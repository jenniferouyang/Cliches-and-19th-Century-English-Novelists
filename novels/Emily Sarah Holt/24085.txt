earl hubert's daughter by emily sarah holt this is one of emily holt's admirable and deeply researched historical novels this time set in the early years of the thirteenth century the main players in the story appear at first sight to be the upper class ladies of the court and their various somewhat confusing relationships but early in the book an old jewish pedlar comes and displays rich wares of a surprising value and variety one of the girls asks if he can get some special embroidery done on a scarf she wants to give as a present abraham sends in his young daughter belasez and conditions are agreed such that she will not be called upon to do or eat anything she should not and all this seems to work very well but the story involving belasez her mother licorice and her brother delecresse gets more and more involved and interesting belasez realises that there has been something in the past that she wants to unearth and gradually the whole strange story is revealed earl hubert's daughter by emily sarah holt preface the thirteenth century was one of rapid and terrible incidents tumultuous politics and in religious matters of low and degrading superstition transubstantiation had just been formally adopted as a dogma of the church accompanied as it always is by sacramental confession and quickly followed by the elevation of the host and the invention of the pix various orders of monks were flocking into england the pope was doing his best aided by the roman clergy and to their shame be it said by some of the english to fix his iron yoke on the neck of the church of england the doctrine of human merit was at its highest pitch the doctrine of justification by faith was absolutely unknown amid this thick darkness a very small number of true hearted heaven taught men bore aloft the torch of truth that is of so much truth as they knew one of such men as these i have sketched in father bruno and if possibly the portrait is slightly over charged for the date if he be represented as a shade more enlightened than at that time he could well be i trust that the anachronism will be pardoned for the sake of those eternal verities which would otherwise have been left wanting there is one fact in ecclesiastical history which should never be forgotten and this is that in all ages within the visible corporate body which men call the church god has had a church of his own true living and faithful he has ever reserved to himself that typical seven thousand in israel of whom all the knees have not bowed unto baal and every mouth hath not kissed him such men as these have been termed protestants before the reformation the only reason why they were not protestants was because there was as yet no protestantism the heavenly call to come out of her had not yet been heard these men were to be found in all stations and callings on the throne as in alfred the great saint louis and henry the sixth in the hierarchy as in anselm bradwardine and grosteste in the cloister as in bernard de morlaix but perhaps most frequently in that rank and file of whom the world never hears and of some of whom however low their place in it the world is not worthy these men often made terrible blunders as saint louis did when he persecuted the jews under the delusion that he was thus doing honour to the lord whom they had rejected and bernard de morlaix when he led a crusade against the albigenses of whom he had heard only slanderous reports do we make no blunders that we should be in haste to judge them how much more has been given to us than to them how much more then will be required chapter one father and mother he was a true man this who lived for england and he knew how to die sweet there are many sweet things clover's sweet and so is liquorice though 'tis hard to chew and sweetbriar till it scratches look margaret thine aunt dame marjory is come to spend thy birthday with thee and see my new bower boudoir o aunt marjory i am so glad the new bower was a very pretty room for the thirteenth century but its girl owner was the prettiest thing in it her age was thirteen that day but she was so tall that she might easily have been supposed two or three years older she had a very fair complexion violet blue eyes and hair exactly the colour of a cedar pencil if physiognomy may be trusted the face indicated a loving and amiable disposition the two ladies who had just entered from the ante room the mother and aunt of margaret were both tall finely developed women with shining fair hair they spoke french evidently as the mother tongue but in that was the custom of all english nobles these ladies had been brought up in england from early maidenhood but they were scottish princesses the eldest and youngest daughters of king william the lion by his norman queen ermengarde de beaumont both sisters were very handsome but the younger bore the palm of beauty in the artist's sense though she was not endowed with the singular charm of manner which characterised her sister chroniclers tell us that the younger princess marjory was a woman of marvellous beauty yet something more attractive than mere beauty must have distinguished the princess margaret for two men of the most opposite dispositions to have borne her image on their hearts till death and for her husband a man capable of abject superstition and with his hot headed youth far behind him to have braved all the thunders of rome rather than put her away these royal sisters had a singular history their father king william had put them for education into the hands of king john of england and his queen isabelle of angouleme when they were little more than infants in other words he had committed his tender doves to the charge of almost the worst man and woman whom he could have selected there were just two vices of which his english majesty was not guilty and those were cowardice and hypocrisy he was a plain unvarnished villain and he never hesitated for a moment to let people see it queen isabelle had been termed the helen of the middle ages alike from her great beauty and from the fact that her husband abducted her when betrothed elsewhere she can hardly be blamed for this since she was a mere child at the time but as she grew up she developed a character quite worthy of the scoundrel to whom she was linked to personal profligacy she added sordid avarice and a positive incapacity for telling the truth to these delightful persons the poor little scottish maidens margaret and isabel were consigned at what age marjory joined them in england is doubtful but it does not appear that she was ever as they were an official ward of the crown the exact terms on which these royal children were sent into england were for many years the subject of sharp contention between their brother alexander and king henry the third the memorandum drawn up between the kings william and john does not appear to be extant but that by which in they were afresh consigned to the care of henry the third is still in existence alexander strenuously maintained that john had undertaken to marry the sisters to his own two sons the agreement with henry the third simply provides that we will also marry this meant at the time cause to be married' margaret and isabel sisters of the said alexander king of scotland during the space of one full year from the feast of saint denis october as shall be to our honour and if we do not marry them within that period we will return them to the said alexander king of scotland safe and free in his own territories within two years from the time specified note this article of the convention was honestly carried out according to the later memorandum so far as concerned margaret who was married to hubert de burgh earl of kent at york on the twenty fifth of june isabel however was not married to roger bigod earl of norfolk until may note still after the latter date the convention having been carried out it might have been supposed that the kings would have given over quarrelling about it the princesses were honourably married in england which was all that henry the third at least had undertaken to do but neither party was satisfied alexander never ceased to reproach henry for not having himself married margaret and united isabel to his brother henry while he testily maintained to alexander that he had done all he promised and no further claim could be established against him yet as history shows never to the last hour pardoned hubert de burgh for his marriage with the scottish princess and most bitterly reproached him for depriving him of her whom he had intended to make his queen the truth seems to be that henry the third who at the time of margaret's marriage was only a lad of thirteen years had cherished for her a fervent boyish passion and that she was the only woman whom he ever really loved hubert at that time regent probably never imagined any thing of the kind while to margaret a stately maiden of some twenty years if not more the sentimental courtship of a schoolboy of thirteen would probably be a source of amusement rather than sympathy but at every turn in his after life henry showed that he had never forgiven this slight put on his affections it is true that his affection was of a somewhat odd type presenting no obstacle to his aspersing the character of his lady love when he found it convenient to point a moral by so doing but of all men who ever lived surely one of the most consistently inconsistent was henry the third in most instances he was constant to one thing his inconstancy like his father he possessed two virtues but they were not the same henry was not a lover of cruelty for its own sake which john was and he was not personally a libertine of his father's virtues bravery and honesty there was not a trace in him he covered his sins with an embroidered cloak of exquisite piety the bad qualities of both parents were inherited by him to his mother's covetous acquisitiveness and ingrained falsehood he joined his father's unscrupulous exactions and wild extravagance i have said that henry was not a lover of cruelty in itself but he could be fearfully and recklessly cruel when he had a point to gain as we shall see too well before the story is ended it may be true that john murdered his nephew arthur with his own hands but it was reserved for henry out of the public sight and away from his own eyes to perpetrate a more cruel murder upon arthur's hapless sister the pearl of bretagne by one of the slowest and most dreadful deaths possible to humanity and without any offence on her part beyond her very existence stow tells us that poor alianora was slowly starved to death and that she died by royal order the issue roll gives evidence since one hundred pounds were delivered to john fitz geoffrey as his fee for the execution of alianora the king's kinswoman note it is not easy to say whether john or henry would have made the more clever vivisector but assuredly while john would have kept his laboratory door open and have sneered at anaesthetics henry would have softly administered curare note and afterwards made a charming speech on the platform concerning the sacrifices of their own feelings which physiologists are sorrowfully compelled to make for the benefit of humanity and the exigencies of science thirteen years after the marriage of margaret of scotland when he was a young man of six and twenty henry the third made a second attempt to win a scottish queen the fair princess marjory had now joined her sisters in england and in point of age she was more suitable than margaret the english nobles however were very indignant that their king should think of espousing a younger sister of the wife of so mere an upstart as hubert de burgh they grumbled bitterly and the count of bretagne brother in law of the murdered arthur and the disinherited alianora took upon himself to dissuade the king from his purpose this count of bretagne is known as pierre mauclerc or bad clerk not a flattering epithet but historians assure us that pierre only too thoroughly deserved the adjective whatever his writing may have done he had four years before refused his own daughter to king henry preferring to marry her to a son of the king of france the count had undertaken no difficult task for an easier could not be than to persuade or dissuade henry the third in respect of any mortal thing he passed his life in acting on the advice in turn of every person who had last spoken to him so he gave up marjory of scotland three years more had elapsed since that time during which marjory very sore at her rejection had withdrawn to the court of king alexander her brother in the spring of she returned to her eldest sister who generally resided either in her husband's town house at whitehall it was probably near scotland yard or at the castle of bury saint edmund's she was just then at the latter earl hubert himself was but rarely at home in either place being constantly occupied elsewhere by official duties and not unfrequently through some adverse turn of king henry's capricious favour detained somewhere in prison and how long hast thou nestled in this sweet new bower my bird said marjory caressingly to her niece to day aunt marjory it is a birthday present from my lord and father is it not pretty only look at the walls and the windows and my beautiful velvet settle now did you ever see any thing so charming marjory glanced at her sister and they exchanged smiles well i cannot quite say no to that question magot note but lead me round this wonderful chamber and show me all its beauties the wonderful chamber in question was not very spacious being about sixteen feet in length by twelve in width it had a wide fireplace at one end there was no fire for the spring was just passing into summer and two arched windows on one of its longer sides the fireplace was filled with a grotto like erection of fir cones moss and rosemary the windows as margaret triumphantly pointed out were of that rare and precious material glass three doors led into other rooms one opposite the fireplace gave access to a small private oratory two others opposite the windows communicated respectively with the wardrobe and the ante chamber these four rooms together with the narrow spiral staircase which led to them occupied the whole floor of one of the square towers of the castle the walls of the bower were painted green relieved by golden stars and on every wall space between the doors and windows was a painted history namely a medallion of some biblical historical or legendary subject the subjects in this room had evidently been chosen with reference to the tastes of a girl they were the virgin and child the legend of saint margaret the wheel of fortune saint agnes with her lamb a fountain with doves perched upon the edge and saint martin dividing his cloak with the beggar the window shutters were of fir wood bound with iron meagre indeed we should think the furniture but it was sumptuous for the date a tent bed hung with green curtains stood between the two doors a green velvet settle stretched across the window side of the room by the fireplace was a leaf table round the walls were wooden brackets with iron sockets for the reception of torches and at the foot of the bed which stood with its side to the wall was a fine chest of carved ebony there were only three pieces of movable furniture two footstools and a curule chair also of ebony with a green velvet cushion as nobody could sit in the last who had not had a king and queen for his or her parents it may be supposed that more than one was not likely to be often wanted the countess of kent as the elder sister took the curule chair while her sister marjory when the inspection was finished sat down on the velvet settle margaret drew a footstool to her aunt's side and took up her position there resting her head caressingly on marjory's knee three whole years aunt marjory that you have not been near us what could make you stay away so long there were reasons magot the two princesses exchanged smiles again but there was some amusement in that of the countess while the expression of her sister was rather sad margaret looked from one to the other as if she would have liked to understand what they meant don't trouble that little head said her mother with a laugh thy time will come soon enough thou art too short to be told state secrets i shall be as tall as you some day lady responded margaret archly and then said marjory stroking the girl's hair thou wilt wish thyself back again little magot nay under your good leave fair aunt never ah we know better don't we madge asked the countess laughing well i will leave you two maidens together there is the month's wash to be seen to and if i am not there that alditha is as likely to put the linen in the chests without a sprig of rosemary as she is to look in the mirror every time she passes it we shall meet at supper adieu and the countess departed on housekeeping thoughts intent for a few minutes the two girls for the aunt was only about twelve years the senior sat silent margaret having drawn her aunt's hand down and rested her cheek upon it they were very fond of one another and being so near in age they had been brought up so much like sisters that except in one or two items they treated each other as such and did not assume the respective authority and reverence usual between such relations at that time beyond the employment of the deferential you by margaret and the familiar thou by marjory they chatted to each other as any other girls might have done but just then for a few minutes neither spoke well magot said marjory breaking the silence at last have we nought to say to each other thou art forgetting i think that i want a full account of all these three years since i came to see thee before they have not been empty of events i know margaret's answer was a groan empty she said fair aunt i would they had been rather than full of such events as they were father nicholas saith that the old romans or greeks i don't know which used to say the man was happy who had no history i am sure we should have been happier lately if we had not had any don't know which' what a heedless magot why fair aunt surely you don't expect people to recollect lessons did you ever remember yours marjory laughed sufficiently so i hope to know the difference between greeks and romans but however for the last three years tell me all about them am i to begin with the flood like a professional chronicler well no i think the conquest would be soon enough delicious aunt marjory how many weary centuries you excuse me how many magot oh please don't how can i possibly tell if you really want to know i will send for father nicholas marjory laughed and kissed the lively face turned up to her idle magot well go on i don't think i am idle fair aunt but i do detest learning dates well now was it in april you left us i know it was very soon after my lady of cornwall was married but i do not remember exactly what month it was in may said marjory shortly may was it oh i know it was the eve of saint helen's day well things went on right enough till my lord of canterbury took it into his head that my lord and father had no business to detain tunbridge castle it all began with that it was about july i think i thought tunbridge castle belonged to my lord of gloucester what had either to do with it o aunt marjory have you forgotten that my young lord of gloucester is in ward to my lord and father the lord king gave him first to my lord the bishop of winchester when his father died and then about a year after he took him away from the bishop and gave him to my fair father don't you remember him such a pretty boy i think you knew all about it at the time very likely i did magot one forgets things sometimes and margaret looking up into the fair face saw and did not understand the hidden pain behind the smile so my lord of canterbury complained of my fair father to the lord king i wonder he could not attend to his own business but the lord king said that as my lord of gloucester held in chief of the crown all vacant trusts were his to give as it pleased him and then aunt marjory do you like priests magot what a question but do you all priests are not alike my dear child they are like other people some good and some bad but surely all priests ought to be good art thou always what thou oughtest to be magot margaret's answer was a sudden spring from the stool and a fervent hug of marjory aunt marjory she said when she had sat down again i just hate that bishop of winchester peter de rievaulx always one of the two chief enemies of margaret's father shocking magot oh yes of course it is extremely wicked but i do i wish he were here to set thee a penance for such a naughty speech however go on with thy story well what do you think fair aunt that my lord's grace of canterbury richard grant consecrated in did he actually excommunicated all intruders on the lands of his jurisdiction and all who should hold communication with them the king only excepted and away he went to rome to lay the matter before the holy father of course he would tell his tale from his own point of view the archbishop went to rome indeed he did aunt marjory my fair father was very indignant that the head of the english church could not stand by himself but must seek the approbation of a foreign bishop' that was what he said and i think my fair mother agreed with him perhaps in this nineteenth century we scarcely realise the gallant fight made by the church of england to retain her independence of rome it did not begin at the reformation as people are apt to suppose it was as old as the church herself and she was as old as the apostles some of her clergy were perpetually trying to force and to rivet the chains of rome upon her but the body of the laity who are really the church resisted this attempt almost to the death there was a perpetual struggle greater or smaller according to circumstances between the king of england and the papacy pope after pope endeavoured to fill english sees and benefices with italian priests king after king braved his wrath by refusing to confirm his appointments apostle they were ready to allow the pope to be sovereign or legislator never doctrine they would accept at his hands but he should not rule over their secular or ecclesiastical liberties the quarrel between henry the second and becket was entirely on this point no wonder that rome canonised the man who thus exalted her the kings who stood out most firmly for the liberties of england were henry the second john edward the first and second and richard the second this partly explains the reason why history of which monks were mainly the authors has so little good to say of any of them edward the first only excepted it is not easy to say why the exception was made unless it were because he was too firmly rooted in popular admiration and perhaps a little too munificent to the monastic orders for much evil to be discreetly said of him coeur de lion was a gallio who cared for none of those things henry the third played into the hands of the pope to day and of the anglican church to morrow edward the third held the balance as nearly even as possible the struggle revived faintly during the reign of henry the sixth but the wars of the roses turned men's minds to home affairs and henry the seventh was the obedient servant of his holiness so the battle went on till it culminated in the reformation those who have never entered into this question and who assume that all englishmen were papists until have no idea how gallantly the church fought for her independent life and how often she flung from off her the iron grasp of the oppressor it was not probable that a princess whose fathers had followed the rule of columba and lay buried in protestant iona should have any roman tendencies on this question marjory was as warm as any one could have wished her well then margaret went on that horrid bishop of winchester oh fie said her aunt came back to england in august aunt marjory it is no use he is horrid and i hate him he hates my fair father do you expect me to love him well done magot said another voice when i want a lawyer to plead my cause i will send for thee christ save you fair sister i heard you were here with this piece of enthusiasm both the girls rose to greet the earl margaret courtesying low as beseemed a daughter it was very evident that so far as outside appearance went margaret was only the child of her mother earl hubert was scarcely so tall as his wife and he had a bronzed swarthy complexion with dark hair though short he was strongly built and well proportioned his eyes were dark small but quick and exceedingly bright he had when needful a ready eloquent tongue and a very pleasant smile yet eloquent as undoubtedly he could be he was not usually a man of many words and capable as he was of very deep and lasting affection he was not demonstrative the soft caressing manners of the princess margaret were not in her husband's line at all he was given to calling a spade a spade whenever he had occasion to mention the article and if she preferred to allude to it as an agricultural implement for the trituration of the soil he was disposed to laugh good humouredly at the epithet though he dearly loved the silver voice which used it a thoroughly representative man of his time was hubert de burgh earl of kent and he was one of those persons who leave a deep mark upon their age he was a purely self made man he had no pedigree indeed we do not know with absolute certainty who was his father though modern genealogists have amused themselves by making a pedigree for him to which there is no real evidence that he had the least claim yet of his wives for he was four times married the first was an heiress the second a baron's widow the third a countess in her own right and a divorced queen and the last a princess his public life had begun by his conducting a negotiation to the satisfaction of coeur de lion in the first year of his reign when in all probability hubert was little over twenty years of age from that moment he rose rapidly merely to enumerate all the titles he bore would almost take a page he was by turns a very rich man and a very poor one according as his royal and capricious master made or revoked his grants the religious character of hubert is not a matter of speculation but of certainty it was what his contemporaries considered elevated piety a most singular mixture of the barest and basest superstition with some very strong plain common sense the superstition was of the style set forth in the famous spanish drama entitled the devotion of the cross the true roman type of piety though to protestant minds of the nineteenth century it seems almost inconceivable the hero of this play who is represented as tinctured with nearly every crime which humanity can commit has a miracle performed in his favour and goes comfortably to heaven after it on account of his devotion to the cross the innocent reader must not suspect the least connection between this devotion and the atonement wrought upon the cross it simply means that whenever eusebio sees the shape of a cross in the hilt of his sword the pattern of a woman's dress two sticks thrown upon one another he stops in the midst of whatever sin he may be committing and in some form by word or gesture expresses his devotion of this type was hubert's religion his notion of spirituality was to grasp the pix with one hand and to hold the crucifix in the other he kept a nicely balanced account at the bank of heaven in which this is historical the heaviest deposit was the fact that he had many years before saved a large crucifix from the flames the idea that this action was not most pious and meritorious would have been in hubert's eyes rank heresy yet he might have known better the psalter lay open to him which had he been acquainted with no other syllable of revelation should alone have given him a very different conception of spiritual religion athwart these singular notions of excellence hubert's good common sense was perpetually gleaming like the lightning across a dark moor whatever else this man was he was no slave of rome it was supported by him and probably at his instigation that king john had sent his lofty message to the pope that no italian priest should tithe or toll in his dominions it was when the administration lay in his hands that parliament refused to comply with the demands of the pope till it was seen what other kingdoms would do and no papal aggressions were successful in england so long as hubert was in power to reverse the famous phrase of lord denbigh hubert was a catholic if you please but an englishman first truer englishman at once loyalist and patriot never man was than he well described by one of the english people as that most faithful and noble hubert who so often saved england from the ravages of the foreigner and restored england to herself he stood by the throne bearing aloft the banner of england in three especially dark and perilous days when no man stood there but himself to him alone under providence we owe it that england did not become a vassal province of france most amply was his fidelity put to the test most unspotted it emerged from the ordeal most heavy was the debt of gratitude owed alike by england and her king that debt was paid in a sense to the uttermost farthing in what manner of coin it was discharged we are about to see note patent roll henry third dated york june note in the octave of holy trinity may june at alnwick roberts' extracts from fines rolls note this terrible fact has been strangely ignored by many modern historians rot exit michs henry third note a drug which deadens the sensibilities of the vivisector by rendering the victim incapable of sound or motion but not affecting the nerves of sensation in the least note this was in when our story begins the english diminutive of margaret and was doubtless derived from the french margot note any reader who is inclined to doubt this is requested to consult acts fifteen it is unquestionably the teaching of the new testament the clergy form part of the church merely as individual christians chapter two what do you lack if pestilence stalk through the land ye say this is god's doing is it not also his doing when an aphis creepeth on a rosebud martin f tupper earl hubert was far too busy a man to waste his time in lounging on velvet settles and exchanging sallies of wit with the ladies of his household he had done little more than give a cordial welcome to marjory and pat margaret on the head when he again disappeared to be seen no more until supper time well magot said marjory sitting down in the chair while margaret as before accommodated herself with a footstool at her feet let us get on with thy story i want to know all about that affair two years ago thy fair father looks wonderfully well methinks considering all that he has gone through does he not o aunt marjory i scarcely know how i am to tell you about that it was dreadful dreadful and the tears stood in big drops on margaret's eyelashes well i will try she said with a deep sigh as marjory stroked her hair in the first place the year ended all very well my fair father had been created justiciary of ireland for life and constable of the tower and various favours had been granted to him that he should be on the brink of trouble and such trouble was the very last thing thought of by any one of us and then that bishop of winchester came back and before a soul knew anything about it he was high in the lord king's favour and on the twenty ninth of july i am not likely to forget that date the blow fell he was dismissed then was he not from all his offices without a word of warning dismissed and degraded without a shadow of it and a string of the most cruel wicked accusations brought against him things that he never did nor dreamed of doing aunt marjory it makes my blood boil only to remember them i am not going to tell you all there was one too horrid to mention i know my maiden marjory interposed rather hastily she had heard already of king henry's delicate and affectionate assault upon the fair name of margaret's mother and she did not wish for a repetition of it but beyond that of what do you think he was accused i have not heard the other articles magot then i will tell you first of preventing the lord king's marriage with the duke of austria's daughter by telling the duke that the king was lame and blind and deaf and a leper and gently magot gently said marjory laughing i am not making a syllable of it fair aunt and that he was a wicked treacherous man not worthy of the love or alliance of any noble lady pure foy but i know what i should say if i said just what i think it is sometimes quite as well not to do that magot ha perhaps it is when one may get into prison by it it is a comfort one can always think neither pope nor king can stop that magot my dear child oh yes i know you think i am horribly imprudent aunt marjory but nobody hears me except you and eva de braose she is the only person in the wardrobe and there is no one in the ante chamber and as i have heard her say more than i did just now i don't suppose there is much harm done then secondly they charged my fair father with stealing only think stealing a magical gem from the royal treasury which made the wearer victorious in battle and sending it to the prince of wales llywelyn the great with whom king henry was at war why should they suppose he would do that pure foy aunt marjory don't ask me then thirdly they said it was margaret sprang from her footstool suddenly and disappeared for a second through the door of the wardrobe marjory heard her say eva i had completely forgotten till this minute to tell marie that my lady and mother desired her to finish that piece of tapestry to night if she can do go and look for her and let her know or she will not have time a slight rustle as of some one leaving the room was audible and then margaret dashed back to her footstool as if she too had not a minute to lose you know aunt marjory i could not tell you the next thing with eva listening they said that it was by traitorous letters from my fair father that the prince of wales had caused sir william de braose to be hung eva's father thou meanest yes then they accused him of administering poison to my lord of salisbury of sending my cousin sir raymond to try and force the lady of salisbury into marrying him while her lord was beyond seas of poisoning my lord of pembroke sir fulk de breaut and my sometime lord of canterbury's grace he might have spent his life in poisoning every body then lastly they said he had obtained favour of the lord king by help of the black art marjory smiled contemptuously it was not because she was more free from superstition than other people but simply because she knew full well that the only sorcery necessary to be used towards henry the third was the sorcery of a strong mind over a weak one note it was rather unfortunate she said that my good lord of salisbury whom god rest was seized with his last illness the very day after he had supped at my fair brother's table aunt marjory cried her indignant niece why it is not a month since i was taken ill in the night after i had supped likewise do you suppose he poisoned me it is quite possible that walnuts might have something to do with it magot but did i say he poisoned any one now aunt marjory you are laughing at me because you know i like them but don't you think it is absurd the way in which people insist on fancying themselves poisoned whenever they are ill it looks as if every human being were a monster of wickedness what would father warner say they are magot oh he would say it was perfectly true and he would be right so far as my lord of winchester and a few more are concerned well eva hast thou found marie yes my dear she is with the lady and she is busy with the tapestry oh that is right i am sorry i forgot and the lady bade me tell thee mignonne that she is coming to thy bower shortly with a pedlar who is waiting in the court to choose stuffs for thy whitsuntide robes a pedlar delightful aunt marjory i am sure you want something marjory laughed i want thy tale finished magot before the pedlar comes too long my dear aunt marjory unless the pedlar takes all summer to mount the stairs but you know my lord and father fled into sanctuary at merton abbey and refused to leave it unless the lord king would pledge his royal word for his safety i don't think i should have thought it made much difference i wonder if that pedlar has any silversmiths' work the lord king did not pledge his word but he ordered the lord mayor and the citizens to fetch my fair father only think of that aunt marjory dead or alive some of the nobler citizens appealed to the bishop who was everything with the king just then but instead of interceding for my fair father as they asked he merely confirmed the order so twenty thousand citizens marched on the abbey and when my fair father knew that he fled to the high altar and embraced the holy cross with one hand holding the blessed pix in the other was our lord in the pix inquired marjory meaning of course to refer to the consecrated wafer i am not sure fair aunt but however things turned out better than seemed likely for not only the bishop of chichester but even my lord of chester my fair father's great enemy interceded with the lord king in his behalf we heard that my lord of chester spoke very plainly to him and told him not only that he would find it easier to draw a crowd together than to get rid of it again but also that his fickleness would scandalise the world and the lord king allowed him to say that yes and it had a great effect upon him i think people who are fickle don't like others to see it don't you do you think that pedlar will have any sendal a silk stuff of extremely fine quality of india thine eyes and half thy tongue are in the pedlar's pack magot i cannot tell thee but just let me know how it ended and thy fair father was set free oh it did not end for ever so long my lord's grace of dublin got leave for him to come home and see my fair mother and me and after that when he had gone into essex the king sent after him again and sir godfrey de craucumbe took him away to the tower they sent for a smith to put him in fetters but the man would not do it when he heard who was to wear the fetters he said he would rather die than be the man to put chains on that most faithful and noble hubert who so often saved england from the ravages of foreigners and restored england to herself' aunt marjory i think he was a grand fellow i would have kissed him if i had been there as the kiss was at that time the common form of greeting between men and women for a lady to offer a kiss to a man as a token that she approved his words or actions was not then considered more demonstrative than it would be to shake hands now it was in fact not an unusual occurrence and my fair father told us pursued margaret when he heard what the smith said he could not help thinking of those words of our lord when he thanked god that his mission had been hidden from the wise but revealed to the ignorant for' our lord said to thee my god do i commit my cause for mine enemies have risen against me' note and they took him to the tower of london yes but the bishop of london was very angry at the violation of sanctuary and insisted that my fair father should be sent back he threatened the king with excommunication and of course that frightened him he sent him back to the church whence he was taken but commanded the sheriff of essex to surround the church so that he should neither escape nor obtain food but my fair father's true friend my good old lord of dublin you were right aunt marjory all priests are not alike interposed and begged the lord king to do to him what he had thought to do to my lord and father the lord king then offered the choice of three things my lord and father must either abjure the kingdom for ever or he must be perpetually imprisoned or he must openly confess himself a traitor a fair choice surely horrid wasn't it he chose banishment did he not he said if the king willed it he was content to go out of england for a time not for ever but a traitor he would never confess himself for he had never been one the words of a true man said marjory splendid and then eva is that pedlar never coming up the lord king found out that my fair father had laid up treasure in the temple and he actually accused him of taking it fraudulently from the royal treasury and summoned him to resign it my fair father replied i shouldn't have done that he and all he had were at the king's pleasure and sent an order to the master of the temple accordingly then o aunt marjory it is too long a tale to tell and i want that pedlar but i do think it was a shame after all that for the lord king to profess to compassionate my lord and father and to say that he had been faithful to our lord king john of happy memory note and also to our lord king richard whom god pardon therefore notwithstanding the ill usage of himself and the harm he had done the kingdom he would rather pardon my fair father than execute him for' he said i would rather be accounted a remiss king than a man of blood' well that does not sound bad magot oh no words are very nice things aunt marjory and our lord king henry can string them very prettily together i have no patience i say eva do go and peep into the court and see what is becoming of that snail of a pedlar he is in the hall eating and drinking margaret well i am sure he has had as much as is good for him so then aunt marjory my fair father was sent to devizes and many nobles became sureties for him my lord of cornwall the king's brother among others and while he was there he heard of the death of his great enemy my lord of chester then he said the lord be merciful to him he was my man by his own doing and yet he never did me good where he could work me harm' and he set himself before the holy cross and sang over the whole psalter for my lord of chester well after that i cannot go into all the ups and downs of the matter but after a while by the help of some of the garrison my fair father contrived to escape from devizes and joined the prince of wales that was last november and he stayed in wales until the king's journey to gloucester last march the lord king came here to the abbey and he granted several manors to my fair mother and she took the opportunity to plead for my lord and father so when the lord king went to gloucester he was met by my lord's grace of canterbury who had been to treat with the prince of wales and by his advice all those who had been outlawed and had sought refuge in wales were to be pardoned and received to favour one of them of course was my fair father so they met the lord king at gloucester and he took them to his mercy my lord and father said the lord king looked calmly on them and gave them the kiss of peace but my fair father himself was so much struck by the manner in which our lord had repaid him his good deeds that as his varlet adam told us he clasped his hands and looked up to heaven and he said o jesus crucified saviour i once when sleeping saw thee on the cross pierced with bloody wounds and on the following day according to thy warning i spared thy image and worshipped it and now thou hast in thy favour repaid me for so doing in a lucky moment' it did not strike either marjory or margaret as perhaps it may the reader that this speech presented a very curious medley of devotion thankfulness barefaced idolatry and belief in dreams and lucky moments to their minds the mixture was perfectly natural so much so that marjory's response was doubtless it was so magot it is always very unlucky to neglect a dream at this juncture eva de braose presented herself she was one of three maidens who were alike as was then customary wards of the earl and waiting maids of the countess they were all young ladies of high birth and good fortune orphan heirs or co heirs whose usual lot it was throughout the middle ages to be given in wardship to some nobleman and educated with his daughters eva de braose marie de lusignan and doucebelle de vaux eva and marie but not doucebelle are historical persons were therefore the social equals and constant companions of margaret eva was a rather pretty fair haired girl about two years older than our heroine the pedlar is coming now margaret ha jolife cried margaret note is my lady and mother coming yes and both hawise and marie hawise de lanvalay was the young wife of margaret's eldest brother earl hubert's family consisted beside his daughter of two sons of his first marriage john and hubert who were respectively about eighteen and fifteen years older than their sister the countess entered in a moment bringing with her the young lady hawise a quiet looking dark eyed girl of some eighteen years and marie the little countess of eu who was only a child of eleven after them came levina one of the countess's dressers and two sturdy varlets carrying the pedlar's heavy pack between them the pedlar himself followed in the rear he was a very respectable looking old man with strongly marked aquiline features and long white beard and he brought with him a lithe olive complexioned youth of about eighteen years of age the varlets set down the pack on the floor and departed the old man unstrapped it and opening it out with the youth's help proceeded to display his goods very rich costly and beautiful they were the finest lawn of cambray whence comes cambric and the purest sheeting of rennes formed a background on which were exhibited rich diapered stuffs from damascus crape of all colours from cyprus golden baudekyns from constantinople fine sendal from india with satins velvets silks taffetas linen and woollen stuffs in bewildering profusion over these again were laid rich furs sable ermine miniver black fox squirrel marten and lamb and trimmings of gold and silver gimp and beads delicate embroidery and heavy tinsel here lady is a lovely thing in changeable sendal said the old man hunting for it among his silks it would be charming for the fair haired damsel lift off that fox fur cress blue and gold or here a striped tartaryn which would suit the dark young lady orange and green then cress give me the silver frieze this lady would be well for the little maid for somewhat cooler weather and will my lady see the cyprus hand the pink one cress this would make up enchantingly for the damsel that was in my lady's chamber where is doucebelle asked the countess looking round i thought she had come marie run and fetch her hast thou any broidery work of the east country good man one or two small things lady cress give me thy sister's scarves the young man unfolded a woollen wrapper and then a lawn one inside it and handed to his father three silken scarves of superlatively fine texture and covered with most exquisite embroidery even the countess accustomed as her eyes were to beautiful things was not able to suppress an admiring ejaculation this is lovely she said those are samples remarked the pedlar with a gleam of pleasure in his eyes i have more of various patterns if my lady would wish to see them she has only to speak her commands yes but these are all imported i suppose all imported such as i have shown to my lady i presume no broideress is to be found in england who can do such work as this said the countess in a regretful tone did my lady wish to find one i wished to have a scarf in my possession copied with a few variations which i would order but i fear it cannot be done it would be almost necessary that i should see the broideress myself to avoid mistakes and i would fain if it were possible have had the work done under my own eye that might be done perhaps it would be costly oh i should not care for the cost i want the scarf for a gift and it is nothing to me whether i pay ten silver pennies or a hundred would my lady suffer her servant to see the scarf she wishes to have imitated fetch it levina said the countess thou knowest which i mean levina brought it and the pedlar gave it very careful inspection and the alterations he asked i would have a row of silver harebells and green ferns touched with gold as an outer border explained the countess and instead of those ornaments in the inner part i would have golden scrolls worked with the words dieu et mon droit' in scarlet the pedlar shook his head the golden scrolls with the words can be done without difficulty but i must in all humility represent to my lady that the flowers and leaves she desires cannot why asked the countess in a surprised tone not in this work answered the pedlar in this style of embroidery and he took another scarf from his pack it could be wrought but not in the other but that is not to be compared with the other my lady has well said returned the pedlar with a smile but i do not understand where the difficulty lies said the countess evidently disappointed let my lady pardon her servant we have in our company nay there is in all england one broideress only who can work in this style and i dare not make such an engagement on her behalf still i cannot understand for what reason lady these flowers leaves heads and such representations of created things are the work of christian hands that broidery which my lady desires is not so but why cannot christians work this broidery ha they do not my lady's servant cannot speak further then what is she who alone can do this work what eyes and fingers she must have she is my daughter answered the pedlar rather proudly but i am sure the woman who can broider like this is clever enough to make a row of harebells and ferns clever enough oh yes but she could not do it clever enough' but could not do it' old man i cannot understand thee lady she would account it sin to imitate created things the countess looked up with undisguised amazement why because the holy one has forbidden us to make to ourselves any likeness of that which is in heaven above or in the earth beneath but i would pay her any sum she asked if my lady can buy christian consciences with gold not so a daughter of israel the old man spoke proudly now and his head was uplifted in a very different style from his previous subservient manner his son's lip was curled and his black eyes were flashing fire well i do not understand it answered the countess looking as much annoyed as the sweet princess margaret knew how to look i should have thought thy daughter might have put her fancies aside for what harm can there be in broidering flowers however if she will not she will not she must work me a border of some other pattern for i want the scarf wider that she can do as my lady may command the old jew was once more the obsequious tradesman laying himself out to please a profitable customer what will be the cost if the scarf be three ells in length and let me see about half an ell broad it could not be done under fifteen gold pennies my lady that is costly well never mind if people want to make rich gifts they must pay for them but could i have it by whitsuntide that is a few days earlier so as to make the gift then the pedlar reflected for a moment let my lady pardon her servant if he cannot give that answer at this moment if my daughter have no work promised so that she can give her time entirely to this it can be done without fail but it is some days since my lady's servant saw her and she may have made some engagement since i am the better pleased thou art not too ready to promise said the countess smiling but what about the work being done under my eye i will lodge thy daughter and feed her and give her a gold penny extra for it the old jew looked very grave let my lady not be angered with the lowest of her servants but we are of another religion art thou afraid of my converting her asked the countess in an amused tone under my lady's pardon no said the old man proudly i can trust my daughter and if my noble lady will make three promises on whatsoever she holds most holy the girl shall come she should be worth having when she is so hard to get at responded the countess laughing as she took from her bosom a beautiful little silver crucifix suspended by a chain of the same material from her neck now then old man what am i to swear first that my daughter shall not be required to work in any manner on the holy sabbath namely as my lady will understand it from sunset on friday until the same hour on saturday that i expected i know jews are very precise about their sabbaths very well so that the scarf be finished by wednesday before whitsuntide that i swear secondly by my lady's leave that she shall not be compelled to eat any thing contrary to our law i have no desire to compel her but what will she eat i must know that i can give her something any kind of vegetables bread milk and eggs lenten fare very well i swear it lastly that my lady will appoint her a place in her own apartments or in those of the damsel her daughter and that she may never stir out of that tower while she remains in the castle poor young prisoner good if thou art so anxious to consign thy child to hard durance i will swear to keep her in it may my lady's servant ask where she will be the countess laughed merrily this priceless treasure of thine she might be a king's daughter i will put her in my daughter's ante chamber just behind thee the pedlar walked into the ante chamber and inspected it carefully to the great amusement of the ladies it is enough he said returning lady my child is not a king's daughter but she is the dearest treasure of her old father's heart the old man had well spoken for his words jew as he was a creature according to the views of that day born to be despised and ill treated went straight to the tender heart of the princess margaret 'tis but nature she said softly have no fear old man i will take care of thy treasure what is her name will my lady suffer her grateful servant to kiss her robe i am abraham of norwich and my daughter's name is belasez singular indeed were the jewish names common at this time beyond a very few biblical ones of which the chief were abraham aaron and moses the last usually corrupted to moss or mossy they were for men delecresse dieu le croisse ursel leo hamon kokorell emendant and bonamy for women belasez belle assez floria licorice these three were the most frequent esterote cuntessa belia anegay rosia genta and pucella they used no surnames beyond the name of the town in which they lived and what years has she asked the countess seventeen if it please my lady good i hope she will be clever and tractable now madge what do you want the princess marjory wanted a silver necklace a piece of green silk for a state robe and some unshorn wool for an every day dress beside lamb's fur and buttons for trimming buttons were fashionable ornaments in those days and it was not unusual to spend six or eight dozen upon one dress now magot let me see for thee said her mother thy two woollen gowns must be shorn for winter and thou wilt want a velvet one for gala days but there is time for that by and bye what thou needest now is a blue cyprus crape robe for thy best summer one two garments of coloured thread for common a silk hood one or two lawn wimples note and a pair of corsets note thou mayest have a new armilaus note if thou wilt and may i not have a new mantle was margaret's answer in a coaxing tone a new mantle thou unconscionable magot somebody will be ruined before thy wants are supplied and a red velvet gipciere lady and i did so want a veil of sendal of inde worse and worse come old man prithee measure off the cyprus and look out the wimples quickly or this damsel of mine will leave me never a farthing in my pocket and eva wants a new gown suggested margaret oh yes said the countess laughing and so does marie and so does doucebelle i suppose and hawise i have no doubt i shall be completely ruined among you but my lady will give me the sendal of inde i will try to do without the gipciere a gipciere was a velvet bag dependent from the waist which served as a purse or pocket as occasion required magot hast thou no conscience come then old man let this unreasonable damsel see thy gipcieres and if she must have some sendal of inde well fate is inevitable what was the other thing magot a new mantle oh shocking i can't afford that what is the price of thy black cloth old man it was easy to see that margaret would have all she chose to ask without much pressure some linen dresses were also purchased for the young wards of the earl a blue fillet for eva and a new barm cloth apron for marie and the countess having chosen some sendal and lawn for her own use the purchases were at last completed the old jew helped by delecresse repacked his wares with such care as their delicacy and costliness required and the countess desired levina to summon the varlets to bear the heavy burden down to the gate peace wait on my lady said the pedlar bowing low as he took leave if it please the holy one my belasez shall be here at my lady's command before a week is over note this was the answer given to her judges four hundred years later by leonora galigai when she was asked to confess what kind of magic she had employed to obtain the favour of queen maria de' medici note the earl's quotation from scripture was extremely free combining matthew eleven verse with the substance but not the exact words of several passages in the psalms nor did friar matthew paris know much better since he refers to it all as that passage in the gospels note king henry was given to allusions of this class to the revered memory of his excellent father note oh delightful the modern schoolboy's how jolly is really a corruption of this the companion regret was ha chetife oh miserable note the wimple covered the neck and was worn chiefly out of doors ladies from a queen to a countess wore it coming over the chin women of less rank beneath note tight lacing dates from about the twelfth century note a short cloak worn by both sexes ornamented with buttons chapter three belasez and born of thee she may not always take earth's accents for the oracles of god felicia hemans the last word had scarcely left the pedlar's lips when the door of the ante chamber was flung open and a boy of margaret's age burst into the room he was fair haired and bright faced with a slender elegant figure and all his motions were very agile beginning with i say magot he stopped suddenly both tongue and feet as he caught sight of the countess well sir richard suggested that lady i cry you mercy lady i did not know you were here and if you had done what then why then answered richard laughing but colouring i suppose i ought to have come in more quietly ah did you ever read with father nicholas about an old man who said that the athenians knew what was right but the lacedemonians did it your pardon lady i always forget what i read with father nicholas i should suppose so i am afraid there is athenian blood in your veins sir richard lady if it stand with your pleasure there is none but true christian blood in my veins was the proud reply pure foy if you are so proud of your blood i fear you will disdain to do what i was about to bid you i shall never disdain to execute the commands of a fair lady my word sir richard but you are growing a courtly knight you see that jew boy has left his cap behind as there are none here but damsels i was thinking i would ask you to call him back to fetch it he shall have it a jew boy i'll take the tongs then the next minute delecresse who was just turning back to fetch the forgotten cap heard a boyish voice calling to him out of a window and looking up saw his cap held out in the tongs here thou cur of a jew what dost thou mean to leave thy heathen stuff in the chamber of a noble damsel and the cap was dropped into the courtyard with such good aim that it first hit delecresse on the head and then lodged itself in the midst of a puddle delecresse without uttering a word yet flushing red even through his dark complexion deliberately stooped recovered his wet cap and placed it on his head pressing it firmly down as if he wished to impart the moisture to his hair then he turned and looked fixedly at richard who was watching him with an amused face that wasn't a bad shot was it cried the younger lad thank you was the answer of delecresse i shall know you again the affront was a boyish freak perpetrated rather in thoughtlessness than malice but the tone of the answer however simple the words manifestly breathed revenge richard de clare was not an ill natured boy but he had been taught from his babyhood that a jew was the scum of the earth and that to speak contumeliously to such was so far from being wrong that it absolutely savoured of piety jews had crucified christ to have aided one of them or to have been over civil to him would in a christian have been considered as putting a slight upon his lord there was therefore some excuse for richard educated as he had been in this belief delecresse on the contrary had been as carefully brought up in the opposite conviction to him it was the gentile who was the refuse of humanity and it was a perpetual humiliation to be forced to cringe to and wait upon such contemptible creatures moreover the day was coming when their positions should be reversed and who could say how near it was at hand then the proud christian noble would be the slave of the despised jew pedlar and thought delecresse grinding his teeth he at least would take care that the christian slave should indulge no mistakes on that point to both the youths satan was whispering and by both he was obeyed and each of them was positively convinced that he was serving god the vengeful words of delecresse made no impression whatever on the young earl of gloucester he would have laughed with scorn at the mere idea that such an insect as that could have any power to hurt him he danced back to margaret's bower where in a few minutes he she marie and eva were engaged in a merry round game beside the three girls who were in the care of the countess earl hubert had also three boy wards richard de clare heir of the earldom of gloucester roger de mowbray heir of the barony of mowbray now about fifteen years old and john de averenches or avranches the son of a knight with these six the earl's two sons his daughter and his daughter in law there was no lack of young people in the castle of whom sir john de burgh the eldest was only twenty nine the promise made by abraham of norwich was faithfully kept a week had not quite elapsed when levina announced to the countess that the jew pedlar and the maiden his daughter awaited her pleasure in the court the countess desired her to bring them up immediately to margaret's bower whither she would go herself to meet them margaret and doucebelle had just come in from a walk upon the leads the usual way in which ladies took airings in the thirteenth century indeed the leads were the only safe and proper place for a young girl's out door recreation the courtyard was always filled by the household servants and soldiers of the garrison and the idea of taking a walk outside the precincts of the castle would never have occurred to anybody unless it were to a very ignorant child indeed there were no safe highroads nor quiet lanes in those days where a maiden might wander without fear of molestation old ballads are full of accounts of the perils incurred by rash and self sufficient girls who ventured alone out of doors in their innocent ignorance or imprudent bravado the roadless wastes gave harbour to abundance of fierce small animals and deadly vipers and to men worse than any of them old abraham cap in hand bowed low before the princess and presented a closely veiled graceful figure as the young broideress whom he had promised lay thy veil aside my maid said the countess with most unusual kindness considering that it was a jewess to whom she spoke the maiden obeyed and revealed to the eyes of the princess and her damsels a face and figure of such extreme loveliness that she no longer wondered at the anxiety of her father to provide for her concealment but the beauty of belasez was of an entirely different type from that of the christians around her her complexion was olive her hair raven black her eyes large and dark now melting as if in liquid light now brilliant and full of fire and if margaret looked two years beyond her real age belasez looked more like seven thou knowest wherefore thou art come hither asked the countess smiling complacently on the vision before her to broider for my lady said belasez in a low clear musical voice and wilt thou obey my orders i will obey my lady in every thing not forbidden by the holy law well i think we shall agree my maid returned the countess whose private views respecting religious tolerance were something quite extraordinary for the time at which she lived i would not willingly coerce any person's conscience but as i do not know thy law thou wilt have to tell me if i should desire thee to do some forbidden thing my lady is very good to her handmaiden said belasez margaret take the maid into thy wardrobe for a little while until she has dined and after that i will show her what i require she will be glad of rest after her journey margaret obeyed and a motion of her mother's hand sent doucebelle after her the daughter of the house sat down on the settle which stretched below the window and doucebelle followed her example but belasez remained standing come and sit here by me said margaret to the young jewess i want to talk to thee belasez obeyed in silence art thou very tired with thy journey not now damsel i thank you we have come but a short stage this morning art thou fond of broidery i love everything beautiful and nothing that is not beautiful i did not say that damsel belasez's smile showed a perfect row of snow white teeth am i fair enough to love asked margaret laughingly she had a good deal of her mother's easy tolerance of differences and all her sweet affability to those beneath her ah my damsel true love regards the heart rather than the face methinks i cannot see into my damsel's heart in one minute but i should think it was not at all difficult to love her i want every body to love me said margaret and i love every body if my damsel would permit me to counsel her love every body by all means but do not let her want every body to love her why not because i fear my damsel will meet with disappointment oh i hate to be disappointed hast thou brought thine image with thee to margaret this question sounded most natural in the first place she could not conceive the idea of prayer without something visible to pray to and in the second she had been taught that all jews and saracens were idolaters she was surprised to see the blood rush to belasez's dark cheek and the fire flash from her eyes will my damsel allow me to ask what she means i do not understand wilt thou not want to say thy prayers whilst thou art here responded margaret who was at least as much puzzled as belasez most certainly but not to an image oh do you jews sometimes pray without images does my damsel take us for idolaters yes i was always told so said margaret looking astonished the fire died out of belasez's eyes she saw that margaret had simply made an innocent mistake from sheer ignorance of the question my damsel has been misinformed we israelites hold all images to be wicked and abhorrent to the holy law then thou wilt not want to set up an idol for thyself anywhere most assuredly not i hope i have not vexed thee said margaret ingenuously i did not know my damsel did not vex me as soon as i saw that she did not know and wouldst thou not like better to be a christian than a jew demanded margaret who could not imagine the possibility of any feeling on belasez's part regarding her nationality except those of regret and humiliation but the answer though it came in a single syllable was unmistakable intense pride passionate devotion to her own creed and people the deepest scorn and loathing for all others combined to make up the tone of belasez's no how very odd exclaimed margaret looking at her with an expression of great astonishment upon her own fair open features is it odd to my damsel does she know what her question sounded like to me tell me would she not like better to be a villein scullion maid than to be the daughter of my noble lord of kent' but jews are not noble cried margaret gazing in bewilderment from belasez to doucebelle as if she expected one of them to help her out of the puzzle not in the world's estimate answered belasez there is one above the world before margaret could reply the deep bass ding dong of the great dinner bell rang through the castle and levina made her appearance at the door my lady has given me charge concerning thee belasez she said rather coldly addressing the jewess thou wilt come with me with a graceful reverence to margaret belasez turned and followed levina at that date no titles except those of nobility or office were usual in england any woman below a peer's daughter was addressed by her christian name or by that of her husband that is to say the unmarried woman was simply joan the married one was john's wife belasez was gifted by nature with a large amount of that kind of intuition which has been defined as feeling the pressure of other people's atmosphere it may be a gift which augurs delicacy and refinement but it always brings discomfort to its possessor she knew instinctively and in a moment that levina was likely to be her enemy it was true levina was a prey to that green eyed monster which sports itself with the miseries of humanity she had been the best broideress in the castle until that day and now she felt herself suddenly supplanted by a young thing of barely more than half her age and experience who was called in forsooth to do something which it was imagined that levina could not do what business had the countess to suppose there was any thing she could not do or to want something out of her power to provide was there the slightest likelihood thought levina flaring up that this scrap of a creature could work better than herself a mere chit of a child levina was past thirty with a complexion like the fire bricks levina's resembled putty and hair the colour of nasty sloes levina's was nearer that of a tiger lily and great staring eyes like horn lanterns the countess was the most unreasonable and levina the most cruelly outraged of all the women that had ever held a needle since those useful instruments were originally invented levina did not put her unparalleled wrongs into words it would have been easier for belasez to get on with her if she had done so she held her head up and snorted like an impatient horse as she stalked through the door into the ante chamber this is where thou art to be she snapped in a staccato tone any amount of personal slight and scorn was merely what belasez had been accustomed to receive from christians ever since she had left her cradle the disdain of levina therefore though she could hardly enjoy it made far less impression on her than the unaccountable kindliness of the royal ladies the lady bade me ask what thou wouldst eat demanded levina in the same tone as before i thank thee any thing that has not had life what's that for came in shorter snaps than ever it would not be kosher speak sense what does the vermin mean i mean it would not be killed according to our law suppose it wasn't i what then then i must not eat it stupid silly ridiculous stuff may i be put in a pie if i know what the lady was thinking about when she brought in such road dirt as this and my damsel sets herself above us all forsooth she must have her meat served according to some law that nobody ever heard of least of all the lord king's noble council and she must have a table set for her all by herself as though she were a sick queen pray you my noble countess would you eat in gold or silver and how many varlets shall serve to carry your dainty meat and is your sweet grace served upon the knee or no i would fain have things done as may pleasure my right noble lady belasez answered as she usually disposed of similar affronts by treating them as if they were offered in genuine courtesy but with a faint ring of satire beneath her tone i thank you i should prefer wood or pewter if it please you and i should think one varlet might answer i was never served upon the knee yet and it will scarcely be necessary now levina gave a second and stronger snort and disappeared down the stairs in a few minutes she made her reappearance carrying in one hand a plate of broiled ham and in the other a piece of extremely dry and rather mouldy bread here is my gracious damsel's first course fulk le especer was so good as to tell me that folks of her sort are mighty fond of ham so i took great care to bring her some there'll be sauce with the next that there would be sauce of one species with every course served to her in that house belasez was beginning to feel no doubt yet however levina chose to behave to her the young jewess maintained her own dignity she quietly put aside the plate of ham and cutting off the mouldy pieces ate the dry bread without complaint belasez's kindly and generous nature was determined that the countess who had been so much kinder to her than at that time christians usually were to jews should hear no murmuring word from her unless it came to actual starvation levina's sauce presented itself unmistakably with the second course which proved to be a piece of apple pie swimming in the strongest vinegar though it must have set her teeth on edge belasez consumed the pie in silence avoiding the vinegar so far as she could and entertained while she did so by levina's assurances that it delighted her to see how completely belasez enjoyed it the third article according to levina was cheese but the first mouthful was enough to convince the persecuted jewess that soft soap would have been a more correct epithet she quietly let it alone ha chetife i am sadly in fear that my sweetest damsel does not like our suffolk cheese said levina in a most doleful tone is it manufactured in this county asked belasez very coolly for in all soaps were of foreign importation i thought it tasted more like the french make levina vanished down the stairs but her suppressed laughter was quite audible she came up again with two more plates and informed belasez that they constituted the last course one of them was filled with chicken bones picked exceedingly clean the other with a piece of sweet cake over which had been poured some very hot saline compound which by no means harmonised with the cake but set belasez's throat on fire she managed however to eat it thinking that she would get little food of any kind if she did not and levina departed with the plates remarking that it had done her good to see the excellent meal which belasez had made it was a relief to the girl to be left alone for solitude had no terrors for her and levina was certainly not an enjoyable companion after half an hour's quiet margaret and eva entered the ante chamber hast thou dined belasez asked margaret kindly i thank my damsel yes did levina bring thee such dishes as thou mightest eat according to our law oh yes it was rather a relief to belasez that the question took that form then that is all right said margaret innocently and passed on into her own room the countess's step was heard approaching but just before entering she stopped at the head of the stairs thou hast given the girl her dinner levina oh yes my lady what had she i brought her apple pie if it please my lady and cheese and gateau de dijon and ham and a few other little things but she would not touch the ham and scarcely the cheese thou hast forgotten levina i told thee no meat of any kind nor fish and i believe no jew will touch ham i did not know they objected to cheese but had she enough apple pie and gateau de dijon make but a poor dinner and without questioning levina further the countess went on and addressed belasez direct my maid hast thou fared well i fear levina did not bring thee proper things belasez hesitated she was very unwilling to say no and how could she in conscience say yes they were according to our law i thank my lady all but the ham that under her gracious leave i must decline but thou didst not take the cheese no with my lady's leave was it not in accordance with thy law or didst thou not like it if my lady will pardon me said poor belasez driven into a corner i did not like it what kind was it levina said it was suffolk cheese belasez's conscience rather smote her in giving this answer ah responded the unconscious countess it is often hard and everybody does not like it i know belasez was silent beyond a slight reverence to show that she heard the observation but hast thou had enough pursued the countess still unsatisfied i am greatly obliged to my lady and quite ready to serve her was the evasive reply the countess looked hard at belasez but she said no more she despatched levina for the scarf which was to be copied and gave the young jewess her instructions the exquisite work which grew in belasez's skilful hands evidently delighted the countess she was extremely kind and the reserved but sensitive nature of belasez went out towards her in fervent love to margaret the jewish broideress was an object of equal mystery and interest she would sit watching her work for long periods she noticed that belasez ignored the existence of her private oratory made no reverence to the gilded virgin which stood on a bracket in her wardrobe and passed the benitier without vouchsafing the least attention to the holy water manifestly jews did not believe in gilded images and holy water but then in what did they believe had they any faith in any thing belasez had owned to saying her prayers and she acknowledged the existence of some law which she felt herself bound to obey but whose law was it and to whom did she pray these thoughts seethed in margaret's brain till at last one afternoon when she sat watching the embroidery they burst forth into speech belasez what would my damsel belasez what dost thou believe the jewess looked up in surprise i am not sure that i understand my damsel's question will she condescend to explain i mean what god dost thou worship there is but one god answered belasez solemnly that i believe too but we do not worship the same god do we i think we do to a certain extent but there is a difference between us what is the difference belasez seemed to hesitate don't be afraid but speak out said margaret eagerly if i say what my lady would not approve would it be right in me my lady and mother will not mind go on damsel i think the difference touches him who is the sent of god and the son of the blessed we believe in him as well as you but we believe that he is yet to come and is to be the salvation of israel you believe belasez's words came slowly as if dragged from her that he is come long ago and you think he will save all men but that is our lord christ surely said margaret you call him so was belasez's reply but he did come said margaret in a puzzled tone a man came undoubtedly who claimed to be the man who was to come but was the claim a true one i have always been told that it was and i have always been told that it was not then how are we to find out which is true belasez spread her hands out with a semi eastern gesture which indicated hopeless incapacity of some sort damsel do not ask me the holy prophets told our fathers of old time that so long as israel walked contrary to the holy one so long should they wander over the earth forsaken exiles and be punished seven times for their sins are we not exiles is he not punishing us our holy and beautiful house is a desolation our land is overthrown by strangers yet we are no idolaters we are no sabbath breakers we do not profane the name of the blessed do you think i never ask myself for what sin it is that we are thus cast away from the presence of our king in old days it was always for such sins as i have named it cannot be that now is it o abraham our father can it be that he has come the king of israel and we have not known him damsel there are thousands of the sons of israel that have asked that question and then belasez stopped suddenly go on urged margaret what then i shall say what my damsel will not wish to hear if i do go on but i wish very much to hear it and then we look around on you who call yourselves servants of him whom ye say is come we ask you to tell us what you have learned of him and ye answer us with the very things which the king of israel solemnly forbade ye point us to images of dead men and ye hold up before us a goddess a fair dead woman and ye say these are they whom ye shall serve and we answer if these things be what ye have learned from him that is come then he never can be the sent of god god forbade all idolatry and all image making if he taught it can he be messiah this is why in all the ages we have stood aloof we might have received him we might have believed him but for this but i do not know said margaret thoughtfully that holy church lays much stress on images i should think if ye prefer to pray without them she would allow you to do so i cannot understand how ye can pray without them for what is there to pray to it is your infirmity i suppose ah damsel said belasez with a sad smile this seems to you a very very little matter how shall a jew and a christian ever understand each other for it is life or death to us it is a question of obeying or of disobeying not of doing something we fancy or do not fancy yes but holy church would decide it for you urged margaret earnestly damsel your words are strange to my ears the holy one to whom be praise has decided it long ago ye shall not make unto you any graven image ye shall not bow down to them nor worship them' the command is given what difference can it make to us that the thing you call the church dares to disregard it i scarcely understand what the church' is if i rightly know what my damsel means it signifies all the christians and christians are gentiles how can the sons of israel take laws from them and to speak as if they could abrogate the law of him that sitteth in the heavens before whom they are all less than nothing and vanity it is a strange tongue in which my damsel speaks i do not understand it neither did margaret understand belasez she sat and looked at her with her mind in bewildered confusion to her the authority of the church was paramount was the only irrefragable thing and here was something which looked like another church setting itself up with some unaccountable and unheard of claim to be older truer better something which denied that the church with horror be it whispered had any right to make laws which referred to a law and a legislator so high above the church that it scarcely regarded the church as worth mention in the matter at all margaret felt stunned but god speaks through the church she gasped if that were so they would speak the same thing was belasez's unanswerable response margaret felt pushed into a corner and did not know what to say next the difference between her point of view and that of belasez was so vast that considerations which would have silenced any one else at once passed as the idle wind by her and margaret could not see how to alter it i must ask father nicholas to show thee how it is she said at last in a kindly manner i am only an ignorant girl but he can explain to thee can he said belasez what explanations of his or any one's can prove that man may please himself about obeying his maker he will tell me does my damsel think i have never listened to a christian priest he will tell me to offer incense to yonder gilded image had i not better offer it to myself i am a living daughter of israel is that not better than the stone image of a dead one better than our blessed lady cried the horrified margaret perhaps if she were here a living woman she might be the better woman of the two said belasez coolly but a living woman i am sure is better than a stone image which can neither see nor hear nor feel oh but don't you know said margaret eagerly as a bright idea occurred to her that we have the holy father the pope he keeps the church right and our lord commissioned saint peter who was the first pope to teach every body and promised to guard him from all error margaret was mentally congratulating herself on this brilliant solution of all difficulties belasez looked up thoughtfully but did he promise to guard all the successors oh of course i wonder supposing he were the messiah if he did said belasez because i have sometimes thought that might explain it what might explain it my damsel knows that the disciples of great teachers often corrupt their master's teaching and in course of time they may come to teach doctrines quite different from his it has struck me sometimes whether it might be so with you that your master was truly the sent of god and that you have so corrupted his doctrines that there is very little likeness left now there must be very little if he spoke according to the will of the holy one but the church never changes said margaret then he could not be true said belasez oh but father nicholas says the church develops she always teaches the truth but she unfolds it more and more as time goes on the truth is one my damsel it maybe more but it can never be different and contrary but we change urged margaret taking the last weapon out of her quiver we may need one thing to day and another to morrow we may and if the original command had been even ye shall make no image but one' i should think it might then as need were have been altered to ye may now make a thousand images' but being ye shall make none' it cannot be altered that would be to alter his character who is in all his universe the only unchangeable one margaret sat and watched the progress of the embroidery but she said no more chapter four the time of jacob's trouble i know that the thorny path i tread is ruled with a golden line and i know that the darker life's tangled thread the brighter the rich design for i see though veiled from my mortal sight god's plan is all complete though the darkness at present be not light and the bitter be not sweet the course of public events at that time was of decidedly a stirring character the public considered that four mock suns which had been seen during the previous winter two snakes fighting in the sea off the south coast and fifteen days' continuous thunder in the following march were portents sufficiently formidable to account for any succeeding political events whatever the church was busy introducing the order of saint francis into england the populace were discovering how to manufacture cider hitherto imported and were quite unknown to themselves laying the foundation of their country's commercial greatness by breaking into the first vein of coal at newcastle in fact the importance of this last discovery was so little perceived that a hundred and fifty years were suffered to elapse before any advantage was taken of it belasez's work was done and entirely to the satisfaction of the countess so much also did the princess marjory admire it that she requested another scarf might be worked for her to be finished in time for her approaching marriage she was now affianced to gilbert de clare the new earl of pembroke it was not without a bitter pang that marjory had resigned her proud hope of wearing the crown of england and had consented to become merely the wife of an english noble but the crown was gone from her beyond recall the fickle hearted king who had been merely attracted for a season by her great beauty was now as eagerly pursuing a foreign countess jeanne of ponthieu whom report affirmed to be equally beautiful and perhaps marjory was a little consoled though she might not even admit it to herself by the fact that earl gilbert was at once a much richer man than the king and very much better looking she made him a good wife when the time came and she grieved bitterly over his loss when six years afterwards he was killed in a tournament at hereford marjory was not so particular as her sister about the work being done under her own eyes she left pattern and colours to belasez's taste only expressing her wish that red and gold should predominate as they were the tints alike of the arms of scotland and of clare the princess was to be married on the first of august and belasez promised that her father should deliver the scarf during his customary hawker's round in july the young jewess had suffered less than might have been supposed from levina the countess without condescending to assign any reason had quietly issued orders that belasez's meals should be served in the ante chamber half an hour before the general repast was ready in the hall in the presence of the young ladies and not unfrequently of the countess herself levina deemed it prudent to bring up apple pie without sauce piquante and to serve gateaux unmixed with pepper or anchovies abraham became eloquent in his thanks for the kindness shown to his daughter and the tears were in belasez's eyes when she took leave farewell my maid said the countess addressing the latter thou art a fair girl and thou hast been a good girl i shall miss thy pretty face in magot's ante chamber we shall meet again i doubt not such work as thine is not to be lightly esteemed wilt thou grudge thy treasure to me if i ask for her again she added turning to abraham with a smile surely not my lady my lady has been as an angel of god to my darling and remember both of you that if ye come into any trouble as may be and thou seekest safe shelter for thy bird i will give it her at any time in return for her lovely work this was a greater boon than it may appear troubles were only too likely to assail a jewish household and to know a place where belasez could seek shelter and be certain of finding it was a comfort indeed and might at any hour be a most terrible necessity abraham kissed the robe of the countess and poured out eloquent blessings on her belasez kissed her hand and that of margaret but the tears choked the girl's voice as she turned to follow her father the arguments against idolatry which margaret had heard from belasez were ghosts easily laid by father nicholas a few vague platitudes concerning the supreme authority committed to the apostle peter and through him to the papacy father nicholas discreetly left both points unencumbered by evidence the wickedness of listening to sceptical reasonings and the happiness of implicit obedience to holy church were quite enough to reduce belasez's arguments as they remained in margaret's mind to the condition of uncomfortable reminiscences which being also wicked it was best to forget as soon as possible but there had been one listener to that conversation of whom neither party took account and who could not forget it this was doucebelle de vaux in her brain the words of the young jewess took root and germinated but so silently that no one suspected it but herself father nicholas had not the faintest idea of the importance of the question when one morning during the latin lesson which he administered twice a week to the young ladies of the castle doucebelle asked him the precise meaning of adoro it means in its original to speak to or accost any one said the priest but being now taken into the holy service of religion it signifies to pray to supplicate and thence derived to worship to bow one's self down and if i do not trouble you too much father would you please to tell me the difference between adoro and colo father nicholas was a born philologist though in his day there was no appellation for the science to be asked any question involving a derivation or comparison of words was to him as a trumpet to a war horse my daughter it is pleasure not trouble to me to answer such questions as these colo is a word which comes from the greek but is now obsolete in that tongue wherein it seems to have had the meaning of feed or tend transferred to the latin it signifies to cultivate exercise practise or cherish say rather in any sense to take pains about a thing hence used in the blessed service of religion it is to regard venerate respect or worship therefore cultus which is the noun of this verb signifies when referred to things inanimate tending or cultivation to things animate education culture to god and the holy saints reverence and worship dost thou now understand my daughter i thank you very much father said doucebelle quietly i understand now when she was alone she put her information together and thought it carefully over non adorabis ea neque coles images then were not to be reverenced either in heart or by bodily gesture so said the version of scripture made by saint jerome and used and authorised by the church but how was it that the church allowed these things to be done did she not know that scripture forbade them or was she above all scripture practically it looked like it yet how was it if the church were the mouthpiece of god that the commands issued by the one were diametrically at variance with the recommendations given by the other if god did not change if the church did not change when had they been in accord and how came they to differ doucebelle had now reached a point where she could neither turn round nor go further the more she cogitated on her problem the more insoluble it appeared to her yet her instinctive feeling told her that to refer it to father nicholas would be of no service he was one of the better class of priests a man of respectable character with literary proclivities which had in his case the effect of keeping him from vice on the one hand and of deadening his spiritual sensibilities on the other to him the religion he taught and had himself been taught was sufficient for all necessities and he could not understand any one wanting more when a man's mind has never been disturbed by the question it is no cause for wonder that he has never sought for the answer that father nicholas would have listened to her doucebelle knew for he was by no means an unkind or disobliging man but she had sense to perceive that he was incapable of understanding her and that his only idea of dealing with such queries would be not to solve but to suppress them doucebelle passed in mental review every person in the castle and every one in turn she dismissed as unsuitable for her purpose the other chaplain of the earl father warner was a stern harsh man of whom she in common with all the young people was very much afraid she could not think of putting such queries to him the chaplain of the countess father elias had just resigned his post and his successor had not yet been appointed master aristoteles the household physician was an excellent authority on the virtues of comfrey or frogs' brains but a very poor resource on a theological question the earl was not at home the countess would be likely to enter into doucebelle's perplexities little better than father nicholas and would playfully chide her for entertaining them all the young people were too young except sir john de burgh and hawise sir john had not an idea beyond war politics and falconry and hawise was accustomed to decline mental investigations altogether so doucebelle was shut up to her thoughts and her psalter perhaps she might have been worse situated on the th of february died hugh bishop of lincoln the enemy of all monks he had not however by any means been the enemy of all superstition he was remarkably easy to take in by young women who had sustained personal encounters with satan nuns who had been favoured with apparitions of the virgin and monks to whom saint peter or saint lawrence had made revelations it is little wonder that he was canonised and perhaps not much that a touch of his bones or a shred of his chasuble were asserted to be possessed of miraculous power a very different man filled the see of lincoln in his stead on the rd of june following robert grosteste was appointed to the vacant episcopal throne grosteste was a man who had learned his life lessons not from priest or monk from fathers or decretals but direct from god i do not presume to say that he held no false doctrine or that he made no mistakes but considering the time at which he lived and the corruption all around him his teaching was singularly free from wood hay stubble singularly clear evangelical and true to the one foundation especially he set himself in opposition to the most popular doctrine of the day that which was termed grace of congruity and for a man in such a position to set himself in entire and active opposition to popular taste and belief and to persevere in it requires supplies either of vast pride from satan or of great grace from god grace of congruity is simply a variety of the old heresy of human merit it clad its proud self in the silver robe of humility by professing to possess only an imperfect degree of qualification for the reception of god's grace grace of condignity on the other hand put itself on an equality with the divine gift by its pretension to possess that qualification to the uttermost the summer was chiefly occupied by pageants and feasts for there were two royal marriages that of the princess marjory of scotland with gilbert de clare and that of the princess isabel of england with the emperor frederic the second of germany the latter ceremony did not take place in england but the gorgeous preparations did for henry the third who delighted in spending money even more than in acquiring it provided his sister with the most splendid trousseau ever known even for a royal bride her very cooking vessels were all of silver and her reins and bridles were worked in gold she was married at worms in june the wedding of the princess marjory took place on the first of august abraham and belasez were faithful to their promises and the beautiful scarf wrought in scarlet and gold was delivered into marjory's hands in time to be worn at the wedding the young people of the castle were naturally interested in the stereotyped rough and silly gambols which were then the invariable concomitants of a marriage and the stocking skilfully flung by marie hit margaret on the head to the intense delight of the merry group around her the equally amusing work of cutting up the bride cake revealed richard de clare in possession of the ring supposed to indicate approaching matrimony marie of the silver penny which denoted riches and doucebelle of the thimble which doomed her to celibacy there now 'tis as plain to be seen as the church spire said eva clapping her hands margaret is destined by fate to wed with my cousin sir richard well if fate' mean my wish and intention so she is whispered the countess to her sister the bride doth thy lord so purpose it asked marjory oh hush responded the countess laughing he knows nothing about it and i don't intend that he shall just yet trust me to bring things about but suppose he should be angry pure foy he is never angry with me oh thou dost not understand my dear madge at present men always want managing when thou hast been wed a year thou wilt know more about it but can all women manage men asked marjory in an amused tone ha chetife no indeed and there are some men who can't be managed worse luck but my lord is not one of the latter the holy saints be thanked and thou art one of the women who can manage men answered marjory laughing i wonder at thee magot and have done so many times thou hast such a strange power of winning folks to thy will well that some have and some have not i have it i know said the countess complacently but i will give thee a bit of counsel madge which thou mayest find useful first have a will let it be clear and distinct in thine own mind what thou wouldst have done and secondly let people see that thou takest quietly for granted that of course they will do it there is a great deal in that with some people a weak will always bends to a strong but when two strong ones come in collision how then why like wild animals fight it out and discover which is the stronger a tournament of wills said marjory i should hardly care to enter those lists i think the countess laughed and shook her head she knew that among the strong willed women marjory was not to be reckoned a tournament of that class was being held all that summer between the regular priests and the newly instituted predicant friars the priests complained that the friars presumed to hear confessions in the churches which it was the prerogative of the regularly appointed priests to do and wrathfully alleged that the public were more ready to confess to these travelling mendicants than to the proper authorities it is possible that the cause may be traced to that human proclivity which inclines a man to confide rather in a stranger whom he may never meet again than in one who can remind him of uncomfortable facts at inconvenient times but also it is possible that the people recognised in the teaching of the minorite friars largely recruited as they were from the ranks of the waldenses somewhat more of that good news which christ came to bring to men than of the endless unmeaning ceremonies which encumbered the doctrine of the regular priests the summer had given place to autumn the courtyard of bury castle was strewn with golden and russet leaves the countess was preparing a new dress for the feast of saint luke a foggy day had ended in a dark night and eva threw down her work and rethreaded her needle with a long drawn sigh tired of sewing eva very tired lady i almost wish buttons grew on robes and required no sewing lazy maiden said the countess playfully then i am lazy too interposed margaret for i do hate sewing if it please the lady said levina's voice at the door an old man and woman entreat the honour of laying a petition before her an old man and woman such a night as this do they come from the town if it please the lady i do not know very well if the warder thinks them not suspicious persons they can come into the hall i shall be down shortly when the countess descended followed by margaret and doucebelle she found her petitioners awaiting her most unsuspicious harmless feeble creatures they looked the old man had tottered in as if barely able to stand the old woman walked with a stout oaken staff and was bent nearly double well good people what would ye have asked the countess in answer the old man lifted his head pulled away a mass of false grey hair and a wax mask from his face and the old jew pedlar abraham of norwich stood before the astonished ladies i am come he said in a voice broken by emotion to claim my lady's promise what promise old man my lady was pleased to say that if the robbers broke into the nest or the hawk hovered over it the young bird should be safe in her care thy daughter i remember i did say so where is she at a signal from abraham the aged woman at his side suddenly straightened herself and the removal of another wax mask and some false white hair revealed the beautiful face of belasez welcome my maiden said the countess kindly and what troubles have assailed thee old abraham which made this disguise and flight necessary my lady is good to her poor servants may the blessed one bind her in the bundle of life but not all christians are like her lady there is this day sore trouble and great rebuke and blasphemy against the sons of israel that dwell in norwich they accuse us of having kidnapped and crucified a christian child they lay too much to us lady too much we have never done such a thing nor thought of it but the house of my lady's servant is despoiled and his son ill treated and his brother in the gaol at norwich for this cause and to save his beautiful belasez he has brought her to his gracious lady will she give his bird shelter in her nest according to her word indeed i will answered the countess margaret take the maid up to thine ante chamber and bid levina bring her food she must stay here a while and thou sit thou down old abraham and rest and refresh thee truly my lady is as one of the angels of the holy one to her tried servants said abraham thankfully belasez kissed the hand of the countess and then turned and followed margaret to the ante chamber art thou very tired belasez very very weary my damsel we have come fourteen miles on foot since yesterday very weary belasez looked now that the momentary excitement of her arrival and reception was over the light had died out of the languid eyes and her head drooped as if she could scarcely hold it up go to bed said margaret that is the best place for over tired people levina my lady and mother wills thee to bring the maid some food levina appeared at the door with an expression of undisguised annoyance ha chetife if here is not my lady countess jew come again what would it please her sweetest grace to take but levina had forgotten as older people sometimes do that margaret was no longer a child to be kept in silent subjection girls of fifteen and she was nearly that now were virtually women in the thirteenth century margaret turned to the scoffing levina with an air of dignified displeasure which rather startled the latter levina thou hast forgotten thyself do as thou art bid and levina disappeared without venturing a reply what have they done to thy brother belasez asked margaret they beat him sorely damsel and turned him forth into the street where did he go that is known to the blessed one out in the fields somewhere it is not the first time that a jew hath lain hidden for a night or more until the fury of the christians should pass away doucebelle de vaux was a grave and thoughtful girl beyond her years she sat silent now trying to recall from the stores of a memory not too well furnished whether christ whom these christians professed to follow had ever treated people in such a manner as this at length she remembered that she had seen a picture at thetford of his driving sundry people out of the temple with a scourge but was that because they were jews doucebelle thought not she was too ignorant to be sure but she fancied they had been doing something wrong i should think said margaret warmly that you jews must hate us christians christians are not all alike said belasez with a faint smile but do you not hate us persisted margaret delecresse does i am afraid replied belasez colouring but thyself no o my damsel no she warmed into vivid life for an instant to make this reply then she sank back against the wall apparently overpowered by utter weariness i am glad of that said margaret with her usual outspoken earnestness what can levina be doing doucebelle do go and see and hast thou been hard at work at norwich all the summer belasez no if it please my damsel i have dwelt all this summer at lincoln with my mother's father the devil overlooks lincoln' they say remarked margaret laughingly i hope he did thee no mischief belasez but perhaps jews do not believe in the devil ah we have good cause to believe in the devil answered belasez gravely nay damsel he did me no mischief yet what know i the holy one knoweth all things belasez's tone struck margaret as hinting at some one thing in particular but she did not explain further perhaps she was too tired doucebelle returned at this point followed by levina who carried a plate of manchet bread and a bowl of milk and though belasez did not know it she owed thanks to doucebelle that it was not skim milk the young jewess ate as if she were very faint as well as weary then hast thou come here all the way from lincoln inquired margaret when the bowl was emptied if it please my damsel no i had returned home only two days before the riot is thy mother living asked margaret abruptly yes she abode at lincoln with my grandfather he is very old and will not in likelihood live long when he dies my mother will come back to us do go to bed belasez thou canst scarcely hold thine head up nor thine eyes open said margaret compassionately and belasez accepted the invitation with thanks doucebelle went with her and silently noticed two facts that belasez stood for a few minutes in silent prayer with her face turned to the wall before she offered to undress and that she was fast asleep almost as soon as her head had touched the pillow doucebelle stood still and looked at the sleeping girl why was it so wicked to be a jew had belasez been a christian of noble birth or even of mean extraction she would have been regarded as an ornament of any court in christendom some nobleman or knight would very soon have found that lovely face and her refined and dignified manners were fit for any lady in the land why must she be regarded as despicable and treated with abuse and loathing merely because she had been born a jewess of course doucebelle knew the traditionary reason because the jews had crucified christ but belasez had not been one of them why must she bear the shame of others' sins did none of my ancestors thought doucebelle ever do some wicked deed yet people do not despise me on that account why do they scorn her belasez stirred in her sleep and one or two broken words dropped from her unconscious lips greatly interested and a little startled doucebelle bent over her but she could make out nothing connected from the indistinct utterances it sounded as if belasez were dreaming about somebody whose face she could not see hid faces doucebelle heard her murmur it was probably she thought some reminiscence connected with the tumults which had brought her to seek shelter at the castle doucebelle drew the coverlet higher over the weary sleeper and went to seek rest in her own bed chapter five not wisely i love but one and only one o damon thou art he love thou but one and only one and let that one be me note the pedlar abraham declined to remain at the castle there were plenty of places he said where an old man could be safe it was quite another thing for a young girl if his gracious lady would of her bounty give his bird shelter until the riot and its consequences were over and every thing peaceable again abraham would come and fetch her as soon as he deemed it thoroughly prudent meanwhile belasez could work for the lady the countess was only too pleased to procure such incomparable embroidery on such easy terms she set belasez to work on the border of an armilaus intended as a present for the new queen for the hitherto unmarriageable king had at last found a princess to accept him she was the second daughter of a penniless provencal count but she was a great beauty though an extremely young girl and her eldest sister was queen of france she proved a costly bargain free from all visible vices except two which unfortunately were two cultivated by henry himself unscrupulous acquisition and reckless extravagance she nevertheless contrived to do terrible mischief by giving her husband no advice in general and bad advice whenever she gave it in particular his ivy like nature wanted a strong buttress upon which to lean and eleonore of provence was neither stronger nor more stable than himself her one idea of life was to enjoy herself to the utmost when she wanted a new dress she had not the slightest notion of waiting till she had money to pay for it what were the people of england in her eyes but machines for making it things to be taxed a vast and inexhaustible treasury of which you did but turn the handle and coins came showering out so the tax gatherers went grinding on and the land cried to god and the court heard no sound the man who was to be god's avenger upon them was an obscure foreigner as yet and the english noble who above all others was to aid him in that vengeance was still only a fair haired youth of fifteen whose thoughts were busy with a very different subject but out of the one the other was to grow watered by tears and blood he was standing young richard de clare in one of the recessed windows of the great hall with margaret beside him they were talking in very low tones richard's manner was pleading and earnest while margaret's eyes were cast down and she was diligently winding round her finger a shred of green sewing silk as though her most important concern were to make it go round a certain number of times it was the old story so many times repeated in this world sometimes to flow smoothly on like waters to their haven sometimes to end in stormy wreckage and bitter disappointment they were very young lovers we should term them mere boy and girl and count them unfit to consider the matter at all but in the thirteenth century when circumstances forced men and women early to the front and sixty years was considered ripe old age fifteen was equivalent at least to twenty now in this instance the course of true love for it was on both sides very true seemed likely to be smooth enough the king had granted the marriage of richard to earl hubert and as was then well understood the person to whom he would most probably marry his ward was his own daughter the only irregular item of the matter was that the pair should fall in love or should broach the subject at all to each other but human hearts are unaccountable articles and even in those days when matrimony was an affair of rule and compasses those irregular things did occasionally conduct themselves in a very irregular manner leading young people to fall in love and sometimes to run away with the wrong person but happily and occasionally as in this instance with the right one half an hour later margaret was kneeling on a velvet cushion at the feet of the countess who was with secret delight receiving auricular confession concerning the very point on which she had set her heart this mother and daughter were great friends a state of things too infrequent at any time and particularly so in the middle ages margaret the only one of her mother was an unusually cherished and petted child the result was that she had no fear of the countess and looked upon her as her natural confidante perhaps if more daughters would do so there might be fewer unhappy marriages at the same time it must be admitted that some mothers by no means invite confidence the countess of kent sweet as she was had one great failing a fault often to be found in very gentle and amiable natures she was not sufficiently straightforward instead of honestly telling people what she wanted them to do she liked to manage them into it and this managing involved at most times more or less dissimulation she dearly loved to conduct her affairs by a series of little secrets this is a temperament which usually rests on a mixture of affection and want of courage we cannot bear to grieve those whom we love and we shrink from calling down their anger on ourselves or even from risking their disapprobation of our conduct past or proposed now it had been for some years the dearest wish of the countess's heart that her margaret should marry richard de clare but she never whispered her desire to any one least of all to her husband with whom humanly speaking it lay mainly to promote or defeat it and now when margaret's blushing confession was whispered to her the countess privately congratulated herself on her excellent management and thought how much better it was to pull unseen strings than to blaze one's wishes abroad and lady will you of your grace plead for us with my lord and father said margaret in a coaxing tone at last oh leave it all to me replied her mother i will manage him into it never tell a man anything my dove if thou wouldst have him do it men are such obstinate perverse creatures that as often as not they will just go the other way out of sheer wilfulness thou must always contrive to manage them into it margaret who had inherited her father's honesty with her mother's amiability was rather puzzled by this counsel but how do you manage them said she there is an art in that my dear it takes brains different men require very different kinds of management now thy father is one who will generally consent to a thing when it is done though he would not if it were suggested to him at first he rather likes his own way still he is very good when he is well managed for instance after instance came floating back to the wife's mind in which he had against his own judgment given way to her so that is the way to manage him now our lord king henry requires entirely different handling that was true enough while earl hubert always had a will of his own and knew what it was though he did not always get it king henry had no will and never knew what it was until somebody else told him i am afraid lady i don't understand the management of men said margaret with a little laugh and blush thou wilt learn in time my dear thou art rather too fond of saying all thou meanest that is not wise for a woman of course a man ought to tell his wife every thing but there is no need for a wife always to be chattering to her husband she must have her little secrets and he ought to respect them now as to sir richard i can see as well as possible the kind of management he will require thou must quietly suggest ideas to him gently and diffidently as if thou wert desirous of his opinion but whenever he takes them up mind and always let him think he is getting his own way he has a strong will against which a foolish woman would just run full tilt and spoil every thing a wise one will quietly get her own way and let him fancy he has got his that is thy work magot margaret shook her bright head with a laugh such work as that was not at all in her line it took only a day for the girls to discover that the belasez who had come back to them in october was not the belasez who had gone away from them at whitsuntide she seemed almost a different being quite as amiable as patient as refined as before there was something about her which they instantly perceived but to which they found it hard to give a name it was not exactly any one thing it was not sadness for at times she seemed more bright and lively than they remembered her of old it was not ill temper for her patience was proof against any amount of teasing but her moods were far more variable than they used to be a short time after she had been playing with little marie all smiles and sunshine they would see tears rush to her eyes which she seemed anxious to conceal and at times there was an expression of distress and perplexity in her face evidently not caused by any intricacy in the pattern she was working indirect questions produced none but evasive answers each of the girls had her own idea as to the solution of the enigma margaret very naturally pronounced belasez in love eva one of whose sisters had been recently ill thought she was anxious about her brother marie suggested that too much damson tart might be a satisfactory explanation that having been the state of things with herself a few days before hawise who governed her life by a pair of moral compasses was of opinion that belasez thought it proper to look sorrowful in her circumstances and therefore did so except in an emergency doucebelle alone was silent but her private thought was that no one of the four had come near the truth when belasez had been about a week at the castle one afternoon she and doucebelle were working alone in the wardrobe the countess and margaret were away for the day on a visit to the abbess of thetford eva and marie were out on the leads hawise was busy in her own apartments belasez had been unusually silent that morning she worked on in a hurried nervous way never speaking nor looking up and a lovely arabesque pattern grew into beauty under her deft fingers suddenly doucebelle said belasez does life never puzzle thee belasez looked up with almost a frightened expression in her eyes can anything puzzle one more she said unless it were the perplexity which is hovering over my soul is that anything in which i could help thee it is something in which no human being could help me only he before whom the inhabitants of the earth are as grasshoppers there was silence for a moment then in a low hushed tone belasez said doucebelle didst thou ever do a thing which must be either very right or very wrong and thou hadst no means whereby to know which it was no answered doucebelle slowly i can scarcely imagine such a thing scarcely imagine the thing or the uncertainty the uncertainty because i should ask the priest the priest where is he doucebelle looked up in surprise at the tone and saw that belasez was in tears we had priests said the young jewess we had sons of aaron and a temple and an altar and a holy oracle whereby the blessed one made known his will in all matters of doubt and perplexity to his people but where are they now the mountains of zion are desolate and the foxes walk upon them the light has died out of the sacred gems even if they themselves were to be found we have walked contrary to him ah where is the unerring prophet that shall tell us how we did it and he walks contrary to us and is punishing us seven times for our sins we are in the desert in the dark and the pillar of fire has gone back into heaven and the angel of the covenant leadeth us no more doucebelle was almost afraid to speak lest she should say something which might do more harm than good she only ventured after a pause to remark still there are priests yours i know what they would tell me belasez's fervent voice had grown constrained all at once yes thou dost not believe them i suppose said doucebelle with a baffled feeling i want a prophet doucebelle not a priest nay he knows the holy one that we want a priest most bitterly that we have no sacrifice wherewith to stand before him no blood to make atonement but we want the prophet to point us to the priest let us know by revelation from heaven that this man or that man is the accepted priest of the most high and trust us to bring our fairest lambs in sacrifice belasez i believe that the lamb was offered twelve hundred years ago and the sacrifice which alone god will accept for the sins of men is over for ever and is of everlasting efficacy i know belasez's face was more troubled than before if thou canst not trust his priests couldst thou not trust him trust whom exclaimed belasez with her eyes on fire o doucebelle doucebelle i know not how to bear it i thought i was so strong to stand up against all falsehood and error and here one man with one word let me hold my peace but o that thou wouldst rend the heavens that thou wouldst come down hast thou but one blessing o thou that art a father unto israel or are we so much worse off than our fathers in the desert nay are we not in the desert with no leader to guide us no fiery pillar to bid us rest here or journey thither why hast thou given the dearly beloved of thy soul into the hands of her enemies is it is it because we hid our faces from him and to doucebelle's astonishment belasez covered her face with her apron and sobbed almost as if her heart were breaking poor belasez said doucebelle gently it is often better to tell out what troubles us than to keep it to ourselves if thou wert a daughter of israel i should tell it thee and ask thy counsel i need some one's counsel sorely and canst thou not trust me christian though i am oh no it is not that thou dost not understand doucebelle thou couldst not enter into my difficulty unless thou wert of my faith that is the reason it is not indeed that i mistrust thee hast thou told thy father my father no he would be as much horrified to hear that such thoughts had ever entered my head as the lady would be if thou wert to tell her thou didst not believe any longer in thy christ then what canst thou do could thy mother help thee or thy brother my mother would command me to dismiss such ideas from my mind on pain of her curse but i cannot dismiss them and for delecresse i think he would stab me if he knew what sort of thoughts are they wilt thou keep my secret if i tell thee indeed i will not utter them without thy leave belasez cut off her silk laid down the armilaus and clasped both hands round her knee when your great festivals draw nigh she said four times in every year we israelites are driven into your churches and forced to listen to a discourse from one of your priests until that day i have never paid any attention to what i deemed blasphemy i have listened for a moment but at the first word of error or the first repetition of one of your sacred names i have always stopped my ears and heard no more but this last midsummer when we were driven into lincoln cathedral the new bishop was in the pulpit and he spake not like the other priests i could not stop my ears why should i when he read the words of one of our own prophets and in the holy tongue rendering it into french as he went on and delecresse said it was correctly translated for i asked him afterwards he saw nothing in it different from usual but it was terrible to me he read words that i never knew were in our scriptures concerning one whom it seemed to me must be must be he whom you call messiah as a root out of a dry ground' no form nor comeliness' no beauty that we should desire him' despised and rejected of men' and lastly we hid our faces from him' for we did doucebelle we did i could think of nothing else for a while for we did not hide them from others we welcomed judas of galilee and barchocheba and many another who rose up in our midst claiming to be sent of god but he who claimed to be the sent one we crucified him we did not crucify them we hid our faces from him and from him alone and then i heard more words for the bishop kept reading on we all like sheep have gone astray we have turned every one to his own way' ah was that not true of the dispersed of judah and the lord hath made to meet upon him the iniquities of us all' doucebelle it was like carrying a lamp into a dark chamber and beholding every thing in it suddenly illuminated was that what it all meant was the bishop right when he said afterwards that it was not possible that the blood of bulls and goats could take away sin were they all not realities as i had always thought them but shadows pointing forward through the ages to the one who was to come to the blood which could take away sin did our own scripture say so the man that is my fellow' he read it from one of our very own prophets and we hid our faces from him' if he from whom we hid our faces for there was but one such if he were the sent of god the man that is his fellow the lamb whose blood maketh atonement for the soul why then what could there be for us but tribulation and wrath and indignation from before the holy one for ever was it any marvel that we were punished seventy times for our sins if we had done that belasez drew a long breath and altered her position and if we had not done that what had we done the old perplexity came back on me worse than ever what had we done we were not idolaters any more we were not profane we kept the rest of the holy sabbath yet the blessed one was angry with us he hid his face from us and the centuries went on and we were exiles still still under the displeasure of our heavenly king and what had we done if we had not hidden our faces from him who was the man that is his fellow and then belasez paused again and a softer sadder expression came into her eyes and then the bishop read some other words i suppose they were from your sacred books i do not think they came from ours he read that because this man continueth to eternity untransferable hath he the priesthood' he read that if any man sin we have an advocate with the father and he is the propitiation for our sins' and again he read some grand words said by this man himself i am the first and the last and the living one and i was dead and am alive for evermore and with me are the keys of sheol and of death' oh it was so different doucebelle from your priests' sermons generally there was not a word about that strange thing you call the church not a word about the maiden whom you worship it was all about him who was to be the sent of god and i thought may i be forgiven of the holy one if it were wicked i thought this was the priest that would suit me this was the prophet that could teach me this was the man who if only i knew that to do it was truth and not error was light and not darkness was life and not death i could be content to follow to the world's end and how am i to know it doucebelle looked up earnestly and the girls' eyes met one of them was groping in the darkness in search of christ the other had groped her way through the darkness and had caught hold of him she did not see his face very clearly but enough so to be sure that it was he belasez dear maid he said one other thing come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden and i will give you rest' trust me the surest way to find out who he is is to come to him what meanest thou he is not on earth he is where thy need is answered doucebelle gently in any labyrinth out of which we know not the way over any grave where our hearts lie buried we can meet him but how thy words are a riddle to me call him and see if he do not come to thee and if he and thou do but meet it does not much matter by which track thou earnest thither belasez was silent and seemed to be thinking deeply doucebelle she said at last are there two sorts of christians because thy language is like the bishop of lincoln's all the priests and other christians whom i have heard before spoke in quite another strain there are live christians and dead ones i know not of any third sort the dead ones must be fearfully in the majority said belasez i mean if thou and the bishop are live ones that may be true i am afraid replied doucebelle it must be the breathing of the holy one that makes the difference observed belasez very thoughtfully for it is written that adonai formed man of the dust of the earth and breathed into his nostrils the neshama of life and man became a living soul thus he breathed the life into man at first in the day of the creation of adam surely in the day when the soul of man becomes alive to the will of the holy one he must breathe into him the second time that he may live belasez what are your sacred books you seem to have some we gave them to you was belasez's reply but ye have added to them but the scriptures were given to the church remonstrated doucebelle with some surprise i know not what ye mean by the church answered the jewess they were ours given to our fathers revealed to them by the holy one we gave them to you or ye filched them from us i scarcely know which and ye have added other books which we cannot recognise the flash of fervent confidence had died away and belasez was once more the reserved impenetrable jewish maiden to whom gentile christians were unclean animals and their doctrines to be mentioned only with scorn and abhorrence and as marie came dancing in at that moment the conversation was not renewed but it made a great impression upon doucebelle who ever afterwards added to her prayers the petition fair father jesu christ teach belasez to know thee bel pere then one of the common epithets used in prayer but to every one in general and to doucebelle in particular belasez seemed shut up closer than ever the january of came and with it the royal marriage the ceremonial took place at canterbury and earl hubert was present as his office required of him the countess excused herself on the ground of slight illness which would make it very irksome for her to travel in winter her intimate enemies kindly suggested that she was actuated by pique since a time had been when she might have been herself queen of england but they did not know margaret of scotland pique and spite were not in her her real motive was something wholly different she was not naturally ambitious nor did she consider the crown of england so highly superior to the gemmed coronal of a scottish princess and she had never held king henry in such personal regard as to feel any regret at his loss her true object in remaining at bury was to manage the marriage of margaret with richard de clare it was to be a clandestine match except as concerned a few favoured witnesses and earl hubert was to be kept carefully in the dark till all was safely over the wedding was to be one per verba de presenti then as sacred by the canon law as if it had been performed by a priest in full canonicals and as a matter of absolute necessity no witness was required at all but the countess thought it more satisfactory to have one or two who could be trusted not to chatter till the time came for revelation she chose doucebelle along with herself as the one in whose silence she had most confidence thus in that january in the dead of the night the four indicated assembled in the bed chamber of the countess and the bride and bridegroom joining hands said simply in the presence of god and of these persons i richard take thee margaret to my wedded wife and in the same presence i margaret take thee richard to my wedded husband and according to canon and statute law they were legally married nor could anything short of a divorce part them again now then go to bed said the countess addressing doucebelle and beware every soul of you that not a word comes out till i tell you ye may speak belasez when wilt thou be wed inquired margaret the next morning if the thoughts of the bride ran upon weddings it was not much to be wondered next summer said belasez as coolly as if the question had been when she would finish her embroidery there was no shadow of emotion of any kind to be seen oh art thou handfast replied margaret interested at once i was betrothed in my cradle was the answer of the jewish maiden to a jew of course of course to leo the son of hamon of norwich my father's greatest friend is he a nice young man i never saw him why belasez the maidens of my people are strictly secluded it is not so with christians yet it was less strange to these christian girls than it would be to the reader they lived in times when the hand of an heiress was entirely at the disposal of her guardian who might marry her to some one whom she had never seen as to widows they were in the gift of the crown unless they chose as many did to make themselves safe by paying a high price for liberty to marry whom they would even then such a thing was known as the crown disregarding the compact let it be added since much good cannot be said of king john that he at least was careful to fulfil his engagements of this description his son was less particular margaret looked at belasez with a rather curious expression and how dost thou like the idea she asked of being wife to one whom thou hast never seen i do not think about it said belasez in the same tone as before what is to be will be but what is to be said margaret may be very delightful or it may be very horrid yes no doubt was the cool answer i shall see when the time comes margaret turned away with a shrug of her shoulders and a comic look in her eyes which nearly upset the gravity of the rest note these lines are or were to be seen written with a diamond upon a pane of glass in a window of the hotel des pays bas spa belgium with the date i do not know whether they are to be found in the writings of any poet chapter six the new confessor had the knight looked up to the page's face no smile the word had won had the knight looked up to the page's face i ween he had never gone had the knight looked back to the page's geste i ween he had turned anon for dread was the woe in the face so young and wild was the silent geste that flung casque sword to earth as the boy down sprung and stood alone alone elizabeth barrett browning nobody enjoyed the spring of the year rain poured down day after day as if it were the prelude to a second deluge the thames overflowed its banks to such an extent that the lawyers had to return home in boats floated by the tide into westminster hall there was no progress except by boat or horse through the streets of the royal borough perhaps the physical atmosphere slightly affected the moral and political for men's minds were much unsettled and their tempers very captious the king with his usual fickleness and love of novelty had thrown himself completely into the arms of the horde of poor relations whom the new queen brought over with her particularly of her uncle guglielmo of savoy the bishop of valentia whom he constituted his prime minister by his advice new laws were promulgated which extremely angered the english nobles who complained that they were held of no account in the royal councils the storms were especially violent in the north and there people took to seeing prophetic visions of dreadful import beside all this france was in a very disturbed state which boded ill to the english provinces across the sea the counts of champagne bretagne and la marche used strong language concerning the disgraceful fact that france the kingdom of kingdoms was governed by a woman queen blanche of castilla being regent during the minority of her son saint louis it is a singular fact that while the name of blanche has descended to posterity as that of a woman of remarkable wisdom discretion and propriety of life the popular estimate of her during her regency was almost exactly the reverse meanwhile the royal marriage festivities went on uproariously at canterbury there was not a peacock pie the less on account either of the black looks of the english nobles or of the very shallow condition of the royal treasury to king henry who had no intention of paying any bills that he could help what did it signify how much things cost or whether the sum total were twenty pence or twenty thousand pounds the feasts having at last come to an end king henry left canterbury for merton abbey and earl hubert accompanied him what became of the queen is not stated nor are we told whether his majesty thus went into retreat to seek absolution for his past transgressions or from the lamentable necessity of paying his debts on the th of january the royal penitent emerged from his retreat to be crowned with his bride at westminster earl hubert of course was present and the countess thought proper to feel well enough to join him for the occasion the ceremony was a most splendid one very different from that first hurried coronation of the young henry on his father's death when all the regalia having been lost in fording the wash he was crowned with a gold collar belonging to his mother the archbishop of canterbury was the officiating priest the citizens of london hereditary butlers of england presented three hundred and sixty cups of gold and silver at which the eyes of the royal and acquisitive pair doubtless glistened and which in all probability were melted down in a month to pay for the coronation banquet king henry paid a bill just often enough to prevent his credit from falling into a hopelessly disreputable condition the earl of chester one of earl hubert's two great enemies bore curtana the sword of saint edward says the monk of saint albans to show that he is earl of the palace and has by right the power of restraining the king if he should commit an error either earl ranulph de blundeville was very neglectful of his office or else he must have found it anything but a sinecure the constable of chester attended the earl his office was to restrain not the king but the people by keeping them off with his wand when they pressed too close the earl of pembroke husband of princess marjory of scotland carried a wand before the king cleared the way superintended the banquet and arranged the guests the basin was presented by a handsome young foreigner simon de montfort youngest son of the count de montfort and cousin of the earl of chester to whose good offices in the first instance he probably owed his english preferment he had not yet become the most powerful man in the kingdom the darling of the english people the husband of the king's sister the man whom on his own testimony much as he feared a thunderstorm henry feared more than all the thunder and lightning in the world the earl of arundel should have been the cup bearer but being too young to discharge the office his kinsman the earl of surrey officiated for him the citizens of winchester were privileged to cook the banquet and the abbot of westminster kept every thing straight by sprinkling holy water once more the banquet over the king returned into retreat at merton to get rid of his additional shortcomings never was man so pious as this monarch if piety consisted of tithing mint anise and cummin and of neglecting the weightier matters of the law judgment mercy and faith it was a sharp frosty morning in february margaret doucebelle and belasez were at work in the bower while father nicholas was hearing marie read latin in the ante chamber the other chaplains were also present father warner who with nicholas belonged to the earl and father bruno the chaplain of the countess also present was master aristoteles the reverend physician of the household fortunately for herself marie was by no means shy and she feared the face of no human creature unless it were father warner who margaret used to say had eyes in the back of his head and could hear what the cows were thinking about in the meadow he was an extremely strict disciplinarian when on duty but he never interfered with the proceedings of a brother tutor father bruno was a new inmate of the household he had come from lincoln with a recommendation from the recently appointed bishop but had been there too short a time to show his character since he was a silent man who appeared to see everything and to say nothing very well my daughter thou hast been a good attentive maiden this morning said father nicholas when the reading was finished then father will you let me off my sums was marie's quick response marie hated arithmetic which was doucebelle's favourite study nay my child said father nicholas in an amused tone that is not my business thou must ask father warner please father warner will you let me off my sums pleaded marie but in a more humble style certainly not daughter fetch them at once marie left the room with a grieved face no news abroad i suppose my brethren suggested master aristoteles in his brisk simple innocent manner nay none but what we all knew before said father nicholas methinks the world wags but slowly said master aristoteles much too fast was the oracular reply of father warner the pace of the world depends mainly on our own wishes i take it said father nicholas he who would fain walk thinks the world is at a gallop while he who desires to gallop reckons the world but jogging at a market trot there has been a great massacre of jews in spain said father bruno speaking for the first time all the conversation was plainly audible to the girls in the next room when father bruno spoke belasez's head went up suddenly and her work stood still amen and alleluia said father warner who probably little suspected that he was using hebrew words to express his abhorrence of the hebrews nay my brother answered father bruno gravely shall we thank god for the perdition of human souls of course not of course not interposed father nicholas quickly i am sure our brother warner thanked god for the vindication of the divine honour and is not the divine honour more fully vindicated by far demanded father bruno when a soul is saved from destruction than when it is plunged therein yes yes no doubt no doubt eagerly assented father nicholas who seemed afraid of a fracas curs said father warner contemptuously they all belong to their father the devil and to him let them go i would not give a farthing for a jew's soul in the market belasez's eyes were like stars brother said father bruno so gravely that it was almost sadly our master was not of your way of thinking he bade his apostles to begin at jerusalem when they preached the good tidings of his kingdom have we done it master aristoteles' ah might mean anything as the hearer chose to take it of course they did so the church was first at jerusalem before saint peter transferred it to rome snapped father warner pardon me my brother i did not ask did they do so i said have we done so explained bruno how could we responded father nicholas in a perplexed tone i never came across any of the evil race holy mary be my guard and if i had done i should have crossed over the road lest they should cast a spell on me belasez's smile was one of contemptuous amusement pure foy if i ever came across one i should spit in his face cried warner two might play at that game was the cool observation of bruno i'd have him hung on the new machine if he did exclaimed warner the new machine was the gibbet first set up in england in this year brethren said bruno we are verily guilty one and all for weeks this winter and i hear also last summer there has been in this house a maiden of the hebrew race who has never learned the faith of christ the lord has probably never heard his name except in blasphemy which of us four of his servants shall answer to god for that child's soul margaret expected belasez's eyes to flash and her lip to curl in scorn to her great surprise the girl caught up her work and went on with it hastily doucebelle watching her with deep yet concealed interest fancied she saw tears glistening on the samite really i never you put it so seriously brother bruno i never looked at the matter in that way i did not think and father nicholas came to a full stop you see i have been so very busy illuminating that missal for the lady i really never never considered the thing so seriously brother nicholas answered bruno the devil was serious enough when he tempted our mother eva and christ was serious when he bore away your sins and mine and nailed them to his cross and the angels of god are serious when they look down and see us fighting with sin in the dark and weary day what god is serious and satan is serious and the holy angels are serious and can we not be serious will the great judge take that answer think you lord i was so busy illuminating and writing that i let the maiden slip into perdition and thou wilt find her there' belasez's head was bowed lower than before brother bruno you are unreasonable interposed warner we all have our duties to our lord and lady and as to that contemptible insect in the lady's chamber well i do not know what you think but i would not scorch my fingers pulling her out of erebus the dark brows of the young jewess were drawn close together ah brother warner said bruno christ my master scorched his fingers so much with me that i cannot hesitate to burn mine in his service marie and her arithmetic seemed forgotten by all parties i am afraid brother bruno faltered father nicholas really afraid i may have been too remiss the poor girl of course though she is a jew and they are very bad people very yet she has a soul to be saved yes undoubtedly i will see what i can do there are only about a dozen leaves of the missal and then that treatise on grace of congruity that i promised the abbot of ham and let me see i believe i engaged to write something for the prior of saint albans what was it now where are my tables oh here yes ah that would not take long a week might do it i think i will see i really will see brother bruno when these little matters are disposed of what i can do for the girl do give her ratsbane sneered warner laconically bruno's reply was a quotation while thy servant was busy here and there he was gone' then he rose and left the room dear dear said father nicholas our brother bruno means well very well indeed i am sure but those enthusiastic people like him don't you think they are very unsettling brother warner really he has made me feel quite uncomfortable why the world would have to be turned upside down we could never write nor paint nor cultivate letters we should have to be incessantly preaching and confessing people stuff the fellow's an ass was father warner's decision ha chetife what has become of that little monkey damsel marie i must go and see after her and he followed his colleague father nicholas gathered his papers together and from the silence that ensued the girls gathered that the ante chamber was deserted belasez said doucebelle that night as she was brushing her hair the two slept in the wardrobe wert thou very angry with father bruno this morning belasez looked up quickly with him no i thought but the thought progressed no further till doucebelle said well i thought said belasez combing out her own hair very energetically that i had at last found even a christian priest who was worthy of him of whom the bishop of lincoln preached him whom you believe to be messiah then said doucebelle greatly delighted thou wilt listen to father bruno if he talks to thee i would not if i could help it was belasez's equivocal answer belasez i cannot quite understand thee sometimes thou seemest so different from what thou art at other times because i am different understand me do i understand myself the holy one to whom be praise he understands us all but sometimes thou art willing to hear and talk and at others thou art close shut up like a coffer because that is how i feel i wish thou wouldst tell thy feelings to father bruno i shall wait till he asks me i think said belasez a little drily well i am sure he will i am not sure that he will twice why what wouldst thou say to him he will hear if he wants to know and belasez thereupon shut up like a coffer and seemed to have lost her tongue for the remainder of the night doucebelle determined that if she could possibly contrive it without wounding the feelings of father nicholas her next confession should be made to father bruno he seemed to her to be a man made of altogether different metal from his colleagues master aristoteles kept himself entirely to physical ailments and never heard a confession except from the sick in emergency father nicholas was a very easy confessor for his thoughts were usually in his beloved study and whatever the confession might be absolution seemed to follow as a matter of course if his advice were asked on any point outside philology in all its divisions he generally appeared to be rather taken by surprise and almost as much puzzled as his penitent his strongest reproof was ah that was wrong my child thou must not do that again so that confession to father nicholas while eminently comfortable to a dead soul was anything but satisfying to a living one father warner was a terrible confessor his minute questions penetrated into every corner of soul and body he took nothing for granted good nor bad absolution was hard to get from him and not to be had on any terms but those of severe penance and yet it seemed to doucebelle that there was an inner sanctuary of her heart from which he never even tried to lift the veil a depth in her nature which he never approached was it because there was no such depth in his and therefore he necessarily ignored its existence in another in one way or another they were all miserable comforters she wished to try father bruno most unwittingly father nicholas helped her to gain her end by requesting a holiday he had heard a rumour that a latin manuscript had been discovered in the library of saint albans' abbey and father nicholas in whose eyes the lost books of livy were of more consequence than any thing else in the world except the order of saint benedict was unhappy till he had seen the manuscript the countess in the earl's absence readily granted his request and doucebelle's fear of hurting the feelings of her kind hearted though careless old friend were no longer a bar in the way of consulting father bruno father warner who was confessing the other half of the household growled his disapprobation when doucebelle begged to be included in the penitents of father bruno something new always catches a silly girl's fancy said he but doucebelle had no scruple about hurting his feelings since she did not believe in their existence so when her turn came she knelt down in bruno's confessional at first she wondered if he were about to prove like father nicholas for he did not ask her a single question till she stopped of herself then instead of referring to any thing which she had said he put one of weighty import daughter what dost thou know of jesus christ i know said doucebelle that he came to take away the sins of the world and i humbly trust that he will take away mine that he will repeated bruno is it not done already i thought father that it would be done when i die what has thy dying to do with that if it be done at all it was done when he died then where are my sins father asked doucebelle feeling very much astonished this was a new doctrine to her but bruno was an augustinian and well read in the writings of the founder of his order they are where god cannot find them my child therefore there is little fear of thy finding them understand me if thou hast laid them upon christ our lord i know i have said doucebelle in a low voice then on his own authority i assure thee that he has taken them father i may i really believe that may thou must if thou wouldst not make god a liar but what then have i to do what wouldst thou do for me if i had rescued thee from a burning house and lost my own life in the doing of it i could do nothing said doucebelle feeling rather puzzled wouldst thou love or hate me o father can there be any question and supposing there were some thing left in the world for which thou knewest i had cared a favourite dog or cat wouldst thou leave it to starve or take some care of it i think was doucebelle's earnest answer i should care for it as though it were my own child then daughter see thou dost that for him who did lose his own life in rescuing thee love him with every fibre of thine heart and love what he has loved for his sake he has left with thee those for whom on earth he cared most the poor the sick the unhappy be they unto thee as thy dearest and he the dearest of all this was very unlike any counsel which doucebelle had ever before received from a confessor there was something here of which she could take hold not that father bruno had suggested a new course of action so much as that he had supplied a new motive power to do good to give alms to be kind to poor and sick people doucebelle had been taught already but the reason for it was either the abstract notion that it was the right thing to do or that it would help to increase her little heap of human merit to all minds but in particular to an ignorant one there is an enormous difference between the personal and the impersonal tell a child that such a thing must be done because it is right and the motive power is faint and vague not unlikely to be overthrown by the first breath of temptation but let the child understand that to do this thing will please or displease god and you have supplied a far stronger energising power in the intelligible reference to the will of a living person doucebelle felt this as more or less we all do father she said after a momentary pause i want your advice state thy perplexity my daughter i hope father you will not be angry but a few days ago when you and the other priests were talking in the ante chamber about belasez the door was open and we heard every word in the bower did belasez hear what was said yes ha what did she say i asked her at night whether what you had said had wounded her and she said no but she thought there was one christian priest who was like what the scripture described christ to be did she say that there was a tone of tender regret in the priest's voice she did but father i want to know how to deal with belasez sometimes she will talk to me quite freely and tell me all her thoughts and feelings at other times i cannot get a word out of her let her alone at the other times what is the state of her mind she seems to have been very much struck father with a sermon from your bishop wherein he proved out of her own scriptures she says that our lord is the messiah whom the jews believe but i do not know if she has reached any point further than that i think she hardly knows what to believe only those sermons do good which god preaches said bruno perhaps he spoke rather to himself than to doucebelle whenever the maiden will speak to thee do not repulse her lead her to the best of thy power to see that christ is god's one cure for all evil yet he must teach it first to thyself i think he has done so a little answered doucebelle but father will you not speak to her my child we will both wait upon god and speak the words he gives us at the time he will and remember whatever blunders men make belasez is after the flesh nearer akin to him than thou art she is the kinswoman of the lord jesus let that thought spur thee on if thou faint by the way father our lord was not a jew he was a jew my daughter hardly any news could more have amazed doucebelle but why then do people use them so harshly thou hadst better ask the people answered bruno drily father is it right to use jews so thou hadst better ask the lord what does he say father he said speaking to abraham the father of them all i will bless him that blesseth thee and curse him that curseth thee' oh i am so glad cried doucebelle if you please father i could not help loving belasez but i tried hard not to do so because i thought it was wicked it cannot be wrong to love a jew if christ himself were one bruno did not reply immediately when he did it was with a slight quiver in his voice which surprised doucebelle it can never be wrong to love he said but daughter let not thy love stop at liking the maid's company let it go on till thou canst take it into heaven the strangest of all strange ideas was this to doucebelle she had been taught that love was always a weakness and only too frequently a sin that so purely earthly a thing could be taken into heaven astonished her beyond measure father she said in a tone of mingled amazement and inquiry what now my daughter people always speak of love as weak if not wicked people often talk of what they do not understand my child god is love' think not therefore that god resembles a worldly fancy which springs to day and fades away to morrow his is the heavenly love which can never die which is ready to sacrifice all things which so looks to the true welfare of the beloved that it will give thee any earthly suffering rather than see thee sink into perdition by thy sins this is real love daughter and thou canst not sin in giving it to belasez or to any other yet father said doucebelle in a puzzled tone the religious give up love when they go into the cloister i do not understand a sister of saint ursula may not leave her convent even if her own mother lies dying and pleads hard to see her and though some priests do wed this had not yet in england ceased to be the case yet people always seem to think the celibate priests more holy as if that were more in accordance with the will of god yet god tells us to love each other i cannot quite understand if doucebelle could have seen as well as spoken through the confessional grating assuredly she would have stopped sooner for the agony that was working in every line of father bruno's face would have been terrible to her to see but she only thought that it was a long while before he answered her and she wondered at the hard constrained tone in his voice child he said does any one but god quite understand' do we understand ourselves and how much less each other it is only love that understands he who most loves god will best understand men and for the rest o lord who hast loved us pardon the blunders and misunderstandings of thy people and save thy servants that trust in thee now go my child unless thou hast more to say absolvo te doucebelle rose and retired but she did not know that father bruno heard no more confessions she only heard that he was not at home when dinner was served and when he appeared at supper he looked very worn and white as if after a weary journey chapter seven the shadow of long ago 'tis a fair fair face in sooth larger eyes and redder mouth than mine were in my first youth elizabeth barrett browning so faithfully had the countess adhered to her plighted word that belasez should be seen by no one that not one of the priests had yet beheld her except father nicholas and the meeting in that case had been accidental and momentary but when father bruno announced to his brother priests his intention of seeking an interview with the jewish maiden father nicholas shook his head waggishly have a care of the toils of satan brother bruno said he the maiden may have the soul of a fiend for aught i wot yet hath she the face of an angel i thank thee there is no fear answered bruno with a smile which made him look sadder the countess had not returned from the coronation festivities and the girls were alone in margaret's bower when father bruno entered with god save all here belasez rose hastily and prepared to withdraw wait my child said the priest gently i would speak with thee but when she turned in answer and he saw her face some strange and terrible emotion seemed to convulse his own domine in te speravi fell from his trembling lips as if he scarcely realised what he was saying belasez looked at him with an astonished expression whatever were the cause of his singular emotion it was evidently neither understood nor shared by her with a manifest effort of self control bruno recovered himself sit down daughters he said for all had risen in reverence to the priest and he seated himself on the settle whence he had a full view of belasez and what is thy name my daughter belasez at your service and thy father's name abraham of norwich if it please you abraham of norwich not not the son of ursel of norwich the same again that look of intense pain crossed bruno's face no wonder he said speaking not to belasez the very face the very look no wonder and thy mother my mother is licorice the daughter of kokorell of lincoln bruno gave a little nod as if he had known it before hast thou any brethren or sisters one brother only his name is delecresse the reply seemed to extinguish bruno's interest for a moment as if his thoughts were far elsewhere he played with a morsel of sewing silk which he had picked up from the floor the lord is wiser than men he said at last as if that were the conclusion to which his unseen thoughts had led him yes and better answered the young jewess and better dreamily repeated the priest we shall know that one day when we wake up to see his face amen said belasez when we awake up after thy likeness' saith david the prophet we shall be satisfied with it' satisfied' echoed bruno art thou satisfied my daughter the answering no appeared to come from the depths of belasez's heart shall i tell thee wherefore there is but one thing that satisfies the soul of man neither in earth nor in heaven is any man satisfied with aught else my child dost thou know what that is belasez looked up her own face working a little now you mean she said the man whom ye call christ i mean him i know nothing about him and belasez resumed her embroidery as if that were of infinitely greater consequence dost thou know much about happiness happiness exclaimed the girl i know what mirth is do you mean that or i know what it is to feel as if one cared for nothing is that your meaning happiness said bruno is what thy king meant when he said i shall be satisfied with it' dost thou know that belasez drew a long breath and shook her head sadly no she said i have never known that because thou hast never known jesus christ i know he said i am the life' responded the girl slowly and life is not worth much perhaps it might be if one were satisfied poor child is life not worth much to thee answered the priest in a pitying tone and thou art very young not much over twenty i am under twenty i am just eighteen once more bruno's face was convulsed just eighteen he said yes licorice's child yet she had no pity aye me just eighteen do you know my mother said belasez in accents of mingled surprise and curiosity i did eighteen years ago and bruno rose hastily as if he wished to dismiss the subject margaret dropped on her knees and requested his blessing which he gave as though his thoughts were far away and then he left the room slowly gazing on belasez to the last this was the first but not by any means the last interview between father bruno and the jewish maiden a month later doucebelle asked belasez how she liked him i do not like him i love him said belasez with more warmth than usual what a confession answered doucebelle playfully oh not that sort of love responded belasez with a tinge of scorn i think it must be the sort that we can take into heaven with us the next morning levina announced to the countess in a tone of gratified spite that two persons were in the hall an old man unknown to her and the young jew delecresse he had come for his sister belasez received the news of her recall at first with a look of blank dismay and then with a shower of passionate tears her deep attachment to her christian friends was most manifest she kissed the hand of the countess and margaret warmly embraced doucebelle and then looked round as if something were wanting still what is it my maid kindly asked the countess father bruno faltered belasez through her tears oh i must say farewell to father bruno the countess looked astonished for she knew not that bruno and belasez had ever met a few words from doucebelle explained still the countess was extremely dissatisfied my maid she said thy father may think i have not kept my word i ought to have told father bruno i never thought of it when he first came i am very sorry has he talked with thee on matters of religion at all yes belasez explained no further dear dear said the countess he meant well i suppose and of course it is better thy soul should be saved but i wish he had less zeal and more discretion lady said belasez pausing for an instant if ever i enter the kingdom of the blessed one above i think i shall owe it to the bishop of lincoln and to father bruno that is well no doubt responded the countess in a very doubtful tone oh dear what did make father bruno think of coming up here as belasez passed down towards the hall father bruno himself met her on the stairs whither goest thou my child he asked in some surprise i am going away belasez's tears choked her voice to thy father's house she bowed without christ no father not without him sobbed the girl nor if you will grant it to me at this moment without baptism dost thou believe that jesus christ is the son of god i do bruno hesitated a minute while an expression of deep pain flitted over his face i cannot do it belasez o father do you reject me god forbid my child i do not reject thee in any wise i only reject myself belasez long years ago licorice thy mother did me a cruel wrong if i baptise thee i shall feel it to be my revenge on her and i have no right thus to defile the snow white robe of thy baptism because my hands are not clean nor to mingle the revenge of earth with the innocence of heaven wait a moment and he turned and went rapidly down the stairs belasez waited till he came back he was accompanied by father warner she trembled at the ordeal which she guessed to await her and soon found that she was not far wrong father warner took her into the empty chapel and required her to repeat the creed which of course she could not do to tell him which were the seven deadly sins and what the five commandments of the church belasez had never heard of any of them warner shook his head sternly and wondered what brother bruno could possibly mean by presenting this ignorant heathen as a fit candidate for baptism belasez felt as if god and man alike would have none of her warner recommended her to put herself under the tuition of some priest at norwich which was to her a complete impossibility and perhaps in a year or thereabouts if she were diligent and obedient in following the orders of her director she might hope to receive the grace of holy baptism she went out sobbing and encountered bruno at the head of the stairs o father bruno faltered the girl father warner will not do it i was afraid so said bruno sadly i should not have thought of asking him had my brother nicholas been at home well daughter this is no fault of thine remember we baptise only with water but he whose ministers we are can baptise thee with the holy ghost and with fire let him be thy shepherd to provide for thee thy priest to absolve thee thy king to command thine heart's allegiance so dwell thou to him in this world now that hereafter thou mayest dwell with him for ever belasez stooped and kissed his hand he gave her his blessing in fervent tones bade her a farewell which gave him unmistakable pain and let her depart belasez drew her veil closely over her face and joined delecresse and her father's old friend hamon in the hall what a time thou hast been said delecresse discontentedly do let us go now i want to be outside this accursed castle but to belasez it seemed like stepping out of the sunlit fold into the dreary wilderness beyond as they passed the upper end of the hall belasez paused for an instant to make a last reverence to margaret who sat there talking with her unacknowledged husband sir richard de clare the black scowl on the face of her brother drew her attention at once who is that young gentile he demanded sir richard de clare lord of gloucester what hast thou against him asked old hamon that is the youth that threw my cap into a pool a year ago and called me a jew cur said delecresse between his teeth pooh pooh said old hamon we all have to put up with those little amenities never mind it child i'll never mind it till the time come answered delecresse in an undertone then i think i see how to wipe it off belasez found her mother returned from lincoln she received a warm welcome from abraham a much cooler one from licorice and was very glad having arrived at home late to go to bed in her own little chamber which was inside that of her parents she soon dropped asleep but was awoke ere long by voices in the adjoining room distinctly audible through the curtain which alone separated the chambers they spoke in spanish the language usually employed amongst themselves by the english sephardim ay de mi woe is me' that it ever should have been so said the voice of licorice what did the shiksah note want with her i told thee wife answered abraham in a slightly injured tone she wanted the child to embroider a scarf and i suppose thou wert too anxious to fill thy saddle bags to care for the danger to her there was no danger at all wife the countess promised all i asked her and i made thirteen gold pennies clear profit thou canst see the child is no worse they have been very kind to her she said as much abraham son of ursel thou art a very wise man what canst thou mean licorice kind to her' if they had starved her and beaten her there might have been no harm done canst thou not see that the girl's heart is with her christian friends why she had been crying behind her veil quietly all the journey well wife what then what then' abraham isaac and jacob what then' why then she will do like anegay the god of our fathers forbid it cried abraham in tones of horror and distress it is too late for that said licorice with a short contemptuous laugh thou shouldst have said that a year ago and have kept the child at home we had better marry her at once suggested abraham still in a voice of deep pain there are no birds in last year's nest' old man was the response marry her or let it alone the child's heart is gone from us she has left behind her in yonder castle those for whom she cares more than for us and i should not wonder also a faith dearer to her than ours it will be anegay over again ah well like to like what else could we expect can she hear us licorice not she she was fast asleep an hour ago wife if it be so have we not deserved it abraham don't be a fool cried licorice so very snappishly that it sounded as if her conscience might have responded a little to the accusation i cannot but think thou didst evil licorice thou knowest how and when i understand thee of course it was the only thing to do i know thou saidst so answered abraham in an unconvinced tone yet it went to my heart to hear the poor child's sorrowful moan thy heart is stuffed with feathers i would rather it were so than with stones thanks for the compliment nay i said nothing about thee but licorice if it be as thou thinkest do not let us repeat that mistake i shall repeat no mistakes i warrant thee the conversation ceased rather suddenly except for one mournful exclamation from abraham poor anegay anegay where had belasez heard that name before it belonged to no friend or relative so far as she knew yet that she had heard it before and that in interesting connection with something she was absolutely certain belasez dropped asleep while she was thinking it seemed to her that hardly a minute passed before she woke again to hear her mother moving in the next room and to see full daylight streaming in at the window and suddenly just as she awoke it rushed upon her when and how she had heard of anegay she saw herself a little child standing by the side of licorice with them was old belya the mother of hamon and before them stood an enormous illuminated volume at which they were looking belasez found it impossible to remember what had been said by belya but her mother's response was as vivid in her mind as if the whole scene were of yesterday hush the child must not know yes belya thou art right that was taken from anegay's face what was it that was taken and dimly before belasez's mental eyes a picture seemed to grow in which a king upon his throne and a woman fainting were the principal figures esther before ahasuerus that was it of course and belasez sprang up with a determination to search through her father's books and to find the picture which had been taken from anegay's face but after all who was anegay licorice was in full tide of business and porridge making in her little kitchen when belasez presented herself with an apology for being late nay folks that go to bed at nine may well not rise till five said licorice graciously throw more salt in here child and fetch the porringers whilst i stir it call thy father and delecresse breakfast will be ready by the time they are breakfast was half over when licorice inquired of her daughter whom she had seen at bury castle oh to speak to only the countess and her daughter damsel margaret and the other young damsels doucebelle eva and marie and levina the lady's dresser they showed me some others through the window so that i knew their names and faces belasez quietly left out the priests and what knights didst thou see there through the window sir hubert the earl and sir richard of gloucester and sir john the earl's son and sir john de averenches oh i forgot dame hawise sir john's wife but i never saw much of her there was no such there as one named bruno de malpas i suppose asked licorice with assumed carelessness no there was no knight of that name but in her heart belasez felt that the name belonged to the priest father bruno a few more questions were asked her of no import and then they rose when licorice set her free from household duties belasez took her way to the little closet over the porch which served as her father's library he was the happy possessor of eleven volumes a goodly number at that date eight she passed by knowing them to contain no pictures the ninth was an illuminated copy of the brut which of course began as all chronicles then did with the creation but belasez looked through it twice without finding any thing to satisfy her next came the chronicle of benoit but the illuminations in this were merely initials and tail pieces in arabesque there was only one left and it was the largest volume in the collection belasez could not remember having ever opened it she pulled it down now just missing a sprained wrist in the process and found it to be a splendid copy of the hagiographa with full page pictures glowing with colours and gold of course the illuminations had been executed by christian hands but all these books had come to abraham in exchange for bad debts and he was not so consistent as to refuse to look at the representations of created things however wicked he might account it to produce them belasez turned over the stiff leaves one after another till she reached the book of esther yes surely that was the picture she remembered there sat the king ahasuerus on a curule chair wearing a floriated crown and a mantle clasped at the neck with a golden fibula and there fainted queen esther in the arms of her ladies arrayed in the tight gown the pocketing sleeve the wimple and all other monstrosities of the early plantagenet era a persian satrap enclosed in a coat of mail and a surcoat with a silver shield whereon an exceedingly rampant red lion was disporting itself appeared to be coming to the help of his liege lady while a tall white lily in a flower pot about twice the size of the throne occupied one side of the picture to all these details belasez paid no attention the one thing at which she looked was the face of the fainting queen which was turned full towards the spectator it was a very lovely face of a decidedly jewish type but what made belasez glance from it to the brazen mirror fixed to the wall opposite was it anegay of whom bruno had been thinking when he murmured that she was so like some one undoubtedly there was a likeness the same pure oval face the smooth calm brow the dark glossy hair but it struck belasez that her own features as seen in the mirror were the less prominently jewish and once more who was anegay how little it is possible to know of the innermost heart of our nearest friends belasez went through all her duties that day without rousing the faintest suspicion in the mind of her mother that she had heard a syllable of the conversation between her parents the night before yet she thought of little else her household work was finished and she sat in the deep recess of the window at her embroidery when delecresse came and stood beside her belasez who was that damsel that sat talking with my lord of gloucester in the hall when we passed through that was the damsel margaret daughter of sir hubert the earl what sort of a maiden is she very sweet and gentle i liked her extremely she was always most kind to me is she attached to my lord of gloucester it was a new idea to belasez really i never thought of that cress but i should not at all wonder if she be she is constantly talking of him does he care for her i fancy he does by the way i have seen him look up at her windows yes i could tell that from his face the tone of her brother's voice struck belasez unpleasantly cress what dost thou mean it is a pity that the innocent need suffer with the guilty answered delecresse contemptuously but it mostly turns out so in this world belasez grasped her brother's wrists cress thou hast no thought of revenging thyself on sir richard of gloucester for that boyish trick he once played on thee i'll be even with him belasez no man least of all a christian dog shall insult me with impunity o cress cress thou must not do it hast thou forgotten that vengeance belongeth to the holy one to whom be glory and for such a mere nothing as that nothing dost thou call it nothing for a son of abraham to be termed a jew cur by one of those creeping things of gentiles is not the day at hand when they shall be our ploughmen and vine dressers well then answered belasez assuming a playfulness which she was far from feeling when sir richard is thy ploughman thou canst knock his cap off pish they like high interest these christians i'll let them have it the other way about cress what dost thou mean to do i mean that he shall pay me every farthing that he owes said delecresse through his clenched teeth i cannot have it in gold coins perhaps it will suit me as well in drops of blood either from his veins or from his heart delecresse thou shalt not touch the damsel margaret if that be the meaning of those terrible words i am not going to touch her replied delecresse scornfully even with the tongs he took to my cap i would not touch one of the vile insects for all the gold at norwich but what dost thou mean hold thou thy peace i was a fool to tell thee what art thou going to do persisted belasez what thou wilt hear when it is done said delecresse walking away he left poor belasez in grief and terror some misery of what sort she could not even guess was impending over her poor friend margaret how was it possible to warn her and of what was she to be warned a few minutes were spent in reflection and then belasez's work was hastily folded and she went in search of her father abraham listened with a perplexed and annoyed face that boy always lets his hands go before his head but what can i do daughter in good sooth i would not willingly see any injury done to the christians that have been so kind to thee where is cress he went into the kitchen said belasez abraham shuffled off in that direction in the loose yellow slippers which were one of the recognised signs of a jew delecresse is just gone out he said coming back directly i will talk to him when he comes in but twelve days elapsed before delecresse returned cress thou wilt not do anything to sir richard of gloucester earnestly pleaded belasez when she found him alone no said delecresse with a glitter in his eyes which was not promising hast thou done any thing all i mean to do o cress what hast thou done go to bed was the most lucid explanation which all the eager entreaties of belasez could obtain from her brother note the feminine singular of the hebrew word rendered in the av creeping things dr edersheim tells us that this flattering term is commonly employed in speaking of a gentile chapter eight in the dark i trust thee though i cannot see thy light upon my pathway shine however dark lord let it be thy way not mine if it stand with your good liking may a man have speech of sir piers de rievaulx it was a tall youth who asked the question and he stood under the porch of a large gothic house on the banks of the thames near westminster the night was wet and dark and it was the second of april and who art thou that would speak with the knight my master what i have to say to him is of consequence who i may be does not so much matter well said my young cockerel thou crowest fairly the porter laughed as he set down the lantern which he had been holding up to the youth's face and took down a large key from the peg on which it hung what shall i say to my master touching thee say if it please you that one would speak with him that hath important tidings which closely concern the king's welfare they were rash folks that trusted a slip like thee with important tidings none trusted me eavesdropping eh well thou canst keep thine own counsel lad as thou art i will come back to thee shortly it was nearly half an hour before the porter returned but the youth never changed his position as he stood leaning against the side of the porch come in said the porter holding the wicket open sir piers will see thee i told him being sent of none thou wert like to have no token the unknown visitor followed the porter in silence through the paved courtyard up a flight of stone steps and into a small chamber hung with blue here at a table covered with parchments sat one of king henry's ministers sir piers de rievaulx son of the bishop of winchester the worst living foe of earl hubert of kent he was on the younger side of middle age and was only not quite so bad a man as the father from whom he inherited his dark gleaming eyes lithe quick motions intense prejudices and profound artfulness of character christ save you come forward said sir piers shut the door oliver and let none enter till i bid it now who art thou and what wouldst thou with me i am delecresse son of abraham of norwich ha a jew of course thy face matches thy name now thy news will my noble knight be pleased to tell his unworthy servant if he likes the taste of revenge delecresse despised himself for the words he used a son of israel to humble himself thus to one of the goyim but it was expedient that the creeping thing should be flattered and gratified in order to induce him to act as a tool decidedly replied sir piers looking fixedly at delecresse your honour hates sir hubert of kent or i am mistaken ha pure foy worse than i hate the devil the devil was very near to both at that moment if i help you to be revenged on him will you pay me by giving me my revenge on another delecresse had dropped alike his respectful words and subservient manner and spoke up now as man to man turn about is fair play' i suppose said sir piers if thou seek not revenge on any friend of mine i will i seek it on sir richard de clare the young earl of gloucester he is no friend of mine said sir piers between his teeth his father married the woman i wanted i should rather enjoy it than otherwise the lady his mother yet lives what is that to me she is an old hag what do i care for her now delecresse felt staggered for a moment bad as he was in one respect he was capable of personal attachment as well as of hatred and sir piers' delicate notions of love rather astonished him but sir piers was very far from being the only man who was or is incapable of entertaining any others delecresse soon recovered himself he was too anxious to get his work done to quarrel with his tools it was gratifying too to discover that sir piers was not a likely man to be troubled by any romantic scruples about breaking the heart of the young margaret delecresse himself had been unpleasantly haunted by those and had with some difficulty succeeded in crushing them down and turning the key on them belasez's pleading looks and margaret's bright pretty face persisted in recurring to his memory in a very provoking manner sir piers was evidently the man who would help him to forget them well go on said the minister when delecresse hesitated i have good reason to believe that sir richard is on the point of wedding the damsel margaret de burgh nay i am not sure if they are not married clandestinely could not this be used as a handle to ruin both of them the two pairs of eyes met and a smile which was anything but angelic broke over the handsome countenance of sir piers not a bad idea for one so young he remarked is it thine own my own answered delecresse shortly i could make some use of thee in the kings service thank you said delecresse rather drily i do not wish to have more to do with the devil and his angels than i find necessary sir piers broke into a laugh neat that i suppose i am one of the angels but i am surprised to hear such a sentiment from a jew nothing is more inconsistent than sin in his anxiety to gratify his revenge delecresse was enduring patiently at the hands of sir piers far worse insults than that over which he had so long brooded from richard de clare he kept silence it really is a pity observed sir piers complacently surveying delecresse that such budding talent as thine should be cast away upon trade thou wouldst make far more money in secret service it would be easy to change thy name keep thy descent quiet and be ready to eat humble pie for a short time there is no saying to what thou mightest rise in this world and the other delecresse felt himself an unfledged cherub by the side of sir piers bah sir piers snapped his fingers what do such as we know about that there is no other world if there were the chances are that both of us would find ourselves very uncomfortable there we had better stay in this as long as we can as you please sir knight i am not ready to sell my soul for gold only for revenge eh well that's not much better there are a few scruples about thee my promising lad which thou wouldst find it necessary to sacrifice in the service some soft hearted mother or sister i imagine hath instilled them into thee women are always after some mischief i wish there were none what did delecresse know of the momentary pang of sensation which had pricked that hard seared heart as for one second memory brought before him the loving face of a little child over whose fair head for thirty years the churchyard daisies had been blooming could he hear the tender pleading voice of the baby sister begging dear piers not to hurt her pet kitten and she would give him all the sweetmeats aunt theffania sent her such moments do come to the hardest hearts and they usually leave them harder before delecresse had found an answer sir piers was himself again thou hast done me a service boy and i will take care that thy friend sir richard feels the goad as well as my beloved earl hubert take this piece of gold nay it will not burn thee 'tis only earthly metal thou wilt not as thou list the saints keep thee ah i forgot thou dost not believe in the saints bah no more do i only words lad all words fare thee well a few minutes later delecresse found himself in the street he was conscious of a very peculiar and highly uncomfortable mixture of feelings as if one part of his nature were purely angelic and the other absolutely diabolical he felt almost as if he had come direct from a personal interview with satan and his spirit had been soiled and degraded by the contact yet was he any better than sir piers except in lack of experience and opportunity he leaned over the parapet as he passed and watched the dark river flowing silently below i wish i had not done it came in muttered accents from his lips at last i do almost really wish i had not done it and then as the reader knows he went home and snubbed his sister abraham could get nothing out of his son except some scornful platitudes concerning the creeping creatures not a shred of information would delecresse give he was almost rude to his father a very high crime in the eyes of a jew but it was because he was so intensely dissatisfied with himself o my son light of mine eyes what hast thou done mournfully ejaculated old abraham as he resigned the attempt to influence or reason with delecresse done made those vile gentiles wince i hope retorted licorice i hate every man woman and child among them i should like to bake them all in the oven and she shut the door of that culinary locality with a bang belasez looked up with saddened eyes and her mother noticed them abraham son of ursel she said that night when she supposed her daughter to be safely asleep in the inner chamber when dost thou mean to have this maiden wedded i do not know wife would next week do next week was always abraham's time for doing every thing if thou wilt the gear has all been ready long ago there is only the feast to provide then i suppose i had better speak to hamon said abraham in the tone of a man who would have been thankful if allowed to let it alone it is time i take it it is far past the time husband said licorice that girl's heart as i told thee is gone after the creeping things didst thou not see the look in her eyes to night like to like blood to blood it made mine boil to behold it forbid it god of our fathers fervently ejaculated abraham licorice dost thou think the child has ever guessed hush husband lest she should chance to awake guessed no and she never shall belasez's ears it is unnecessary to say were strained to catch every sound what was she not to guess art thou sure that genta knows nothing genta was the daughter of abraham's brother moss nothing that would do much harm said licorice but in rather a doubtful tone beside genta can hold her peace ay if she choose but suppose she did not she knows does she not about anegay hush well yes something but not what would do most mischief what about her marriage with man i do for pity's sake give over or thou wilt blurt all out do only think if the child were to hear trust me she would go back to that wasp's nest to morrow no no just listen to me son of ursel get her safely married before she knows anything leo may be relied upon to keep her in safe seclusion and when she has a husband and half a dozen children to tie her down heart and soul to us she will give over pining after the gentiles belasez was conscious of a rising repugnance which she had never felt before to this marriage about to be forced upon her not personally to leo of whom she knew nothing but to this tie contemplated for her which was to be an impassable barrier between her and all her christian friends well sighed abraham he evidently did not like it i suppose then i must let the cohen note know about it if it be not already too late responded licorice dubiously if only this second visit had not happened there was less harm done the first time and i do not quite understand it some stronger feeling has taken possession of her now either her faith is shaken may the all merciful defend us from such horror well it is either that or there is love in her heart a deeper love than for the gentile woman and the girls of whom she talks she likes them i do not doubt but she would never break her heart after them there is somebody else old man of whom we have not heard and i counsel thee to try and find out him or her i am sadly afraid it is him but licorice she has not seen any one the lady passed her word that not a soul should come near her pish did the shiksah keep it even if she meant to do and who can trust a gentile was she there day and night did emendant not tell thee that he saw her at the coronation well yes he did admitted abraham with evident reluctance and had she belasez there tied to her apron string with a bandage over her eyes son of ursel wilt thou never open thine who knows how many young gallants may have chattered to her then when the cat is away ' thou knowest not that the shiksah was much of a cat when she was there i'll be bound dost thou not care if the child be stolen from us and when they have stolen her heart and her soul they may as well take her body it won't make much difference then licorice belasez listened more intently than ever there was a world of tender regret in abraham's voice and she knew that it was not for licorice licorice he said and stopped go on responded her mother sharply unless thou wert after some foolery as is most likely licorice hast thou forgotten that sabbath even when thou broughtest home i wish thou wouldst keep thy tongue off names i have as good a memory as thou though it is not lined like thine with asses' skin and dost thou remember what thou toldest me that she said to thy reproaches well what then what then' o licorice i do wish thou wouldst speak sense what art thou driving at thou art hard to please wife if i speak plainly thou wilt not hear me out and if i only hint thou chidest me for want of plainness well if thou canst not see what then' never mind i thought those sorrowful words of my poor child might have touched thy heart i can assure thee they did mine when i heard of them they have never been out of mine ears since it seemed plain to belasez that her mother was being rebuked for want of motherly tenderness and as she doubted not towards anegay this mysterious person then must have been a sister of whom she had never heard probably much older than herself what a lot of soft down must have been used up to make thine heart was the cynical reply of licorice i cannot help it licorice i have her eyes ever before me hers and his it is of no use scolding me i cannot help it and if it be as thou thinkest i cannot break the child's heart i shall not speak to hamon nor the cohen faint hearted gentile blazed forth licorice get it over wife said abraham quietly i will try to find out if thou hast guessed rightly though it were rather work for thee than me if well i will do my best but suppose i should find that she has given her maiden heart to some gentile what am i to do then do what did phinehas the son of eleazar the priest unto zimri and cozbi hath not the blessed one commanded saying thy daughter thou shalt not give unto his son' what meanest thou do couldst thou do too much even if they were offered upon the altar before the god of sabaoth where is it responded abraham desolately but licorice our daughter what dost thou mean said licorice fiercely perhaps we might shed tears first but they must not pollute the sacrifice do not the holy rabbins say that a tear dropped upon a devoted lamb washeth out all the merit of the offering i believe they do said abraham though it is not in the thorah but i did not mean exactly that dost thou not understand me i understand that thou art no true son of abraham burst out his wife i say she is and she shall be who ever heard of such reckoning in the days of the fathers answered abraham licorice i am doubtful if we have done well in keeping back the truth so much doth not the holy one love and require truth in all his people yet it was thy doing not mine oh yes thou wouldst have told her at once sneered licorice she would stay with us meekly then would she not go to sleep for mercy's sake i entreat thee and hold thy tongue before any worse mischief be done my doing yes it is well it was had i listened to thee that girl would have been worshipping idols at this moment blessed is the man that trusteth in adonai' softly said abraham he could have helped it i suppose ay and happy is that woman that hath a wise man to her husband responded licorice irreverently go to sleep for the sake of jael the wife of heber the kenite or i shall get up and chop thy head off for thou art not a whit better than sisera perhaps abraham thought it the wisest plan to obey his incensed spouse for no word of response reached belasez that damsel lay awake for a considerable time she soon made up her mind to get as much as she could out of her cousin genta it was evident that a catechising ordeal awaited her to the end of discovering a supposed christian lover but feeling her conscience quite clear on that count belasez was only disturbed at the possible revelation of her change of faith she could however honestly satisfy abraham that she had not received baptism but two points puzzled and deeply interested her how much had she better say about bruno and what was this mysterious point which they were afraid she might guess which seemed to have some unaccountable reference to herself if anegay were her sister as she could no longer doubt why should her conduct in some way reflect upon belasez suppose anegay had married a christian as she thought most likely from the allusions and which she knew would be in her parents' eyes disgrace of the deepest dye or even if anegay had herself become a christian which was a shade worse still yet what had that to do with belasez and why should it make her so anxious to go back to the christians then as to bruno belasez was conscious in her heart that she loved him very dearly though her affection was utterly unmingled with any thoughts of matrimony she would have thought old hamon as eligible for a husband when he patted her on the head with a patriarchal benediction it was altogether a friendly and daughterly class of feeling with which she regarded father bruno but would abraham enter into that was it wise to tell him thinking and planning belasez fell asleep the ordeal did not come off immediately it seemed to belasez as if her father would gladly have avoided it altogether but she was tolerably sure that her mother would not allow him much peace till it was done delecresse she said the first time she was alone with her brother had we ever a sister never to my knowledge said delecresse looking as if he wondered what had put that notion into her head evidently he knew nothing genta who was constantly coming in and out for her home was in the same short street dropped in during the evening and belasez carried her off to her own little bed chamber which was really a goodsized closet on the pretext of showing her some new embroidery genta she said tell me when my sister died thy sister belasez genta's expression was one of most innocent perplexity hadst thou ever a sister had i not i never heard of one think genta i was she not called anegay genta's shake of the head was decided enough to settle any question but belasez fancied she caught a momentary flash in her eyes which was by no means a negation but belasez did not hear a few sentences that were uttered before genta left the house aunt licorice what has belasez got in her head nay what has she genta i am sure some one has been telling her something she has asked me to night if she had not once a sister and if her name were not anegay the exclamation in reply was more forcible than elegant but that night as belasez lay in bed through half closed eyes she saw her mother enter and hold the lantern to her face i am sorry to add that belasez instantly counterfeited profound sleep and licorice retired with apparent satisfaction husband she heard her mother say a few minutes later either some son of a philistine has told that child something or she has overheard our words what makes thee think so abraham's tone was one of great distress if not terror she has been asking questions of genta but she has got hold of the wrong pattern she fancies anegay was her sister does she replied abraham in a tone of sorrowful tenderness there's less harm in her thinking that than if she knew the truth genta showed great good sense she professed to know nothing at all about it dissimulation again licorice came with a heavy sigh from abraham hold thy tongue where should we be without it abraham made no answer but early on the following morning he summoned belasez to the little porch chamber and she went with her heart beating as she suspected the catechism was now to be gone through but poor abraham was the more timid of the two he was so evidently unwilling to speak and so regretfully tender that belasez's heart warmed and she lost all her shyness of course she told him more than she otherwise would have done belasez denied the existence of any christian lover or indeed of any lover at all with such clear honest eyes that abraham could not but believe her but he urged had she ever seen any man in the castle to speak to him yes said belasez frankly not while the lady was there but during her absence sir richard de clare had been three times in the bower and the priests had given lessons to the damsels in the ante chamber did any of these ever speak to thee sir richard never spoke to me but twice further than to say good morrow' once he admired a pattern i was working and once he asked me when i came in from the leads if it were raining didst thou care for him my daughter not in the least said belasez nor he for me i rather think damsel margaret was his attraction her father seemed satisfied on that point and these priests how many were there belasez told him master aristoteles the physician and father nicholas and father warner chaplains of my lord the earl and the chaplain of the lady she hardly knew what instinct made her unwilling to utter father bruno's name and most unintentionally she blushed oh said abraham to himself the lady's chaplain is the dangerous person are they old men my child none of them is either very old or very young father describe them to me i pray thee master aristoteles i cannot describe for i have only heard his voice father nicholas is about fifty i should think a kindly sort of man but immersed in his books and caring for little beside father warner is not pleasant all the girls were very much afraid of him and the chaplain of the lady he is forty or more i should suppose tall and slender eyes and hair dark a very pleasant man to speak with i am afraid so was abraham's internal comment and his name daughter father bruno what abraham had risen with outspread hands as though he would fain push away some unwelcome and horrible thing belasez repeated the name bruno de malpas i never heard of any name but bruno has he talked with thee abraham's whole manner showed agitation much upon what subjects belasez would gladly have avoided that question different subjects she said evasively tell me what he said when he first met thee he seemed much distressed i knew not at what and murmured that my face painfully reminded him of somebody ah belasez didst thou know whom not till i came home she said in a low tone ay de mi what hast thou heard since thy coming home belasez resolved to speak the truth she had been struck by her father's hints that some terrible mischief had come from not speaking it and she thought that perhaps open confession on her part might lead to confidence on his i overheard you and my mother talking at night she said i gathered that the somebody whom i was like was my sister and that her name was anegay and i thought she had either become a christian or had wedded a christian father may i know my little belasez he said with deep feeling thou knowest all but the one thing thou must not know there was one called anegay but she was not thy sister let the rest be silence to thee it seemed to cost abraham immense pain to say even so much as this he sat quiet for a moment his face working pitifully little belasez he said again didst thou like that man i think i loved him was her soft answer abraham's gesture which she thought indicated despair and anguish roused her to explain father she said hastily i do not mean anything wrong or foolish i loved father bruno with a deep reverential love such as i give you such as thou givest me o belasez belasez thought he was hurt by her comparison of her love for him to that of her love for a mere stranger father how shall i explain i meant my poor child i need no explanation thou hast been more righteous than we belasez the truth is hidden from thee because thou art too near it to behold it my poor poor child and suddenly rising abraham lifted up his arms in the attitude of prayer o thou that doest wonders thou hast made the wrath of man to praise thee how unsearchable are thy judgments and thy ways past finding out then he laid his hand upon belasez's head it is adonai he said let him do what seemeth him good he said unto shimei curse david methinks he hath said to thee love bruno the holy one forbid that i should grudge the love of of our child to the desolate heart which we made desolate adonai knows and he only whether we did good or bad pray to him my belasez to forgive that one among us who truly needs his forgiveness and abraham hurried from the room as if he were afraid to trust himself lest if he stayed he should say something which he might afterwards regret bitterly note priest all jews named cohen are sons of aaron chapter nine paying the bill 'tis hard when young heart singing songs of to morrow is suddenly met by the old hag sorrow leigh hunt father bruno was walking slowly with his hands one in the other behind him about a mile from bury castle it was a lovely morning in april and though alone he had no fear of highwaymen for he would have been a bold sinner indeed who in meddled with a priest for his harm an absent minded man was father bruno at all times when he was free to indulge in meditation for to him the future was all dark and the past a troubled sea and memory sat in his heart wailing where hope should be he was given to murmuring his thoughts half aloud when in solitude and he was doing it now they oscillated from one to the other of two subjects closely associated in his mind one was belasez the other was a memory of his sorrowful past a fair girl face the likeness to which had struck him so distressingly in hers and which would never fade from his memory till god's love set her at his side again what will become of the maiden he whispered to himself so like so like just what my beatrice might have been if nay thou art wise o lord it is i who am blind and ignorant ay and just the same age she must be the infant of whom licorice spoke she was then in the cradle i remember she said that if beatrice had lived they might have been like twin sisters well well ay and it is well for anegay has found her in heaven safe from sin and sorrow from tempest and temptation with christ for evermore o mea spes mea o syon aurea ut clarior oro' and what does it matter for me during these few and evil days that are left of this lower life true the wilderness is painful but it will be over soon true my spirit is worn and weary but the rest of the new jerusalem will soon restore me true i am weak poor blind ignorant lonely sorrowful but my lord is strength wealth light wisdom love and joyfulness never canst thou be loveless bruno de malpas while the deathless love of christ endureth never canst thou be lonely and forlorn whilst thou hast his company who is the sunlight of heaven perhaps it would not have been good for me had my beloved stayed with me nay since he saw it good it can be no perhaps but a certainty i suppose i should have valued him less had my jewel casket remained full ay thou hast done well my lord pardon thy servant if at times the journey grows very weary to his weak human feet and he longs for a draught of the sweet waters of earthly love which thou hast permitted to dry up grant him fresh draughts of that living water whereof he that drinketh shall thirst no more hold thou me up and i shall be safe was i right in refusing to baptise the maiden verily it would have been rich revenge on licorice i had no right as i told her to suffer the innocence of her chrism to be soiled with the evil passions which were sin in me yet had i any right to deny her the grace of holy baptism because i was not free from evil passions oh how hard it is to find the straight road poor little maiden what will become of her now i fear the impressions that have been made on her will soon be stifled in the poisonous atmosphere into which she is gone and i cannot bear to think of her as a lost soul with that face so like my anegay and that voice now shame upon thee bruno de malpas is belasez more to thee than to him that died for her canst thou not trust him who giveth unto his sheep eternal life not to allow this white lamb to be plucked out of his hand o lord increase my faith for it is very low i am one of the very weakest of thy disciples yet i am thine lord thou knowest all things thou knowest that i love thee during the time occupied by these reflections bruno had been instinctively approaching the castle and he looked up suddenly as he was conscious of a clang of arms and a confused medley of voices not in very peaceful tones breaking in upon his meditations he now perceived that the drawbridge was thronged with armed men the portcullis drawn up and the courtyard beyond full of soldiers in mail what is the matter friend william asked bruno of the porter at the outer gate nay the saints wot good father not i but of this am i very sure that some mischance is come to my lord you were a wise man if you kept away not so was bruno's answer as he passed on it is the hireling not the shepherd that fleeth from the wolf and leaveth the sheep to be scattered he made his way easily into the hall for no one thought of staying a priest the lower end was thronged with soldiers on the dais stood sir piers de rievaulx and half a dozen more confronting earl hubert who wore an expression of baffled amazement just behind him stood the countess evidently possessed by fear and anguish sir john de burgh with his hand upon his sword doucebelle very white and frightened and furthest in the background sir richard de clare who clasped in his arms the fainting form of margaret and bent his head over her with a look of agonised tenderness words are fine things my lord of kent was the first sentence distinguishable to father bruno and the spokesman was sir piers but i beg you to remember that it is of no earthly use talking to me in this strain if you can succeed in convincing my lord the king that you had no hand in this business well and sir piers' shoulders went up towards his ears in a manner which indicated that result to be far from what he expected but those two young fools don't attempt to deny it and their faces would give them the lie if they did as for my lady the countess sprang forward and threw herself on her knees clinging to the arm of her husband while she passionately addressed herself to both sir piers on my life and honour my lord knew nothing of this it was done while he was away with the lord king at merton it was my doing my lord mine and it is true what sir piers tells you my daughter has gone too far with sir richard de clare ever to be married to another note sir piers stood listening with a rather amused set of the lips as if he thought the scene very effective to him the human agony before his eyes was no more than a play enacted for his entertainment of course it was in the way of business but sir piers' principle was to get as much diversion out of his business as he could very good indeed lady said that worthy minister your confession may spare you some annoyance but as to your lord it will do nothing you hardly expect us to swallow this pretty little fiction i suppose if you do i beg you will undeceive yourself officers do your duty the officers had evidently received previous instructions for they at once laid their hands on the shoulders of earl hubert and sir richard the half insensible margaret was roused into life by the attempt to take her bridegroom from her with a cry that might have touched any heart but that of sir piers de rievaulx she flung her arms around him and held him close apparently the officers were touched for they stopped and looked at their chief for further orders coward loons as ye are are ye frightened of a girl said sir piers with a harsh laugh and he came forward himself lady margaret there is no need to injure you unless you choose please yourself i am going to arrest this young knight but for one second sir piers waited himself those around mistook it for that knightly courtesy of which there was none in him they did not know that suddenly to him out of margaret's pleading eyes looked the eyes of the dead sister serena de rievaulx and it seemed to him as though soft child fingers held him off for an instant he had never loved any mortal thing but that dead child with one passionate pleading gaze at sir piers margaret laid her head on the breast of sir richard and sobbed as though her heart were breaking my lord my lord came painfully mixed with long drawn sobs from the lips of the young bride my own own richard and only two months since we were married have you the heart to part us she cried suddenly turning to sir piers did you never love any one never madam for once in his life sir piers spoke truth never except serena and not much then brute and with this calumnious epithet for brutes can love dearly margaret resumed her former attitude lady margaret i must trouble you said sir piers in tones of hardness veneered with civility my darling you must let me go interposed the young earl of gloucester who seemed scarcely less miserable than his bride magot my child we may not stay justice said the distressed tones of her father yet she held tight until sir piers tore her away look to the damsel he condescended to say with a glance at doucebelle and bruno oh ha where is the priest that blessed this wedding i must have him there was no priest sobbed the countess lifting her head from her husband's arm where she had let it sink it was per verba depresenti that we will see was the cool response of sir piers take all the priests sir drew now my lady fare thee well my jewel said earl hubert kissing the brow of the countess poor little magot farewell too sir hubert my lord forgive me i meant no ill forgive thee said the earl with a smile and again kissing his wife's brow i could not do otherwise my margaret now sir piers we are your prisoners these little amenities being disposed of sneered sir piers i suppose women must cry over something kind i should think to give them something to cry about march out the prisoners father nicholas had been discovered in his study engaged in the deepest meditation on a grammatical crux and had received the news of his arrest with a blank horror and amazement very laughable in the eyes of sir piers master aristoteles was pounding rhubarb with his sleeves turned up and required some convincing that he was not wanted professionally father warner was no where to be found the three priests were spared fetters in consideration of their sacred character both the earls were heavily ironed and so the armed band with their prisoners marched away from the castle the feelings of the prisoners were diverse father nicholas was simply astonished beyond any power of words to convey master aristoteles was convinced that the recent physical disturbances in the atmosphere were more than enough to account for the whole affair earl hubert felt sure that his old enemy the bishop of winchester was at the bottom of it earl richard was disposed to think the same father bruno alone looked upwards and saw god but assuredly no one of them saw the moving cause in that tall stern silent jewish youth and the last idea that ever entered the mind of richard de clare was to associate this great grief of his life with the boyish trick he had played on delecresse two years before for the great grief of richard's life this sorrow was through the six and twenty years which remained of his mortal span he never forgot it and he never forgave it it proved the easiest thing in the world to convince king henry that he had not intended richard to marry margaret had his dearly beloved uncle the bishop of valentia held up before him a black cloth and said this is white his majesty would merely have wondered what could be the matter with his eyes the next point was to persuade that royal and most deceivable individual that he had entertained an earnest desire to see richard married to a princess of savoy a cousin of the queen this also was not difficult the third lesson instilled into him was that richard having thought proper to render this impossible by choosing for himself he king henry was a cruelly injured and unpardonably insulted man his majesty swallowed them all as glibly as possible the metal being thus fused to the proper state the prisoners were brought before their affronted sovereign in person they were tried in inverse order according to importance father bruno could prove without much difficulty that the obnoxious marriage had taken place on the showing of the prosecution itself before he had entered the household his penalty was the light one of discharge from the countess's service that he deserved no penalty at all was not taken into consideration the crown could not so far err as to bring a charge against an entirely innocent man the verdict therefore in father bruno's case resembled that of the famous jury who returned as theirs not guilty but we hope he won't do it again master aristoteles was next placed in the dock and had the honour of amusing the court his asseverations of innocent ignorance were so mixed up with dissertations on the virtues of savin and betony and lamenting references to the last eclipse which might have warned him of what was coming on him that the court condescended to relax into a smile and let the simple man go with the light sentence of six months' imprisonment at a subsequent period in his life master aristoteles was wont to say that this sentence was the best thing that ever happened to him since the enforced meditation and idleness had enabled him to think out his grand discovery that the dust which gathered on beams of chestnut wood was an infallible specific for fever he had since treated three fever patients in this manner and not one of them had died whether the patients would have recovered without the dust and with being so much let alone master aristoteles did not concern himself next came father nicholas a light sentence also sufficed for him not on account of his innocence but because his friend the abbot of ham was a friend of the bishop of winchester earl hubert of kent was then tried the animus of his accusers was plainly shown for they brought up again all the old hackneyed charges on account of which he had been pardoned years before for some of them more than once the affront offered to the king by the earl's marriage with margaret of scotland the fact that she and his third wife were within the forbidden degrees and that no dispensation had been obtained these were renewed with all the other disproved and spiteful accusations of old time but the head and front of the offending in this instance was of course the marriage of his daughter it did not make much difference that hubert calmly swore that he had never known of the marriage either before or after except what he had learned from the simple statement of the countess his wife to the effect that it had been contracted at bury saint edmund's during his absence at merton the fervent intercession of hubert's friends moved by the passionate entreaties of the countess did not make much difference either but what did make a good deal was that the earl who knew his royal master offered a heavy golden bribe for pardon of the crime he had not committed king henry thereupon condescended to announce that in consideration of the effect produced upon his compassionate heart by the piteous intercession of the prisoner's friends his fury should abate and he the crowns would take earl hubert therefore received a most gracious pardon and was permitted to return minus the money to the bosom of his distracted family but the heaviest vengeance fell on the young head of richard de clare and through him on the fair girl with the cedar hair whose worst crime was that she had loved him it was not vengeance that could be weighed like hubert's coins or told on the clock like the imprisonment of his physician it was counted out throb by throb in the agony of two human hearts one fiercely stabbed and artificially healed and the other left to bleed to death like a wounded doe the king's first step was to procure a solemn papal sentence of divorce between richard and margaret their consent of course was neither asked nor thought needful his majesty's advisers allowed him and richard a little rest then before they thought it necessary to do any thing more the result of the trial was to leave father bruno homeless he returned to his monastery at lincoln and sought the leave of his superior to be transferred to the convent of the order at norwich his heart still yearned over belasez with a tenderness which was half of heaven and half of earth yet he knew that in all probability he would never find it possible to cross her path well let him do what he could and leave the rest with god if he meant them to meet meet they must though satan and all his angels combined to bar the way wife may thy beard be shaven i was just dropping off well it had taken abraham a long while to summon up his courage to make what he felt would be to licorice an unwelcome communication he was rather dismayed to find it so badly received at the first step do go on thou weariest of old jackdaws i'm half asleep i have spoken to the child licorice as if thou couldst not have said that half an hour ago well how do matters stand there is one person in particular whom she is sorry to leave of course there is i saw that as plain as the barber's pole across the street didn't i tell thee so is it some young christian gallant and who is he blessed be the memory of abraham our father why did we ever let that girl go to bury it is not as thou art fearing wife but it is worse worse licorice seemed wide awake enough now why what could there be worse unless she had married a christian or had abjured her faith wife this is worse she has seen him de malpas the name was almost hissed from the lips of licorice the same it was to be licorice adonai knows why but it is evident they were fated to meet what did the viper tell her i do not gather that he told her any thing except that she brought a face to his memory that he had known of old she fancies and so of course does he that it was her sister a low peculiar laugh from her mother made belasez's blood curdle as she lay listening there seemed so much more of the fiend in it than the angel what an ass he must be never to guess the truth she wants to know the truth wife she asked me if she might not thou let it alone i'll cook up a nice little story that will set her mind at rest o licorice more deception yet deception why wouldst thou tell her the truth just go to her now and wake her and let her know that she is belasez strained her ears to their utmost but the words which followed could not be heard from her mother's dropped tones what would follow eh demanded licorice raising her voice again adonai knows said abraham sadly but i suppose we could not keep her long i should think not thou canst go and tell the mayor and see what he and his catch polls will say wouldn't there be a pretty ferment old man it would cost thee thy life and mine also give over talking about lies as if thou wert one of the cherubim i'll let thee know when i think there's any danger of it and show a little spice of prudence like a craftsman of middle earth as thou art more deception of course there is more deception a man had better keep off a slide to begin with it he does not want to be carried down it the child fancies licorice that anegay was her sister and that she either became a christian or married one she has no idea of any thing more who told her anegay's name i cannot imagine it might be bruno we have always been so careful to keep it from her hearing there was a pause didst thou find the christian dog had tampered with her faith i don't know licorice i could not get that out of her then he has no doubt i'll get it out of her belasez trembled at the threat any thing more old man if not i'll go to sleep again licorice said abraham in a low voice the child said she loved him as she loves me may he be buried in a dunghill what witchcraft has he used to them both it touched me so wife i could hardly speak to her she did not know why abraham do give over thy sentimental stuff nothing ever touches me i doubt if it do was abraham's dry answer such a rabbit as thou art as frightened as a hare and as soft as a bag of duck's down i'm going to sleep and belasez heard no more she woke however the next morning with that uncomfortable conviction of something disagreeable about to happen with which all human beings are more or less familiar it gradually dawned upon her that licorice was going to get it out of her and was likewise about to devise a false tale for her especial benefit she had not heard two sentences which passed between her parents before she woke or she might have been still more on her guard licorice thou must take care what thou sayest to that child i told her that anegay was not her sister just what might have been expected of thee my paragon of wisdom well never mind i'll tell her she was her aunt that will do as well when the daily cleaning dusting cooking and baking were duly completed licorice made belasez's heart flutter by a command to attend her in the little porch chamber belasez she began in tones so amiable that belasez would instantly have suspected a trap had she overheard nothing for licorice's character was well known to her belasez i hear from thy father that thou hast heard some foolish gossip touching one anegay that was a kinswoman of thine and thou art desirous of knowing the truth thou shalt know it now indeed there was no reason to hide it from thee further than this that the tale being a painful one thy father and i have not cared to talk about it this anegay was the sister of abraham thy father and therefore thine aunt belasez who had been imagining that anegay might have been her father's sister at once mentally decided that she was not she had noticed that abraham's references to the dead girl were made with far more indication of love and regret than those of licorice and she had fancied that this might be due to the existence of relationship on his part and not on hers she now concluded that it was simply a question of character but who anegay was was a point left as much in the dark as ever she was a great friend of mine daughter and i loved her very dearly said licorice applying one hand to her perfectly dry eyes a proceeding which imparted to belasez who knew that such terms from her were generally to be interpreted by the rule of contrary a strong impression that she had hated her and at that time thy father dwelt at lincoln it was before we were married thou knowest and anegay being an only and motherless daughter used to spend much of her time with me i cannot quite tell thee how for indeed it was a puzzle to myself but anegay became acquainted with a christian maiden whose name was beatrice a peculiar twinkle in the eyes of licorice caused belasez to feel especially doubtful of the truth of this part of the story and who had a brother pursued licorice a young christian squire but as thou shalt hear a most wicked and artful man belasez at once set down the unknown squire as a model of all the cardinal virtues thou art well aware belasez my child that these idolaters practise the black art and are versed in spells which they can cast over all unfortunate persons who are so luckless as to come within their influence there had been a time when belasez believed this and many more charges brought against the christians just as they in their turn believed similar calumnies against the jews but the months spent at bury castle unconsciously to herself till it was done had shaken and uprooted many prejudices leaving her with the simple conviction that jews and christians were all fallible human beings very much of the same stamp some better than others but good and bad to be found in both camps licorice however was by no means the person to whom she chose to impart such impressions there had never been any confidence or communion of spirit between them in fact they were cast in such different moulds that it was hardly possible there should be any licorice was a sweeping and cooking machine whose intellect was wholly uncultivated and whose imagination all ran into cunning and deceit belasez was an article of much finer quality both mentally and morally the only person in her own family with whom she could exchange thought or feeling was abraham and he was not her equal though he came the nearest to it it had often distressed belasez that her mother and she seemed to have so little in common many times she had tried hard to scold herself into more love for licorice and had found the process a sheer impossibility she had now given it up with a sorrowful recognition that it was not to be done but a firm conviction that it was her own fault and that she ought to be very penitent for such hardness of heart it seems to me continued licorice that this bad young man whose name was de malpas must have cast a spell on our poor unhappy anegay for how else could a daughter of israel come to love so vile an insect as one of the accursed goyim for she did love him belasez and a bitter grief and disgrace it was to all her friends of course i need not say that the idea of a marriage between them was an odious impossibility the only resource was to take anegay away from lincoln where she would learn to forget all about the creeping creatures and return to her duty as a servant of the living and eternal one it was at that time that i and thy father were wedded and we then came to live in norwich bringing anegay with us licorice paused as if her tale were finished it sounded specious but how much of it was true and did she forget him mother of course she did belasez it was her duty belasez privately thought that people did not always do their duty and that such a duty as this would be extremely hard to do was she ever married mother if you please she married a young jew my dear named aaron the son of leo and died soon after the birth of her first child said licorice glibly and was she really happy mother happy of course she was she had no business to be any thing else belasez was silent but not in the least convinced thou seest now my belasez why i was so much afraid of thy visits to bury i well know thou art a discreet maiden and entirely to be trusted so far as thine ability goes but what can such qualities avail thee against magic i have heard of a grand aunt of mine whom a christian by this means glued to the settle and for three years she could not rise from it until the wicked spell was dissolved i do not mistrust thee good daughter i do but warn thee and licorice rose with a manner which indicated the termination of the interview apparently thinking it better to reserve the religious question for another time may i ask one other question mother what became of the maiden beatrice and her brother licorice's eyes twinkled again belasez listened for the answer on the principle of the irishman who looked at the guide post to see where the road did not lead the squire was killed fighting the saracens i believe i do not know what became of the maiden licorice disappeared the squire was not killed i am sure said belasez to herself it is father bruno left alone belasez reviewed her very doubtful information anegay was not her sister and probably not her aunt that she had loved bruno was sure to be true and that she had been forcibly separated from him was only too likely but her subsequent marriage to aaron and the very existence of beatrice were in belasez's eyes purely fictitious details introduced to make the events dovetail nicely why she doubted the latter point she could hardly have told it was really due to that gleam in her mother's eyes which she invariably put on when she was launching out rather more boldly than usual into the sea of fiction yet there seemed no reason for the invention of beatrice if she were not a real person but was the story which belasez had heard sufficient to explain all the allusions which she had overheard she went over them one by one as they recurred to her memory and decided that it was she had heard nothing from her parents nothing from bruno which contradicted it in the least why then this uncomfortable instinctive feeling that something was left behind which had not been told her belasez was lying awake in bed when she reached that point and a moment after she sprang to a sitting posture yes there was something behind what had she heard that if it were known would cost abraham and licorice their lives what had she heard which explained those mysterious allusions to herself as personally concerned in the story why would she leave them instantly if she knew all what was that one point which abraham had distinctly told her she must not know which licorice expressed such anxiety that she should not even guess there was not much sleep for belasez that night note the confession of the countess is historical she took the whole blame upon herself chapter ten truth told at last guardami ben' ben' son' ben' son' beatrice dante well now this is provoking what is the matter wife and abraham looked up from a bale of silk which he was packing why here has genta been and taken the fever and there is not a soul but me to go and nurse her there is esterote her brother's wife there isn't esterote has her baby to look to dost thou expect her to carry infection to him what is to be done demanded abraham blankly could not pucella be had or old cuntessa old cuntessa is engaged as nurse for rosia the wife of bonamy the rich usurer and pucella would be no good she's as frightened of the fever as a chicken and she has never had it well thou hast had it i oh i'm not frightened a bit not of that i am tremendously afraid of thee of me i shall not hinder thee licorice i do not think it likely thou wouldst take it ay de mi canst thou not understand i might as well leave a thief to take care of my gold carcanet as leave thee alone with belasez i shall come back to find the child gone off with some vile dog of a christian and thee tearing thy garments like a blind blundering bat as thou art bats don't tear their garments wife they run their heads upon every stone they come across and so dost thou wife dost thou not think we might speak out honestly like true men and trust the all merciful with the child's future well if ever i did see a lame wall eyed broken kneed old pack ass he was called abraham the son of ursel and licorice stood with uplifted hands gazing on her lord and master in an attitude of pitying astonishment i do believe thou moon cast shadow of a man if bruno de malpas were to walk in and ask for her thou wouldst just say here she is o my lord do what thou wilt with thy slave' i think licorice it would break my heart but we have let him break his for eighteen years and if it came to breaking hers what wicked thing did he do wife that we should have used him thus what canst thou ask me did he not presume to lay unclean hands on a daughter of israel of whom saith the holy one ye shall not give her unto the heathen' i do not think de malpas was a heathen hast thou been to the creeping thing up yonder and begged to be baptised to morrow this was a complimentary allusion to that right reverend person the bishop of norwich nay licorice i am as true to the faith as thou ay de mi i must have put on my gown wrong side out to make thee say so and licorice pretended to make a close examination of her skirt as if to discover whether this was the case licorice is it not written cursed be their wrath for it was cruel' thine was wife whatever has come to thy conscience it quietly went to sleep for eighteen years and now all at once it comes alive and awake abraham winced as though he felt the taunt true better late than never' wife that is a christian saying may be it is true well and licorice's hands were thrust out from her as if she were casting off drops of water i've done my best i shall let it alone now genta must be nursed and i cannot bring infection home and after all the girl is thine not mine thou must take thine own way but i shall bid her good bye for ever for i have no hope of seeing her again abraham made no answer unless his troubled eyes and quivering lips did so for him but the night closed in upon a very quiet chamber owing to the absence of licorice delecresse sat studying with a book open before him belasez was busied with embroidery abraham was idle so far as his hands were concerned but any one who had studied him for a minute would have seen that his thoughts were very active and by no means pleasant ten calm days passed over and nothing happened they heard through neighbours that genta was going through all the phases of a tedious illness and that licorice was a most attentive and valuable nurse at the end of those ten days delecresse came in with an order for some of the exquisite broidery which only belasez could execute it was wanted for the rich usurer's wife rosia and she wished belasez to come to her with specimens of various patterns so that she might select the one she preferred a walk through the city was an agreeable and unusual break in the monotony of existence and rosia's house was quite at the other end of the jews' quarter belasez prepared to go out with much alacrity her father escorted her himself leaving delecresse to mind the shop the embroidery was exhibited the pattern chosen and they were nearly half way at home when they were overtaken by a sudden hailstorm and took refuge in the lych gate of a church it was growing dusk and they had not perceived the presence of a third person like themselves a refugee from the storm this is heavy said abraham as the hailstones came pouring and dancing down i am afraid we shall not get home till late was the response of his daughter no not till late said abraham absently belasez came softly from behind her she turned round quickly her hands held out in greeting her eyes sparkling delight written on every feature of her face father bruno i never knew you were in norwich i have not been here long my child i wondered if we should ever meet ah little idea had belasez how that meeting had been imagined longed for prayed for through all those weary weeks she glanced at her father suddenly remembering that her warm welcome to the christian priest was not likely to be much approved by him bruno's eyes followed hers abraham he said in tones which sounded like a mixture of friendship and deprecation abraham had bent down as though he were cowering from an expected blow now he lifted himself up and held out his hand bruno de malpas thou art welcome if god hath sent thee god sends all events answered the priest accepting the offered hand ay i am trying to learn that replied abraham in a voice of great pain for at times he sends that which breaks the heart that he may heal it my father the title from bruno's lips surprised and puzzled belasez it may be so said abraham in a rather hopeless tone it is adonai let him do what seemeth him good' so thou hast made friends with my belasez i did not know she was thine when i made friends with her said bruno with that quiet smile of his which had always seemed to belasez at once so sweet and so sad did not know' no i suppose not ah yes yes did not know' does this child know my history was bruno's next question she knows said abraham in a troubled voice nearly as much as thou knowest then she knows all nay she knows nothing you speak in riddles my father my son i am about to do that which will break my heart nay god is about to do it let me put it thus or i shall not know how to bear it i have no wish nor intention to trouble you my father said bruno hastily if i might now and then see this child to tell truth it would be a great pleasure and solace to me for i have learned to love her just the years of my beatrice just what beatrice might have grown to be yet if i speak i must speak honestly give me leave to see belasez only on the understanding that i may speak to her of christ she is dear as any thing in this dreary world but he is dearer than the world and all that is in it if i may not do this let me say farewell and see her no more thou hast spoken to her of the nazarene asked abraham in a low tone i have was bruno's frank reply thou hast taught her the christian faith so far as i could do it belasez stood trembling yet abraham did not seem angry thou hast baptised her perhaps no that i have not not why not she was fit for it in my eyes and may i say it belasez she was willing but my hands were not clean enough i felt that i could not repress a sensation of triumphing over licorice if i baptised her daughter may the lord forgive me if i erred but i did not dare to do it o my son my son broke from abraham thou hast been more righteous than i come home with me and tell the story to belasez thyself and then adonai thou knowest help me to do thy will bruno was evidently much astonished and not a little perplexed at abraham's speech but he followed him quietly the storm was over now and they gained home and the chamber over the porch without coming in contact with delecresse abraham left bruno there while he desired belasez to take off her wet things and rejoin them meantime he changed his coat and carried up wine and cake to his guest but when belasez reappeared abraham drew the bolt and closed the inner baize door which shut out all sound now bruno de malpas he said tell thy story and sitting down at the table he laid his arms on it and hid his face upon it but my father dost thou wish her to hear it the blessed one does i believe she has heard as yet but a garbled version i wish what he wishes amen ejaculated bruno and he turned to belasez she on her part felt too much astonished for words if any thing could surprise her more than that bruno should be actually invited to tell the tapued story it was the calm way in which abraham received the intimation that she had all but professed christianity mortal anger and scathing contempt she could have understood and expected but this was utterly beyond her belasez said bruno years ago before thou wert born thy father had another daughter and her name was anegay father you said anegay was not my sister came in surprised accents from belasez but a choking sob was the only answer from abraham she was not the daughter of thy mother belasez but of thy father's first wife whose name was fiona perhaps he meant that she was twenty years older than thou and i need not make my tale long we met belasez and we loved each other i told her of christ and she became a christian and received holy baptism at my hands by that time thy father had wedded thy mother as thou knowest she is a staunch jewess and though she did not by any means discover all she did find that anegay had christian friends and forbade her to see them again time went on and we could scarcely ever meet and anegay was not very happy at length one night a ring was brought to me which was her usual token praying me to meet her quickly at the house of isabel de fulshaw where we had usually met before i went and found her weeping as though her heart would break she told me that licorice had been not very gentle with her and had threatened to turn her out of the house the next morning unless she would trample on the cross as a sign that she abjured all her christian friends and christ that she said she could not do i could tread on the piece of wood' she said and that would be nothing but my mother means it for a sign of abjuring christ' and she earnestly implored me to get her into some nunnery where she might be safe perhaps i ought to have done that but i offered her another choice of safety and the next morning as soon as the canonical hours had dawned anegay was my wife abraham spoke here but without lifting his head i was on a journey belasez he said i never persecuted my darling never no belasez echoed bruno he never did i believe he was bitterly grieved at her becoming a christian but he had no hand in her sufferings at that time a year or more went on and the lord gave us a baby daughter i baptised her by the name of beatrice which was also the name that her mother had received in baptism she was nearly a month old when a message came to me from the bishop requiring me to come to him which involved a journey there and back of about a week i went and i returned to find my home desolate wife child even the maid servant all were gone an old woman who dwelt in my parish was in the house but she could tell me nothing save that a message had come to her from frethesind the maid begging her to come and take charge of the house until my return but not giving a word of explanation i could think of no place to which my wife would be likely to go unless her mother had been there and had either forced or over persuaded her to return with her i hurried to norwich with as much speed as possible to my surprise licorice received me with apparent kindliness and inquired after anegay as though no quarrel had ever existed belasez thought with momentary amusement that bruno was not so well acquainted with licorice as herself i asked in great distress if anegay were not with her licorice assured me she knew nothing of her then you did not fetch her away' said i how could i' she answered i have a baby in the cradle only five weeks old' well i could not tell what to think her words and looks were those of truth she was apparently as kind as possible she showed me her baby thyself belasez and encouraged me to play with delecresse who was then a lively child of three years i came away baffled yet unsatisfied i should have been better pleased had i seen thy father but he i was told was again absent on one of his business journeys true was the one word interpolated by abraham i went to the house of my friend walcheline de fulshaw he was an apothecary i told my story to him and to isabel his wife desiring their counsel as to the means whereby i should get at the truth walcheline seemed perplexed but isabel said father i think i see how to find out the truth dost thou not remember' she said turning to her husband the maiden rosia daughter of aaron whom thou didst heal of her sickness a year past let me inquire of her these jews all know each other the child is bright and shrewd and i am sure she would do what she could out of gratitude to thee' walcheline gave consent at once and a messenger was sent to the house of aaron requesting that his daughter would visit isabel de fulshaw who had need of her the girl came quickly and very intelligent she proved she was about twelve years of age and was manifestly loving and desirous to oblige isabel who had as i heard afterwards shown her great kindness she said she knew abraham thy father well and licorice and anegay had anegay been there of late' isabel asked her certainly' answered rosia was she there now' the child hesitated but the truth came out when isabel pressed her licorice had been absent from home for several weeks and when she returned anegay was with her and four men were also in her company anegay had been very ill very very ill indeed said the child but after long hesitation she was better now what about the baby' asked isabel rosia looked surprised she had heard of none except licorice's own thee belasez had she spoken with anegay the girl shook her head had she seen her yes how was it that she had seen her but not spoken with her the child replied she was too ill to speak she knew no one she did not know me belasez said abraham sorrowfully lifting his white troubled face i came home to find her there to my great surprise but she did not know me she took me for some other man i cannot tell whom and she kept begging me pitifully to tell bruno to let bruno know the moment he should come home he would never never leave her in prison he would be sure to rescue her i asked licorice if anegay had come of her own will for i was very much afraid lest some force had been used to bring her but she assured me that my daughter had returned of her own free will only a little reluctantly lest her husband should not approve it there had been no force whatever only a little gentle persuasion and fool that i was i believed it at the time it was not until all was over that i heard the real truth what good could come of telling bruno then it would be simply to make him miserable to no purpose and yet go on my son and abraham returned to his former position then continued bruno isabel pressed the child rosia harder she told her that she felt certain she knew where anegay was and she must tell it to her at last the child burst into tears oh don't ask me' she said for i did love her so much i cannot believe what licorice says that she is gone to satan because she believed in the nazarene i am sure she went to god' but is she dead rosia' cried isabel and the child said she is dead she died yesterday morning' bruno paused apparently to recover his composure i went back at once to this house i saw that licorice instantly read in my face that i had heard the truth and she tried to brazen it out no longer yes it was true she said in answer to my passionate charges anegay was dead i should see her if i would to convince me so i passed into an inner chamber and there i found her lying my own fair darling white and still with the lips sealed for ever which could have told so much bruno nearly broke down and he had to wait for a minute before he could proceed i stood up from my dead and i demanded of licorice why she had done this cruel thing and she said why how little does a christian know the heart of a jew canst thou not guess that in our eyes it is a degradation for a daughter of israel to be looked on by such as you gentiles that for one of you so much as to touch her hand is pollution that only blood can wipe away why i wanted to revenge myself on thee and if it were not too late to save the child's soul thou canst hang me now if thou wilt i have had my revenge' and i said licorice my faith teaches me that revenge must be left to god and that only forgiveness is for the lips of men i a sinner as thou art must have nothing to do with vengeance but o licorice by all that thou deemest dear and holy by the love that thou bearest to that babe of thine in the cradle i conjure thee to tell me what has become of my child is she yet living' she paused a while then she said in a low voice no bruno the journey was too much in such a season for so young an infant she died the day after we arrived here perhaps' said licorice thou wilt not believe me but i am sorry that the child is dead i meant to bring her up a strict jewess and to wed her to some jew that would have been sweet to me she and my belasez would have grown together like twin sisters for they were almost exactly of an age' i could not refuse credence for her look and tone were those of truth it explained too if beatrice had died so soon after arrival why the child rosia had not heard of her so then i knew belasez that the life to which my god called me thenceforward was to be a lonely walk with him sweetened by no human love any more only by the dear hope that heaven would hold us all and that when we met in the golden city we should part no more tears were dimming belasez's eyes bruno turned to abraham now my father i have done thy will but suffer me to say that it is no slight perplexity to me why thou hast thought it meet that this sorrowful story should be told to the child of her that did the wrong abraham made no answer but to rise from the position in which he had been sitting all the time and to walk straight to the window he seemed unwilling to speak and his companions looked at him in doubtful surprise they had to wait however till he turned from the window and came and stood before bruno son he said what saith thy faith to this question when a man hath taken the wrong road and hath wandered far away from right from truth and god is it ever too late while life lasts for him to turn and come back never was bruno's answer and is it under any circumstances lawful for a man to lie unto his neighbour bruno like many another was better than his system and at that time the church herself had not reached those depths of legalised iniquity wherein she afterwards plunged so that he had no hesitation in repeating never then hear the truth bruno de malpas and if it well nigh break an old man's heart to tell it it is better that i should suffer and die for god's sake than that i should live for mine on one point licorice deceived thee to the last and until now i even i have aided her in duping thee yet it is written he that confesseth and forsaketh his sin shall find mercy' may it not be too late for me assuredly not my father but what canst thou mean bruno thy child did not die the day after she came hither father thou art not going to tell me bruno's voice had in it a strange mixture of agony and hope son thy beatrice lives before either could speak further belasez had thrown herself on her knees and flung her arms around abraham o father if it be so speak quickly and end his agony for the sake of the righteous lord that loveth righteousness do do give father bruno back his child abraham disengaged himself from belasez's clinging arms with what seemed almost a shudder he took up his long robe and tore it from the skirt to the neck then with a voice almost choked with emotion he laid both hands as if in blessing on the head of the kneeling belasez beatrice de malpas he said thou art that child a low cry from bruno a more passionate exclamation from belasez and the father and daughter were clasped heart to heart chapter eleven what came of it content to fill religion's vacant place with hollow form and gesture and grimace cowper nay my son it is of no use i shall never forsake the faith of my fathers for this child if she can believe it well she is more thine than mine ay dios and perhaps there is this much change in me that i have come to think it just possible that it may not be idolatry to fancy the nazarene was the messiah how can i tell we know so little and adonai knows so much but the cowslip is easily transplanted the old oak will take no new rooting let the old oak alone and there are other things in thy faith my son a maiden whom i should deem it sin to worship images of stone before which no jew may bow down a thing you call the church which we cannot understand but which seems to bind you all hand and foot soul and body as a slave is bound by his master i cannot take up with those nor i said belasez in a low voice then do not was the quiet answer of bruno i shall never ask it of either of you but thou believest all these said abraham i believe jesus christ my lord the rest is all to me a very little matter i never pray with an image i need it not if another man think he does need it to his own conscience i leave it before god for mary mother and maid i honour her as you maybe honour your mother i do not worship her about other men i say nothing and as to the church why what is the church but a congregation of saved souls to whom christ is lawgiver and saviour her laws are his or if not then they have no right to be hers ah bruno said abraham rather sadly thy religion is not that of other christians it is better said belasez softly father my christianity is christ i concern not myself with other men except to save them so far as it pleases god to work by me well well may adonai forgive us all my son what dost thou mean to do with the child it is for thee to decide now my father i shall endeavour to obtain absolution from my vows and to become once more a parish priest so that my beatrice may dwell with me until then choose thou whether she shall remain with thee or go back to bury castle i am sure the lady would gladly receive her nay bruno do not ask me to choose if the child be here when licorice returns she will never dwell with thee i believe she would well nigh stab us both to the heart sooner than permit it and i fear she may come any day then she had better come with me to bury it is adonai' so be it but i shall see thee my father asked belasez addressing abraham trust me for that my belasez i can come to thee on my trade journeys so long as it pleases the holy one that i have strength to take them and after that he will provide my son wilt thou come for the child to morrow i will let thee out at the postern door for thou hadst better not meet delecresse and abraham drew back the bolt and opened the baize door father jacob they heard him instantly ejaculate in a very different tone from that of his last words what hast thou been about now demanded the shrill voice of licorice in the passage outside when folks are frightened at the sight of their lawful wives it is a sure sign they have been after some mischief is there any one in yon chamber except thyself ah belasez i am glad to see thee 'tis more than i expected but child thou shouldst have set the porridge on half an hour ago go down and look to it any body else come i had best see for myself and licorice pushed past her husband and walked into the room where bruno was standing he came forward to meet her with far more apparent calmness than abraham seemed to feel good even my mother he said courteously if i were thy mother i would hang myself from the first gable hissed licorice between her closed teeth i know thee bruno de malpas thou vile grandson of a locust nay locust is too good for thee they are clean beasts and thou art an unclean thou hare camel coney night hawk raven lobster earwig hog i spit on thee seven times and she did it i deliver thee over to satan thy master that thou canst not quietly said bruno i sweep thee out of my house and suiting the action to the word licorice caught up a broom which stood in the corner and proceeded to apply it with good will bruno retreated as was but natural he should licorice my dear wife i'll sweep thee out next cried licorice brandishing her broom in the very face of her lord and master i'll have no christians nor christian blood nor christian faith in my house as i am a living daughter of abraham get you all out hence ye loathsome creeping things which whosoever toucheth shall be unclean get ye out i say belasez bring me soap and water i'll not sleep till i've washed the floor i'd wash the air if i could your pardon mother but if you will have no christian blood in your house you must sweep me out answered belasez with a mixture of dignity and irrepressible amusement licorice turned round to abraham thou hast told her it was better she should know wife i'll chop thy head off if i hear thee say that again and dost thou mean to be a christian thou wicked girl i do mother and i mean to go with my father go then like to like and all the angels of satan go with thee and the broom came flying after belasez nay wife give the child her raiment and jewels i'll give her what belongs to her and that's a hot iron if she does not get out of that door this minute wife i'll spoil her pretty face for her shrieked licorice i never liked the vain chit overmuch nor anegay neither but if she does not go i'll give her something she won't forget in a hurry come my beatrice quick said bruno go go my belasez and god keep thee sobbed abraham and so belasez was driven away from her old home she had hardly expected it it had always been a trouble to her and a cause of self reproach that she and licorice did not love each other better and she was not able to repress a sensation of satisfaction in making the discovery that licorice was not her mother yet belasez had not looked for this what are we to do father she asked rather blankly i must lodge thee with the sisters of saint clare my child there is nothing else to be done i will come and fetch thee away so soon as my arrangements can be made beatrice as we must henceforth call her did not fancy this arrangement at all bruno detected as much in her face thou dost not like it my dove i do not like being with strangers she said frankly and i am afraid the nuns will think me a variety of heathen for i cannot do all they will want me they will not if i tell the abbess that thou art a new convert said bruno they may very likely attempt to instruct thee father why should there be any nuns beatrice did not know how she astonished bruno but he only smiled thine eyes are unaccustomed to the light was all he answered but father among our people of old i mean said beatrice hesitatingly my mother's people go on my beatrice let it be our people' speak as it is nature to thee to do thank you my father among our people there were no nuns so far from it that for a woman to remain unwed was considered a reproach why dost thou know i think because every woman longed for the glory of being the mother of the messiah true therefore christ being come that reproach is done away let each woman choose for herself if a virgin marry she hath not sinned' nevertheless she that is unmarried thinks of the things of the lord that she may be holy body and soul' father do you wish me to be a nun never hastily answered bruno nay my beatrice i should not have said that be thou what the lord thinks best to make thee but i do not want to be left alone again beatrice's heart was set at rest she had terribly feared for a moment lest bruno being himself a monk might think her absolutely bound to be a nun they soon reached the franciscan convent the abbess a rather stiffly mannered grey haired woman received her young guest with sedate kindliness and committed her to the special charge of sister eularia this was a young woman of about twenty five in whose mind curiosity was strongly developed she took beatrice up to the dormitory showed her where she was to sleep and gave her a seat on the form beside her at supper which was almost immediately served beatrice noticed that whenever eularia helped herself to any thing edible she made the sign of the cross over it why dost thou do that asked the young jewess it is according to our rule replied the nun surely thou knowest how to cross thyself indeed i do not and i do not see why i should poor thing how sadly thou lackest teaching dost thou not know that our lord christ suffered on the cross oh yes but why must i cross myself on that account in respect to him exclaimed eularia pardon me if one whom i loved were slain by the sword i should not courtesy to every sword i saw because i loved him i should hate the very sight of one eularia was scarcely less puzzled than beatrice it is the symbol of our salvation she said i should look on it rather as the symbol of his suffering true but he suffered for us for which reason i should still less admire that which made him suffer eularia shrugged her shoulders thou art very ignorant the discussion slumbered until they rose from supper when eularia seated beatrice beside her on the settle and offered to instruct her in the use of the rosary what a pretty necklace i thought nuns did not wear ornaments ornaments of course not then what do you do with that we pray by it pray by it i do not understand we keep count of our prayers count why why how could we remember them else but why should you remember poor ignorant child when thou comest to make confession thou wilt find that the priest will set thee for penance so many aves and so many paternosters what are those dost thou never pray gasped eularia i never say so many of one thing and so many of another answered beatrice half laughing i never heard anything so absurd the holy prophets did not pray in that way of course they did exclaimed eularia how could they obtain help of our lady without repeating ave and salve how could they indeed before she was born was the retort oh dear dear said eularia why thou knowest nothing beatrice privately thought that she would prefer not to know all that rubbish plenty of it was served up to her before she left the convent by the holy sisters of saint clare it was nearly three weeks before bruno came for her and very weary of her hosts she was they were no less astonished and dismayed by her the ignorant heathen would not worship the holy images would not use holy water would not kneel before the holy sacrament would not do this that and the other and not content with this series of negations she actually presumed to reason about them what dost thou believe despairingly demanded sister eularia at last i believe in god said beatrice gravely and i believe that jesus of nazareth was the sent of god and in the holy ghost asked eularia if i understand you certainly is it not written the spirit of god hath made me' and in holy church i do not know what is it how shocking and in the forgiveness of sins assuredly and in the resurrection and eternal life undoubtedly and in the invocation of the holy saints i believe that there have been holy men and women and dost thou invoke them do you mean pray to them dost thou beg of them to intercede for thee no indeed not i did i ever see such ignorance and thou wilt not learn i will learn of my father and no one else i am sure he does not believe half the rubbish you do sancta hilaria or a pro nobis what language is that innocently asked beatrice the holy tongue of course it is not our holy tongue have jews a holy tongue responded eularia in surprise yes indeed hebrew i did not know they believed any thing to be holy have they any relics i do not know what those are eularia led the way to the sacristy look here she said reverently opening a golden reliquary set with rubies here is a small piece of the holy veil of our foundress saint clare this is the finger bone of the blessed evangelist matthew here is a piece of the hoof of the holy ass on which our lord rode now thou knowest what relics are but what can make you keep such things as those asked beatrice opening wide her lustrous eyes and this enthusiastically added eularia opening another reliquary set with emeralds and pearls is our most precious relic one of the small feathers from the wing of the holy angel saint gabriel to the intense horror of eularia a silver laugh of unmistakable amusement greeted this holy relic beatrice hast thou no reverence not for angels' feathers answered beatrice still laughing well i did think you had more sense i can assure thee thou wilt shock father bruno if thou allowest thyself to commit such improprieties i shall shock him then how excessively absurd eularia took her unpromising pupil out of the sacristy more hastily than she had led her in and perhaps it was as well for beatrice that father bruno arrived the next day they reached bury castle in safety the countess had been very much interested in father bruno's story and most readily acceded to his request to leave beatrice as her visitor until he should have a home to which he could take her and beatrice de malpas the daughter of a baronial house in cheshire was a very different person in the estimation of a christian noble from belasez daughter of the jew pedlar rather to her surprise she found herself seated above the salt that is treated as a lady of rank and the embargo being over which had confined her to margaret's apartments she took her place at the earl's table in the banquet hall earl hubert's quick eyes soon found out the addition to his supper party and he condescended to remark that she was extremely pretty and quite an ornament to the hall beatrice herself was much pleased to find her old friend doucebelle seated next to her and they soon began to converse on recent events it is a curious fact as concerns human nature that however long friends may have been parted their conversation nearly always turns on what has happened just before they met again they do not speak of what delighted or agonised them ten years ago though the effect may have extended to the whole of their subsequent lives they talk of last week's journey or of yesterday's snow storm beatrice fully expected doucebelle's sympathy on the subject of relics and she was disappointed to find it not forthcoming doucebelle was rather inclined to be shocked than amused the angel's feather in her eyes was provocative of any thing rather than ridicule and beatrice who had anticipated her taking the common sense view of the matter felt chilled by the result life had fallen back into its old grooves at bury castle grief with the countess was usually a passionate but also a transitory feeling her extremely easy temper led her to get rid of a sorrow as soon as ever she could pain whether mental or bodily was in her eyes not a necessary discipline but an unpleasant disturbance of the proper order of events in fact she was one of those persons who are always popular by reason of their gracious affability but in whom below the fair flow of sweet waters there is a strong substratum of stony selfishness she objected to people being in distress not because it hurt them but because it hurt her to see them and the difference between the two though it may scarcely show at times on the surface lies in an entire and essential variety of the strata underneath it was only natural that with this character the countess should expect others to be as little impressed by suffering as herself she really had no conception of a disposition to which sorrow was not an easily healed scratch but a scar that would be carried to the grave in her eyes the calamity which had happened to her daughter was a disappointment undoubtedly but one which she would find no difficulty in surmounting at all there were plenty of other men in the world quite as handsome as amiable as rich and as noble as richard de clare if such a grief had happened to herself she would have wept incessantly for a week been low spirited for a month and in a year would have been wreathed with smiles and arranging her trousseau for a wedding with another bridegroom the only thing which could really have distressed her long would have been if the vacant place in her life had not been refilled but margaret's character was of a deeper type for her the world held no other man and life's blossom once blighted no second crop of happiness could grow at least on the same tree to such a character as this the only possibility of throwing out fresh bloom is when the tree is grafted by the great husbandman with amaranth from heaven yet it was not in margaret's nature it would have been in her mother's to say much of what she felt outwardly she showed no difference except that her coeur leger was gone never to return she did not shut herself up and refuse to join in the employments or amusements of those around her and the majority of those around never suspected that the work and the amusement alike had no interest for her nor would ever have any that she could never think as she had thought or be as she had been again one person only perceived the truth and that was because he was cast in a like mould bruno saw too plainly that the hope expressed by the countess that magot was getting nicely over her disappointment was not true never would be true in his case the amaranth had been grafted in and the plant was blossoming again but there was no such hope for her at least as yet beatrice was unable to enter into margaret's feelings not so much through want of capacity as of experience eva was equally unable being naturally at once of a more selfish and a less concentrated disposition her mind would have been more easily drawn from her sorrow an important item of the healing process doucebelle came nearest but as she was the most selfless of all her grief in like case would have been rather for the sufferings of richard than for her own beatrice soon carried the relic question to her father for decision though with some trepidation as to what he would say if he should not agree with her she would be sorely disappointed bruno's smile half reassured her so thou canst not believe in the genuineness of these relics said he well my child so that thou hast full faith in christ and his salvation i cannot think it much matters whether thou believest a certain piece of stuff to be the veil of saint clare or not neither saint clare nor her veil is concerned in thine eternal safety but doucebelle seems almost shocked she does believe in them perhaps it will not harm her with the like proviso but father the honour in which they hold these rags and bones seems to me like idolatry then be careful thou commit it not but you do not worship such things dear child i find too much in christ and in this perishing world to have much time to think of them beatrice was only half satisfied she would have felt more contented had bruno warmly disclaimed the charge it was at the cost of some distress that she realised that what were serious essentials to her were comparatively trivial matters to him the wafts of polluted air were only too patent to her which were lost in the purer atmosphere at the altitude where bruno stood the girls were gathered together one afternoon in the ante chamber of margaret's apartments and bruno who had come up to speak to his daughter was with them except in special cases no chamber of any house was sacred from a priest eva was busy spinning but it would be more accurate to say that marie who was supposed to be spinning also was engaged in breaking threads margaret was employed on tapestry work doucebelle in plain sewing and beatrice with her delicate embroidery father said beatrice looking up suddenly i was taught that it was sin to make images of created things on account of the words of the second commandment what do you say non fades tibi sculptile neque omnem similitudinem' murmured bruno reflectively i think my child that it depends very much on the meaning of tibi' ah i see in thy face thou hast learned no latin thou shalt not make to thee any sculptured image' then a sculptured image may be made otherwise the latter half of the commandment i think shows what is meant non adorabis ea neque coles' thou shalt not worship them' at the same time saint paul saith omne autem quod non est ex fide peccatum est' all that is not of faith is sin' and nisi ei qui existimat quid commune esse illi commune est' namely to him who esteemeth a thing unclean to him it is unclean' if thou really believest it sin by no means allow thyself to do it but father suppose we cannot be sure said doucebelle thou needst not fear that thou wilt ever walk too close to christ daughter quietly answered bruno but father i are we bound to give up all that can possibly be sin or even can become sin asked eva in a tone which decidedly indicated dissent i should like to hear thy objection daughter why we should have to give up every thing nice said eva disconsolately there are all sorts of delightful things which are not exactly sins but not quite virtues interposed beatrice with an amused expression as eva paused well no still they are not wrong in themselves but they make one waste one's time or forget to say one's beads or be cross to one's sister just because they are so delightful and one does not want to give over and being cross is sin i suppose and so it is when one forgets to say one's prayers i don't know whether wasting time is exactly a sin i see said bruno in the same quiet tone had our lord sent thee to clear his temple of the profane who desecrated it by traffic thou wouldst have overthrown the tables of the money changers but not the seats of them that sold doves beatrice and doucebelle answered by a smile of intelligence eva looked rather dissatisfied but it is not a sin to be happy father asked margaret in a low voice not if god give thee the happiness that is just it said eva discontentedly how is one to know my child answered bruno ignoring the tone god never means his children to put any thing into the place of himself the moment thou dost that that thing is sin to thee but when do we do that father asked doucebelle when it makes thee forget to say thy prayers i should think drily observed beatrice when it comes in the way between him and thee said bruno and is it a sin to waste time father queried eva it is a sin to waste any thing answered bruno but if it be more a sin to waste one thing than another surely it is to waste life itself he rose and went away eva shrugged her shoulders with a wry face there never was any body so precise as father bruno i would rather ask questions of father nicholas ten times over well i don't like asking questions of father nicholas responded doucebelle because he never answers them he never goes down to the bottom of things ha chetife cried eva dost thou want to get to the bottom of things that is just why i like father nicholas because he never bothers one with reasons and distinctions it is only yes thou mayest do so' or no do not do that' and then i am satisfied now father bruno will persist in explaining why i am not to do it and that sometimes makes me want to do it all the more it seems to leave it in one's own hands beatrice broke into a laugh why eva thou wouldst rather be a chair to be moved about than a woman to be able to go at pleasure i would rather have a distinct order said eva a little scornfully do' or don't' i can understand but saint paul says this' or saint john says that' and to have to make up one's own mind i detest it and i should detest the opposite i am afraid beatrice thou art greatly wanting in the virtue of holy obedience but of course one can make allowances for thine unhappy education eva had occasion to leave the room at the conclusion of this unflattering speech and beatrice indulged in a long laugh well what i am afraid of she said to margaret and doucebelle is that eva is rather wanting in the virtue of common sense but whether i am to lay that on her education i do not know there was no answer but the thoughts of the hearers were almost opposites margaret considered beatrice rash and self satisfied doucebelle thought heartily with her and only wished that she had as much courage to say so chapter twelve what is love she only said my life is dreary he cometh not' she said she said i am aweary weary i would that i were dead' tennyson it was fortunate for bruno de malpas that he had a friend in bishop grosteste whose large heart and clear brain were readily interested in his wish to return from regular to secular orders he smoothed the path considerably and promised him a benefice in his diocese if the dispensation could be obtained but the last was a lengthy process and some months passed away before the answer could be received from rome it greatly scandalised hawise and eva for different reasons to see how very little progress was made by beatrice in that which in their eyes was the christian religion it was a comfort to them to reflect that she had been baptised as an infant and therefore in the event of sudden death had a chance of going to heaven instead of the dreadful certainty of being shut up in limbo a place of vague locality and vaguer character being neither pleasant nor painful but inhabited by all the hapless innocents whose heathen or careless christian parents suffered them to die unregenerated but both of them were sorely shocked to discover when she had been about two months at bury that poor beatrice was still ignorant of the five commandments of the church nor was this all she irreverently persisted in her old inquiry of what is the church and sturdily demanded what right the church had to give commandments hawise was quite distressed it was not proper a phrase which with her was the strongest denunciation that could be uttered nobody had ever asked such questions before ergo they ought never to be asked every sane person knew perfectly well what the church was though when gently urged by beatrice hawise backed out of any definition and no good catholic could possibly require telling and as to so shocking a supposition as that the church had no right to issue her own commands well it was not proper eva's objection was quite as strong but of a different sort she really could not understand what beatrice wanted if the priest or the church they were very much the same thing told her what to do could she not rest and be thankful it was a great deal less trouble than everlastingly thinking for one's self no one of any note ever thinks for himself chimed in hawise then i am glad i am not of any note bluntly responded beatrice you a de malpas i am quite shocked said hawise god made me with a heart and a conscience was the answer if he had not meant me to use them he would not have given them to me at that point beatrice left the room in answer to a call from the countess and hawise turning to her companions remarked in a whisper that it must be that dreadful jewish blood on the mother's side which had given her such very improper notions they were so low for my part she added if it were proper to say so i should remark that i cannot imagine why father bruno does not see that she understands something of christianity but of course one must not criticise a priest speak truth my daughter said a voice from the doorway which rather disconcerted hawise thou canst not understand my actions in what respect i humbly crave your pardon father but i am really distressed about beatrice indeed how so she understands nothing about christian duties i hope that is a little more than truth but if not let her understand christ first my child christian duties will come after forgive me father without teaching not without his teaching said bruno gravely without mine it may be but father she does not know the five commandments of holy church nay she asks what the church' means if she be in the church she can wait to know it thy garments will not keep thee less warm because thou hast never learned how to weave them hawise did not reply but she looked unconvinced a few days after this eva was pleased to inform beatrice that she had been so happy as to reach that point which in her eyes was the apex of feminine ambition i am betrothed to sir william de cantilupe margaret sighed dost thou like him asked beatrice in her straightforward way which was sometimes a shade too blunt and was apt to betray her into asking direct questions which it might have been kinder and more delicate to leave unasked eva blushed and simpered i'll tell thee beatrice said little marie dancing up she's over head and ears in love so much over head and marie's hand went as high as it would go above her own but it's my belief she has tumbled in on the wrong side the wrong side' answered beatrice laughing the wrong side of love or the wrong side of eva the wrong side of eva responded marie with a positive little nod as to love i'm not quite sure that she knows much about it for i don't believe she cares half so much for sir william as she cares for being married that's the grand thing with her so far as i can make out and that's not my notion of love thou silly little child of twelve what dost thou know about it contemptuously demanded eva thy time is not come no and i hope it won't said marie if i'm to make such a goose of myself over it as thou dost marie marie it's true margaret now beatrice dost thou not think so she makes a regular misery of it there is no living with her for a day or two before he comes to see her she never gives him a minute's peace when he is here and if he looks at somebody else she goes as black as a thunder cloud if he's half an hour late she's quite sure he is visiting some other gentlewoman whom he loves better than he loves her she's for ever making little bits of misery out of nothing if he were to call her honey sweet eva' to day and only sweet eva' to morrow she would be positive there was some shocking reason for it instead of like a sensible girl never thinking about it in that way at all beatrice and doucebelle were both laughing and even margaret joined in a little of course said marie by way of postscript if sir william had been badly hurt in a tournament or anything of that sort i could understand her worrying about it or if he had told her that he did not love her i could understand that but she worries for nothing at all if he does not tell her that he loves her every time he comes she fancies he doesn't marie don't be so silly thanks i'll try not said marie keenly and she calls that love what dost thou think beatrice why i think it does not sound much like it marie in thy description why what notion of love hast thou said eva scornfully i have not forgotten how thou wert wont to talk of thy betrothed but i never professed to love leo said beatrice looking up how could i when i had not seen him dost thou want to see in order to love sentimentally inquired eva no answered beatrice thoughtfully but i want to know i might easily love some one whom i had not seen with my eyes if he were always sending me messages and doing kind actions for me but i could not love somebody who was to me a mere name and nothing more it is plain thou hast no sensitiveness beatrice i'd rather have sense wouldn't you said little marie as if one could not have both sneered eva well if one could i should have thought thou wouldst retorted marie well i don't understand you said eva i cannot care to be loved with less than the whole heart i should not thank you for just the love that you can spare from other people but should not one have some to spare for other people suggested marie that sounds as if one's heart were a box said beatrice that would hold so much and no more is it not more like a fountain that can give out perpetually and always have fresh supplies within yes for the beloved one replied eva warmly for all answered beatrice that is a narrow heart which will hold but one person well i would rather be loved with the whole of a narrow heart than with a piece of a broad one o eva what dost thou mean doucebelle said eva sharply turning on her new assailant indeed i would the man who loves me must love me supremely must care for nothing but me must find his sweetest reward for every thing in my smile and his bitterest pain in my displeasure that is what i call love well i should call that something else if margaret wouldn't scold murmured marie in an undertone what is that marie asked margaret with a smile self conceit and plenty of it said the child ask father bruno what he thinks beatrice suggested margaret after a gentle hush to the somewhat too plain spoken marie thou canst do it but it would not come so well from us dost thou mean to say i am conceited little piece of impertinence inquired eva in no dulcet tones well i thought thou saidst it thyself was the response for which marie got chased round the room with the wooden side of an embroidery frame and being lithe as a monkey escaped by flying to the countess's rooms which communicated with those of her daughter by a private staircase father bruno came up as he often did the same evening but before beatrice had time to consult him the small countess of eu appeared from nowhere in particular and put the crucial question in its crudest form please father bruno what is love dost thou want telling inquired bruno with evident amusement please we all want telling because we can't agree bruno very rarely laughed but he did now then if you cannot agree you certainly do need it i should rather like to hear the various opinions oh eva says began the child eagerly but bruno's hand laid gently on her head stopped her wait my child let each speak for herself there was silence for a moment for no one liked to begin except marie whom decorum alone kept silent what didst thou say eva i believe i said good father that i cared not for the love of any that did not hold me first and best nor do i love seeketh not her own' said bruno that which seeks its own is not love what is it father modestly asked doucebelle it is self love my daughter the worst enemy that can be to the true love of god and man real love is unselfish unexacting and immortal but love can die surely saint paul says the contrary my daughter it can kill i suppose said margaret in a low tone yes the weak replied bruno but father was the holy apostle not speaking of religious love suggested eva trying to find a loophole what is the alternative irreligious love i do not know of such a thing my daughter but there is a wicked sort of love certainly not there are wicked passions but love can never be wicked because god is love but people can love wickedly asked eva looking puzzled i fail to see how any one can love wickedly self love is always wicked then father if it be wicked you call it self love said eva leaping very cleverly as she thought to a conclusion scarcely said bruno with a quiet smile say rather my daughter that if it be self love i call it wicked the perplexed expression returned to eva's face my child what is love why father that is just what we want to know said marie but bruno waited for eva's answer i suppose she said nervously it means liking a person and wishing for his company and wanting him to love one and i suppose that it is caring for him so much that thou wouldst count nothing too great a sacrifice to attain his highest good that is how god loved us my children eva thought this extremely poor and tame beside her own lovely ideal then said marie if i love margaret i shall want her to be happy i shall not want her to make me happy unless it would make her so right my child said bruno with a smile of approbation to do otherwise would be loving marie not margaret but father exclaimed eva do you mean to say that if my betrothed prefers to go hawking rather than sit with me if i love him i shall wish him to leave me whom wouldst thou be loving if not i could not wish him to go and leave me my child there is a divine self abnegation to which very few attain but those few come nearest to the imitation of him who pleased not himself' and i think god knoweth often they are the happiest let us all ask god for grace to reach it this is my commandment that ye have love one to another' and as was generally the case when he had said all he thought necessary at the moment bruno rose and with a benediction quitted the room call that loving said eva contemptuously when he was gone poor tame stuff i should not thank you for it well i should said doucebelle quietly oh thou was eva's answer in the same tone why thou hast no heart to begin with doucebelle silently doubted that statement o eva for shame said marie doucebelle always does what every body wants her unless she thinks it is wrong thou dost not call that love i hope i think it is quite as like it as wishing people to do what they don't want to please you said marie sturdily i don't believe one of you knows any thing about it loftily returned eva if i had been margaret now i could not have sat quietly to that broidery i could not have borne it margaret looked up quickly changed colour and with a slight compression of her lower lip went back to her work in silence but what wouldst thou have done eva demanded the practical little marie wouldst thou have stared out of the window all day long no returned eva with fervent emphasis i should have wept my life away but margaret is not like me she can get interested in work and other things and forget a hapless love and outlive it it would kill me in a month margaret rose very quietly put her frame by in the corner and left the room beatrice who had been silent for some time looked up then with expressive eyes it is killing her eva my father told me so a week since he says he is quite sure that the countess is mistaken in fancying that she is getting over it she she is as strong as a horse and i don't think she ever felt it much not as i should have done i should have taken the veil that very day earth would have been a dreary waste to me from that instant i could not have borne to see a man again however many years i might have lived no sound but the miserere but eva i thought thou wert going to die in a month it is very rude to interrupt marie no sound but the miserere would ever have broken the chill echoes of my lonely cell nor should any raiment softer than sackcloth have come near my seared and blighted heart i should think it would get seared with nothing but sackcloth put in the irrepressible little lady of eu but what good would all that do eva good beatrice what canst thou mean i tell thee i could not have borne any thing else i don't believe much in thy sackcloth eva thou wert making ever such a fuss the other day because the serge of thy gown touched thy neck and rubbed it and levina ran a ribbon down to keep it off thee don't be impertinent marie of course in such a case as that i could not think of mere inconveniences well if i could not think of inconveniences when i was miserable i would try to make less fuss over them when i was happy i am not happy foolish child why what's the matter did sir william look at thee only twenty nine times instead of thirty when he was here thou art the silliest maiden of whom any one ever heard no eva her match might be found i think said beatrice marie went off into convulsions of laughter and flung herself on the rushes to enjoy it with more freedom i wonder which of you two is the funnier said she what on earth is there comical about me exclaimed eva the more put out because beatrice and doucebelle were both joining in marie's amusement it is of no use to tell thee eva replied beatrice thou wouldst not be able to see it can't i see any thing you can demanded eva irritably why no said marie with a fresh burst canst thou see thine own face what a silly child to make such a speech as that no eva said beatrice trying to stifle her laughter increased by marie's witticism the child is any thing but silly well i think you are all very silly and i shall not talk to you any more retorted eva endeavouring to cover her retreat but she was answered only by a third explosion from marie half an hour later the countess entering her bed chamber was startled to find a girl crouched down by the side of the bed her face hidden in the coverlet and her sunny cedar hair flowing over it in disorder why what magot my darling magot what aileth thee my white dove margaret lifted her head when her mother spoke she had not been shedding tears perhaps she might have looked less terribly wan and woeful if she had done so pardon me lady i came here to be alone the countess sat down in the low curule chair beside her bed and drew her daughter close margaret laid her head with a weary sigh on her mother's knee and cowered down again at her feet and what made thee wish to be alone my rosebud something that somebody said has any one been speaking unkindly to my little one no no they did not mean to be unkind oh dear no nothing of the sort but things sting when people do not mean it the countess softly stroked the cedar hair she hardly understood the explanation things of that sort did not sting her but this she understood and felt full sympathy with that her one cherished darling was in trouble who was it magot do not ask me lady i did not mean to complain of any one and nobody intended to hurt me what did she say she said something like a sob came here that i was one who could settle to work and get interested in other things and forget a lost love but she said it would kill her in a month well darling i began to hope that was true no came in a very low voice it was not a quick warm denial like that of eva yet one which sounded far more hopelessly conclusive no o mother no and thou art still fretting in secret my dove i do not know about fretting i think that is too energetic a word it would be better to say dying magot mine own my sunbeam do not use such words it is better to see the truth lady and that is true but i do not think it will be over in a month the countess could not trust herself to speak she went on stroking the soft hair father bruno says that love can kill weak people i suppose i am weak i feel as if i should be glad when it is all done with when what is done with asked the countess in a husky tone living said the girl this weary round of dressing eating working talking and sleeping when it is all done and one may lie down to sleep and not wake to morrow i feel as if that were the only thing which would ever make me glad any more my heart dost thou want to leave me i would have lived lady for your sake if i could have done but i cannot the rosebud that you loved is faded it cannot give out scent any more it is not me me your margaret that works and talks and does all these things it is only my body which cannot die quite so fast as my soul my heart is dead already my treasure i will have master aristoteles to see to thee i really hoped thou wert getting over it it is of no use trying to keep me she answered quietly you had better let me go mother the countess's reply was to clap her hands at that time the usual method of summoning a servant when levina tapped at the door instead of bidding her enter her mistress spoke through it tell master aristoteles that i would speak with him in this chamber the mother and daughter were both very still until the shuffling of the physician's slippered feet was heard in the passage then the countess roused herself and answered the appeal with come in my lady desired my attendance i did master i would fain have you examine this child she has a strange fancy which i should like to have uprooted from her mind she imagines that she is going to die a strange fancy indeed if it please my lady i see no sign of disease at all about the damsel a little weakness and low spirits no real complaint whatever she might with some advantage wear the fleminum note the blood seems a little too much in the head and warm fomentations would help to restore her strength almond blossoms pounded with pearl might also do something but if it please my lady let my lady speak i was only going to ask master whether viper broth would be good for her a most excellent suggestion my lady but i was about to remark the physician of saint albans hath given me a most precious thing which would infallibly restore the damsel even if she were at the gates of death three hairs of the beard of the blessed dominic note whom our holy father hath but now canonised if the damsel were to take one of these fasting in holy water no influence of the devil could have any longer power over her ha jolife cried the countess clasping her hands magot my love this is the very thing thou must take it i will take what you command lady but there was no enthusiasm in margaret's voice then to morrow morning master do i beseech you administer this precious cordial lady i will do so but it would increase the efficacy if the damsel would devoutly repeat this evening the rosary of the holy virgin with twelve glorias and one hundred aves get thee to it quickly magot my darling and i will say them with thee which will surely be of still more benefit master i thank you inexpressibly and hastily rising the countess repaired to her oratory whither margaret followed her father warner was there already and he joined in the prayers which made them of infallible efficacy in the eyes of the countess at five o'clock the next morning in the oratory the holy hair was duly administered to the patient all the priests were present except bruno master aristoteles himself after high mass came forward with the blessed relic a long thick black hair immersed in holy water in a golden goblet set with pearls this margaret obediently swallowed of course exclusive of the goblet and it is not very surprising that a fit of coughing succeeded the process avaunt thee satanas said father warner making the sign of the cross in the air above margaret's head father nicholas kindly suggested that a little more of the holy water might be efficacious against the manifest enmity of the foul fiend master aristoteles readily assented and the additional dose calmed the cough but probably it did not occur to any one to think whether unholy water would not have done quite as well when they had come out into the bower the countess took her daughter in her arms and kissed her brow now my magot said she playfully it was not much forced for her faith was great in the blessed hair now my magot thou wilt get well again thou must margaret looked up into the loving face above her and a faint sad smile flitted across her lips think so dear lady if it comfort thee she said it will not be for long note a garment which was supposed to draw the blood downwards from the brain note hairs of a saint's beard dipped in holy water and taken inwardly are given by fosbroke encyclopaedia of antiquities page in his list of medieval remedies chapter thirteen father bruno's sermon and speak'st thou thus despairing of the sun that sets to thee and of the earthly love that wanes to thee and of the heaven that lieth far from thee peace peace fond fool one draweth near thy door whose footprints leave no print across the snow thy sun has risen with comfort in his face the smile of heaven to warm thy frozen heart and bless with saintly hand what is it long to wait and far to go thou shalt not go behold across the snow to thee he comes thy heaven descends and is it long to wait thou shalt not wait this night this night' he saith i stand at the door and knock' jean ingelow earl hubert went very pale when his wife told him of the conversation which she had had with margaret she was his darling the child of his old age and he loved her more dearly than he was himself aware but the blessed hair and the holy water were swallowed by him in a figurative sense with far more implicit faith than they had been physically by margaret he was quite easy in his mind after that event the countess was a little less so the saintly relic did not weigh quite so much with her and the white still unchanged face of the girl weighed more with the restless anxiety of alarm only half awake she tried to bolster up her own hopes by appeals to every other person father nicholas do you think my daughter looks really ill father nicholas lost at the moment in the aegean sea came slowly back from the many twinkling smile of ocean to the consideration of the question referred to him my lady ah yes the damsel margaret to be sure well looking ill i cannot say lady that i have studied the noble damsel's looks perhaps is she a little paler than she used to be ah my lady a course of the grand old greek dramatists that would be the thing to set her up she could not fail to be interested and charmed the countess next applied to father warner the damsel does look pale lady what wonder when she has not confessed for over a fortnight get her well shriven and you will see she will be another maiden she sighs indeed my lady and i do not think she sleeps well said levina who was the third authority it strikes me under my lady's pleasure that she would be the better for a change this meant that levina was tired of bury saint edmund's oh there's nothing the matter with her said eva testily she never takes things to heart as i do she'll do well enough lady i am very uneasy about dear margaret was doucebelle's contribution i am sure she is ill and unhappy too i only wish i knew what to do for her beatrice looked up with grave eyes lady i would so gladly say no but i cannot do it the last person interrogated was bruno and by the time she came to him the countess was very low spirited his face went grave and sad lady it never does good to shut one's eyes to the truth it is worse pain in the end yes the damsel margaret is dying dying shrieked the unhappy mother dying father bruno you said dying too true my lady but what can i do how am i to stop it ah said bruno softly as if to himself there is a talitha cumi' from the other side too the healer is on that side now lady he has called her in her face her voice her very smile it is only too plain that she has heard his voice and there is no possibility of disobeying it whether it call the living to death or the dead to life but how am i to help it repeated the poor countess you cannot help it suffer her to rise and go to him let us only do our utmost to make sure that it is to him she is going oh if it be so would it be possible to have her spared the pains of purgatory father i would think it indeed a light matter to give every penny and every jewel that i have do so if it will comfort you but for her leave her in his hands without whom not a sparrow falleth lady he loves her better than you better it is not possible i would die for her he has died for her answered bruno softly and he is the amen the living one for ever and he hath the keys of hades and of death she cannot die lady until he bids it who counts every hair upon the head of every child of his but where will she be what will she be moaned the poor mother if she be his she will be where he is and like him but he does not need her and i do nay if he did not he would not take her he loves her too well lady to deal with this weak and weary lamb as he deals with the strong sheep of his flock he leads them for forty years it may be through the wilderness he teaches them by pain sorrow loneliness unrest but she is too weak for such discipline and she is to be folded early it is far better for her well perhaps if she can be got past purgatory but for me for each of you what she needs lady o father bruno she is mine only one lady can you not trust her in his hands who gave his only one for her salvation one evening about this time levina came up with the news that abraham of norwich wished to see the damoiselle de malpas her words were civil enough but her tone never was when she spoke to beatrice and on this occasion she put an emphasis on the name which was manifestly not intended to be flattering beatrice however took no notice of it indeed she was too glad to see abraham to feel an inclination to quarrel with the person who announced his arrival in any terms whatever she threw aside her work in haste and ran down into the hall my belasez light of mine eyes said the old man fervently as he folded her in his arms and blessed her ah there is not much light for the old pedlar's eyes now dost thou miss me my father miss thee ah my darling how little thou knowest the sun has gone down and the heavens are covered with clouds was my mother very angry after i went away it was not natural to speak of licorice by any other name don't mention it belasez she beat me with the broom until delecresse interfered and pulled her off then she spat at me and cursed me in the name of abraham isaac and jacob and all the twelve tribes of israel she threw dirt at my beard child the last expression as beatrice well knew was an oriental metaphor is she satisfied now satisfied what dost thou mean by satisfied she gives me all the sitten note porridge that is not very satisfying for one can't eat much of it i break my fast with moss when i can beatrice could not help laughing my poor father i wish i could just fly in every morning to make the porridge for thee blessed be the memory of the twelve patriarchs child thou wouldst scarcely escape with whole bones if licorice hated christians before she hates them tenfold now dost thou think belasez that the lady lacks anything to day i have one of the sweetest pieces of pale blue cyprus that ever was woven and some exquisite gold damascene stuffs as well i am sure father she will like to look at them and i have little doubt she will buy how are matters going with thee child has thy father got leave to abandon his vows he hopes to receive it in a few days well well matters were better managed in israel our vows were always terminable and nazarites did not shut themselves up as if other men were not to be touched like unclean beasts we always washed ourselves too there is an old monk at norwich that scents the street whenever he goes up it and not with otto of roses i turn up a side lane when i see him coming even the saracens are better than that i never knew any but christians who thought soap and water came from satan note well we all wash ourselves here said beatrice laughing unless it be father warner i will not answer for him this world is a queer place my belasez full of crooked lanes and crookeder men and women men are bad enough i believe but women beatrice could guess of what woman abraham was especially thinking is cress come with thee my father no not here answered the old jew emphatically and he never can why belasez i have a sad tale to tell thee o my father is there anything wrong with cress it was impossible to recognise delecresse as uncle instead of brother ay child wrong enough said abraham sadly is he so ill my father ah my belasez there is a leprosy of the soul worse than that of the body and there is no priest left in israel who can purge that child hast thou never wondered how sir piers de rievaulx came to know of the damsel's marriage she that is the lady's daughter margaret i never could tell how it was it was delecresse who told him delecresse ah yes may the god of israel forgive him but how did delecresse know i fancy he guessed it partly and perhaps subtly extracted some avowal from thee in a way which thou didst not understand at the time but father i could not have told him even unwittingly for i did not know it myself i remember his asking me who sir richard was as we passed through the hall yes and he said to old hamon that he owed him a grudge he asked me too after that if sir richard were attached to margaret what didst thou say that i thought it might be so but i did not know well i am thankful thou couldst tell him no more i suppose he pieced things together and very likely jumped the last yard howbeit he did it my son my only one if there were an altar yet left in israel it should smoke with a hecatomb of lambs for him all israelites would not think it wicked my father they think all gentiles fair prey what after they have eaten of their salt child when the lady had been kind to thee i could not have touched a hair of any head she loved had the messiah come that day and all gentiles been made our bond slaves i would have besought for her to fall to me that i might free her without an instant's suspense yes my father thou wouldst answered beatrice affectionately but i do not think thou ever didst hate christians as some of our nation do child belasez how could i when the best love of my white dove's heart had been given to a christian and a gentile i loved her more than thou canst imagine but would my love have been true had i hated what she loved best where is thy father my darling beatrice was just about to say that she could not tell when she looked up and saw him the greeting between abraham and bruno was very cordial now bruno smiled gravely when he heard of the further exploits of licorice with the broom but a very sad almost stern expression came into his eyes when he was told the discovery concerning delecresse keep it quiet my father he said the lord will repay may it be not in justice but with his mercy then abraham and his pack were had up to the bower and large purchases made of damascene and cyprus stuffs when he went away bruno walked with him across the yard and as they clasped hands in farewell suddenly asked him what he thought of the damsel margaret can there be any question answered abraham pityingly hath not azrael the angel of death stamped her with his signet i fear so wilt thou pray for her my father abraham looked up in amazement a christian ask the prayers of a jew exclaimed he why not replied bruno were not christ and all his apostles jews and thou art a good and true man my father the god of israel heareth the prayers of the righteous canst thou account a jew righteous one who believes not in thy messiah i am not so sure of that said bruno his eyes meeting those of abraham in full i think thy heart and conscience are convinced but thou art afraid to declare it abraham's colour rose a little may adonai lead us both to his truth he replied but bruno noticed that he made no attempt to deny the charge bruno's chief wish now was to get hold of margaret and find out the exact state of her mind without knowing his wish she helped him by asking him to hear her confession bruno rose at once now said margaret with a little surprise there is no time but now was the reply they went into the oratory and closed the door on curious ears and margaret poured out the secrets of her restless and weary heart i longed to confess to you father for i fancied that you would understand me better than the other priests you know what love is i am not sure that they do and father warner at least thinks it weakness if not sin and now tell me have you any balm for such a sorrow as mine of course it can never be undone that i know too well and i do not think that any thing could make me live nor do i wish it if i only knew where it is that i am going let the where alone answered bruno daughter to whom art thou going is it to a stranger or to him whom thy soul loveth not unnaturally she misunderstood the allusion no he will not necessarily die because i do she was only thinking of richard my child said bruno gently thou art going to the presence of the lord jesus christ dost thou know any thing about him i know of course what the church teaches well but dost thou know what he teaches is he as dear to thee as thine earthly love no the reply was in a rather shamefaced tone but there was no hesitation about it is he as dear to thee as the earl thy father no is he as dear to thee as any person in this house whomsoever it be such as thou hast been acquainted with and accustomed to all thy life father said the low sad voice i am afraid you are right i do not know him wilt thou not ask him then to reveal himself to thee will he do it father will he' has he not been waiting to do it ever since thou wert brought to him in baptism but he can never fill up this void in my heart he could my daughter but i am not sure that he will in this world i rather think that he sees how weak thou art and means to gather thee early into the warm shelter of his safe and happy fold father i feel as if i could not be happy even in heaven if he were not there i can long for the grave because it will be rest and silence but for active happiness such as i suppose they have in heaven father i do not want that i could not bear it i would rather stay on earth where richard is poor child said bruno half involuntarily my daughter it is very natural it must be so where is thy treasure there is also thine heart' and the low voice went on if i could know that he had given over loving me i fancy it would be easier to go bruno thought it best rather to raise her thoughts out of that channel than to encourage them to flow in it my child christ has not given over loving thee that does not seem real like the other and o father he is not richard dear child it is far more real but thine heart is too sore to suffer thine eyes to see it dost thou not know that our lord is saying to thee in this very sorrow come unto me and i will give thee rest' it would be rest if he would give me richard she said there is but that one thing for me in all the world bruno perceived that this patient required not the plaster as he had supposed but the probe her heart was not merely sore it was rebellious she was hardening herself against god no my daughter thou art not ready for rest there can be no peace between the king and an unpardoned rebel thou art that margaret de burgh lay down thine arms and put thyself in the king's mercy father said the girl in a voice which was a mixture of surprise and alarm child he giveth not account of any of his matters unconditional submission is what he requires of his prisoners thou wouldst fain dictate terms to thy sovereign it cannot be thou must come into his terms if there is to be any peace between him and thee yet even for thee there is a message of love he is grieved at the hardness of thine heart listen to his voice it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks' it is for thy sake that he would have thee come back to thine allegiance the answer was scarcely what he expected father it is of no use to talk to me i hear what you say of course but it does me no good my heart is numb thou art right gently replied bruno the south wind must blow upon the garden ere the spices can flow out ask the lord i will ask him also to pour on thee the gift of the holy ghost how many paters said the girl in a weary tone one will do my daughter if thou wilt put thy whole heart into it i can put my heart into nothing then say to him this only lord i bring thee a dead heart that thou mayest give it life' she said the words after him mechanically like a child repeating a lesson how long will it take he knows not i but suppose i die first the lord will not let thee die unsaved if thou hast a sincere wish for salvation he wants it more than thou he wants it repeated margaret wonderingly he wants it he wants thee did he die for thee child that he should let thee go lightly thou art as precious in his sight as if the world held none beside thee i did not think i was that to any one except my parents and and richard thou art that incomparably more than to any of them to the lord jesus the momentary exhibition of feeling was past well she said with a dreary sigh it may be so but i cannot care about it bruno's answer was not addressed to margaret lord care about it for her breathe upon this dead that she may live save her in spite of herself there was a slight pause and then bruno quietly gave the absolution and the confession was over the next sunday there was the unwonted occurrence of a sermon after vespers sermons were not fashionable at that time when preached at all they were usually extremely dry scholastic disquisitions father warner had given two during his abode at the castle and both were concerning the duty of implicit obedience to the church father nicholas had preached about a dozen some on the virtues dreary classical essays three concerning the angels and one on a good friday which was a series of fervent declamations on the passion but this time it was bruno who preached and on a very different topic from any mentioned above his clear ringing voice was in itself a much more interesting sound than father nicholas's drowsy monotone or father warner's dry staccato he at least was interested in his subject no one could doubt that as soon as the last note of the last chant had died away bruno came forward to the steps of the altar he had given due notice of his intention beforehand and every one with beatrice in particular was prepared to listen to him the text itself to hearers unfamiliar with the letter of scripture was rather a startling one o all ye that pass by the way hearken and see if there be sorrow like unto my sorrow wherewith the lord hath trodden me as in the wine press in the day of the wrath of his anger' margaret looked up quickly this seemed to her the very language of her own heart she at least was likely to be attentive perhaps no medieval preacher except bruno de malpas would even have thought of alluding to the literal and primary meaning of the words from the first moment of their joint existence jerusalem and rome have been enemies and rivals not content with so far as in her lay blotting out the very name of israel from under heaven rome has calmly arrogated to herself without even offering proof of it that right to the promises made to the fathers which saint paul tells us belongs in a higher and richer sense to the invisible church of christ than to the literal and visible israel but rome goes further than the apostle for in her anxiety to claim the higher sense for herself she denies the lower altogether no romanist will hear with patience of any national restoration of israel and whether the anglo israelite theory be true or false it is certainly as a theory exceedingly unpalatable to rome with respect moreover to this particular passage it had become so customary to refer it to the sufferings of christ that its original application to the destruction of jerusalem had been almost forgotten but here bruno's jewish proclivities stood him in good stead he delighted beatrice by fully stating the original reference of the passage but then he went on to say that it was no longer applicable to the babylonish captivity since that time there had been another sorrow to which the sufferings of israel were not to be compared to which no affliction ever suffered by humanity could be comparable for a moment he told them in words that burned of that three hours' darkness that might be felt of that eli eli lama sabachthani into which was more than concentrated every cry of human anguish since the beginning of the world and then he looked as it were straight into the heart's depths of every one of his hearers and he said to each one of those hearts this was your doing he told them that for every sin of every one among them that sacrifice was a sufficient atonement and that if for any one the atonement was not efficacious that was not christ's fault but his own there was room at the marriage supper for every pauper straying on the high way and if one of them were not there it would be because he had refused the invitation then bruno turned to the other half of his subject and remarked that every man and woman was tempted to think that there was no sorrow like to his sorrow yet there was a balm for all sorrow but it was only to be had at one place the bridge which had been strong enough to bear the weight of christ and his cross carrying with him all the sins and sorrows of all the world for ever would be strong enough to bear any sorrow of theirs but so long as man persisted in saying my will be done he must not imagine that god would waste mercy in helping him not my will but thine must always precede the sending of the strengthening angel and lastly he reminded them that god sent grief to them for their own sakes it was not for his sake it gave him no pleasure nay it grieved him when he had to afflict the children of men it was the medicine without which they could not recover health and he always gave the right remedy in the right quantities and at the right time and now said bruno at last ye into whose hands the great physician hath put this wholesome yet bitter cup how are ye going to treat it will ye dash it down and say i will have none of this remedy' for the end of that is death the death eternal will ye drink it only because ye have no choice with a wry face and a bitter tongue blaspheming the hand that gives it it will do you no good then it will work for evil or will ye take it meekly with thanksgiving on your lips though there be tears in your eyes knowing that his will is better than yours and that he who bore for you the pangs that no man can know is not likely to give you any bitterness that he can spare you trust me the thanksgivings that god loves best are those sobbed from lips that cannot keep still for sorrow and brethren there is no sorrow in heaven death there shall be no more neither sorrow nor crying nor pain shall be any more' note we who are christ's shall be there before long he ended thus almost abruptly the chapel was empty and the congregation were critical earl hubert thought that father bruno had a good flow of language and could preach an excellent discourse the countess would have preferred a different subject it was so melancholy sir john thought it a pity that man had been wasted on the church hawise supposed that he had said just what was proper beatrice wished he would preach every day eva was astonished at her did she really like to listen to such dolorous stuff as that doucebelle wondered that any one should think it dolorous she had enjoyed it very much marie confessed to having dropped asleep and dreamed that father bruno gave her a box of bonbons there was one of them who said nothing because her heart was too full for speech but the south wind had begun to blow upon the garden on that lonely and weary heart god had looked in his mercy that day and had said live too late for earthly life that was sapped at the root god knew that

by with outstretched hand too tired to hold him if he hold not me too tired to long but for one heavenly thing rest for the weary in the promised land permission for bruno to lay aside the habit of saint augustine reached bury castle very soon after his sermon and with it came two other items of news the one that bishop grosteste offered him a rich living in his diocese the other that the bishop's life had been attempted by poison it was not to be wondered at in the least since grosteste had coolly declared the reigning pope innocent to be an exact counterpart of anti christ for which the head of the church rewarded him by terming him a wicked old dotard and his attachment to monachism in general was never allowed to stand in the way of the sternest rebuke to disorderly monks in particular he also presumed to object to his clergy having constant recourse to jewish money lenders and especially interfered with their favourite amusement of amateur theatricals which he was so unreasonable as to think unbecoming the clerical office bruno hastened to the countess with the news accompanying it by warm thanks for the shelter afforded to himself and his daughter and informing her that he would no longer burden her with either but she looked very grave father bruno she said i have a boon to ask ask it freely lady i am bound to you in all ways then i beg that you and beatrice will continue here so long ha chetife so long as my child lives father bruno gravely assented he knew too well that would not be long yet it proved longer than either of them anticipated stormy times were at hand the papal legate had effected between earl hubert and the bishop of winchester a reconciliation which resembled a quiescent volcano but hubert was put into a position of sore peril by his royal brother in law of scotland who coolly sent an embassy to king henry demanding as his right that the three northernmost counties of england should be peaceably resigned to him after putting him off for a time by an evasive message king henry consented to meet alexander at york and discuss the questions on which they differed his britannic majesty was still vexing his nobles by the favour he showed to foreigners at this time he demanded a subsidy of one thirtieth of all the property in the kingdom which they were by no means inclined to give him as a sop to cerberus the king promised thenceforth to abide by the advice of his native nobility and the subsidy was voted but his next step was to invite his father in law the count of provence and to shower upon him the gold so unwillingly granted the nobles were more angry than ever and the king's own brother richard earl of cornwall was the first to remonstrate then archbishop edmund of canterbury took a journey to rome and declined to return even when recalled by the legate but the grand event of that year was the final disruption of christendom the greek church had many a time quarrelled with the latin chiefly on two heads the worship of images and the assumption of universal primacy on the first count they differed with very little distinction since the greek church allowed the full worship of pictures but anathematised every body who paid reverence to statues a rather odd state of things to protestant eyes once already the eastern church had seceded but the quarrel was patched up again but after the secession of there was never to be peace between east and west again the new year came in with a royal marriage there were curious circumstances attending it for the parties married in spite of the king who was obliged to give away the bride his sister alianora right sore against his will and though the bride had taken the vow of perpetual widowhood note they did not trouble themselves about a papal dispensation till they had been married for some weeks the bridegroom was the young frenchman sir simon de montfort whom the king at last came to fear more than thunder and lightning the english nobility were extremely displeased for they considered that the princess had been married beneath her dignity but since from first to last she had had her own wilful way it was rather unreasonable in the nobles to vent their wrath upon the king they rose against him furiously headed by his own brother and by the husband of the princess marjory of scotland till at last the royal standard was deserted by all but one man that true and loyal patriot hubert earl of kent the man whom no oppression could alienate from the throne and whom no cruelty could silence when he thought england in danger but now his prestige was on the wane the nobles were not afraid of him on account of his old age his wisdom and a vow which he had taken never to bear arms again in vain king henry appealed privately to every peer asking if his fidelity might be relied on from every side defiant messages came back the citizens of london as their wont was were exceptionally disloyal then he sent the legate to his brother urging peace cornwall refused to listen at last driven into a corner the king begged for time and it was granted him until the first monday in lent when that day came the nobles assembled in grand force at london to come to a very lame and impotent conclusion earl richard of cornwall the king's brother suddenly announced that he and his new brother in law montfort had effected a complete reconciliation the other nobles were very angry at the desertion of their leader and accused him perhaps not untruly of having been bribed into this conduct for cornwall was quite as extravagant and nearly as acquisitive as his royal brother just at this time died joan queen of scotland the eldest sister of king henry of rapid decline while on her way home from england and her death was quickly followed by that of hubert's great enemy the bishop of winchester the filling up of the vacant see caused one of the frequent struggles between england and rome the chapter of winchester wished to have the bishop of chichester the king was determined to appoint the queen's uncle guglielmo of savoy and as he often did to gain his ends henry sided with rome against his own people the disruption between the greek and latin churches being now an accomplished fact the archbishop of antioch went the length of excommunicating the pope and the whole roman church asserting that if there were to be a supreme pontiff he had the better claim to the title this event caused a disruption on a small scale in margaret's bower where beatrice scandalised the fair community by wanting to know why the pope should not be excommunicated if he deserved it excommunicate the head of the church said hawise in a horrified tone well but here are two churches persisted beatrice if the pope can excommunicate the archbishop what is to prevent the archbishop from excommunicating the pope poor creature said hawise pityingly the eastern schism is no church added eva oh i do wish some of you would tell me what you mean by a church exclaimed beatrice earnestly laying down her work what makes one thing a church and another a schism but that was just what nobody could tell her hawise leaped the chasm deftly by declaring it an improper question eva said si bete and declined to say more well i may be a fool said beatrice bluntly but i do not think you are much better if you cannot tell me of course i could tell thee if i chose answered eva with lofty scorn then why dost thou not was the unanswerable reply eva did not deign to respond but when bruno next appeared beatrice put her question the church is what christ builds on himself a schism is bred in man's brain contrary to holy scripture in saying which bruno only quoted bishop grosteste but seeing men are fallible how then can any human system claim to be at all times the church asked beatrice the true church is not a human system at all said he father beatrice actually fancies that the archbishop of antioch could excommunicate the holy father observed hawise in tones of horror i suppose any authority can excommunicate those below him in the church visible said bruno calmly in the invisible jerusalem above which is the mother of us all none excommunicates but god every branch in me not fruit bearing he taketh it away' my daughters it would do us more good to bear that in mind than to blame either the pope or the archbishop and he walked away as was his wont when he had delivered his sentence that afternoon the countess sent for beatrice and doucebelle to her own bower they found her seated by the window with unusually idle hands and an expression of sore disturbance on her fair serene face there is bad news come my damsels she said when the girls had made their courtesies and i do not know how to tell my magot perhaps one of you might manage it better than i could and she had better be told for she is sure to hear it in some way and i would fain spare the child all i can about sir richard the earl lady asked beatrice yes of course he is married beatrice to whom lady asked beatrice calmly but doucebelle uttered an ejaculation under her breath to maud daughter of sir john de lacy the earl of lincoln it is no fault of his poor boy the lord king would have it so and the king has made a good thing of it for i hear that the earl of lincoln has given him above three thousand gold pennies to have the marriage and has remitted a debt of thirteen hundred more a good thing for him and it may be quite as well for richard but my poor child i cannot understand how it is that she does not rouse up and forget her disappointment it is very strange it was very strange to the mother who loved margaret so dearly and yet understood her so little but doucebelle silently thought that any thing else would have been yet stranger and you would have us tell her lady it would be as well really i cannot the substratum was showing itself for a moment in the character of the countess dulcie would do it better than i said beatrice i am a bad hand at beating about the bush i might do it too bluntly then dulcie do tell her pleaded the countess very well lady but all doucebelle's unselfishness did not prevent her from feeling that she would almost rather have had any thing else to do she went back slowly to margaret's bower tenanted at that moment by no one but its owner margaret looked up as doucebelle entered and read her face as easily as possible evil tidings she said quietly enough for thee or for me dulcie doucebelle came and knelt beside her for me then margaret's voice trembled a little go on dulcie richard she could imagine no evil tidings except as associated with him doucebelle conquered her unwillingness to speak by a strong effort yes dear margaret it is about him the is he dead asked margaret hurriedly no i thought if it had been that she hesitated margaret didst thou not expect something more to happen something what i see and her tone changed it is marriage yes sir richard is married to no don't tell me to whom i am afraid i should hate her and i do not want to do that doucebelle was silent was it his doing asked margaret in a low voice or did the lord king order it oh it was the lord king's doing entirely the lady says o dulcie i ought to wish it were his because there would be more likelihood of his being happy but i cannot i cannot my poor margaret i do not wonder answered doucebelle tenderly is it very wicked added margaret in a voice of deep pain not to be able to wish him to be happy without me it is so hard dulcie to be shut out from the warmth and the sunlight and to see some one else let in i suppose that is a selfish feeling but it is so hard my poor darling was all that doucebelle could say father bruno said that so long as we kept saying my will be done' we must not expect god to comfort us yet how are we to give over o dulcie i thought i was beginning to submit and this has stirred all up again my heart cries out and says this shall not be i will not have it so' and if god will have it so how am i to learn to bend my will to his neither of the girls had heard any one enter and they were a little startled when a third voice replied none but himself can teach thee that my daughter if thou canst not yet give him thy will ask him to take it in spite of thee i have done that already father bruno then thou mayest rest assured that he will do all that is lacking that night bruno said to beatrice that poor dear child i am sure god is teaching her but to day's news has driven another nail into her coffin would it have been easier or harder if the veil could have been lifted which hid from margaret the interior of gloucester castle to the eyes of the world outside the young earl behaved like any other bridegroom he brought the lady maud to his home placed her in sumptuous apartments surrounded her with obsequious attendants provided her with all the comforts and luxuries of life but there his attentions ended for four years his step never crossed the threshold of the tower where she resided and they met only on ceremonial occasions wife she never was to him until for twelve months the cold stones of westminster abbey had lain over the fair head of his margaret the one love of his tried and faithful heart having now completed the wreck of these two young lives his majesty considerately intimated to richard de clare that in return for the unusual favours which had been showered upon him he only asked of him to feel supremely happy and to be devoted to his royal service for the term of his natural life only how often it is the case that we imagine our friends to be blessing us with every fibre of their hearts when it is all that they can do to pray for grace to enable them to forgive us not that richard did any thing of the kind so far from it that he registered a vow in heaven that if ever the power to do it should fall into his hands he would repay that debt an hundredfold the two chaplains of the earl had shown no interest whatever in margaret and her troubles father warner despised all human affections of whatever kind with the intensity of a nature at once cold and narrow father nicholas was of a far kindlier disposition but he was completely engrossed with another subject alchemy was reviving the endless search for the philosopher's stone the elixir of life and other equally desirable and unattainable objects had once more begun to engage the energies of scientific men the real end which they were approaching was the invention of gunpowder which can hardly be termed a blessing to the world at large but father nicholas fell into the snare and was soon absolutely convinced that only one ingredient was wanting to enable him to discover the elixir of life that one ingredient of priceless value remains undiscovered in the nineteenth century yet one thing must be said for these medieval philosophers that except in the way of spending money they injured none but themselves their search for the secret of life did not involve the wanton torture of helpless creatures nor did their boasted knowledge lead them to the idiotic conclusion that they were the descendants of a jelly fish oh this much extolled wise learned supercilious nineteenth century is it so very much the superior of all its predecessors as it complacently assumes to be king alexander of scotland married his second wife in the may of to the great satisfaction of his sisters the countess of kent thought that such news as this really ought to make margaret cheer up and she was rather perplexed which doucebelle was not by any means at the discovery that all the gossip on that subject seemed only to increase her sadness an eclipse of the sun which occurred on the third of june alarmed the countess considerably some dreadful news might reasonably be expected after that but no worse occurrence from her point of view happened than the birth of a prince afterwards to be edward the first who has been termed the greatest of all the plantagenets the occasion of the royal christening was eagerly seized upon as a delightful expedient for the replenishing of his exhausted treasury by the king who might not inappropriately be termed the least of the plantagenets messengers were sent with tidings of the auspicious event to all the peers and if the gifts with which they returned laden were not of the costliest description king henry dismissed them in disgrace god gave us this child exclaimed a blunt norman noble but the king sells him to us four days after the prince's birth came another event which to one at least in bury castle was enough to account for any portentous eclipse the countess found beatrice drowned in tears beatrice my dear maiden what aileth thee i have scarcely ever seen thee shed tears before the girl answered by a passionate gesture oh that mine head were waters and mine eyes a fountain of tears that i might weep day and night for the slain of the daughter of my people' ha chetife what is the matter lady there has been an awful slaughter of my people and she stood up and flung up her hands towards heaven in a manner which seemed to the countess worthy of some classic prophetess remember o adonai what is come upon us consider and behold our reproach' o god why hast thou cast us off for ever why doth thine anger smoke against the sheep of thy pasture we see not our signs there is no more any prophet' arise o adonai judge the earth for thou shalt inherit all nations' the countess stood mute before this unparalleled outburst she could not comprehend it my child i do not understand she said kindly enough has some relative of thine been murdered how shocking are not all my people kindred of mine exclaimed beatrice passionately dost thou mean the massacre of the jews in london said the countess as the truth suddenly flashed upon her oh yes i did hear of some such dreadful affair but my dear remember thou art now a de malpas thou shouldst try to forget thine unfortunate connection with that low race they are not thy people any longer beatrice looked up with flashing eyes from which some stronger feeling than sorrow had suddenly driven back the tears if i forget thee o jerusalem let my right hand forget her cunning' lady thou canst not fathom the heart of a jew no christian can we are brethren for ever and you call my nationality unfortunate and low know that i look upon that half of my blood as the king does upon his crown yea as the lord dees upon his people we are thine thou never barest rule over them they were not called by thy name' but you do not understand lady no it is very strange replied the countess in a dubious tone jews do not seem to understand their position it is odd but dry thine eyes my dear child thou wilt make thyself ill and really the countess was too kind to finish the sentence but beatrice could guess that she thought there was really nothing to weep over in the massacre of a few scores of jews she found little sympathy among the younger members of the family party margaret said she was sorry but it was evidently for the fact that her friend was in trouble not for the event over which she was sorrowing eva openly expressed profound scorn of both the jews and the sorrow marie wanted to know if some friend of beatrice were among the slain because if not why should she care any thing about it doucebelle alone seemed capable of a little sympathy but before the evening was over beatrice found there was one christian who could enter into all her feelings she was slowly crossing the ante chamber in the twilight when she found herself intercepted and drawn into bruno's arms my darling he said tenderly i am sent to thee with heavy tidings poor beatrice laid her tired head on her father's breast with the feeling that she had one friend left in the world i know it dear father but it is such a comfort that you feel it with me there are not many who will i can guess answered bruno but my child i am afraid thou dost not know all father what is it asked beatrice fearfully one has fallen in that massacre very dear to thee and me my daughter delecresse she thought him the most likely to be in london of any of the family no delecresse is safe so far as i know is it uncle moss or levi my cousin beatrice it is abraham the son of ursel the father of us all the low cry of utter desolation which broke from the girl's lips was pitiful to hear my father my father the chariot of israel and the horsemen thereof' bruno let her weep passionately until the first burst of grief was over then he said gently be comforted my beatrice i believe that he sleeps in jesus and that god shall bring him with him he was not baptised asked beatrice in some surprise that bruno should think so he was ready for it he had spoken to a friend of mine one friar saher de kilvingholme on the subject and the lord would not refuse to receive him because his brow had not been touched by water when he had baptised him with the holy ghost and with fire perhaps scarcely any priest then living bruno excepted would have ventured so far as to say that oh this is a weary world sighed beatrice drearily it is not the only one replied her father it seems as if we were born only to die nay my child we were born to live for ever those have death who choose it a great many seem to choose it a great many said bruno sadly father said beatrice after a short silence as a man grows older and wiser do you think that he comes to understand any better the reason of the dark doings of providence can you see any light upon them which you did not of old no my child i think not was bruno's answer if any thing i should say they grow darker but we learn to trust beatrice it is not less dark when the child puts his hand confidingly in that of his father but his mind is the lighter for it we come to know our father better we learn to trust and wait what i do thou knowest not now but thou shalt know hereafter' and he has told us that in that land where we are to know even as we are known we shall be satisfied satisfied with his dealings then let us be satisfied with him here and now it is dark said beatrice with a sob the morning cometh' replied bruno and in the morning is gladness' beatrice stood still and silent for some minutes only a slight sob now and then showing the storm through which she had passed at last in a low troubled voice she said there is no one to call me belasez now bruno clasped her closer my darling he said so long as the lord spares us to each other thou wilt always be belle assez for me note she was the young widow of william earl of pembroke the eldest brother of the husband of marjory of scotland chapter fifteen at last joy for the freed one she might not stay when the crown had fallen from her life away she might not linger a weary thing a dove with no home for its broken wing thrown on the harshness of alien skies that know not its own land's melodies from the long heart withering early gone she hath lived she hath loved her task is done felicia hemans now sir john de averenches what on earth dost thou want is there no room damsel room there is room enough for thee i dare say replied eva rather contemptuously she looked down on sir john supremely for four reasons which in her own eyes at least were excellent ones first he was rather short secondly he was very silent thirdly he was not particularly handsome and lastly and of most import he had remained proof against all eva's attractions i thank thee was all he said now and he walked into margaret's bower where he took a seat on the extreme end of the settle and never said a word to any body whilst he stayed the absurd creature exclaimed eva when he was gone what an absolute ass he is he has not an idea in his head oh i beg thy pardon eva interposed marie rather warmly he's plenty of ideas he'll talk if one talks to him thou never dost he is clever enough to please thee very likely was the rather snappish answer from that evening sir john de averenches took to frequenting the bower occasionally much to the annoyance of eva until the happy thought struck her that she might have captivated him at last mentally binding him to her chariot wheels she made no further objection but on the contrary became so amiable that the shrewd little marie noticed the alteration well eva is queer said that acute young lady she goes into the sulks if sir william de cantilupe so much as looks at any body but she does not care how many people she looks at i think she should be jealous on both sides eva's amenities however seemed to have no more effect on sir john than her displeasure night after night there he sat never speaking to any one and apparently not noticing one more than another he's going out of his mind suggested marie not he said eva he's none to go out of the mystery was left unsolved except by bruno who fancied that he guessed its meaning but since the clue was one which he preferred not to pursue he discreetly left matters to shape themselves or rather to be shaped by providence when the time should come that was a dreary winter altogether the king had openly insulted his sister and montfort when they made their appearance at the ceremony of the queen's up rising churching and they had left england pocketing the affront but as concerned montfort by no means forgetting it the pope made further encroachments on the liberties of the church of england by sending over a horde of italians to fill vacant benefices the nobles blazed out into open wrath that the pope through avarice should deprive them of their ancient right to the patronage of livings they were headed as usual by the king's brother richard earl of cornwall who seems to have been not a true living christian as there is reason to believe his son was but simply a political opponent of the aggressions of rome the citizens of london were about equally disgusted with the king who at this time received a visit from the queen's uncle tomaso of savoy and in his delight his majesty commanded his loyal and grumbling subjects to remove all dirt from the streets and to meet the count in gala clothing and with horses handsomely accoutred the hint thrown out by levina had not been lost on the countess she thought a complete change might do good to the fading flower which was only too patently withering on its stem and at her instance the whole household removed to westminster at the beginning of this winter they had hardly settled down in their new abode when a fresh storm broke on the now aged head of earl hubert once more all the old worn out charges were trumped up including even that by which the princess margaret's name had been so cruelly aspersed a flash of the early fire of the old man blazed forth when the accusation was made i was never a traitor to you nor to your father said hubert de burgh facing his ungrateful king and pupil of long ago if i had been under god you would never have been here it was true and henry knew it best of all men the king in the fulness of his compassionate grace was pleased to let the earl off very lightly the sentence passed was that he should only resign the four most valuable castles that he had this of course was not because hubert was guilty but because his majesty was covetous chateau blanc grosmond skenefrith and hatfield were given up to the crown hubert bore it we are told very quietly and patiently his own time could not be long now for he was at least seventy and the benjamin of his love was dying of a broken heart king henry himself was not without sorrow for about all saints' day guglielmo of savoy the beloved uncle who had moulded him like wax died rather suddenly at viterbo so grieved was the king that he tore his royal mantle from his shoulders and flung it into the fire with that sudden and passionate reaction to the other side often seen in weak natures he now threw himself into the arms of the predicants and minorites until he set up a new favourite who was not long in appearing before the winter was over a second sorrow fell upon richard de clare in the death of his mother isabel wife of the king's brother cornwall grieved bitterly both for the loss of his wife and for the miserable state into which england was sinking and declaring that he loved his country so much that he could not bear to stay and see it go to ruin he prepared to head a fresh crusade perhaps it did not occur to him that love and patriotism would have been shown better by staying at home and trying to keep his country from going to ruin that was reserved for another richard the young earl of gloucester another comet and a violent hurricane in the spring made the augurs shake their heads and prophesy worse calamities than ever there was a fresh one on the way in the shape of a papal exaction of one fifth of the property of foreign beneficed clerks in england in order to support the war then waged by the pope on the emperor of germany the royal council was stirred and told its listless master that he ought not to suffer england to become a spoil and a desolation to immigrants like a vineyard without a wall exposed to wild beasts his majesty like a true son of holy church replied that he neither wished nor dared to oppose the pope in any thing as if to make confusion worse confounded the archbishop of canterbury subsequently known as saint edmund of pontigny aspired to become a second becket and appealed to the pope to do away with state patronage which he of course considered ought to be vested in the primate king henry supine as he was was roused at last and sent a message to rome to the effect that the appeal of the archbishop was contrary to his royal dignity the pope declined to entertain the appeal and the king we are told by a monk became more tyrannical than ever and appointed bonifacio of savoy to the see of winchester the defeated archbishop submitted to the pope's demand of a fifth of his income but when the pope emboldened by success came to an agreement with the italian priests occupying english benefices that on condition of their helping him against the emperor all benefices in his gift should be bestowed upon italians the archbishop could bear no longer and he left england never to return he died at pontigny his birthplace on the sixteenth of november following and not long afterwards king henry reverently knelt to worship at the tomb of the saint note who had been a thorn in his side as long as he lived then the english abbots cruelly mulcted by the pope appealed to their natural sovereign to be met by a scowl and to hear the legate told that he might choose the best of the royal castles wherein to imprison them twenty four roman priests came over to fill english benefices and at last when the legate left england for which no one was sorry but the king it was calculated that with the exception of church plate he carried out of england more wealth than he left in it but in the halls of earl hubert at westminster all interest in outside calamities was lost in the inside as that spring drew on towards summer the blindest eyes could no longer refuse to see that the white lily had faded at last and the star was going out the trial of patience had been long for margaret but it was over now master aristoteles could not understand it the maiden had no disease that he could discover and to think that the blessed hair of saint dominic should have failed to restore her it was most unaccountable there was no word of complaint from the dying girl she no longer thought it strange that god should have made her young life short and bitter the lesson was learned at last so gradually her life went out that no one expected the end just when it came weaker and weaker she grew from day to day more unable to sit up to work to talk but the transition from life to death was so quiet that it was difficult for those around to realise how near it was margaret had risen and dressed every day but had lain outside her bed when dressed for the greater part of april it was may day now and in all the streets were may poles and may dancers singing and sunshine eva went out early with a staff of attendants to join in the festivities why what good can there be in my staying at home she said answering doucebelle's face margaret will not be any better because i am here and then when i come in at night i can tell her all about it and it is no use talking doucebelle i really cannot bear this sort of thing i get so melancholy you have no idea i don't know what would become of me if i had not some diversion beatrice and doucebelle stayed with margaret doucebelle from a sort of inward sensation she hardly knew what or why beatrice from a remark made by bruno the night before it will not be long now at least he had said the day wore slowly on but it seemed just like twenty days which had preceded it bruno paid his daily visit towards evening are the streets very full of holiday makers asked margaret very full my daughter there is a great crowd round the may pole i hope eva will enjoy herself i have no doubt she will it seems so far off now said margaret dreamily as if i were where i could hardly see it somewhere above this world and all the things that are in the world father have you any idea what there will be in heaven there will be christ answered bruno and what may be implied in his glory which god hath given him' our finite minds are scarcely capable of guessing only his will is that his people shall behold it and share it it must be something that he thinks worth seeing he who has beheld the glory of god before the worlds were father said margaret with deep feeling it seems too much that we should see it true but not too much that he should bestow it he gives as he forgives like a king like what king was the thought in doucebelle's mind not like the one of whom she knew any thing who was responsible before god for that death which was coming on so quietly yet so surely beatrice had left the room a few minutes before and she was now returning to it through the ante chamber the dusk was rapidly falling and not knowing of any presence but her own she was extremely startled to find herself grasped by the shoulder by a firm hand which evidently had no intention of standing any trifling she looked up into the face of a stranger and yet a face which was not altogether strange it was that of a tall handsome man with fair hair and a stern pained compression of brow and lips is it true he said in a husky voice is what true beatrice was too startled to think what he meant the grasp upon her shoulder tightened till a weaker woman would have screamed belasez do not trifle with me is she dying and then all at once beatrice knew who it was that asked her it is too true sir richard she said sadly pityingly with almost a reverential compassion for that faithful love which had brought him there that night i must see her belasez is it wise sir richard wise pardon me is it right right what is the wrong she is my wife in god's sight she and none other what do i care for pope or king is not god above both we plighted our vows to him and none but he could part us let me break it to her then said beatrice feeling scarcely so much convinced as overwhelmed it will startle her if she be not told beforehand richard's only answer was to release beatrice from his grasp she passed into margaret's bower and was surprised to see a strange gleam in the eyes of the dying girl beatrice richard is here i know i heard his voice bring him to me god has told her said bruno in an undertone as he left the room with a sign to beatrice and doucebelle to follow they stood in the ante chamber minute after minute but no sound came through the closed door half an hour passed in total silence at last bruno said i think some one should go in but no one liked to do it and the silence went on again then hawise same in and wanted to know what they were all doing there she was excessively shocked when doucebelle told her how extremely improper she must go in and put a stop to it that minute hawise tapped at the door but no answer came she opened it and stood silenced and frightened by what she saw richard de clare bent over the bed pouring passionate unanswered kisses upon dead violet eyes and tenderly smoothing the tresses of the cedar hair the lord has been here said beatrice involuntarily o lord be thanked that thou hast given thy child quiet rest at last was the response from bruno richard stood up and faced them is this god's doing or is it man's he said in a voice which sounded almost like an execration of some one god gave me this white dove to nestle in my bosom and to be the glory of my life who took her from me does one of you dare to say it was god it was man a man who shall pay for it if he coin his heart's blood to do so and if the payment cost my heart's blood it will be little matter seeing it has cost my heart already he drew his dagger and bending down again severed one of the long soft tresses of the cedar hair farewell my dove he murmured in a tone so altered that it was difficult to recognise the same voice thou at least shalt suffer no more thy place is with the blessed saints and the holy angels where nothing may ever enter that shall grieve or defile but surely as thou art safe housed in heaven and i am left desolate on earth thy death shall be avenged by fair means or by foul vengeance is mine i will repay saith the lord' softly quoted bruno as richard passed him in the doorway he will by my hands and richard de clare was seen no more it was hard to tell the poor mother who came into her margaret's bower with a bright smile guessing so little of the terrible news in store tenderly as they tried to break it she fainted away and had to be nursed back to life and diligently cared for but all was over for the night and doucebelle and beatrice were beginning to think of bed before eva made her appearance of course the news had to be told again oh dear how shocking said eva putting down her bouquet how very distressing i am afraid those flowers will never keep till morning well do you know i am really thankful i was not here what good could it have done poor dear margaret you know and i am so easily upset and so very sensitive i never can bear scenes of that sort dear i had no idea my shoes were so splashed as it is i shall not sleep a wink i sha'n't get over it for a week if i do then oh how very shocking look doucebelle aren't these cowslips sweet eva wilt thou let me have some of the white flowers for margaret said doucebelle for margaret why what dost thou mean oh to put by her in her coffin horrid really dulcie i think that is great waste and the bouquet is so nicely made up it would be such a pity to pull it to pieces i spent half an hour at least in putting it together and brimnatyn de hertiland helped me of course thou canst have them if thou must but doucebelle quietly declined the gift so doubtfully offered i wish doucebelle thou wouldst have more consideration for people's feelings said eva in a querulous tone smoothing the petals of her flowers i am sure whenever i look at a bouquet for the next twelvemonth i shall think of this i cannot help it things do take such hold of me and just think how easily all that might be avoided i beg thy pardon eva i am sorry i asked thee was the soft answer it was not far to margaret's grave for they laid her in the quiet cloisters of westminster abbey and the king who had been an accessory to her end followed her bier hers was not the only life that his act had shortened earl hubert had virtually done with earth when he saw lowered into the cold ground the coffin of his benjamin he survived her just two years and laid down his weary burden of life on the fourth of may when margaret was gone there was no further tie to bury castle for bruno and his daughter bishop grosteste was again applied to and responded as kindly as before though circumstances did not allow him to do it equally to his satisfaction the rich living originally offered to bruno had of course been filled up and there was nothing at that moment in the episcopal gift but some very small ones the best of these he gave and about two months after the death of margaret bruno and beatrice took leave of the countess and removed to their new home it was a quiet little hamlet in the south of lincolnshire with a population of barely three hundred souls and beatrice's time was filled up by different duties from those which had occupied her at bury castle the summer glided away in a peaceful round of most unexciting events there had been so much excitement hitherto in their respective lives that the priest and his daughter were only too thankful for a calm stretch of life all to themselves one evening towards the close of summer as bruno came home to his little parsonage where the dog roses looked in at the windows and the honeysuckles climbed round the porch a sight met him which assured him that his period of peace and content was ended on the stone bench in the porch alone intently examining a honeysuckle sat sir john de averenches bruno de malpas was much too shrewd to suppose that his society was the magnet which had attracted the silent youth some fifty miles across the country he sighed but resigning himself to the inevitable lifted his biretta as he came up to the door sir john rose and greeted him with evident cordiality but he did not appear to have any thing particular to say beyond two self evident statements that it was a fine evening and the honeysuckles were pretty is beatrice within said the priest feeling pretty sure that he knew sir john demurely thought not it was another half hour before beatrice made her appearance and bruno noticed that the unexpected presence of a third person evoked no expression of surprise on her part the preparations for supper were made by beatrice and her attendant handmaiden sabina and after the meal was over bruno discreetly went off with the interesting observation that he was about to visit a sick person at the furthest part of the parish sir john had taken his seat on the extreme end of a form and beatrice came and sat with her embroidery at the other end ten minutes of profound silence intervened beatrice yes another minute of silence beatrice well beatrice what dost thou think of me beatrice coolly cut off an end of yellow silk and threaded her needle with blue ask my father how does he know what thou thinkest well he always does said beatrice calmly fastening the blue silk on the wrong side of the material wilt thou not tell me thyself i should if i wanted to be rid of thee the distance between the two occupants of the form was materially lessened then thou dost not want to be rid of me i can work while i am talking replied beatrice in her very coolest manner why dost thou think i came beatrice because it pleased thee i should think the needle was drawn from the blue silk and a needleful of scarlet went in instead while the end of the blue thread was carefully secured in beatrice's left hand for future use one two three four beatrice was half audibly counting her stitches it did please me beatrice five six all right sir john seven eight nine does it please thee thirteen fourteen it is pleasant to have some one to talk to fifteen sixteen when i am not counting seventeen eighteen nineteen and in went the needle and the scarlet silk began to flow in and out with rapidity do i interrupt thee beatrice thanks i have done counting for the present would it interrupt thee very much to be married well i should think it would beatrice stopped the scarlet and rethreaded the blue more than thou wouldst like that would depend on circumstances what circumstances inquired the bashful yet persistent suitor who was to marry me principally suppose i was thou canst not till thou hast asked my father there was a gleam in the dark eyes veiled with their long lashes it might be either resentment or fun may i ask him beatrice did i not tell thee so at first this curious conversation had taken so long and had been interrupted by so many pauses that bruno appeared before it had progressed further he glanced at the pair with some amusement in his eyes not unmixed with sadness for he had a decided foreboding that he was about to lose his beatrice but no more was said that night the next morning sir john de averenches made the formal appeal which bruno was fully expecting i am not good at words father he said with honest manliness and i know the maiden is fair beyond many you may easily look higher for her but you will not easily find one that loves her better truly my son that is mine own belief said bruno but hast thou fully understood that she is of jewish descent which many christian knights would count a blot on their escocheons being a christian that makes no difference to me well she shall decide for herself but i fancy i know what she will say it will be hard to part with her why should you father will she not still want a confessor and could she have a better than you thank you father said beatrice demurely when bruno told her that his consent was given contingent upon hers then i will begin my wedding dress in this extremely cool manner the fair maiden intimated her intention of becoming a matron but bruno who knew every change of her features and colour was well aware that she felt a great deal more than she said the mask was soon dropped the wedding dress was a marvel of her own lovely embroidery it was worn about the beginning of winter and once more bruno resigned his parish duties and became as his son in law had wisely suggested a family confessor they heard from bury that the marriage of eva de braose took place about the same time and the general opinion in the lincolnshire parsonage was rather as respected sir william de cantilupe one of condolence than of congratulation eighteen years after that summer a solitary traveller was approaching the city of tewkesbury he sat down on a low wall which skirted the road and wiped his heated brow he was a tall fine looking man with a dark olive complexion and clustering masses of black hair there was no one in sight and the traveller began to talk in an undertone to himself as solitary men are sometimes wont to do a good two hours before sunset i suppose he said looking towards the sun which was blazing fiercely pugh where does that horrid smell come from ah that is the vesper bell as they call it the unclean beasts that they are well we at least are pure from every shadow of idolatry yet are we pure from sin i do think now it was a pity a mistake that visit of mine to sir piers de rievaulx i might have let that girl live the girl that belasez loved well she is one of the creeping things now she our belasez this is a cross grained crooked sort of world faugh that smell again i suppose this is the wall of tewkesbury castle is my lord the earl at home i wonder how i did hate that boy what is coming yonder with those jingling bells a string of pilgrims to some accursed shrine most likely may these heathen idolaters be all confounded and the chosen people of adonai be brought home in peace i could see i dare say if i stood on the wall they may have some vile idol with them and if i do not get out of the way he had sprung upon the parapet and stood trying so to twist himself as to catch a glimpse of the religious procession which he supposed to be approaching when suddenly he slipped and fell backwards a wild cry for help rang through the startled air where was he going down down plunging overhead into some soft evil odoured horrible mass from which by grasping an iron bar that projected above he just managed so far to raise himself as to get his head free and then the dreadful truth broke upon him and his cries for help became piercing delecresse had fallen into the open cess pool of tewkesbury castle suddenly he ceased to shriek and all was still not that he needed help any the less nor that he was less conscious of it but because he remembered what at first he had forgotten in his terror and disgust that until sunset it was the rest of the holy sabbath unto the lord perhaps by clinging to the iron bar he could live till the sun dropped below the horizon at any rate delecresse sternest of pharisees to his heart's core would not profane the sabbath even for life but now there was a little stir outside and a voice shouted what ho who cried for help i who art thou and where i have fallen into the cess pool i pray thee friend whoever thou art to bring or send me something on which i can rest till sunset and then help me forth the saints be blessed a jolly place to fall into but why in the name of all the calendar dost thou want to wait till sunset because i am a jew and until then is the holy sabbath a peal of laughter answered the explanation hope thou mayest enjoy it well if ever i heard such nonsense is it worth while pulling a jew out what sayest thou anselm he is a man poor soul returned a second voice nay let us not leave him to such a death as that look here old jew i will go and fetch a ladder and rope i should pull my dog out of that hole and perhaps thou mayest be as good i will not be taken out till sunset returned delecresse stubbornly the fellow's a mule hie thee anselm and ask counsel of our gracious lord what we shall do a strange feeling crept over delecresse when he heard his fate for life or death thus placed in the hands of the man whose life he had wrecked anselm was heard to run off quickly and in a few minutes he returned sir richard the earl laughed a jolly laugh when i told him was his report he saith let the cur be if he will not be plucked forth until monday morning for if saturday be his sabbath sunday is mine and what will defile the one will defile the other this part of the story is historical monday morning he will be a dead man hours before that so he will it cannot be helped except jew wilt thou be pulled out now or not if not now then not at all for one moment the heart of delecresse grew sick and faint within him as he contemplated the awful alternatives presented to his choice then gathering all his strength he shouted back his final decision no i will not break the sabbath of my god the men outside laughed uttered an expression of contemptuous pity and he heard their footsteps grow faint in the distance and knew that he was left to die as horrible a death as can befall humanity only one other cry arose and that was not for the ears of men it was the prayer of one in utter error yet in terrible extremity and it was honestly sincere adonai i have sinned and done evil all my life long specially i have sinned against this man who has left me to die here in this horrible place now therefore o my god i beseech thee let the sufferings of thy servant be accepted before thee as an atonement for his sin and let this one good deed that i have preferred death rather than break thy law rise before thee as the incense with the evening sacrifice yes it was utter error yet the christians of his day one here and there excepted could have taught him no better and what had they offered him instead idol worship woman worship offerings for the dead every thing which the law of god had forbidden in the day when the blood of the martyrs is demanded at the hand of babylon will there be no reckoning for the souls of those thousand sons of israel whom she has persistently thrust away from christ by erecting a rood screen of idols between him and them when day dawned on the monday they pulled out of the cess pool the body of a dead man one month later in the chapter house at canterbury king henry the third stood an humble and helpless suppliant before his assembled barons there he was forced utterly against his will and wish to sign an additional charter granting liberties to england and binding his own hands it was simon de montfort who had brought matters to this pass but simon de montfort was not the tall fair stately man who forced the pen into the unwilling fingers of the cowering king and who held out the evangelisterium for the swearing of his hated oath king henry looked up into the cold steel like glitter of those stern blue eyes and the firm set expression of the compressed lips and realised in an instant that in this man he would find neither misgiving nor mercy it was a great perplexity to him that the man on whom he had showered such favours should thus take part against him he had forgotten all about that april morning twenty three years before and had no conception that between himself and the eyes of richard de clare floated a shadow like an angel's with bright hair nor that when that scene in the chapter house was over and richard returned his good damascus blade to its scabbard he murmured within his heart to ears that heard not i have avenged thee at last but richard never knew that his heaviest vengeance had been exacted one month sooner when with that bitter mirth which anselm had misnamed he left an unknown jew to perish in misery the sun was setting that evening over lincoln just on the rise of steephill stood a handsome norman house with a garden stretching behind in the garden on a stone settle sat an old priest and a very handsome middle aged lady two young sisters were wandering about the garden with their arms round each other's waists a young man stood at the ornamental fountain talking playfully to the hawk upon his wrist while on the grass at the lady's feet sat two pretty children their laps full of flowers a conversation which had been running was evidently coming to a conclusion then you think father that it is never lawful under any circumstances to do evil that good may come god can bring good out of evil my beatrice but it is one of his prerogatives note rot

conteville and his wife arlette mother of william the conqueror was probably born about and created justiciary of england june he was also lord chancellor and lord chamberlain with abundance of smaller offices he was created earl of kent february after all the strange vicissitudes through which he had passed it seems almost surprising that he was allowed to die in his bed at banstead may

married geoffrey de mandeville earl of essex to whom she was sold by the husband who had repudiated her for the sum of twenty thousand marks in in the wars of the barons she threw all her influence into the scale against the king but she showed that her enmity was personal not political by at once returning to her allegiance on the accession of henry the third she was then given in marriage to hubert de burgh into whose hands the manor of walden was delivered as part of her dower august the marriage probably took place shortly before that date and certainly before the th of september isabel was hubert's wife for so short a time that some writers have doubted the fact of the marriage altogether but it is amply authenticated she was dead on the th of november following as the close rolls bear witness and the obituary of canterbury cathedral and the chronicle of rochester agree in stating that she died october she was buried in canterbury cathedral d margaret eldest daughter of william

granted to brother john may therefore died shortly before that date most writers attribute to earl hubert another daughter whom they call magotta but the rolls show no evidence of any daughter but margaret magotta or magot is manifestly a latinism of margot the french diminutive for margaret the earl's gifts to monasteries for the souls of himself and relatives include m his daughter but make no mention of two and the grants made by the king to earl hubert and margaret his wife and margaret their daughter certainly imply that margaret was the sole heir of her mother character inferentially

historical so far as their existence is concerned but the characters ascribed to them are imaginary the dreadful end of delecresse is thus far true that a jew was thus treated by richard de clare but who it really was who revealed to king henry the clandestine marriage of richard and margaret is one of the inscrutable mysteries of which no evidence remains

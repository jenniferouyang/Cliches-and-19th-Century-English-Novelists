the white lady of hazelwood by emily sarah holt her is another of emily holts books set in the middle ages this time at the end of the fourteenth century we are kept constantly aware of this by the quaint words and expressions the players in the drama are always using many of these phrases have dropped out of the language but sometimes the usage is very illuminating as we can see how we got some modern expression or spelling on the whole in this story life goes on quite evenly with not too many of those murders that aspiring members of the noblest families of england used to perpetrate in those days the heroine of the story is the white lady the countess of montfort who had fought bravely to bring her son back to power but who was then ignored by him for many years until her death for that reason the story is very moving one part of the story i liked very much was when a mercer a dealer in rich cloths is trying to tempt his customers to buy his wares the variety of his goods and the prices of them make one realise what a wealthy trade he was engaged in the white lady of hazelwood by emily sarah holt preface on the crowded canvas of the fourteenth century stands out as one of its most prominent figures that of the warrior countess of montfort no reader of froissarts chronicle can forget the siege of hennebon and the valiant part she played in the defence of her sons dominions actuated by more personal motives than the peasant maid she was nevertheless the joan of arc of her day and of bretagne what became of her after the restoration of her son we see no more of that brave and tender mother she drops into oblivion her work was done those who have thought again of her at all have accepted without question the only extant answerthe poor response of a contemporary romance according to which she dwelt in peace and closed an honoured and cherished life in a castle in the duchy of her loving and grateful son it has been reserved for the present day to find the true replyto draw back the veil from the bitter close of all and to show that the hardest part of her work began when she laid down her sword and the ending years of her life were the saddest and weariest portion never since the days of lear has such a tale been told of a parents sacrifice and of a childs ingratitude in the royal home of the duke of bretagne there was no room for her but for whose love and care he would have been a homeless fugitive the discarded mother was imprisoned in a foreign land and left to die let us hope that as it is supposed in the story the lonely broken heart turned to a truer love than that of her cherished and cruel son even to his who says my mother of all aged women who seek to do the will of god and who will never forsake them that trust in him chapter one at the pattymakers shop man wishes to be lovedexpects to be so and yet how few live so as to be loved rev horatius bonar dd it was a warm afternoon in the beginning of julywarm everywhere and particularly so in the house of master robert altham the pattymaker who lived at the corner of saint martins lane where it runs down into the strand shall we look along the strand for the time is five hundred years ago and the strand was then a very different place from the street as we know it now in the first place trafalgar square had no being below where it was to be in the far future stood charing crossthe real eleanor cross of charing a fine gothic structureand four streets converged upon it that to the northwest parted almost directly into the hay market and hedge lane genuine country roads in which both the hay and the hedge had a real existence southwards ran king street down to westminster and northwards stood the large building of the kings mews where his majestys hawks were kept two hundred years later bluff king hal would turn out the hawks to make room for his horses but as yet the word mews had its proper signification of a place where hawks were mewed or confined at the corner of the mews between it and the pattymakers ran up saint martins lane its western boundary being the long blank wall of the mews and its eastern a few houses and then saint martins church along the strand eastwards were stately private houses on the right hand and shops upon the left just below the cross further to the south was scotland yard the site of the ancient palace of king david of scotland and still bearing traces of its former grandeur then came the priory of saint mary rouncival the town houses of six bishops the superb mansion of the earl of arundel and the house of the bishops of exeter interspersed with smaller dwellings here and there a long row of these stretched between durham place and worcester place behind which with its face to the river stood the magnificent palace of the savoy the city habitation of john of gaunt duke of lancaster eldest surviving son of the reigning king the strand was far narrower than now and the two churches instead of being in the middle broke the monotony of the rows of houses on the north side let us look more especially at the long row which ran unbroken from the corner of saint martins lane to the first church that of our lady and the holy innocents atte stronde what would first strike the eye was the signboards gaily painted and swinging in the summer breeze every house had one for there were no numbers and these served the purpose consequently no two similar ones must be near each other people directed letters to master robert altham at the katherine wheel by saint martins church nigh the kings mews when they had any to write but letters except to people in high life or in official positions were very rare articles and master altham had not received a full dozen in all the sevenandtwenty years that he had lived in the strand and made patties next door to him was john arnold the bookbinder who displayed a saracens head upon his signboard then came in regular order julian walton the mercer with a wheelbarrow stephen fronsard the girdler with a cardinals hat john silverton the pelter or furrier with a star peter swan the court broiderer with crosskeys john morstowe the luminer or illuminator of books with a rose lionel de ferre the french baker with a vine herman goldsmith the court goldsmith who bore a dolphin william alberton the forcermonger who kept what we should call a fancy shop for little boxes baskets etcetera and exhibited a fleurdelis michael ladychapman who sported a unicorn and sold goloshes joel garlickmonger at the white horse who dealt in the fragrant vegetable whence he derived his name and theobald atte home the hatter who being of a poetical disposition displayed a landscape entitled as was well understood the harts bourne beyond these stretched far away to the east other shopsthose of a mealman a lapidary a cordwainernamely a shoemaker a lindraper for they had not yet added the syllable which makes it linen a lorimer who dealt in bits and bridles a pouchmonger who sold bags and pockets a parchmentmaker a treaclemonger a spicer a chandler and a pepperer all four the representatives of our modern grocer an apothecary a scrivener who wrote for the numerous persons who could not write a fuller who cleaned clothes a tapiser who sold tapestry universally used for hangings of rooms a barber an armourer a spurrier a scourer a dyer a glover a turner a goldbeater an upholdester or upholsterer a toothdrawer a bucklermaker a fletcher who feathered arrows a poulter or poulterer a vinter or winemerchant a pewterer a haberdasher a pinner or pinmaker a skinner a hampermaker and a hosier the list might be prolonged through fifty other trades but we have reached temple bar so few houses between saint martins lane and temple bar yes so few ground was cheap and houses were low and it cost less to cover much ground than to build high only very exalted mansions had three floors and more than three were unknown even to imagination moreover the citizens of london had decided ideas of the garden order they did not crush their houses tight together as if to squeeze out another inch if possible though their streets were exceedingly narrow yet nearly every house had its little garden and behind that row to which we are paying particular attention ran le covent garden the abbot of westminsters private pleasure ground and on its southeast was auntrous garden bordered by the kings highway leading from the town of seint gylys to stronde crosse the town of seint gylys was quite a country place and as to such remote villages as blumonds bury or iseldon which we call bloomsbury and islington nobody thought of them in connection with london any more than with nottingham or durham the houses were much more picturesque than those of modern build there was no attempt at uniformity each man set his house down as it suited him and some thatches turned to the east and west while others fronted north and south there were few chimneys except in the larger houses and no shop windows a large wooden shutter fixed below the window covered it at night and in the day it was let down to hang tablewise as a counter whereon the goods sold by the owner were displayed the strand was one of the few chief streets where various trades congregated together usually every street had its special calling and every trade its own particular street some of the latter retain their significant names even yethosier lane cordwainer street bread street sopers lane the poultry silver street ironmongers lane and paternoster row in which last lived the textwriters and rosarymakers the mercers lived mainly in cheapside the drapers in lombard street they were mostly italians as the name shows the furriers in saint mary axe the fishmongers in knightriders street the brewers by the thames the butchers in eastcheap and the goldsmiths in guthrums now gutter lane but it is time to inquire what kind of patties were inviting the passerby on mr althams counter they were a very large variety oyster crab lobster anchovy and all kinds of fish sausagerolls jelly liver galantine and every sort of meat ginger honey cream fruit cheesecakes almond and lemon little open tarts called bry tarts made of literal cheese with a multitude of other articleseggs honey or sugar and spices and many another compound of multifarious and indigestible edibles for what number of incongruities palatable or sanitary did our forefathers not put together in a pie for one description of dainty however mr altham would have been asked on this july afternoon in vain he would have deemed it next door to sacrilege to heat his oven for a mince pie outside the charmed period between christmas eve and twelfth day on the afternoon in question mr altham stepped out of his door to speak with his neighbour the girdler and no sooner was he well out of the way than another person walked into it this was a youth of some eighteen years dressed in a very curious costume men did not affect black clothes then except in mourning and the taste of few led them to the sombre browns and decorous greys worn by most now this young gentleman had on a tunic of dark red in shape not unlike a butchers blue frock which was fastened round the hips by a girdle of black leather studded with brass spangles his head was covered by a loose hood of bright blue and his hose or stockingsfor stockings and trousers were in onewere a light bright shade of applegreen low black shoes completed this showy costume but it was not more showy than that of every other man passing along the street our young man seemed rather anxious not to be seen for he cast sundry suspicious glances in the direction of the girdlers and having at length apparently satisfied himself that the pattymaker was not likely to return at once he darted across the street and presented himself at the window of the corner shop two girls were sitting behind it whose ages were twenty and seventeen these young ladies were scarcely so smart as the gentleman the elder wore a grey dress striped with black over which was a crimson kirtle or pelisse with wide sleeves and tight grey ones under them a little green cap sat on her light hair which was braided in two thick masses one on each side of the face the younger wore a dress of the same light green as the youths hose with a silvery girdle and a blue cap mistress alexandra said the youth in a loud whisper the elder girl took no notice of him the younger answered as if she had just discovered his existence though in truth she had seen him coming all the time o clement winkfield is that you weve no raffyolys sausagerolls left if that be your lack i thank you mistress ricarda but i lack nought o the sort mistress alexandra knoweth full well that i come but to beg a kind word from her ive none to spare this even said the elder with a toss of her head but you will sweet heart when you hear my tidings what now has your mother bought a new kerchief or the cat catched a mouse nay sweet heart mock me not here be grand doings whereof my lord talked this morrow at dinner i being awaiting what say you to a goodly tournament at the palace of the savoy i dare reckon you fell asleep and dreamed thereof mistress alexandra youd make a saint for to swear howbeit if you reck not thereofi had meant for to practise with my cousin at arundel house for to get you standing room with the maids yonder but seeing you have no mind theretoi dare warrant mistress joan silverton shall not say me nay and may be mistress argenta come within clement and eat a flaune said ricarda in a very different tone taking up a dish of cheesecakes from the counter when shall the jousting be oh it makes no bones mistress ricarda your sister hath no mind thereto tis plain however clement suffered himself to be persuaded to do what he liked and ricarda going close to her sister to fetch a plate whispered to her a few words of warning as to what she might lose by too much coldness whereupon the fair alexandra thawed somewhat and condescended to seem slightly interested in the coming event ricarda however continued to do most of the talking clement winkfield was scullion in the bishop of durhams kitchen and would have been considered in that day rather a good match for a tradesmans daughter for anything in the form of manufacture or barter was then in a very mean social position domestic service stood much higher than it does now and though mr althams daughters were heiresses in a small way they could not afford to despise clement winkfield except as a political stratagem and what like shall the jousting be clement asked ricarda when that young gentleman had been satisfactorily settled on a form inside the shop with a substantial cheesecake before himnot a mere mouthful but a large oval tart from which two or three people might be helped it shall be the richest and rarest show was seen this many a day my mistress replied clement having disposed of his first bite in good sooth mistress but you wot how to make flaunes my lord hath none such on his table that was saundrinas making observed ricarda with apparent carelessness dear heart thats wherefore its so sweet trow responded clement gallantly alexandra laughed languidly come now clem tell us all about the jousting like a good lad as thou art and win us good places to see the same and i will make thee a chowetpie liverpie of the best said she laying aside her affected indifference by my troth ill talk till my tongue droppeth on the floor answered the delighted clement and i have heard all of will pierpoint that is in my lord of arundel his stable and is thick as incleweaving with one of my lord of lancaster his palfreymen the knights be each one in a doublet of white linen spangled of silver having around the sleeves and down the face thereof a border of green cloth whereon is broidered the device chosen wrought about with clouds and vines of golden work the ladies and damsels be likewise in green and white for the knights moreover there be masking visors fourteen of peacocks heads and fourteen of maidens heads the one sort to tilt against the other my lord duke of lancaster that is lord of the revels beareth a costume of white velvet paled with cramoisie striped with crimson velvet whereon be wrought garters of blue and the lady of cambridge that is lady of the jousts and shall give the prizes shall be in indecolour blue all wrought with roses of silver there be at this present forty women broiderers aworking in the palace in such haste they be paid mighty high wagefourpence halfpenny each one by the day in order to understand the value of these payments we must multiply them by about sixteen the wages of a broideress according to the present worth of money were when high six shillings a day and the device what is it well i counsel not any man to gainsay it it is as it isthere you have it truly a merry saying and when shall it be clem mistress alexandra was quite gracious now thursday shall be a fortnight being saint maudlins day at ten o the clock in the forenoon will hath passed word to me to get me in and two other with me youll come my mistresses therell not be room for mistress amphillis im sorry alexandra tossed her head very contemptuously what does amphillis want of jousts said she shes fit for nought save to sift flour and cleanse vessels when we have adone with them and she hasnt a decent kirtle never name a hood i wouldnt be seen in her company for forty shillings saundrinas been at father to put her forth added ricarda if he could but hear of some service in the country where little plenishing were asked theres no good laying no money out on the like of her a soft little sound at the door made them look round a girl was standing there of about clements agea pale quietlooking girl who seemed nervously afraid of making her presence known apparently lest she should be blamed for being there or anywhere alexandra spoke sharply come within and shut the door amphillis and stare not thus like a goose what wouldst amphillis neither came in nor shut the door she held it in her hand while she said in a shy way the patties are ready to come forth if one of you will come and then she disappeared as if frightened of staying a minute longer than she could help ready to come forth echoed ricarda cannot the stupid thing take them forth by herself i bade her not do so explained her sister but call one of usshe is so unhandy go thou ricarda or shell be setting every one wrong side up ricarda with a martyrlike expressionwhich usually means an expression very unlike a martyrsrose and followed amphillis alexandra thus left alone with clement became so extra amiable as to set that not overwise youth on a pinnacle of ecstasy until she heard her fathers step when she dismissed him hastily she did not need to have been in a hurry for the pattymaker was stopped before he reached the threshold by a rather pompous individual in white and blue livery liveries were then worn far more commonly than nownot by servants only but by officials of all kinds and by gentlemen retainers of the noblessometimes even by nobles themselves to wear a friends livery was one of the highest compliments that could be paid mr altham knew by a glance at his costume that the man who had stopped him bore some office in the household of the duke of lancaster since he not only wore that princes livery but bore his badge the ostrich feather ermine affixed to his left sleeve master altham the pattymaker i take it he good my master and your servant a certain lady would fain wit of you master if you have at this present dwelling with you a daughter named amphillis i have no daughter of that name i have two daughters whose names be alexandra and ricarda that dwell with me likewise one wedded named isabel i have a niece named amphillis that dwelleth with you ay she doth at this present sithence my sister her mother is departed dead but you have had some thought of putting her forth maybe mr altham looked doubtful well we have talked thereof i and my maids but no certain end was come to thereabout that is it which the lady has heard mistress walton the silkwoman at the wheelbarrow spake with this lady saying such a maid there was for whom you sought service and the lady wotteth knows of a gentlewoman with whom she might be placed an she should serve and the service suited your desires for her pray you come within and let us talk thereon at our leisure i am beholden to mistress walton she knew i had some thoughts thereanent about it and she hath done me a good turn to name it the varlet as he was then called followed mr altham into the shop aralet is a contraction of this word but varlet at that date was a term of wide signification including any type of personal attendant the varlet of a duke would be a gentleman by birth and education for gentlemen were not above serving nobles even in very menial positions people had then in some respects less nonsense about them than now and could not see that it was any degradation for one man to hand a plate to another alexandra rose when the varlet made his appearance she did not keep a heart and she did keep a large stock of vanity she was consequently quite ready to throw over clement winkfield as soon as ever a more eligible suitor should present himself and her idea of mankind ranged them in two classessuch as were and such as were not eligible suitors for alexandra altham mr altham however led his guest straight through the shop and upstairs thus cutting short miss althams wiles and graces he took him into what we should call his study a very little room close to his bedchamber and motioned him to the only chair it contained for chairs were rare and choice things the form or bench being the usual piece of furniture before shutting the door however he calledphyllis somebody unseen to the varlet answered the call and received directions in a low voice mr altham then came in and shut the door i have bidden the maid bring us hypocras and spice said he so you shall have a look at her hypocras was a very light wine served as tea now is in the afternoon and spice was a word which covered all manner of good thingsnot only pepper sugar cinnamon and nutmegs but rice almonds ginger and even gingerbread mr tynneslowefor so the varlet was namedsat down in the chair and awaited the tray and amphillis chapter two the goldsmiths daughter i can live a life that tells on other lives and makes this world less full of evil and of pain a life which like a pebble dropped at sea sends its wide circles to a hundred shores rev horatius bonar dd the coming hypocras interested mr tynneslowe more than its bearer he was privately wondering as he sat awaiting it whether mr altham would have any in his cellar that was worth drinking especially after that of his royal master his next remark however had reference to amphillis it makes little matter good master that i see the maid said he the lady or her waitingdamsels shall judge best of her you and i can talk over the money matters and such i am illset to judge of maids they be kittle gear forsooth they be so assented mr altham with a sigh for his fair and wayward alexandra had cost him no little care before that summer afternoon and to speak truth master tynneslowe i would not be sorry to put the maid forth for she is somewhat a speckled bird in mine house whereat the rest do peck come within the door of the little chamber opened and amphillis appeared carrying a tray whereon was set a leather bottle flanked by two silver cups a silver plate containing cakes and a little silvergilt jar with preserved ginger glass and china were much too rare and costly articles for a tradesman to use but he who had not at least two or three cups and plates of silver in his closet was a very poor man of course these by people in mr althams position were kept for best the articles commonly used being pewter or wooden plates and horn cups amphillis louted to the visitorthat is she dropped what we call a charity schoolgirls boband the visitor rose and courtesied in reply for the courtesy was then a gentlemans reverence she set down the tray poured out wine for her uncle and his guest into the silver cups handed the cakes and ginger and then quietly took her departure a sober maid and a seemly in good sooth said mr tynneslowe when the door was shut hath she her health reasonable good she looks but white ay good enough said the pattymaker who knew that amphillis was sufficiently teased and worried by those lively young ladies her cousins to make any girl look pale good well what wages should content you mr altham considered that question with pursed lips and hands in his pockets should you count a mark shillings pence by the year too much this would come to little over ten pounds a year at present value and seems a very poor salary for a young lady but it must be remembered that she was provided with clothing as well as food and lodging and that she was altogether free from many expenses which we should reckon necessariesumbrellas and parasols watches desks stamps and stationery scarce enough rather was the unexpected answer mind you master altham i said a lady master altham looked curious and interested we call every woman a lady who has either money or education but in ranks were more sharply defined only the wives and daughters of a prince peer or knight were termed ladies the wives of squires and gentlemen were gentlewomen while below that they were simply called wives or maids according as they were married or single this lady then shall bemercy on us sure master tynneslowe you go not about to have the maid into the household of my ladys grace of cambridge or the queens grace herself of castile the duke of lancaster having married the heiress of castile he and his wife were commonly styled king and queen of castile mr tynneslowe laughed nay there you fly your hawk at somewhat too high game said he nathless nevertheless master altham it is a lady whom she shall serve and a lady likewise who shall judge if she be meet for the place but first shall she be seen of a certain gentlewoman of my ladys household that shall say whether she promise fair enough to have her name sent up for judgment i reckon three nobles one pound present value pounds by the year shall pay her reckoning truly i would be glad she had so good place and for plenishing what must she have store sufficient of raiment is all she need have and such jewelling as it shall please you to bestow on her all else shall be found the gentlewoman shall give her note of all that lacketh if she be preferred to the place and when shall she wait on the said gentlewoman next thursday in the even at master goldsmiths i will send her mr tynneslowe declined a second helping of hypocras and took his leave the pattymaker saw him to the door and then went back into his shop i have news for you maids said he ricarda who was arranging the fresh patties looked up and stopped her proceedings alexandra brought her head in from the window amphillis only who sat sewing in the corner went on with her work as if the news were not likely to concern her phyllis how shouldst thou like to go forth to serve a lady a bright colour flushed into the pale cheeks i uncle she said a lady cried alexandra in a much shriller voice the word which had struck her fathers ear so lightly being at once noted by her said you a lady father what lady i pray you that cannot i say daughter phyllis thou art to wait on a certain gentlewoman at master goldsmiths as next thursday in the even that shall judge if thou shouldst be meet for the place don thee in thy best raiment and mind thy manners may i go withal father cried alexandra there was nought said about thee wouldst thou fain be put forth i never thought of no such a thing maybe it had been better that i had spoken for you my maids i would not go forth to serve a city wife or such mean gear said alexandra contemptuously but in a ladys household i am well assured i should become the place better than phyllis why she has not a word to say for herselfa poor weak creature that should never hush daughter taunt not thy cousin if she be a good maid and discreet she shall be better than fair and foolish gramercy cannot a maid be fair and discreet belike soothly so tis pity she is not oftener but may we not go withal father said ricarda belike ye may my maid bear in mind the gentlewoman looks to see amphillis not you and make sure that she wist which is she then i see not wherefore ye may not go any one who had lived in mr althams house from that day till the thursday following would certainly have thought that alexandra not amphillis was the girl chosen to go the former made far more fuss about it and she was at the same time preparing a new mantle wherein to attend the tournament of which amphillis was summoned to do all the plain and uninteresting parts the result of this preoccupation would have been very stale pastry on the counter if her father had not seen to that item for himself ricarda was less excited and egotistical yet she talked more than amphillis the thursday evening came and the three girls dressed in their best clothes took their way to the dolphin the court goldsmith was a more select individual than mr altham and did not serve in his own shop unless summoned to a customer of rank the young men who were there had evidently been prepared for the girls coming and showed them upstairs with a fire of jokes which alexandra answered smartly while amphillis was silent under them they were ushered into the private chamber of the goldsmiths daughter who sat at work and rose to receive them she kissed them all for kissing was then the ordinary form of greeting and people only shook hands when they wished to be warmly demonstrative is the gentlewoman here mistress regina sit you down said mistress regina calmly no she is not yet come she will not long be which of you three is de maiden dat go shall that my cousin is said alexandra making fun of the german girls somewhat broken english though in truth she spoke it fairly for a foreigner but amphillis said gently that am i mistress regina and i take it full kindly of you that you should suffer me to meet this gentlewoman in your chamber so was the answer you shall better serve of de three alexandra had no time to deliver the rather pert reply which she was preparing for the door opened and the young man announced mistress chaucer had the girls known that the lady who entered was the wife of a man before whose fame that of many a crowned monarch would pale and whose poetry should live upon mens lips when five hundred years had fled they would probably have looked on her with very different eyes but they knew her only as a lady of the bedchamber first to the deceased queen philippa and now to the queen of castile and therefore deserving of all possible subservience of her husband they never thought at all the chiel amang em takin notes made no impression on them but five centuries have passed since then and the chiels notes are sterling yet in england mistress chaucer sat down on the bench and with quiet but rapid glances appraised the three girls then she said to amphillis is it thou whom i came to see amphillis louted and modestly assented after which the lady took no further notice of the two who were the more anxious to attract her attention and what canst thou do she said what i am told mistress said amphillis ach murmured regina you den can much do ay thou canst do much quietly repeated mistress chaucer canst dress hair amphillis thought she could she might well for her cousins made her their maid and were not easily pleased mistresses thou canst cook i cast no doubt being bred at a pattyshop mistress i have only dwelt there these six months past my father was a poor gentleman that died when i was but a babe and was held to demean himself by wedlock with my mother that was sister unto mine uncle master altham mine uncle was so kindly as to take on him the charge of breeding me up after my father died and he set my mother and me in a little farm that longeth to him in the country and at after she departed likewise he took me into his house i know somewhat of cookery an it like you but not to even my good cousins here oh phyllis is a metely fair cook when she will give her mind thereto said alexandra with a patronising air and a little toss of her heada gesture to which that young lady was much addicted a very slight look of amusement passed across mistress chaucers face but she did not reply to the remark and thy name she asked still addressing amphillis amphillis neville and your servant mistress canst hold thy peace when required so to do amphillis smiled i would endeavour myself so to do canst be patient when provoked of other with gods grace mistress i so trust alexandras face wore an expression of dismay it had never occurred to her that silence and patience were qualities required in a bowermaiden as the maid or companion to a lady was then called for the maid was the companion then and was usually much better educated than nowas education was understood at that time in alexandras eyes the position was simply one which gave unbounded facilities for flirting laughing and giddiness in general she began to think that amphillis was less to be envied than she had supposed and thou wouldst endeavour thyself to be meek and buxom humble and submissive in all things to them that should be set over thee i would so my mistress what fashions of needlework canst do mistress i can sew and work tapestry and embroider somewhat if the pattern be not too busy elaborate difficult i would be glad to learn the same more perfectly mistress chaucer rose i think thou wilt serve said she but i can but report the samethe deciding lieth not with me mistress regina i pray you to allow of another to speak with this maid in your chamber tomorrow in the even and this time it shall be the lady that must make choice not she that shall be thy mistress my maid she dwelleth not hereaway but far hence amphillis cared very little where her future duties were to lie she was grateful to her uncle but she could hardly be said to love him and her cousins had behaved to her in such a style that the sensation called forth towards them was a long way from love she felt alone in the world and it did not much signify in what part of that lonely place she was set down to work the only point about which she cared at all was that she was rather glad to hear she was not to stay in london for like old earl douglas she would rather hear the lark sing than the mouse cheep the girls louted to mistress chaucer kissed regina and went down into the shop which they found filled with customers and master herman himself waiting on them they being of sufficient consequence for the notice of that distinguished gentleman on the table set in the midst of the shopwhich like most tables at that day was merely a couple of boards laid across trestleswas spread a blue cloth whereon rested various glittering articlesa silver basin a silvergilt bottle a cup of gold and another of a fine shell set in gold a set of silver apostle spoons socalled because the handle of each represented one of the apostles and another spoon of beryl ornamented with gold but none of them seemed to suit the customers who were looking for a suitable christening gift ach dey vill not do ejaculated master herman spreading out his fat fingers and beringed thumbs then belike we must de jewels try it is a young lady de shild gut den look you here here is de botoner of perry buttonhook of goldsmiths work and de bottons twelfwrought wid garters wid lilies wid bears wid leetle bells or wid a reason mottoyou can haf what reason you like look you here again madamde ouches broochesan eagle of gold and enamel saint george and de dragon de white hart de triangle of diamonds look you again de paternosters rosaries dey are lieblich gold and coral gold and pearls gold and rubies de rings sapphire and ruby and diamond and smaragdus emeraldach i have it look you here and from an iron chest locked with several keys master herman produced something wrapped carefully in white satin and took off the cover as if he were handling a baby dere he cried holding up a golden chaplet or wreath for the head of ruby flowers and leaves wrought in gold a large pearl at the base of every leafdere you shall not see a better sight in all de cityach not in nuremburg nor coln dat is what you wantit is schon schon and dirt sheap it isonly von hundert marks you take it the lady seemed inclined to take it but the gentleman demurred at the hundred marks pounds shillings and pence which reduced to modern value would be nearly eleven hundred pounds and the girls who had lingered as long as they reasonably could in their passage through the attractive shop were obliged to pass out while the bargain was still unconcluded id have had that chaplet for myself if id been that lady said alexandra as they went forward id never have cast that away for a christening gift nay but her lord would not find the money answered ricarda id have had it some way said her sister it was fair enough for a queen amphillis i do marvel who is the lady thou shalt serve theres ever so much ado ere the matter be settled tis one grander than mistress chaucer trow thou shalt see tomorrow even ay so it seems was the quiet answer nathless i would not change with thee ive no such fancy for silence and patience good lack but if a maid can work and dress hair and the like what would they of such weary gear as that maids be not of much worth without they be discreet said amphillis well be as discreet as thou wilt ill none of it was the flippant reply of her cousin the young ladies however did not neglect to accompany amphillis on her subsequent visit regina met them at the door she is great lady dis one i am sure said she pray you mind your respects the great lady carried on her conversation in french which in was the usual language of the english nobles its use was a survival from the norman conquest but the normanfrench was very far from pure being derided by the real french and not seldom by englishmen themselves chaucer says of his prioress and french she spake full fair and fetously cleverly after the scole of stratfordattebow for french of paris was to hire her unknow this lady the girls noticed spoke the french of paris and was rather less intelligible in consequence she put her queries in a short quick style which a little disconcerted amphillis and she had a weary irritated manner at last she said shortly very well consider yourself engaged you must set out from london on lammas day august st and mistress regina here who is accustomed to such matters will tell you what you need take a varlet will come to fetch you take care you are ready be discreet and do not get into any foolish entanglements of any sort amphillis asked only one questionwould the lady be pleased to tell her the name and address of her future mistress your mistress lives in derbyshire

window and keep very quiet in de bower note and mind you keep demand yourself toofrom de mans mans is bad amphillis was able to say with a clear conscience that she had no hankering after the society of those perilous creatures see you resumed regina with some warmth dere is one good man in one hundert mans no more de man you see shall he be de hundert man or one von de nine and ninety what you tink i think he were more like to be of the ninety and nine said amphillis with a little laugh but how for the women mistress regina be they all good regina shook her head in a very solemn manner dere

lady i am to serve i know noting no more dan youno not de name of de lady you dis evening saw she came from de savoyso much know i no more amphillis knew that goldsmiths were very often the bankers of their customers and that their houses were a frequent rendezvous for business interviews it was therefore not strange at all that regina should not be further in the confidence of the lady in question now you shall not tarry no later said regina kissing her you serve well your lady you pray to god and you keep from de mans goodnight your pardon granted mistress regina but you have not yet told me what i need carry withal ach so my head gather de wool as you here say why you take with you raiment enough to begindat is all your lady find you gowns after and a saddle to ride and all dat you need only de raiment to begin and de brains in de headshe shall not find you dat take wid you as much of dem as you can get now runde dark is gekommen it relieved amphillis to find that she needed to carry nothing with her except clothes brains and prudence the first she knew that her uncle would supply for the second she could only take all she had and as to the last she must do her best to cultivate it mr altham on hearing the report charged his daughters to see that their cousin had every need supplied and to do those young ladies justice they took fairly about half their share of the work until the day of the tournament when they declared that nothing on earth should make them touch a needle instead of which they dressed themselves in their best and escorted by mr clement winkfield were favoured by permission to slip in at the garden door and to squeeze into a corner among the dukes maids and grooms a very grand sight it was in the royal stand sat the king old edward the third scarcely yet touched by that pitiful imbecility which troubled his closing days and on his right hand sat the queen of the jousts the young countess of cambridge bride of prince edmund with the duke of lancaster on her other hand the duchess being on the left of the king all the invited ladies were robed uniformly in green and white the prizegiver herself excepted the knights were attired as clement had described them i am not about to describe the tournament which after all was only a glorified prizefight and therefore suited to days when few gentlemen could read and no forks were used for meals we call ourselves civilised now yet some who consider themselves such seem to entertain a desire to return to barbarism human nature in truth is the same in all ages and what is called culture is only a thin veneer nothing but to be made partaker of the divine nature will implant the heavenly taste the knights who were acclaimed victors or at least the best jousters on the field were led up to the royal stand and knelt before the queen of the jousts who placed a gold chaplet on the head of the first and tied a silken scarf round the shoulders of the second and third happily no one was killed or even seriously injurednot a very unusual state of things at a tournament eighteen years later the duke of lancasters soninlaw the last of the earls of pembroke was left dead upon the field alexandra and ricarda came back very tired and not in exceptionally good tempers as amphillis soon found out since she was invariably a sufferer on these occasions they declared themselves the next morning far too weary to put in a single stitch and occupied themselves chiefly in looking out of the window and exchanging airy nothings with customers but when clement came in the afternoon with an invitation to a dance at his mothers house their exhausted energies rallied surprisingly and they were quite able to go though the same farce was played over again on the ensuing morning by dint of working early and late amphillis was just ready on the day appointedsmall thanks to her cousins who not only shirked her work but were continually summoning her from it to do theirs mr altham gave his niece some good advice along with a handsome silver brooch a net of gold tissue for her hair commonly called a crespine or dovecote and a girdle of black leather set with bosses of silvergilt these were the most valuable articles that had ever yet been in her possession and amphillis felt herself very rich though she could have dispensed with ricardas envious admiration of her treasures and alexandras acetous remarks about some people who were always grabbing as much as they could get in their fathers presence these observations were omitted and mr altham had but a faint idea of what his orphan niece endured at the handsor rather the tonguesof his daughters who never forgave her for being more gently born than themselves lammas day dawned warm and bright and after early mass in the church of saint mary at strandwhich nobody in those days would have dreamed of missing on a saints dayamphillis placed herself at an upstairs window to watch for her escort she had not many minutes to wait before two horses came up the narrow lane from the savoy palace and trotting down the strand stopped at the pattymakers door after them came a baggagemule whose back was fitted with a framework intended to sustain luggage one horse carried a man attired in white linen and the other bore a saddle and pillion the latter being then the usual means of conveyance for a woman on the saddle before it sat a middleaged man in the royal livery which was then white and red the man in linen alighted and after a few minutes spent in conversation with mr altham he carried out amphilliss luggage in two leather trunks which were strapped one on each side of the mule as soon as she saw her trunks disappearing amphillis ran down and took leave of her uncle and cousins well my maid god go with thee said mr altham forget not thine old uncle and these maids and if thou be illusen or any trouble hap thee pray the priest of thy parish to write me a line thereanent and i will see what can be done fare thee well phyllis said alexandra and ricarda echoed the words mr altham helped his niece to mount the pillion seated on which she had to put her arms round the waist of the man in front and clasp her hands together for without this precaution she would have been unseated in ten minutes there was nothing to keep her on as she sat with her left side to the horses head and roads in those days were rough to an extent of which we accustomed to macadamised ways can scarcely form an idea now and so pursued for luck by an old shoe from ricardas hand amphillis neville took her leave of london and rode forth into the wide world to seek her fortune passing along the strand as far as the row of houses ran at the strand cross they turned to the left and threading their way in and out among the detached houses and little gardens they came at last into holborn and over holborn bridge into smithfield under holborn bridge ran the fleet river pure and limpid on its way to the silvery thames and as they emerged from cock lane the stately priory of saint bartholomew fronted them a little to the right crossing smithfield they turned up long lane and thence into aldersgate street and in a few minutes more the last houses of london were left behind them as they came out into the open country amphillis was greeted to her surprise by a voice she knew god be wi ye mistress amphillis said clement winkfield coming up and walking for a moment alongside as the horse mounted the slight rising ground maybe you would take a little farewell token of mine hand just for to mind you when you look on it that you have friends in london that shall think of you by nows and thens and clement held up to amphillis a little silver box with a ring attached through which a chain or ribbon could be passed to wear it round the neck a small red stone was set on one side tis a good charm said he there is therein writ a scripture that shall bear you safe through all perils of journeying and an hair of a shebear that is good against witchcraft and the carnelian stone appeaseth anger trust me it shall do you no harm to bear it anigh you amphillis though a sensible girl for her time was not before her time and therefore had full faith in the wonderful virtues of amulets she accepted the silver box with the entire conviction that she had gained a treasure of no small value simple goodnatured clement lifted his cap and turned back down aldersgate street while amphillis and her escort went on towards saint albans a few miles they rode in silence broken now and then by a passing remark from the man in linen chiefly on the deep subject of the hot weather and by the sumptermans frequent requests that his mule would geeup which the perverse quadruped in question showed little inclination to do at length as the horse checked its speed to walk up a hill the man in front of amphillis said know you where you be journeying my mistress into derbyshire she answered have there all i know but you wot surely whom you go to serve truly i wot nothing she replied only that i go to be bowerwoman to some lady the lady that saw me and bound me thereto said that i might look to learn on the road dear heart and is that all they told you all my master words must be costly in those parts said the man in linen well answered the other drawing out the word in a tone which might mean a good deal words do cost much at times master saint oly they have cost men their lives ere now ay better men than you or me replied the other howbeit my mistress there is no harm you should knowis there master dugan that you be bounden for the manor of hazelwood some six miles to the north of derby where dwell sir godfrey foljambe and his dame no harm so you tarry there at this present said master dugan ay ive reached my hostel was the response then my lady foljambe is she that i must serve the man in linen exchanged a smile with the man in livery you shall see her the first i cast no doubt and she shall tell you your duties answered dugan amphillis sat on the pillion and meditated on her information as they journeyed on there was evidently something more to tell which she was not to be told at present after wondering for a little while what it might be and deciding that her imagination was not equal to the task laid upon it she gave it up and allowed herself to enjoy the sweet country scents and sounds without apprehension for the future for six days they travelled on in this fashion about twenty miles each day staying every night but one at a wayside inn where amphillis was always delivered into the care of the landlady and slept with her daughter or niece once at a private house the owners of which were apparently friends of mr dugan they baited for the last time at derby and about two oclock in the afternoon rode into the village of hazelwood it was only natural that amphillis should feel a little nervous and uneasy in view of her introduction to her new abode and unknown companions she was not less so on account of the mystery which appeared to surround the nameless mistress why did everybody who seemed to know anything make such a secret of the affair the manor house of hazelwood was a pretty and comfortable place enough it stood in a large garden gay with autumn flowers and a high embattled wall protected it from possible enemies the trio rode in under an old archway through a second gate and then drew up beneath the entrance arch the door beingas is yet sometimes seen in old innsat the side of the arch running beneath the house a man in livery came forward to take the horses well master saint oly said he here you be i could have told thee that sim was the amused reply is all well sir godfrey at home ay to the first question and no to the second my lady is in her bower my ladys in the privy garden whither you were best take the damsel to her sim led the horses away to the stable and saint oly turned to amphillis then if it please you follow me my mistress we were best to go to my lady at once amphillis followed silent curious and a little fluttered they passed under the entrance arch inwards and found themselves in a smaller garden than the outer enclosed on three sides by the house and its adjacent outbuildings in the midst was a spreading tree with a form underneath it and in its shade sat a lady and a girl about the age of amphillis another girl was gathering flowers and an elderly woman was coming towards the tree from behind saint oly conducted amphillis to the lady who sat under the tree dame said he here under your good leave is mistress amphillis neville that is come to you from london town to serve her you wot of this then was lady foljambe amphillis looked up and saw a tall handsome faircomplexioned woman with a rather grave not to say stern expression of face good said lady foljambe you are welcome mistress neville i trust you can do your duty and not giggle and chatter the girl who sat by certainly giggled on hearing this question and lady foljambe extinguished her by a look i will do my best dame replied amphillis nervously none can do more said her ladyship more graciously are you aweary with your journey but a little dame i thank you our stage today was but short you left your friends well was the next condescending query yes dame i thank you lady foljambe turned her head perrote she said dame answered the elderly woman take the damsel up to your ladys chambers and tell her what her duties will bemistress neville one matter above all other must i press upon you whatever you see or hear in your ladys chamber is never to come beyond you will company with my damsels agatha with a slight move of her head towards the girl at her sideand marabel indicating by another gesture the one who was gathering flowers remember in your leisure times when you are talking together no mention of your lady must ever be made if you hear it rebuke it if you make it you may not like that which shall follow be wise and discreet and you shall find it for your good chatter and be giddy and you shall find it far otherwise now follow mistress perrote amphillis louted silently and as silently followed the elderly woman who was tall slim and preciselooking led her into the house and up the stairs when twothirds of them were mounted she turned to the left along a passage lifted a heavy curtain which concealed its end and let it drop again behind them they stood in a small square tower on a little landing which gave access to three doors the door on the right hand stood ajar the middle one was closed but the left was not only closed but locked and barred heavily mistress perrote led the way into the room on the right a pleasant chamber which looked out into the larger garden at the further end of the room stood a large bed of blue camlet with a canopy worked with fighting griffins in yellow a large chest of carved oak stood at the foot along the wall ran a settle or long bench furnished with blue cushions and over the back was thrown a dorsor of black worsted worked with the figures of david and goliath in strict fourteenthcentury costume the fireplace was supplied with andirons a shovel and a firefork which served the place of a poker a small leaf table hung down by the wall at one end of the settle and over it was fixed a round mirror so high up as to give little encouragement to vanity on hooks round the walls were hangings of blue tapestry presenting a black diamond pattern within a border of red roses will you sit said mistress perrote speaking in a voice not exactly sharp but short and staccato as if she werewhat more voluble persons often profess to beunaccustomed to public speaking and not very talkative at any time your name i think is amphillis neville amphillis acknowledged her name you have father and mother i have nothing in the world said amphillis with a shake of her head save an uncle and cousins which dwell in london town ha said mistress perrote in a significant tone that is wherefore you were chosen because i had no kin said amphillis looking up that and also that you were counted discreet and discreet you had need be for this charge what charge she asked blankly you know not i know nothing nobody would tell me anything mistress perrotes set features softened a little poor child she said you are youngtoo youngto be given a charge like this you will need all your discretion and more amphillis felt more puzzled than ever you may make a friend of marabel if you choose but beware how you trust agatha but remember as her ladyship told you no word that you hear no thing that you see must be suffered to go forth of these chambers you may repeat nothing can you do this i will bear it in mind was the reply but pray you if i may ask seeing i know nothingis this lady that i shall serve an evil woman that you caution me thus no answered mistress perrote emphatically she is a most terribly injuredwhat say i forget my words they were not discreet mary mother there be times when a womans heart gets the better of her brains there be more brains than hearts in this world lay by your hood and mantle child on one of those hooks and smooth your hair and repose you until suppertime tomorrow you shall see your lady note sad at this time did not mean sorrowful but serious note these are the duties of a bowerwoman laid down in the books of courtesy at that time note then a very expressive word including both morals and manners note a private sittingroom for ladies chapter four the white lady the future is all dark and the past a troubled sea and memory sits in the heart wailing where hope should be supper was ready in the hall at four oclock and amphillis found herself seated next below agatha the younger of lady foljambes damsels it was a feastday so that meat was serveda boars head stewed beef minced mutton squirrel and hedgehog the last dainty is now restricted to gypsies and no one eats our little russet friend of the bushy tail but our forefathers indulged in both there were also roast capons a heron and chickens dressed in various ways near amphillis stood a dish of beef jelly a chowet or liverpie a flampoynt or porkpie and a dish of sops in fennel the sweets were barlee and mon amy of which the first was rice cream and the second a preparation of curds and cream amphillis looked with considerable interest along the table and at her opposite neighbours lady foljambe she recognised at once and beside her sat a younger lady whom she had not seen before she applied to her neighbour for information she said agatha oh shes mistress margaret my ladys daughterinlaw wife to master godfrey that sits o t other side of his mother and thats master matthew o this side the priests father jordana fat old noodle as ever droned a psalm through his nose love you mirth and jollity i scarce know said amphillis hesitatingly i have had so little agathas face was a sight to see good lack but i never reckoned you should be a spoilsport said she licking her spoon as in duty bound before she plunged it in the jellya piece of etiquette in which young ladies at that date were carefully instructed the idea of setting a separate spoon to help a dish had not dawned upon the mediaeval mind i shall hate you i can tell you if you so are things here be like going to a funeral all day longnever a bit of music nor dancing nor aught that is jolly mistress margaret might be eighty so sad and sober is she and as for my lady and mistress perrote they are just a pair of old jogtrots fit to run together in a quirle the open car then used by ladies something like a waggonette master godfreys all for arms and fighting so hes no better master matthews best of the lot but bads the best when youve adone and he hasnt much chance neither for if hes seen laughing a bit with one of us my ladys adown on him as if hed broke all the ten commandments and whisks him off ere you can say jack robinson and if she whip you not you may thank the saints or your stars which you have a mind oh tis a jolly house youve come to that i can tell you i hoped youd a bit more fun in you than clariceshe wasnt a scrap of good but im afraid youre no better i dont know really said amphillis feeling rather bewildered by agathas reckless rattle and remembering the injunction not to make a friend of her i suppose i have come here to do my duty but i know not yet what it shall be i detest doing my duty said agatha energetically thats a pity isnt it was the reply agatha laughed come you can give a quipword said she clarice was just a lump of wood that you could batter nought intomight as well sit next a post marabel has some brains but theyre so far in theres no fetching em forth i declare i shall do somewhat one o these days that shall shock all the neighbourhood only to make a diversion i dont think i would responded amphillis you might find it ran the wrong way youll do said agatha laughing you are not jolly but youre next best to it whose is that empty place on the form asked amphillis looking across oh thats master normanssir godfreys squirehes away with him and agatha without any apparent reason became suddenly silent when supper was over the girls were called to spin which they did in the large hall sitting round the fire with the two ladies and perrote amphillis as a newcomer was excused for that evening and she sat studying her neighbours and surroundings till mistress perrote pronounced it bedtime then each girl rose and put by her spindle courtesied to the ladies and wished them each goodeven receiving a similar greeting and the three filed out of the inner door after perrote each possessing herself of a lighted candle as she passed a window where they stood at the solar landing they parted perrote and amphillis turning aside to their own tower marabel and agatha going on to the upper floor the solar was an intermediate storey resembling the french entresol amphillis found as she expected that she was to share the large blue bed and the yellow griffins with perrote the latter proved a very silent bedfellow beyond showing amphillis where she was to place her various possessions she said nothing at all and as soon as she had done this she left the room and did not reappear for an hour or more as amphillis lay on her pillow she heard an indistinct sound of voices in an adjoining room and once or twice as she fancied a key turned in the lock at length the voices grew fainter the hoot of the white owl as he flew past the turret window scarcely roused her and amphillis was asleepso sound asleep that when perrote lay down by her side she never made the discovery the next morning dawned on a beautiful summer day perrote roused her young companion about four oclock with a reminder that if she were late it would produce a bad impression upon lady foljambe when they were dressed perrote repeated the rosary amphillis making the responses and they went down to the hall breakfast was at this time a luxury not indulged in by every one and it was not served before seven oclock lady foljambe patronised it at that hour it was accordingly spread in the hall and consisted of powdered beef boiled beef brawn a jug of ale another of wine and a third of milk the milk was a condescension to a personal weakness of perrote everybody else drank wine or ale amphillis was wondering very much in the private recesses of her mind how it was that no lady appeared whom she could suppose to be her own particular mistress and had she not received such strict charges on the subject she would certainly have asked the question as it was she kept silence but she was gratified when after breakfast having been bidden to follow perrote that worthy woman paused to say as they followed the passage which led to their own turret now amphillis neville you shall see your lady she stopped before the locked and barred door opposite to their own unfastened it and led amphillis into the carefullyguarded chamber the barred room proved to be an exceedingly pleasant one except that it was darker than the other for it looked into the inner garden and therefore much less sun ever entered it a heavy curtain of black worsted whereon were depicted golden vines and recumbent lions stretched across the room shutting off that end which formed the bedchamber within its shelter stood a bed of green silk wrought with golden serpents and roses a small walnutwood cabinet against the wall two large chests a chair of carved walnutwood upholstered in yellow satin a mirror set in silver and two very unusual pieces of furniture which in those days they termed foldingchairs but which we should call a shutup washstand and dressingtable the former held an ewer and basin of silvergilt much grander articles than amphillis had ever seen except in the goldsmiths shop in front of the curtain was a bench with green silk cushions and two small tables on one of which lay some needlework and by it in another yellow satin chair sat the solitary inhabitant of the chamber a lady who appeared to be about sixty years of age she was dressed in widows mourning and in that meant pure snowy white with chin and forehead so covered by barb and wimple that only the eyes nose and mouth were left visible this ladys face was almost as white as her robes even her lips seemed colourless and the fixed weary hopeless expression was only broken by two dark brilliant sunken eyes in which lay a whole volume of unread historyeyes that looked as if they could flash with fury or moisten with pity or grow soft and tender with love eyes that had done all these long long ago so long ago that they had forgotten how to do it sad tired sorrowful eyeseyes out of which all expectation had departed which had nothing left to fear only because they had nothing left to hope they were turned now upon amphillis your graces new chamberdame said mistress perrote in the room of clarice her name is amphillis neville the faintest shadow of interest passed over the sorrowful eyes go near said perrote to amphillis and kiss her graces hand amphillis did as she was told the lady after offering her hand for the kiss turned it and gently lifted the girls face dost thou serve god she said in a voice which matched her eyes i hope so dame replied amphillis i hope nothing said the mysterious lady it is eight years since i knew what hope was i have hoped in my time as much as ever woman did but god took away from me one boon after another till now he hath left me desolate be thankful maid that thou canst yet hope she dropped her hand and went back to her work with a weary sigh dame said perrote your grace wot that her ladyship desires not that you talk in such strain to the damsels the white face changed as amphillis had thought it could not change and the sunken eyes shot forth fire her ladyship said the widow who is avena foljambe that she looketh to queen it over marguerite of flanders they took my lord and i lived through it they took my daughter and i bare it they took my son my firstborn and i was silent though it brake my heart but by my troth and faith they shall not still my soul nor lay bonds upon my tongue when i choose to speak avena foljambe the kinswoman of a wretched traitor that met the fate he deservedwhy hath she ten drops of good blood in her veins and she looks to lord it over a daughter of charlemagne that hath borne sceptre ere she carried spindle mistress perrotes calm even voice checked the flow of angry words dame your grace speaks very sooth truth yet i beseech you remember that my lady doth present represent an higher than herselfthe kings grace and no lesser the lady in white rose to her feet what mean you woman king edward of windsor may be your master and hers but he is not mine i owe him no allegiance nor i never sware any your son hath sworn it dame the eyes blazed out again my son is a hounda craven cur that licks the hand that lashed hima poor court fool that thinks it joy enough to carry his bauble and marvel at his motley coat and his silvered buttons that he should be my sonand his the voice changed so suddenly that amphillis could scarcely believe it to be the same all the passionate fury died out of it and instead came a low soft tone of unutterable pain loneliness and regret the speaker dropped down into her chair and laying her arm upon the little table hid her face upon it my poor lady said perrote in tender accentsmore tender than amphillis had imagined she could use the lady in white lifted her head i was not so weak once she said there was a time when man said i had the courage of a man and the heart of a lion maiden never man sat an horse better than i and no warrior ever fought that could more ably handle sword i have mustered armies to the battle ere now i have personally conducted sieges i have headed sallies on the camp of the king of france am i meek pigeon to be kept in a dovecote look around thee this is my cage ha the perches are fine wood sayest thou the seed is good and the water is clean i deny it not i say only it is a cage and i am a royal eagle that was never made to sit on a perch and coo the blood of an hundred kings is thrilling all along my veins and must i be silent the blood of the sovereigns of france the kingdom of kingdomsof the seakings of denmark of the ancient kings of burgundy and of the lombards of the iron crownit is with this mine heart is throbbing and man saith be still how can i be still unless i were still in death and man reckoneth i shall be apaid for my lost sword with a needle and for my broken sceptre he offereth me a bodkin with a sudden gesture she brushed all the implements for needlework from the little table to the floor there gather them up which of you list i lack no such babes gear if i were but now on my feraunt with my visor down clad in armour as i was when i rode forth of hennebon while the french were busied with the assault on the further side of the townforth i came with my three hundred horse and we fired the enemys campah but we made a goodly blaze that day i reckon the villages saw it for ten miles around or more but your grace remembereth we won not back into the town at after quietly suggested perrote well what so went we not to brest and there gathered six hundred men and when we appeared again before hennebon the trumpets sounded and the gates were flung open and we entered in triumph thy memory waxeth weak old woman i must refresh it from mine own please it your good grace i am nigh ten years younger than yourself then shouldest thou be the more shamed to have so much worser a memory why hast forgot all those weeks at hennebon that we awaited the coming of the english fleet dost not remember how i went down to the council with thyself at mine heels and the child in mine arms to pray the captains not to yield up the town to the french and the lither loons would not hear me a word and then at the last minute when the gates were opened and the french marching up to take possession mindest thou not how i ran to yon window that giveth toward the sea and there at last at last the english fleet was seen making straight sail for us then flung i open the contrary casement toward the street and myself shouted to the people to shut the gates and man the ramparts and cry no surrender ah it was a day that had there been but time id never have shoutedid have been down myself and slammed that gate on the king of frances nose the pity of it that i had no wings and did i not meet the english lords and kiss them every one note and hang their chambers with the richest arras in my coffers and the very next day sir walter mauny made a sally and destroyed the french batteringram and away fled the french king with ours in pursuit ha that was a jolly sight to see old perrote hast thou forgot it all we are accustomed in the present day to speak of the deliverer of hennebon as sir walter manny that his name ought really to be spelt and sounded mauny is evidenced by a contemporary entry which speaks of his daughter as the lady of maweny old perrote had listened quietly while her mistress poured forth these reminiscences in rapid words when the long waiting for the english fleet was mentioned a kind of shudder passed over her as if her recollection of that time were painful and distinct enough but otherwise she stood motionless until the concluding question then she answered ay dameno i would say i mind it well thou shouldest then quote not avena foljambe to me i care not a brass nail for avena foljambe hand me yonder weary gear it is better than counting ones fingers maybe amphillis stooped and gathered up the scattered broidery glancing at perrote to see if she were doing right as she approached her mistress to offer them perrote whispered hurriedly on the knee child on the knee and amphillis blushing for her mistake dropped on one knee she was hoping that the lady would not be angrythat she could be severely so there could be no doubtand she was much relieved to see her laugh thou foolish old woman she said to perrote as she took her work back then addressing amphillis she addedseest thou my maid man hath poured away the sparkling wine out of reach of my thirsty lips and this silly old perrote reckons it of mighty moment that the empty cup be left to shine on the buffet what matters it if the caged eagle have his perch gilded or no he would a thousand times liefer sit of a bare rock in the sun than of a perch made of gold and set with emeralds so man granteth me the gilded perch to serve me on the knee like a queen and he setteth it with emeralds to call me duchess in lieu of countess and he reckoneth that shall apay the caged eagle for her lost liberty and her quenched sunlight and the grand bare rock on the mountain tops it were good enough for the dove to sit on the pigeonhouse and preen her feathers and coo and take decorous little flights between the dovecote and the ground whereon her corn lieth she cares for no more the bare rock would frighten her and the sun would dazzle her eyes so man bindeth the eagle by a bond long enough for the dove and quoth he be patient i am not patient i am not a silly dove that i should be so chide me not old woman to tug at my bond i am an eagle ah well dame said perrote with a sigh the will of god must needs be done i marvel if mans will be alway gods in sooth folks say whatever happeth gods will be done is everything his willthe evil things no less than the good is it gods will when man speaketh a lie or slayeth his fellow or robbeth a benighted traveller of all his having crack me that nut perrote truly dame i am no priest to solve such matters then leave thou to chatter glibly anentis gods will what wist any man thereabout perrote was silent open the window said the countess suddenly i am dying for lack of fresh air lifting her hand to her head she hastily tore off the barb and wimple with little respect to the pins which fastened them and with the result of a long rent in the former thats for one of you to amend she said with a short laugh ye should be thankful to have somewhat to do provided for you ay me the words were uttered in a low long moan perrote made no reply to the petulant words and action an expression of tender pity crossed her face as she stooped and lifted the torn barb and examined the rent with as much apparent calmness as if it had been damaged in the washing there was evidently more in her than she suffered to come forth note this action in the estimation of the time was merely equivalent to a cordial shaking of hands between the countess and her deliverers chapter five new and strange i stretched mine empty hands for bread and see they have given me stones instead bm before anything more could be said the door opened and lady foljambe came in she addressed herself at once to perrote did i not bid you alway to lock the door when you should enter lo here it is unlocked wherefore have you a key apart from mine but that you should so do i cry you mercy dame said perrote meekly did you ever this before i mind not well dame well of a surety call you this guarding a prisoner mind you not that which happed at tickhill when she scaped forth by aid of that knighthis name i forgetand had nigh reached the border of the liberties ere it was discovered is this your allegiance and duty dame i bid you good morrow better late than never avena said the countess a little satirically thou fond thing there lie over twenty years betwixt yon night at tickhill and this morrow and if the night were back where is the knight nay avena foljambe i have nought to escape for now dame i must needs say you be rare unbuxom and unthankful ay so said the fox to the stork when he plained to be served with thin broth pray you look but around you be lodged fit for any queen be she the greatest in christendom you need but speak a wish and you shall have it fulfilled namely thou shalt not put me off with red silk to my broidery when i would have blue you eat of the best and lie of the softest and speak with whom you would hold there the fire had come back to the sunken eyes i would speak with some that come never anigh me mine own children that have cast me off or be kept away from me they never so much as ask the old mother how she doth and i slaved and wrought and risked my life for them times out of mind and here you keep me shut up in four walls never a change from year end to year end never a voice to say mother or i love thee never a hope to look forward to till death take me no going forth of my cage even the very air of heaven has to come in to me and i may choose may i whether my bed shall be hung with green or blue i may speak my pleasure if i would have to my fourhours macaroons or gingerbread and be duly thankful that this liberty and these delicates are granted me avena foljambe all your folly lieth not in your legs lady foljambe evidently did not appreciate this pun upon her surname dame she said severely well i can fare forth if you have not had enough what right hath your king thus to use me i never was his vassal i entreated his aid truly as prince to prince and had he kept his bond and word he had been the truer man i never brake mine and i had far more need than he wherefore played he at seesaw now aiding me and now charles until none of his knights well knew which way he was bent i brought charles de blois to him a prisoner and he let him go for a heap of yellow stuff and fiddled with him off and on till charles brake his pledged word and lost his life as he deserved at auray i desire to know what right king edward had when i came to visit him after i had captured mine enemy to make me a prisoner and keep me so now and then suffering me like a cat with a mouse to escape just far enough to keep within his reach when he list to catch me again but not now for eight long yearseight long years dame i cannot remain here to list such language of my sovereign then dont i never asked you my tongue is free at any rate you can go and the countess turned back to the black satin on which she was embroidering a wreath of red and white roses follow me amphillis said lady foljambe with as much dignity as the countesss onslaught had left her she led the way into the opposite chamber the one shared by perrote and amphillis it were best as this hath happed that you should know quickly who this lady is that wotteth not how to govern her tongue she is the duchess of brittany heard you ever her story something dame an it please you yet not fully told i heard as i think of some quarrel betwixt her and a cousin touching the succession to the duchy and that our king had holpen her and gave his daughter in wedlock to the young duke her son so did he in very deed and yet is she thus unbuxom listen and you shall hear the inwards thereof in the year of our lord died duke john of brittany that was called the good and left no child two brothers had hesir guy that was his brother both of father and mother and sir john of the father only that was called count de montfort sir guy was then dead but had left behind him a daughter the lady joan that man called joan the halting by reason she was lame of one leg between her and her uncle of montfort was the war of successionshe as daughter of the brother by father and mother he as nearer akin to duke john being brother himself note our king took part with the count de montfort and the king of france espoused the cause of the lady joan lady foljambe did not think it necessary to add that king edwards policy had been of the most halting character in this matterat one time fighting for jeanne and at another for montfort until his nobles might well have been pardoned if they found it difficult to remember at any given moment on which side their master was well the king of france took the count and led him away captive to paris his city whereupon this lady that is now here in ward what did she but took in her arms her young son that was then a babe of some few months old and into the council at rennes she wentwhich city is the chief town of brittanyand quoth she unto the nobles there assembled fair sirs be not cast down by the loss of my lord he was but one man see here his young son who shall present him for you and trust me we will keep the stranger out of our city as well without him as with him truly there was not a man to come up to her she handled sword as well as any marshal of the kings host no assault could surprise her no disappointment could crush her nor could any man however wily take her off her guard when she had gone forward to hennebonfor rennes surrendered ere help could come from our kingman said she rade all up and down the town clad in armour encouraging the townsmen and moving the women to go up to the ramparts and thence to hurl down on the besiegers the stones that they tare up from the paved streets never man fought like her if it please you dame was her lord never set free asked amphillis considerably interested ay and no said lady foljambe set free was he never but he escaped out of louvre note in disguise of a pedlar and so came to england to entreat the kings aid but his grace was then so busied with foreign warfare that little could he do and the poor count laid it so to heart that he died he did but return home to die in his wifes arms oh poor lady said amphillis three years later said lady foljambe this lady took prisoner sir charles de blois the husband of the lady joan and brought him to the king also bringing her young son that was then a lad of six years and was betrothed to the kings daughter the lady mary the king ordered her residence in the castle of tickhill where she dwelt many years until a matter of two years back when she was brought hither amphillis felt this account exceedingly unsatisfactory dame said she if i may have leave to ask at you wherefore is this lady a prisoner what hath she done lady foljambes lips took a stern set she was apparently not pleased with the freedom of the question she was a very troublesome person said she nothing could stay her she was ever restless and interfering but these be matters too high for a young maid such as thou thou wert best keep to thy broidery and suchlike duties harvest homethe sixteenth of augustarrived when amphillis had been a week at hazelwood she had not by any means concluded that process which is known as settling down on the contrary she had never felt so unsettled and the feeling grew rather than diminished even alexandra and ricarda had tried her less than her present companions in one sense for they puzzled her less though they teased her more she was beginning to understand her mistress whose mood was usually one of weary lack of interest and energy occasionally broken either by seasons of acute sorrow or by sudden flashes of fiery anger and the last were less trying than the firstindeed it seemed sometimes to amphillis that they served as a vent and a relief that for a time after them the weariness was a shade less dreary and the languor scarcely quite so overpowering late in the evening on the night before harvest home sir godfrey returned home attended by his squire master norman hylton the impression received by amphillis concerning the master of the house was that he was a fitting pendant to his wifetall square and stern she did not know that sir godfrey had been rather wild in his youth and as some such men do had become correspondingly severe and precise in his old age not that his heart had changed it was simply that the sins of youth had been driven out by the sins of maturer life and satan is always willing to let his slaves replace one sin by another for it makes them none the less surely his sir godfrey suffered under no sense of inconsistency in sternly rebuking when exhibited by agatha or matthew slight tendencies to evil of the same types as he had once been addicted to himself had he not sown his wild oats and become a reformed character the outside of the cup and platter were now so beautifully clean that it never so much as occurred to him to question the condition of the inside yet within were some very foul things alienation from god and hardness of heart and love of gold that grew upon him year by year and he thought himself a most excellent man though he was only a whitewashed sepulchre he lifted his head high as he stood in the court of the temple and effusively thanked god that he was not as other men an excellent man said everybody who knew him perhaps a little too particular and rather severe on the peccadilloes of young people but when the time came that another voice pronounced final sentence on that whitewashed life the verdict was scarcely well done norman hylton sat opposite to amphillis at the suppertable in the only manner in which people could sit opposite to each other at a mediaeval tablenamely when it was in the form of a squared horseshoe the table which was always one or more boards laid across trestles was very narrow the inside of the horseshoe being reserved for the servants to hand the dishes there were therefore some yards of distance between opposite neighbours amphillis studied her neighbour so far as an occasional glance in his direction allowed her to do so and she came to the conclusion that there was nothing remarkable about him except the expression of his face he was neither tall nor short neither handsome nor ugly neither lively nor morose he talked a little with his next neighbour matthew foljambe but there was nothing in the manner of either to provoke curiosity as to the subject of their conversation but his expression puzzled amphillis he had dark eyeslike the countesss she thought but the weary and sometimes fiery aspect of hers was replaced in these by a look of perfect contentment and peace yet it was utterly different from the selfsatisfied expression which beamed out of sir godfreys eyes what manner of man is master hylton she asked of agatha who always sat next her precedence at table was regulated by strict rules the youngest of six brethren prithee trouble not thine head over him was that young ladys answer but that doth me not to wit what manner of man he is responded amphillis turning to the sewer or waiter who was offering her some rissoles of lamb agatha indulged in a little explosion of laughter under cover of her handkerchief oh amphillis where hast thou dwelt all thy life thou art the full seliest simplest most unconventional maid ever i did see amphillis replied literally why in hertfordshire was i born but i dwelt in london town a while ere i came hither a jolly townswoman must thou have made canst not conceive what i mean why the youngest of six brethren hath all his fortune to make and cannot be no catch at all for a maid without he be full high of rank and she have gold enough to serve her turn without but i dont want to catch him said amphillis innocently agatha burst out laughing and lady foljambe from the middle of the horseshoe table looked daggers at her unrestrained laughter at table especially in a girl was a serious breach of etiquette i say you shouldnt be so funny remonstrated agatha how shall man help to laugh if you say so comical words i wist not i was thus comical said amphillis but truly i conceive you not wherefore should i catch master hylton and wherewith and to what end amphillis you shall be the death of me my lady shall snap off my head at after supper and the maid is not born that could help to laugh at you to what end why for an husband child as to wherewith that i leave to thee and agatha concluded with another stifled giggle agatha was all that the indignant amphillis could say in answer she could hardly have told whether she felt more vexed or astonished the bare idea of such a thing evidently quite familiar to agatha was utterly new to her you never surely signify that any decent maid could set herself to seek a man for an husband like an angler with fish they must be uncommon queer folks in hertfordshire if thou art a sample thereof was the reply why for sure i so signified thou must have been bred up in a convent phyllis or else tied to thy grandmothers apronstring all thy life shall a maid neer have a bit of fun quotha amphillis made no answer but finished her rissoles in silence and helped herself to a small poundcake verily some folks be born as old as their grandmothers said agatha accepting a fieldfare from the sewer and squeezing a lemon over it i would fain enjoy my youth though im little like to do it whilst here i am howbeit it were sheer waste of stuff for any maid to set her heart on master norman he wist not how to discourse with maids he should have been a monk in very sooth for he is fit for nought no better there isnt a sparkle about him he looks satisfied said amphillis rather wistfully she was wishing that she felt so agathas answer was a puzzled stare first at amphillis and then at mr hylton satisfied she repeated as if she wondered what the word could mean arent we all satisfied maybe you are replied amphillis though i reckon i have heard you say what looked otherwise you would fain have more life and jollity if i err not truly therein you err not in no wise answered agatha laughing again though in a more subdued manner than before i never loved to dwell in a nunnery and this house is little better satisfied she said again as though the word perplexed her i never thought of no such a thing doth master norman look satisfied what hath satisfied him trow that is it i would fain know said amphillis in good sooth i see not how it may be resumed agatha he has never a penny to his patrimony i heard him to say once to master godfrey that all he had of his father was horse and arms and raiment nor hath he any childless old uncle or such that might take to him and make his fortune he lives of his wits belike now i am an only daughter and have never a brother to come betwixt me and the inheritance i shall have a pretty penny when my father dies so i have some right to be jolly ay and jolly ill be when i am mine own mistress i warrant you ive no mother so there is none to oversee me and rule me and pluck me by the sleeve when i would go hither and thither so soon as i can be quit of my lady yonder oh theres a jolly life afore me it was amphilliss turn to be astonished dear heart she said why i have no kindred nearer than uncle and cousins but i have ever reckoned it a sore trouble to lose my mother and no blessing very like it was to you said agatha youd make no bones if you were ruled like an antiphonarium musicbook for anthems and chants ill be bound im none so fond of being driven in harness i love my own way and ill have it too one of these days but then you have none to love you that is one of the worst sorrows in the world i take it love bless you i shall have lovers enough ive three hundred a year to my fortune three hundred pounds in was equal to nearly five thousand now but what good should it do you that people wanted your money asked amphillis that isnt loving you amphillis i do believe you were born a hundred years old or else in some other world where their notions are quite diverse from this said agatha taking a candied orange from the sewer i never heard such things as you say but lovers who only want your money seem to me very unsatisfying folks replied amphillis will they smooth your pillows when you are sick or comfort you when your heart is woeful i dont mean my heart to be woeful and as to pillows there be thousands will smooth them for wages they are smoother when tis done for love was the answer agatha devoted herself to her orange and in a few minutes lady foljambe gave the signal to rise from table the young ladies followed her to her private sittingroom where agatha received a stern reprimand for the crime of laughing too loud and was told she was no better than a silly giglot who would probably bring herself some day to dire disgrace lady foljambe then motioned her to the spindle and desired her not to leave it till the bell rang for evening prayers in the chapel just before bedtime agatha pulled a face behind lady foljambes back but she did not dare to disobey note it seems very strange to us that the count de montfort should have imagined himself to have a better claim to the crown than his niece but the principle under which he claimed was the law of nonrepresentation which forbade the child of a deceased son or brother to inherit and this little as it is now allowed or even understood was not only the custom of some continental states but was the law of succession in england itself until the struggle between stephen and the empress maud and that between king john and his nephew arthur were fought upon this principle note the louvre then considered near paris was usually mentioned without the article chapter six a thankless child we will not come to thee till thou hast nailed us to some bitter cross and made us look on thee bm amphillis took her own spindle and sat down beside marabel who was just beginning to spin what was it so diverted agatha at supper inquired marabel she laughs full easily answered amphillis and told her what had been the subject of discourse she is a lightminded maid said marabel so you thought master norman had a satisfied look trow well i count you had the right agatha said she knew not of nought in this world that should satisfy him marabel smiled i misdoubt if that which satisfieth him ever came out of this world amphillis whenas you dwelt in london town heard you at all preach one of the poor priests what manner of folks be they you shall know them by their raiment for they mostly go clad of a frieze coat bound by a girdle of unwrought leather oh ay i heard once a friar so clad and i marvelled much to what order he belonged but it was some while gone what said he truly that cannot i tell you for i took not but little note i was but a maidling scarce past my childhood my mother was well pleased therewith i mind her to have said divers times when she lay of her last sickness that she would fain have shriven her of the friar in the frieze habit wherefore cannot i say then perchance i can say it for youfor i reckon it was because he brought her gladder tidings than she had heard of other amphillis looked surprised why whatso sermons be all alike so far as ever i could tell be they so no verily amphillis is there no difference betwixt preaching of the lawdo this and thou shalt live and preaching of the glad gospel of the grace of godi give unto them everlasting life but we must merit heaven exclaimed amphillis our lord then paid not the full price but left at the least a few marks over for us to pay nay he bought heaven for us amphillis and only he could do it we have nothing to pay and if we had how should our poor hands reach to such a purchase as that it took god to save the world ay and it took god too to love the world enough to save it why but if so be we are savednot shall be we are if we ever shall be but is that true catholic doctrine it is the true doctrine of gods love either therefore it is catholic doctrine or catholic doctrine hath erred from it but the church cannot err truth so long as she keep her true to gods law the church is men not god and god must be above the church but what is the church is it this priest or that bishop nay verily it is the congregation of all the faithful elect that follow christ and do after his commandments so long therefore as they do after his commands and follow him they be little like to err he that believeth in the son hath everlasting life but we all believe in our lord said amphillis feeling as if so many new ideas had never entered her head all at once before believe what said marabel and she smiled why we believe that he came down from heaven and died and rose again and ascended and suchlike wherefore wherefore came he truly that know i not by reason that it liked him i count ay that was the cause said marabel softly he came becauseshall we sayhe so loved amphillis neville that he could not do without her in heaven and as she could win there none other way than by the laying down of his life he came and laid it down marabel never heard i none to speak after this manner soothly our lord died for us but butyet was it not rightly for us thee and me but for some folks a long way off we cannot well say whom amphillis span and thoughtspan fast because she was thinking hard and marabel did not interrupt her thoughts butwe must merit it she urged again at last dost thou commonly merit the gifts given thee when man meriteth that he receivethwhen he doth somewhat to obtain itit is a wage not a gift the very life and soul of a gift is that it is not merited but given of free favour of friendship or love i never heard no such doctrine marabel only smiled followeth my lady this manner a little in the head maybe for the heart will i not speak and my lai would say mistress perrote amphillis suddenly recollected that her mistress was never to be mentioned ask at her said marabel with a smile then master norman is of this fashion of thinking ay so be the hyltons all whence gat you the same it was learned me of my lady molyneux of sefton that i served as chamberer ere i came hither i marvel somewhat amphillis that thou hast never heard the same and a neville all the nevilles of raby be of our learningwellnigh dear heart but im no neville of raby cried amphillis with a laugh at the extravagance of the idea at the least i know not well whence my father came his name was walter neville and his father was ralph and more knew i never he bare arms tis truegules a saltire argent and his device ne vile velis the self arms of the nevilles of raby said marabel with an amused smile i marvel amphillis thou art not better learned in thine own family matters soothly i never had none to learn me saving my mother and though she would tell me oft of my father himself how good and true man he were yet she never seemed to list to speak much of his house maybe it was by reason he came below his rank in wedding her and his kin refused to acknowledge her amongst them thus see you i dropped down as man should say into my mothers rank and never had no chance to learn nought of my fathers matters did thine uncle learn thee nought then he learned me how to make patties of divers fashions answered amphillis laughing he was very good to me and belike to my mother his sister but i went not to dwell with him until after she was departed to god and then i was so slender insignificant a country maid with no fortune ne parts talents that my cousins did somewhat slight me and keep me out of sight so never met i any that should be like to wise me in this matter and the sooth to say but i would not desire to dwell amongst kin that had set my mother aside and reckoned her not fit to company with them not for no wickedness nor unseemly dealing but only that she came of a trading stock it seemeth me had such wist our blessed lord himself they should have bidden him stand aside for he was but a carpenters son thats the evil of being in high place trow ah no dear heart it hath none ado with place high or low tis human nature thou shalt find a duchess more ready to company with a squires wife ofttimes than the squires wife with the bailiffs wife and there is a deal further distance betwixt it hangeth on the heart not on the station but folks hearts should be the better according to their station marabel laughed that were new world verily the grace of god is the same in every station and the like be the wiles of satannot that he bringeth to all the same temptation for he hath more wit than so but he tempteth all high and low the high have the fairer lookout yet the more perilous place the low have the less to content them yet are they safer things be more evenly parted in this world than many think many times he that hath rich food hath little appetite for it and he that hath his appetite sharp can scarce get food to satisfy it but then things fit not said amphillis soothly nay this world is thrown all out of gear by sin things fitted in eden be thou sure another reason is there alsothat he which hath the food may bestow it on him that can relish it and hath it not the chapel bell tolled softly for the last service of the day and the whole household assembled every day this was done at hazelwood for prime sext and compline at six am noon and seven pm respectively and any member of the household found missing would have been required to render an exceedingly good reason for it the services were very short and a sermon was a scarcely imagined performance after compline came bedtime each girl took her lamp louted to lady foljambe and kissed her hand and they then filed upstairs to bed after perrote she and amphillis going to their own turret hitherto perrote had been an extremely silent person not one word unnecessary to the work in hand had she ever uttered since those few on amphilliss first arrival it was therefore with some little surprise that the girl heard her voice as she stood that evening brushing her hair before the mirror amphillis who chose you to come hither truly mistress that wis i not only first of all mistress chaucer of the savoy palace looked me oer to see if i should be meet for taking into account and then came a lady thence and asked at me divers questions and judged that i should serve but who she was i knew not she bade me be well ware that i gat me in no entanglements of no sort said amphillis laughing a little but in good sooth i see here nothing to entangle me in she gave thee good counsel therein there be tangles of divers sorts my maid and those which cut the tightest be not alway the worst thou mayest tangle thy feet of soft wool or rich silk no less than of rough cord ah me there be tangles here amphillis and hard to undo there were skilwise fingers to their tyinghard fingers that thought only to pull them tight and harried them little touching the trouble of such as should be thus tethered and there be knots that no man can undoonly god why tarry the wheels of his chariot amphillis turned round from the mirror mistress perrote may i ask a thing at you ask my maid my lady answered me not will you what hath our lady done to be thus shut close in prison she done was the answer with a piteous intonation perrote looked earnestly into the girls face amphillis canst thou keep a secret if i know myself i can well wilt thou so do for the love of god and thy lady it should harm her if men knew thou wist it and god wot she hath harm enough i will never speak word mistress perrote to any other than you without you bid me or grant me leave so shall thou do well guess amphillis who is it that keepeth this poor lady in such durance nay that i cannot without it be our lord the king he surely yet is he but the gaoler there is another beyond him at whose earnest entreaty and for whose pleasure he so doth who is it thinkest it seemeth me mistress looking to what you say this poor lady must needs have some enemy said amphillis amphillis that worst enemy the enemy that bindeth these fetters upon her that bars these gates against her going forth that hath quenched all the sunlight of her life and hushed all the music out of itthis enemy is her own son that she nursed at her bosomthe boy for whose life she risked hers an hundred times whose patrimony she only saved to him whose welfare through thirty years hath been dearer to her than her own dost thou marvel if her words be bitter and if her eyes be sorrowful could they be aught else amphillis looked as horrified as she felt mistress perrote it is dreadful can my said lord duke be christian man christian echoed perrote bitterly dear heart ay one of the best catholics alive hath he not built churches with the moneys of his mothers dower and endowed convents with the wealth whereof he defrauded her what could man do better a church is a great matter and a mother a full little one mothers die but churches and convents endure ah when such mothers die and go to god be there no words writ on the account their sons shall thereafter render is he all silent that denounced the jewish priests for their corban by reason they allowed man to deny to his father and mother that which he had devote to gods temple is his temple built well of broken hearts and his altar meetly covered with the rich tracery of womens tears the hope of the hypocrite shall perish when god taketh away his soul never before had amphillis seen any one change as perrote had changed now the quiet stolidlooking woman had become an inspired prophetess it was manifest that she dearly loved her mistress and was proportionately indignant with the son who treated her so cruelly child she said to amphillis she lived for nought save that boy her daughter was scarce anything to her it was alway the lad the lad and thus the lad apayeth her for all her love and sacrificefor the heart that stood betwixt him and evil for the gold and jewels that she thought too mean to be set in comparison with him for the weary arms that bare him and the tired feet that carried him about a little wailing babefor the toil and the labour the hope and the fear the waiting and the sorrow ay but i marvel in what manner of coin god our father shall pay him but wherefore doth he so cried amphillis she was in his way replied perrote in a tone of constrained bitterness he could not have all his will for her he desired to make bargains and issue mandates and reign at his pleasure and she told him the bargains were unprofitable and the mandates unjust and it was not agreeable twas full awkward and illconvenient look you to have an old mother interfering with mans pleasure he would have set her in a fair palace and given her due dower i reckon would she but there have tarried like a slug on a cabbageleaf and let him alone and she would not how could she she was not a slug but an eagle and tis not the nature of an eagle to hang hour after hour upon a cabbageleaf so as king edward had at the first kept her in durance for his own ends my gracious lord duke did entreat him to continue the same on his account as for my lady duchess i say not i know her not this only i know that my lady foljambe is her kinswoman and most times there is a woman at the bottom of all evil mischief ay there is so mistress perrote it seemeth me this is worser world than i wist ere i came hither art avised o that ay phyllis thou shalt find it so and the further thou journeyest therein the worser shalt thou find it mistress wherefore is it that this poor lady of ours is kept so secret it seemeth as though man would have none know where she were ha chetife oh miserable i can but avise thee to ask so much at them that do keep her shall she never be suffered to come forth ay said perrote slowly and solemnly she shall come forth one day but i misdoubt if it shall be ere the king come himself for her the king shall his grace come hither inquired amphillis with much interest she thought of no king but edward the third perrotes eyes were uplifted towards the stars she spoke as if she were answering them rather than amphillis he shall deem judge the poor men of the people and he shall make safe the sons of poor men and he shall make low the false challenger and he shall dwell with the sun and before the moon in generation and in to generation and he shall be lord from the sea till to the sea and from the flood till to the ending of the world for he shall deliver a poor man from the mighty and a poor man to whom was none helper he shall spare a poor man and needy and he shall make safe the souls of poor men blessed be the name of his majesty withouten end and all earth shall be filled with his majesty be it done be it done note amphillis almost held her breath as she listened for the first time in her life to the grand roll of those sonorous verses that were a king she said that shall be a king answered perrote softly not yet is his kingdom of this world but he is king of israel and king of kings and king of the everlasting ages and the day cometh when he shall be

that would fain stretch their wings and be off into the sunlight mine never do nought else think you not the fathers and mothers might reasonably ask wheres the good of sons and daughters how much have you cost yours matthew since you were born matthew foljambe turned round with a light laugh and gazed half contemptuously at the speaker gentlemen never reckon said he tis a mean business only

there man alive wilt hold thy peace and let man be thou art turned now into a predicant friar ill leave thee here to preach to the gillyflowers and matthew walked off with a sprig of mint in his mouth he was not a bad man as men go he was simply a man who wanted to please himself and to be comfortable and easy in his eyes the whole fabric of the universe revolved round matthew foljambe he did not show it as the royal savage did who beat a primitive gong in token that as he had sat down to dinner the rest of the world might lawfully satisfy their hunger but the sentiment in matthews mind was a civilised and refined form of the same idea if he were comfortable what did it signify if everybody else were uncomfortable like all men in his dayand a good many in our ownmatthew had a low opinion of woman it had been instilled into him as it was at that time into every man who wrote himself esquire that the utmost chivalrous reverence was due to the ladies as an abstract idea but this abstract idea was quite compatible with the rudest behaviour and the supremest contempt for any given woman in the concrete woman was an article of which there were two qualities the firstclass thing was a toy the second was a machine both were for the use of manwhich was true enough had they only realised that it meant for mans real help and improvement bodily mental and spiritual but they understood it to mean for the bodily comfort and mental amusement of the nobler half of the human race the natural result of this was that every woman must be appropriated to some master the bare notion of allowing a woman to choose whether she would go through life unattached to a master or if otherwise to reject one she feared or disliked would have seemed to matthew the most preposterous audacity on the part of the inferior creature as it would also have appeared if the inferior creature had shown discontent with the lot marked out for it the inferior creature on the whole walked very meekly in the path thus swept for it this was partly no doubt because it was so taught as a religious duty but partly also because the style of education then given to women left no room for the mental wings to expand the bird was supplied with good seed and fresh water and the idea of its wanting anything else was regarded as absurd let it sit on the perch and sing in a properly subdued tone that it was graciously allowed to sing was enough for any reasonable bird and ought to call forth on its part overflowing gratitude even then a few of the caged birds were not content to sit meekly on the perch but they were eyed askance by the properly behaved ones and held up to the unfledged nestlings as sorrowful examples of the pernicious habit of thinking for ones self never was bird less satisfied to be shut up in a cage than the hapless prisoner in that manor house whom the peasants of the neighbourhood knew as the white lady now and then they caught a glimpse of her at the window of her chamber which she insisted on having open and at which she would stand sometimes by the hour together looking sorrowfully out on the blue sky and the green fields wherein she might wander no more a wild bird was marguerite of flanders in whose veins ran the blood of those untamed seaeagles the vikings of denmark and though bars and wires might keep her in the cage to make her content with it was beyond their power so thought norman hylton looking up at the white figure visible behind the bars which crossed the casement of the captives chamber he knew little of her beyond her name saying thy prayers to the moon hylton or to the white lady asked a voice behind him neither godfrey i was marvelling wherefore she is mewed up there dost know i know she was a full wearisome woman to my lord duke her son and that he is a jollier man by the acre since she here dwelt was she his own mother asked norman his ownay for sure and did him a good turn at the beginning by preserving his kingdom for him when he was but a lad and could he find no better reward for her than this tut she sharped teased irritated him man he could not have his will for her could he neer have put up with a little less of it or was his will so much dearer to him than his mother dost reckon he longed sore to be ridden of an old woman and made to trot to market at her pleasure when his own was to take every gate and hurdle in his way thou art old woman thyself an thou so dost my lord duke is no jogtrot marketass i can tell thee but as fiery a warcharger as man may see in a summers day and dost think a warcharger should be well apaid to have an old woman of his back my lady his mother then hath no fire in her said norman glancing up at her where she stood behind the bars in her white weeds looking down on the two young men in the garden marry enough to burn a city down she did burn the king of frances camp afore hennebon and whenas she was prisoner in tickhill castle a certain knight whose name i know not the name of this knight is apparently not on record covenanted secretly with her by means of some bribe or such like given to her keepers that he would deliver her from durance and one night scaled he the walls and she herself gat down from her window and clambered like a cat by means of the waterspout and slight footholds in the stonework till she came to the bottom and then over the walls and away they were taken as thou mayest lightly guess yet they gat them nigh clear of the liberties ere they could again be captivated fire ay that hath she and ever will forsooth that is the cause wherefore she harried her son if she would have sat still at her spinning hed have left her be but look thou she could not leave him be wherein did she seek to let him wot you good lack not i if thou art so troubled thereanent thou wert best ask my father maybe he wist not i cannot say it must have been sore disheartenment said norman pityingly to win nearly away and then be brought back ay marry and then was she had up to london afore the kings grace and had into straiter prison than aforetime ere that matter was she treated rather as guest of the king and queen though in good sooth she was prisoner but after was she left no doubt touching that question some thought she might have been released eight years agone when the convention was with the lady joan of brittany which after her lord was killed at auray gave up all receiving the county of penthievre the city of limoges and a great sum of money and so far as england reckoned so she might and maybe would had it been to my lord dukes convenience but he had found her aforetime very troublesome to him why when he was but a youth he fell o love with some fair damsel of his mothers following and should have wedded her had not my lady duchess so soon as ever she knew it packed her off to a nunnery wherefore that wis i not without it were that she was not for him unsuitable was the tale true think you that wis i not likewise man said so muchbehold all i know any way she harried him and he loved it not and here she is thats enough for me poor lady poor what for poor she has all she can want she is fed and clad as well as ever she wasbetter i dare guess than when she was besieged in hennebon if she would have broidery silks or flowers or any sort of womens toys she hath but to say and my lady my mother shall ride to derby for them the king gave order she should be well used and well used she is he desireth not that she be punished but only kept sure i would guess that mere keeping in durance with nought more to vex her were sorest suffering to one of her fashioning but what more can she lack beside she is only a woman women mostly live in and for their children and your story sounds as though hers cared little enough for her well they know she is well treated why should they harry them over her they be young and would lead a jolly life not to be tied for ever to her apronstring i would not use my mother thus what wouldst lead her horse with thy bonnet doffed and make a leg afore her whenever she spake unto thee if it made her happy so to do i would meseemeth i should be as well employed in leading her horse as another and could show my chivalry as well towards mine old mother as any other lady i were somewhat more beholden to her of the twain and god bade me not honour any other but he did her ha chetife tis easier work honouring a fair damsel with golden hair and roseleaf cheek than a toothless old harridan that is for ever plaguing thee belike the lord knew that and writ therefore his fifth command godfrey did not answer for his attention was diverted two wellladen mules stood at the gate and two men were coming up to the manor house carrying a large packa somewhat exciting vision to country people in the middle ages there were then no such things as village shops and only in the largest and most important towns was any great stock kept by tradesmen the chief trading in country places was done by these itinerant pedlars whose visits were therefore a source of great interest to the family and especially to the ladies they served frequently as messengers and carriers in a small way and were particularly valuable between the four seasons when alone anything worth notice could be expected in the shopseaster whitsuntide all saints and christmas there were also the spring and autumn fairs but these were small matters except in the great towns as it was now the beginning of september godfrey knew that a travelling pedlar would be a most acceptable visitor to his mother and wife the porter instructed by his young master let in the pedlars what have ye demanded godfrey i have mercery sweet sir and he hath jewelling answered the taller of the pedlars a middleaged man with a bronzed face which told of much outdoor exposure why well said come ye both into hall and when ye have eaten and drunk then shall ye open your packs godfrey led the pedlars into the hall and shouted for the sewer whom he bade to set a table and serve the wearied men with food an hour later amphillis who was sewing in her mistresss chamber rose at the entrance of lady foljambe here dame be pedlars bearing mercery and jewelling said she would your grace anything that i can pick forth to your content ay i lack a few matters avena said the countess in her usual bittersweet style a twothree yards of freedom an it like thee and a boxful of air so he have it fresh and if thou see a silver chain of daughters duty or a bit of sons love set in gold i could serve me of those if i had them theyll not come over sea methinketh would it like your grace asked lady foljambe rather stiffly to speak in plain language and say what you would have plain language repeated the countess in very deed but i reckoned i had given thee some of that afore now i would have my liberty avena foljambe and i would have my rights and i would have of mine own childre such honour as longeth to a mother by reason and gods law is that plain enough or wouldst have it rougher hewn dame your grace wist well that such matter as this cometh not of pedlars packs ay said the countess with a long weary sigh i do so nor out of mens hearts belike well avena to come down to such petty matter as i count i shall be suffered to have prithee bring me some violet silk of this shade for broidery and another yard or twain of red samitelle for the backing it were not in thy writ of matters allowable i reckon that the pedlars should come up and open their packs in my sight lady foljambe looked scandalised dear heart dame what means your grace i know said the countess they have eyes no less than i and they shall see an old woman in white doole and fall to marvelling and maybe talking wherefore their lord king edward keepeth her mewed up with bars across her casement his graces honour must be respected trow be it done tis only one penny the more to the account that the lord of the helpless shall demand of him one day i trust he hath in his coffers wherewith to pay that debt verily there shall be some strange meetings in that further world i marvel something what manner of tale mine old friend de mauny carried thither this last january when he went on the long journey that hath no return howbeit seeing he wedded his masters cousin maybe it were not to his conveniency to remind the lord of the old woman behind the bars at hazelwood it should scantly redound to his lords credit and at times it seemeth me that the lord lacketh reminding for he appears to have forgot me i cannot listen dame to such speech of my sovereign do thy duty avena after all thy sovereigns not bad man as men go marvellous ill they go some of them he hath held his sceptre well even betwixt justice and mercy on the whole saving in two matters whereof this old woman is one and old women be of small account with most men he should have fared well had he wist his own mind a bit betterbut thats in the blood old king harry his fathers grandfather i have heard say was a weary setout for that go thy ways avena and stand not staring at me im neither a lovesome young damsel nor a hobgoblin that thou shouldst set eyes on me thus three ells of red samitelle and two ounces of violet silk this hueand a bit of gold twist shall harm no man amphillis my maid thou art not glued to the chamber floor like thy mistress go thou and take thy pleasure to see the pedlars packs thou hast not much here poor child amphillis thankfully accepted her mistresss considerate permission and ran down to the hall she found the mercers pack open and the rich stuffs hung all about on the forms which had been pulled forward for that purpose the jeweller meanwhile sat in a corner resting until he was wanted time was not of much value in the middle ages chapter eight alners and samitelle and theres many a deed i could wish undone though the law might not be broke and theres many a word now i come to think that i wish i had not spoke the mercers stock spread out upon the benches of the hall was a sight at once gay and magnificent cloth of gold diaper baldekin velvet tissue samite satin tartaryn samitelle sarcenet taffata sindon cendall sayall of them varieties of silken stuffsribbons of silk satin velvet silver and gold were heaped together in brilliant and bewildering confusion of beautiful colours lady foljambe mrs margaret marabel and agatha were all looking on what price is that by the yard inquired lady foljambe touching a piece of superb cyprus baldekin striped white and crimson baldekin was an exceedingly rich silk originally made at constantinople it was now manufactured in england also but the oversea article was the more valuable the baldekin of cyprus holding first rank baldachino is derived from this word dame answered the mercer that is a cyprus baldekin it is eight pound the piece of three ells lady foljambe resigned the costly beauty with a sigh and this she asked indicating a piece of soft blue that is an oversea cloth dame yet not principal of firstclass qualityit is priced five pound the piece lady foljambes gesture intimated that this was too much for her purse hast any gold cloths of tissue not over three pound the piece that have i dame answered the mercer displaying a pretty pale green a dark red and one of the favourite yellowishbrown shade known as tawny lady foljambe looked discontented the beautiful baldekins first seen had eclipsed the modest attractions of their less showy associates nay i pass not do not care for those said she show me velvet the mercer answered by dexterously draping an unoccupied form first with a piece of rich purple then one of tawny then one of deep crimson and lastly a bright blue and what price be they he touched each as he recounted the prices beginning with the purple fifteen shillings the ell dame a mark shillings pence fourteen shillings half a mark i have also a fair green at half a mark a peach blossom at fourteen shillings a grey at sevenandsixpence and a murrey mulberry colour at a mark lady foljambe slightly shrugged her shoulders say a noble shillings pence for the grey and set it aside she said dame i could not replied the mercer firmly though respectfully my goods be honest matter they be such as they are set forth and they have paid the kings dues like many other people lady foljambe would have preferred smuggled goods if they were cheaper than the honest article her conscience was very elastic about taxes it was no great wonder that this spirit prevailed in days when the crown could ruthlessly squeeze its subjects whenever it wanted extra money as henry the third had done a hundred years before and though his successors had not imitated his example the memory of it remained as a horror and a suspicion dishonest people whether they are kings or coalheavers always make a place more difficult to fill for those who come after them well then set aside the blue said lady foljambe with a slight pout margaret what lackest thou mrs margaret looked wistfully at the fourteenshilling crimson and then manfully chose the sixandeightpenny green now let us see thy samitelles said her ladyship samitelle as its name implies was doubtless a commoner quality of the rich and precious samite which ranked in costliness and beauty with baldekin and cloth of gold and above satin and velvet samite was a silk material of which no more is known than that it was very expensive and had a glossy sheen like satin some antiquaries have supposed it to be an old name for satin but as several wardrobe rolls contain entries relating to both in immediate sequence this supposition is untenable the mercer exhibited three pieces of samitelle perse dame four marks the piece said he holding up a very pale blue ashcolour thirty shillings applebloom forty shillings no said lady foljambe i would have white fortyfive shillings the piece dame hast no cheaper not in white dame well lay it aside likewise three ells of the red i would have moreover a cendall of beanflower colour and a piece or twain of say murrey or sopinwine cendall was a very fine thin silk fit for summer wear resembling what is now called foulard say was the coarsest and cheapest sort of silk and was used for upholstery as well as clothing i have a full fair beanflower cendall dame one shilling the ell and a good sopinwine say at twopence the mercer as he spoke held up the piece of say of a nondescript colour not unlike what is now termed crushed strawberry that shall serve for the chamberers said lady foljambe but the cendall is for myself i would have it good dame it is principal you shall not see better good measure me off six ells of the cendall and nine of the say then lay by each piece skeins of thread of silk an ounce to the piece each to his colour two ounces of violet and two of gold twist enough for this morrow the mercer bowed with deft quickness executed the order and proceeded to pack up the remainder of his goods when the forms were denuded of their rich coverings he retired into the corner and the jeweller came forward the little jeweller was less dignified but more lively and loquacious than his companion the mercer he unstrapped his pack laid it open at the feet of lady foljambe and executed a prolonged flourish of two plump brown hands what may i lay before your ladyship buttons and buttoners of de best paternosters of de finest gold and silver collars chains crucifixes garnished of stones and pearls crespines girdles of every fashion ouches rings tablets tablets were of two sorts reliquaries and memorandumbooks charms gipsers and forcers satchels to hang from the waist and small boxes combs spoons caskets collars for de leetle dogs bells points tagged laces then much used alners almsbags larger than purses purses knives scissors cupswhat asks your ladyship behold dem all dost call thyself a jeweller asked lady foljambe with a laugh why thou art jeweller silversmith girdler forcermaker and cutler dame i am all men to please my customers answered the little jeweller obsequiously will your ladyship look ah de beautiful tings art thou englishman ah no madame i am a breton i come from hennebon a sudden flash of suspicious uneasiness lighted up the eyes of the countess of montforts gaoler yet had the man meant mischief he would scarcely have been so communicative however that might be lady foljambe determined to get him out of the house as quickly as possible i lack but little of thy sort she said howbeit thou mayest show us thine alners and thy buttons i would fain have a gipser said mrs margaret while mrs margaret was selecting from the stock of gipsers a pretty red velvet one with a silver clasp price halfacrown perrote came quietly into the hall and stood beside amphillis a little behind lady foljambe who had not heard her entrance here are de alners madame said the lively little breton blue green black white red tawny violet will your ladyship choose tree shillings to free marksbeautiful beautiful den here arebon saints que voisje surely surely it is mademoiselle de carhaix it is said perrote and thou art ivo filz jehan i am ivo filz jehan dat man calls ivo le breton i go from cornwall where dwell my countrymen right up to de scottish border and how comes it den if a poor man may ask dat i find here in de heart of england a breton damsel of family lady foljambe was in an agony she would have given her best gold chain for the little breton jeweller to have kept away from hazelwood if he had any sort of penetration another minute might reveal the secret hitherto so jealously guarded that his sovereigns missing mother was a prisoner there her misery was the greater because she could not feel at all sure of perrote whom she strongly suspected of more loyalty to her mistress than to king edward in her heart though she had not shown it by any outward action perrote knew the direction of lady foljambes thoughts as well as if she had spoken them she answered very calmly and with a smile may breton damsels not tarry in strange lands as well as breton pedlars i have divers friends in england surely surely said the pedlar hastily perceiving that he had transgressed against lady foljambes pleasure only if so poor man may say it it is full pleasant to see face dat man know in strange land madame would it please your ladyship to regard de alners lady foljambe was only too glad to turn ivos attention back to the alners she bought six for presentsthey were a favourite form of gift and picked out twenty buttons of silvergilt stamped with an eagle mrs margaret also selected a rosary of coral set in silver to help her in saying her prayers for which article in her eyes of the first necessity she gave shillings pence and for a minute enamelled image of the virgin and child in a little tabernacle or case of silver filagree of italian work she paid five pounds this was to be set before her on the table and prayed to mrs margaret would not have put it quite in that plain form of words for no idolater will ever admit that he addresses the piece of wood or stone but it was what she really did without admitting it alas for the worshipper whose god has to be carried about and requires dusting like any other ornament they that make them are like unto them so is every one that trusteth in them perrote bought an ivory comb of ivo which cost her three shillings for old acquaintance sake marabel purchased six silver buttons in the form of a lamb for which she paid shillings pence agatha invested four shillings in a chaplet of pearls while amphillis whose purse was very low and had never been otherwise contented herself with a sixpenny casket ivo however was well satisfied and packed up his goods with a radiant face when the two itinerant tradesmen had shouldered their packs and had gone forth lady foljambe hastily summoned her husbands squire she was not sufficiently high in dignity to have a squire of her own prithee keep watch of yon little jeweller packman said she uneasily mark whither he goeth and see that he hold no discourse with any of the household without it be to trade withal i desire to know him clear of the vicinage ere the dark falleth norman hylton bowed in answer and went out he found the two packmen in the courtyard the centre of an admiring throng of servants and retainers all of whom were anxious to inspect their goods some from a desire to make such purchases as they could afford and all from that longing to relieve the monotony of life which besets man in general and must have been especially tempting in the middle ages a travelling pedlar was the substitute for an illustrated newspaper his pack supplying the engravings and his tongue the text these men and pilgrims were the chief newsmongers of the day ivo dangled a pair of blue glass earrings before the enchanted eyes of kate the chambermaid you shall have dem dirt sheap treepence de pairdat is all vat lack you my young maids here is mirrors and combs scissors and knives necklaces beads and girdles purses of rouen forcers and gipsersall manner you

brooches crespines charms spectacles alners balls puppets coffers bells baskets for de maids needlework pins needles earrings shoebuckles buttonseveryting and herehere is my beautifullest tingmy chiefest relic in de leetle silver boxsee nay what is it trow inquired kate who looked with deep interest through the interstices of the filagree and saw nothing but a few inches of coarse linen thread oh it is de blessed relic look you our lady made shirt for saint joseph and she cut off de tread and it fall on de floor and dere it lie till saint petronilla come by and she pick it up and put it in her bosom it is all writ down inside de holy fader give it my moders grandmoders aunt when she go to rome it is wort tousands of poundsde tread dat our blessed lady draw trough her fingers you should have no maladies never if you wear dat ay but such things as that be alonely for folk as can pay for em i reckon said kate looking wistfully first at the blue earrings and then at the blessed relic ivo made a screen of his hand and spoke into kates ear see you now you buy dem and i trow him you into de bargain said i well fair maid what all for threepence gasped the bewitched kate all for treepence de blessed relic and de beautiful earrings it is dirt sheap i would not say it to nobody else only my friends see you kate looked in his face to see if he meant it and then slowly drew out her purse the warmth of ivos friendship ten minutes old at the most rather staggered her but the earrings had taken her fancy and she was also though less desirous to possess the holy relic she poured out into the palm of her hand various pence halfpence and farthings and began endeavouring to reckon up the threepence a difficult task for a girl utterly ignorant of figures you leave me count it suggested the little packman i will not cheat youno no how could i wid de blessed relic in mine hand one two free dere i put in de rings in your ears ah dey make you look beautiful beautiful de widow lady i see her not when i have my pack in hall she is well what widow lady trow said kate feeling the first earring glide softly into her ear ah i have afore been here i see a widow lady at de window why come she not to halloh how fair you shall be you shall every eye charmshe is here no moreyes well aythere is a widow lady dwelleth here said kate offering the other ear to her beguiler just as norman hylton came up to them but she is a prisoner andhush haste you now or i must run without them dat shall you not said ivo quickly slipping the second earring into its place ah how lovesome should you be under dat bush by the gate that hath de yellow flowers when de sun was setting and all golden behind you keep well de holy relic it shall bring you good and with a significant look and a glance upwards at the house ivo shouldered his pack and turned away the mercer had not seemed anxious to do business with the household perhaps he felt that his wares were scarcely within their means he sat quietly in the gateway until the jeweller had finished his chaffering when he rose and walked out beside him the two packs were carefully strapped on the waiting mules which were held by the lad and the party marched down the slope from the gateway what bought you with your holy relic and your earrings ivo asked the mercer with a rather satirical glance at his companion when they were well out of hearing aught that was worth them i bought the news that our lady abideth hither was the grave reply and it was cheap at the cost of a scrap of tin and another of glass and an inch or twain of thread out of your pack if yon maid have but wit to be under the shrub by the gate at sunset i shall win more of her but shes but a poor brain or i err howbeit ive had my earrings worth they cost but a halfpenny can you see aught from here your eyes be sharper than mine i see somewhat white at yonder window but ivo were you wise to tell the lady you came from hennebon i was sir roland she will suspect me now instead of you and if as i guess she send a spy after us when we part company he will follow me and you shall be quit of him the mercer glanced back as though to see if any one were following well perchance you say well he answered there is none behind methinks so now to rejoin father eloy norman hylton had not followed the packmen beyond the gate he did not like the business and was glad to be rid of it he only kept watch of them till they disappeared up the hill and then returned to tell lady foljambe the direction which they had taken kates mind was considerably exercised as ivo had remarked her wits were by no means of the first quality but her conceit and love of admiration far outstripped them the little jeweller had seen this and had guessed that she would best answer his purpose of the younger members of the household quiet sensible joan the upper chambermaid would not have suited him at all neither would sturdy straightforward meg the cookmaid but kates vanity and indiscretion were both so patent that he fixed on her at once as his chosen accomplice his only doubt was whether she had sense enough to understand his hint about being under the bush at sunset ivo provided himself with a showy brooch of red glass set in gilt copper which kate was intended to accept as gold and rubies and leaving his pack under the care of his fellow conspiratorfor ivo was really the pedlar which roland was not he slipped back to hazelwood and shortly before the sun set was prowling about in the neighbourhood of the bush which stood just outside the gate of hazelwood manor before he had been there many minutes a light tripping footstep was heard and poor foolish kate with the blue drops in her ears came like a giddy fly into the web of ivo the spider chapter nine mischief ive nothing to do with better and worsei havent to judge for the rest if other men are not better than i am they are bad enough at the best when ivo thought proper to see kate approaching he turned with an exclamation of hyperbolical admiration he knew perfectly the type of woman with whom he had to deal ah it is den you fair maid you be fair widout dem but much fairer wid de earrings i you assure ah if you had but a comely ouche at your troat just dereand ivo laid a fat brown finger at the base of his ownyour beauty would be perfect perfect lackaday i would i had responded silly kate but ouches and such be not for the likes of me how say no such a ting i know of one jewel a ruby of de best and de setting of pure gold fit for a queen dat might be had by de maid who would give herself one leetle pain to tell me only one leetle ting dat should harm none but you care not i dare say to trouble youself so much and ivo thrust his hands in his pockets and began to whistle softly nay now do you said the bewitched fly getting a little deeper into the web good master packman do of your grace tell me how a maid should earn that jewel ivo drew the brooch half out of his breast so as just to allow kate the least glance at it possible is that the jewel she asked eagerly eh but it shineth wellnigh to match the sun himself come now what should i tell you ill do aught to win it ivo came close to her and spoke into her ear show me which is the prisoners window well its yon oriel on the inner side ofeh but i marvel if i do ill to tell you tell me noting at all dat you count ill was the pious answer of ivo who had got to know all he needed except one item you can tarry a little longer or you are very busy sir godfrey is away is it not nay hes at home but hell be hence next week hes to tilt at the tournament at leicester ah dat will be grand sight all de knights and de ladies but i am suresuredere shall not be one so fair as you sweet maid look you

how it shine it shine better as de sun when it do catch him you sleep in de prisoners chamberyes nay im but a subchambermaid look younot even an upper mistress perrote she sleeps in the pallet whenas any doth but methinks her ladyship lieth alone at this present howbeit none never seeth her save mistress perrote and mistress amphillis and my lady and sir godfrey of course when they have need ive neer beheld her myself only standing behind the casement as she oft loveth to do my lady hath a key to her chamber door and mistress perrote the like and none save these never entereth ivo drank in all the information which kate imparted while he only seemed to be carelessly trimming a switch which he had pulled from a willow close at hand they be careful of her it should seem he said you may say that theyre mortal feared of any man so much as seeing her well i reckon i should go now im sure im right full indebted to you master packman for this jewel only i dont feel as if i have paid you for it you have me paid twice its value to suffer me look on your beautiful face was the gallant answer with a low bow but one more word and i go fair maid and de sun go from me wid you de porter he

good even master packman and good befall you youll not forget that crespine forget impossible absolute impossible i bear your remembrance on mine heart all de days of my life i adore you farewell when meg the next minute joined kate under the tree there was no more sign of ivo than if he had been the airy creature of a dream the little pedlar had escaped dexterously and only just in time he hid for a moment beneath the shade of a friendly shrub and as soon as he saw megs back turned ran downwards into the derby road as lithely as a cat and took the way to that city where he recounted to his companions when other people were supposed to be asleep the arrangement he had made to free the countess thou art sore lacking in discretion my son said father eloy whose normal condition was that of a private confessor in bretagne and whose temporary disguise was that of a horsedealer such a maid as thou describest is as certain to want and have a confidant as she is to wear that trumpery thou wilt findor rather we shall findthe whole house up and alert and fully aware of our intention ivos shoulders were shrugged very decidedly ha chetife cried he she will want the crespine not so much as she will want to impart her secret answered the priest who whispered to the earth midas has long ears it will not matter much to ivo so he be not taken said the knight nor in a sense to you father as your frock protects you i shall come off the worst youll come off well enough responded ivo you made an excellent mercer this morrow you only need go on chaffering till you have sold all your satins and by that time you will have your pockets well lined and if you choose your route wisely you will be near the sea well and good if we are not all by that time eating dry bread at the expense of our worthy friend sir godfrey mind you are not sir roland said ivo every man for himself i always fall on my feet like a cat and have nine lives nine lives come to an end some day replied sir roland grimly on what art thou athinking thus busily phyllis your pardon mistress perrote i was thinking of you not hard to guess when i saw thine eyes look divers times my ways what anentis me my maid i cry you mercy mistress perrote for you should very like say that whereon i thought was none of my business yet mans thoughts will not alway be ruled i did somewhat marvel under your pleasure at your answer to yon pedlar that asked how you came to be hither wherefore that i told him no more ay and likewise make an end my maid mistress again i cry you mercy but it seemed me as though while you sore pitied our lady you had no list to help her forth of her trouble an it might be compassed and i conceived note it not it could not be compassed phyllis and granting it so should to what good purpose set in case that she came forth this morrow a free womanwhither is she to wend and what to do to her son he will have none of her to her daughter man saith she hath scantly more freedom than her mother in truth being ruled of an ill husband that giveth her no leave to work to king edward it should but set him in the briars with divers other princes the king of france and the duke of bretagne more in especial to my lady princess verily she is good woman yet is she mother of my lady duchess and though i cast no doubt she should essay to judge the matter righteously yet tis but like that she should lean to her own child which doubtless seeth through her lords eyes and it should set her in the briars no less than king edward whither then is she to go for whom there is no room on middle earth note and whose company all men avoid nay my maid for the lady marguerite there is no home save heaven and there is none to be glad of her company save him that was yet more lonely than she and whose foes like hers were they of his own house tis sore pitiful said amphillis looking up with the tears in her eyes pitiful ay never was sadder case sithence that saddest of all in the garden of gethsemane would god she would seek him and accept of his pity surely our lady is christian woman responded amphillis in a rather astonished tone what signifiest thereby why she that doth right heartily believe christ our lord to have been born and died and risen again and so forth what good should that do her amphillis stared without answering if that belief were very heartfelt it should be life and comfort but meseemeth thy manner of belief is not heartfelt but headful to believe that a man lived and died phyllis is not to accept his help and to affy thee in his trustworthiness did it ever any good and pleasure to thee to believe that one julius caesar lived over a thousand years ago no verily but amphillis did not like to say what she was thinking that no appropriation of good nor sensation of pleasure had ever yet mingled with that belief in the facts concerning jesus christ on which she vaguely relied for salvation she thought a moment and then spoke out mistress did you mean there was some other fashion of believing than to think certainly that our lord did live and die set in case phyllis that thou shouldst hear man to say i believe in master godfrey but not in master matthew what shouldst reckon him to signify think on it i suppose said amphillis after a moments pause for consideration i should account him to mean that he held master godfrey for a true man in whom man might safely affy him but that he felt not thus sure of master matthew thou wouldst not reckon then that he counted master matthew as a fabled man that was not alive nay surely said amphillis laughing then seest not for thyself that there is a manner of belief far beside and beyond the mere reckoning that man liveth phyllis dost thou trust christ our lord for what mistress that he shall make me safe at last if i do my duty and pay my dues to the church and shrive me confess sins to a priest metely oft and so forth ay i reckon i do said amphillis in a tone which sounded rather as if she meant i dont hast alway done thy duty amphillis alack no mistress yet meseemeth there be worser folks than i i am alway regular at shrift the which shrift thou shouldst little need if thou hadst never failed in duty but how shall our lord make thee safe why forgive me my sins replied amphillis looking puzzled that saith what he shall do not how he shall do it thy sins are a debt to gods law and righteousness canst thou pay a debt without cost but forgiveness costs nought doth it so i think scarce anything costs more hast ever meditated amphillis what it cost god to forgive sin i thought it cost him nothing at all child it could only be done in one of two ways at the cost of his very self either he should forgive sin without propitiationwhich were to cost his righteousness and truth and honour could that be in no wise then it must be at the cost of his own bearing the penalty due unto the sinner thy sins amphillis thine every failure in duty thine every foolish thought or wrongful word cost the father his own son out of his bosom cost the son a human life of agony and a death of uttermost terribleness didst thou believe that a long look of mingled amazement and horror preceded the reply mistress perrote i never thought of no such thing i thoughti thought said amphillis struggling for the right words to make her meaning clear i thought our lord was to judge us for our sins and our blessed lady did plead with him to have mercy on us and we must do the best we could and pray her to pray for us but the fashion you so put it seemethit seemeth certain as though the matter were settled and done with and should not be fordone revoked is it thus if perrote de carhaix had not been gifted with the unction from the holy one she would have made a terrible mistake at that juncture all that she had been taught by man inclined her to say no to the question but there are a few of us whom god whispers in the ear and those who hear those whispers often go utterly contrary to mans teaching being bound only by gods word so bound they must be if they speak not according to that word it is because there is no light in themonly an ignis fatuus which leads the traveller into quagmires but they are often free from all other bonds perrote could not have told what made her answer that question in the way she did it was as if a soft hand were laid upon her lips preventing her from entering into any doctrinal disputations and insisting on her keeping the question down to the personal level she saidor that inward monitor said through her is it settled for thee amphillis mistress i dont know can i have it settled he that believeth on the son hath everlasting life i give unto them eternal life john three verse ten verse perrote said no more then if i go and ask at him my lord god i cried unto thee and thou madest me whole all ye that hope in the lord do manly and your heart shall be comforted psalm thirty verse thirtyone verse hereford and purveys version once more it was as by a heavenly instinct that perrote answered in gods words rather than in her own amphillis drew a long breath the light was rising on her she could not have put her convictions into words and it was quite as well for had she done so men might have persuaded her out of them but the one conviction borne in upon her wasgod and not man gods word not mens words god the saviour of men not man the saviour of himself god the giver of his son for the salvation of men not men the offerers of something to god for their own salvation and when man or woman reaches that point that he sees in all the universe only himself and god the two points are not likely to remain long apart when the one is need longing for love and the other is love seeking for need what can they do but come close together sir godfrey set forth for his tournament in magnificent style and lady foljambe and mistress margaret with him young godfrey was already gone the old knight rode a fine charger and was preceded by his standardbearer carrying a pennon of bright blue whereon were embroidered his masters armssable a bend or between six scallops of the second the ladies journeyed together in a quirle and were provided with rich robes and all their jewellery the house and the prisoner were left in the hands of matthew father jordan and perrote norman hylton accompanied his master lady foljambes mind had grown tolerably easy on the subject of ivo and she only gave perrote a long lecture warning her among other things never to leave the door unlocked nor the prisoner alone either perrote or amphillis must sleep in the pallet bed in her chamber during the whole time of lady foljambes absence so that she should never be left unguarded for a single moment matthew received another harangue to which he paid little attention in reality though in outward seeming he received it with due deference father jordan languidly washed his hands with invisible soap and assured his patrons that no harm could possibly come to the prisoner through their absence the tuesday evening was near its close the sun had just sunk behind the western hills the day had been bright and beautiful in the extreme amphillis was going slowly upstairs to her turret carrying her little workbasket which was covered with brown velvet and adorned with silver cord when she saw kate standing in the window of the landing as if she were waiting for something or some person it struck amphillis that kate looked unhappy kate what aileth thee she asked pausing ere ere she mounted the last steps dost await here for man to pass nay mistressleastwiseo mistress amphillis i wis not what to do anentis what my maid nay id fain tell you butlackaday im all in a tumblement what manner of tumblement asked amphillis sitting down in the windowseat hast brake some pottery kate or torn somewhat that thou fearest thy dames anger nay ive brake nought saving my word and ive not done that yet it were evil to break thy word kate were it so kate looked up eagerly surely without thou hadst passed word to do somewhat thou shouldst not kates face fell she had thought she saw a way out of her difficulty and it was closing round her again its none so easy to tell what man shouldnt she said in a troubled tone what hast thou done kate nay ive done nought yet ive only passed word to do to do what before kate could answer agatha whisked into the corner thank goodness theyre all gone the whole lot of them wont we have some fun now kate run down stairs and bring me up a cork and i want a long white sheet and a mop now haste thee do for i would fain cause father jordan to skrike out at me and i have scarce time to get my work done ere the old drone shall come buzzing up this gait be sharp maid and ill do thee a good turn next time and agatha fairly pushed kate down the stairs allowing her neither excuse nor delaya piece of undignified conduct which would bitterly have scandalised lady foljambe could she have seen it by the time that kate returned with the articles prescribed agatha had possessed herself of a lighted candle wherein she burnt the end of the cork and with it proceeded to delineate in the middle of the sheet a very clever sketch of a ferocious turk with moustaches of stupendous length then elevating the long mop till it reached about a yard above her head she instructed kate to arrange the sheet thereon in such a manner that the turks face showed close to the top of the mop and gave the idea of a giant about eight feet in height now thenquick i hear the old bumblebee down alow yonder keep as still as mice and stir not nor laugh for your lives kate appeared to have quite forgotten her trouble and entered into agathas mischievous fun with all the thoughtless glee of a child agatha said amphillis my lady foljambe should be heavy angered if she wist thy dealing prithee work not thus if father jordan verily believed thou wert a ghost it were wellnigh enough to kill him poor sely old man and he hath ill deserved such treatment at thine hands in the present day we should never expect an adult clergyman to fall into so patent a trap but in the middle ages even learned men were credulous to an extent which we can scarcely imagine priests were in the habit of receiving friendly visits from pretended saints and meeting apparitions of socalled demons apparently without the faintest suspicion that the spirits in question might have bodies attached to them or that their imaginations might be at all responsible for the vision thank all the calendar shes away was agathas response thee hold thy peace and be not a spoilsport i mean to tell him im a soul in purgatory and none save a priest named jordan can deliver me and he only by licking of three crosses in the dust afore our ladys altar every morrow for a month that shall hurt none of him and it shall cause me die o laughter to see him do it back quick here cometh he i would fain hear the old snail skrike out at me avaunt sathanas as he surely will amphillis stepped back her quicker ear had recognised that the step beginning to ascend the stairs was not that of the old priest and she felt pretty sure whose it wasthat healthy sturdy plainspoken meg the cookmaid was the destined victim and was likely to be little injured while there was a good chance of agathas receiving her deserts just as meg reached the landing a low groan issued from the uncanny thing agatha of course could not see she only heard the steps which she still mistook for those of father jordan meg stood calmly gazing on the apparition will none deliver an unhappy soul in purgatory demanded a hollow moaning voice followed by awful groans such as amphillis had not supposed it possible for agatha to produce i rather reckon my saracen thourt a soul out o purgatory with a body tacked to thee said meg in the coolest manner help thee oh ay that i will and bring thee back to middle earth out o thy pains come then and meg laid hands on the white sheet and calmly began to pull it down oh stay meg thou shalt stifle me said the turk in agathas voice ay i thought youd somewhat to do wi t my damsel it were like you have you driven anybody else out o her seven senses beside me wi yon foolery youve kept in seventy senses pouted agatha releasing herself from the last corner of her ghostly drapery meg youre a spoilsport my dame shall con you but poor thanks mistress agatha if you travail folks o this fashion while she tarrieth hence mistress amphillis too marry i thought i tarried here to lessen the mischief said amphillis it wasnt thee i meant to fright said agatha with a pout i thought father jordan was acoming it was he i wanted never blame amphillis shes nigh as bad as thou mistress amphillis i ask your pardon mistress agatha youre a bad un tis a burning shame to harry a good old man like father jordan thee hie to thy bed and do no more mischief thou false hussy ill tell my dame of thy fine doings when she cometh home i will so now meg dear sweet meg dont and ill youll get you abed and bide quiet im neither dear nor sweet im a cookmaid and youre a young damsel with a fortin and youd neither sweet nor dear me without you were wanting somewhat of me forsooth theyll win a fortin that weds wi the like of you get abed thou magpie and meg was heard muttering to herself as she mounted the upper stairs to the attic chamber which she shared with joan and kate note understood the word understand was then restricted to an original idea conceive was used in the sense of understanding another person note the term middle earth arose from the belief then held that the earth was in the midst of the universe equidistant from heaven above it and from hell beneath chapter ten night alarms oh let me feel thee near me the world is very near i see the sights that dazzle the tempting sounds i hear my foes are ever near me around me and within but jesus draw thou nearer and save my soul from sin john e bode phyllis thou wilt lie in my ladys pallet tonight said perrote as she let her into their own chamber amphillis looked rather alarmed she had never yet been appointed to that responsible office but it was not her nature to protest against superior orders and she quietly gathered up such toilet articles as she required and prepared to obey you know your duty said perrote interrogatively you first help your lady abed and then hie abed yourself in the dark as silently and hastefully as may be there is no more to do without she call in the night till her lever for which you must be ready and have a care not to arouse her till she wake and summon you without the hour grow exceeding late when you may lawfully make some little bruit to wake her after a gentle fashion come now amphillis followed perrote into the countesss room they found her standing by the window as she often was at night for the sunset and the evening lights had a great attraction for her she turned her head as they entered at last perrote she said in good sooth but i began to think thou hadst forgot me like everybody else in earth and heaven my lady knows i shall never do that was the quiet reply dame my lady foljambe entreats of your ladyship leave that amphillis here shall lie in your pallet until she return doth she so answered the countess with a curt laugh my lady foljambe is vastly pleasant trow asking her caged birds leave to set another bird in the cage well little brown nightingale what sayest art feared lest the old eagle bite or canst trust the hooked beak for a week or twain dame an it please you i am in no wise feared of your grace well said not that thou shouldst make much difference had i a mind to fight for the door or the window i could soon be quit of such a whitefaced chit as thou ah me to what end that time is by for me well so they went off in grand array i saw them if godfrey foljambe buy his wife a new quirle and his daughterinlaw a new gown every time they cry for it he shall be at the end of his purse ere my cushion yonder be finished broidering lackaday i would one of you would make an end thereof i am aweary of the whole thing green and tawny and redred and tawny and green tentstitch down here and satinstitch up yonder and what good when done theres a cushioncover more in the world that is all would godah would god from the bottom of mine heart that there were but one weary woman less my dear lady said perrote sympathisingly ay old woman i know thou wouldst fain ask whither should i go i know little verily and care less only let me lie down and sleep for ever and forget everythingi ask but so much i think god might let me have that one has to wake ever here to another dreary day if man might but sleep and not wake orah if man could blot out thirty years and i sit once more in my mail on my feraunt at the gate of hennebon dreams dreams all empty dreams come child and lay by this wimple tis mans duty to hie him abed now lets do our duty tis all man has left to meleave to do as i am bidden what was that bruit i heard without an halfhour gone amphillis in answer for perrote was unable to speak told the story of agathas mischievous trick the countess laughed tis right the thing i should have done myself as a young maid said she ay i loved dearly to make lordly sober folks look foolish poor father jordan howbeit was scarce fit game for her crossbow if she had brought avena foljambe down id have given her a clap on the back now maid let us see how thou canst braid up this old white hair for the pillow it was jet black once and fell right to my feet i little thought theni little thought the coucher accomplished the countess lay down in her bed perrote took leave of her and put out the light admonishing amphillis to be quick then she left the room locking the door after her there said the voice of the countess through the darkness now then we are prisoners thou and i how doth it like thee it liketh me well dame if so i may serve your grace well said thou shalt be meet for the court ere long but child thou hast not borne years of it as i have sixteen years with a hope of release and eight with none tell me thy history i have no list to sleep and it shall pass the time if it may please your grace i reckon i have had none thou wert best thank the saints for that yet i count tis scarce thus didst grow like a mushroom truly no dame said amphillis with a little laugh but i fear it should ill repay your grace to hear that i fed chickens and milked cows and baked patties of divers sorts it should well repay me it were a change from blue silk and yellow twist and one endless view from the window fare forth thus bidden amphillis told her story as she lay in the pallet uninterrupted save now and then by a laugh or a word of comment it was not much of a story as she had said but she was glad if it amused the royal prisoner even for an hour good maid said her mistress when she saw that the tale was finished now sleep thou for i would not cut off a young maid from her rest i can sleep belike or lie awake as it please the saints all was silence after that for halfanhour amphillis had just dropped asleep when she was roused again by a low sound of what nature she knew not at first then she was suddenly conscious that the porters watchdog colle was keeping up a low uneasy growl beneath the window and that somebody was trying to hush him amphillis lay and listened wondering whether it were some further nonsense of agathas manufacture then came the sound of angry words and hurrying feet and a womans shrill scream what ado is there asked the countess draw back the curtain phyllis and see amphillis sprang up ran lightly with bare feet across the chamber and drew back the curtain the full harvest moon was shining into the inner court and she discerned eight black shadows all mixed together in what was evidently a struggle of some kind the only one distinguishable being that of colle who was as busy and excited as any of the group at length she saw one of the shadows get free from the others and speed rapidly to the wall pursued by the dog which however could not prevent his escape over the wall the other shadows had a further short scuffle at the end of which two seemed to be driven into the outer yard by the five and amphillis lost sight of them she told her mistress what she saw some drunken brawl amongst the retainers most like said the countess come back to thy bed maid tis no concern of thine amphillis obeyed and silence fell upon the house the next thing of which she was conscious was perrotes entrance in the morning what caused yon bruit in the night asked the countess as amphillis was dressing her hair dame said perrote it was an attack upon the house an attack the countess turned suddenly round drawing her hair out of her tirewomans hands after what fashion thieves robbers foes come tell me all about it i scantly know dame how far i may lightly tell said perrote uneasily it were better to await sir godfreys return ere much be said thereanentis the countess fixed her keen black eyes on her old attendant the which means said she that the matter has too much ado with me that i should be suffered to know the inwards thereof perrote was it that man essayed once more to free me thou mayest well tell me for i know it the angels whispered it to me as i lay in my bed my dear lady it was thus pray you be not troubled if so were should you be any better off than now mary mother with that wail of pain the countess turned back to her toilet who was it and how tell me what thou wist perrote considered a moment and then answered the questions your grace hath mind of the two pedlars that came hither a few days gone one of whom sold yon violet twist the illest stuff that ever threaded needle he had need be shamed of himself ay well dame he was no pedlar at all but sir roland de pencouet a knight of bretagne ha one of oliver clissons following or i err ay a look of intense interest had driven out the usual weary listlessness in the black eyes which had thus disguised him in order to essay the freeing of your grace i am at peace with him then for his caitiff twist knights make ill tradesmen i doubt not poor fool to think he could do any such thing what befell him with him dame were two otherivo filz jehan yon little breton jeweller that was used to trade at hennebon i know not if your grace have mind of him ay i remember him and also a priest named father eloy the priest won clean away over the wall only mark saith that colle hath a piece of his hose for a remembrance sir roland and ivo were taken and be lodged in the dungeon poor fools said the countess again o perrote perrote to be free dear my lady should it be better with you than now what wist thou to have the right to go right or left as man would to pluck the flowerets by the roadside at will to throw man upon the grass and breathe the free air to speak with whom man would to feel the heaving of the salt sea under mans boat and to hear the clash of arms and see the chargers and the swords and the nodding plumes file out of the posterno perrote perrote mine own dear mistress would i might compass it for you i know thou dost and thou canst not but wherefore doth not god compass it can he not do what he will be wrong and cruelty and injustice what he would doth he hate me that he leaveth me thus to live and die like a rat in a hole and wherefore what have i done i am no worser sinner than thousands of other men and women i never stole nor murdered nor sware falsely i was true woman to god and to my lord and true mother to the lad that they keep from me ay and true friend to lord edward the king that cares not a brass nail whether i live or dieonly that if i died he would be quit of a burden holy saints but i would full willingly quit him of it god when i ask thee for nought costlier than death canst thou not grant it to me she looked like an inspired prophetess that tall whitehaired woman lifting her face up to the morning sun as if addressing through it the eternal light and challenging the love and wisdom of his decrees amphillis shrank back from her perrote came a little nearer god is wiser than his creatures she said words words perrote only words and i have heard them all aforetime and many a time oer if i could but come at him id see if he could not tell me somewhat better ay said perrote with a sigh if we could all but come at him dear my lady cross thyself old woman and have done when i lack an homily preacher ill send for a priest my wimple phyllis when comes sir godfrey back saturday shall be a week dame sir godfrey came back in a bad temper he had been overcome at the tournament which in itself was not pacifying and he was extremely angry to hear of the unsuccessful attempt to set his prisoner free he scolded everybody impartially all round but especially matthew and father jordan the latter of whom was very little to blame since he was not only rather deaf but he slept on the other side of the house and had never heard the noise at all matthew growled that if he had calmly marched the conspirators up to the prisoners chamber and delivered her to them his father could scarcely have treated him worse whereas he had safely secured two out of the three and the prisoner had never been in any danger kate had been captured as well as the conspirators and instead of receiving the promised crespine she was bitterly rueing her folly locked in a small turret room whose only furniture was a bundle of straw and a rug with the pleasing prospect of worse usage when her mistress should return the morning after their arrival at home lady foljambe marched up to the turret armed with a formidable cane wherewith she inflicted on poor kate a sound discipline pleading sobs and even screams fell on her ears with as little impression as would have been caused by the buzzing of a fly having finished her proceeding she administered to the suffering culprit a short sharp lecture and then locked her up again to think it over with bread and water as the only relief to meditation the king was expected to come north after parliament rosesomewhere about the following february and sir godfrey wrathfully averred that he should deal with the conspirators himself the length of time that a prisoner was kept awaiting trial was a matter of supremely little consequence in the middle ages his majesty reached derby on his way to york in the early days of march and slept for one night at hazelwood manor disposing of the prisoners the next morning before he resumed his journey nobody at hazelwood wished to live that week over again the king brought a suite of fourteen gentlemen beside his guard and they all had to be lodged somehow perrote amphillis lady foljambe and mrs margaret slept in the countesss chamber the more the merrier said the prisoner sarcastically prithee avena see that the king quit not this house without he hath a word with me i have a truth or twain to tell him but the king declined the interview perhaps it was on account of an uneasy suspicion concerning that truth or twain which might be told him for fifty years edward the third swayed the sceptre of england and his rule upon the whole was just and gentle two sore sins lie at his doorthe murder of his brother in a sudden outburst of most righteous indignation and the long dreary captivity of the prisoner of tickhill and hazelwood who had done nothing to deserve it considering what a mother he had perhaps the cause for wonder is that in the main he did so well rather than that on some occasions he acted very wrongly the frequent wars of this king were all foreign ones and under his government england was at rest that long quiet reign was now drawing near its close the king had not yet sunk into the sad state of senile dementia wherein he ended his life but he was an infirm tired old man bereft of his other self his bright and loving wife who had left him and the world about four years earlier he exerted himself a little at supper to make himself agreeable to the ladies as was then held to be the bounden duty of a good knight but after supper he enjoyed a peaceful slumber with a handkerchief over his face to keep away the flies the two prisoners were speedily disposed of by being sent in chains to the duke of bretagne to be dealt with as he should think fit the king seemed rather amused than angered by kates share in the matter he had the terrified girl up before him talked to her in a fatherly fashion and ended by giving her a crownpiece with his own hand and bidding her in the future be a good and loyal maid and not suffer herself to be beguiled by the wiles of evil men poor kate sobbed promised and louted confusedly and in due course of time when king edward had been long in his grave and kate was a staid grandmother the crownpiece held the place of honour on her sons chest of drawers as a prized family heirloom the next event of any note a few weeks afterwards was marabels marriage in those days young girls of good family instead of being sent to school were placed with some married lady as bowerwomen or chamberers to be first educated and then married the mistress was expected to make the one her care as much as the other and it was not considered any concern of the girls except to obey the husband was provided by the mistress along with the weddingdress and the weddingdinner and the bride meekly accepted all three with becoming thankfulnessor at least was expected to do so the new chamberer who came in marabels place was named ricarda the girls were told this one evening at suppertime and informed that she would arrive on the morrow her place at table was next below amphillis who was greatly astonished to be asked as she sat down to supper well phyllis what hast thou to say to me amphillis turned and gazed at the speaker well repeated the latter thou hast seen me before ricarda how ever chanceth it the astonishment of amphillis was intense the rules of etiquette at that time were chains indeed and the daughter of a tradesman was not in a position to be bowerwoman to a lady of title how had her cousin come there what sayest then asked ricarda with a triumphant smile to know that my lady foljambe sent to covenant with me by reason that she was so full fain of thee that she desired another of thy kin is it soothly thus replied amphillis her surprise scarcely lessened by hearing of such unusual conduct on the part of the precise lady foljambe verily butand how do my good master mine uncle and my good cousin alexandra saundrinas wed and so is my father and saundrina leads clement a life and mistress altham leads my father another i was none so sorry to come away i can tell thee i hate to be ruled like a ledger and notched like a tally thou shalt find things be well ruled in this house rica said amphillis thinking to herself that ricarda and agatha would make a pair and might give their mistress some trouble but whom hath mine uncle wed that is thus unbuxom disobedient to him why mistress regina the goldsmiths daughter that counts herself worth us all and would fain be a queen in the pattyshop and cut us all out according to her will but ricarda i reckoned mistress regina a full good and wise woman good and wise she may soon be so i hate goodness and wisdom theres never a bit of jollity for her tis all thou shalt not she might as well be the ten commandments and done with it wouldst thou fain not keep the ten commandments rica id fain have my own way and be jolly oh she keeps the house well enough father saith hes tenfold more comfortable sithence her coming i thought thou saidst she led him an ill diseaseful note life well so did i father didnt oh said amphillis in an enlightened tone and shes a rare hand at the cooking that will i say she might have made patties all her life she catches up everything afore you can say jack robinson she says its by reason shes a dutchwoman note rubbish as if a lot of nasty foreigners could do aught better or half as well as english folks be all foreigners nasty asked amphillis thinking of her mistress of course they be phyllis whats come oer thee i knew not anything had lackaday thou art tenfold as covenable and deliver note as thou wert wont to be derbyshire hath brightened up thy wits amphillis smiled privately she thought that if her wits were brightened it was mainly by being let alone and allowed to develop free of perpetual repression i have done nought to bring the same about ricarda but must i conceive that master winkfields diseaseful life then is in thine eyes or in his own he reckons himself the blissfullest man under the sun said ricarda as they rose from the table and he dare not say his soul is his own not for no price man should pay him amphillis privately thought the bliss of a curious kind phyllis said her cousin suddenly hast learned to hold thy tongue i count i am metely well learned therein rica well mind thou not for nothing of no sort to let on to my lady that father is a pattymaker i were put forth of the door with no more ado should it come to her ear that i am not of gentle blood like thee ricarda is my lady then deceived thereon shsh she thinks i am a neville and thy cousin of the fathers side thee hold thy peace and all shall be well but rica that were to tell a lie never a bit of it man cant tell a lie by holding his peace nay i am not so sure thereof as i would like this i know he may speak one by his life no lesser than his words amphillis if thou blurt out this to my lady ill hate thee for ever and ever amen said ricarda i must meditate thereon was her cousins answer soothly i would not by my good will do thee an ill turn rica and if it may stand with my conscience to be silent thou hast nought to fear yet if my lady ask me aught touching thee that may not be thus answered i must speak truth and no lie a murrain take thy conscience canst not say a twothree times the rosary of our lady to ease it maybe said amphillis drily our lady hath no more lore for lying than i have mistress ricarda said agatha joining them as they rose from the table i do right heartily pray you of better acquaintance i trust you and i be of the same fashion of thinking and both love laughter better than tears in good sooth i hate long faces and sad looks said ricarda accepting agathas offered kiss of friendship you be not an illmatched pair added amphillis laughing only i pray you upset not the quirle by over much prancing note still used in its original sense of uncomfortable note the dutch were then known as high dutch the germans as low dutch note agreeable and ready in conversation chapter eleven beaten back i know not why my path should be at times so straitly hedged so strangely barred before i only know god could keep wide the door but i can trust mistress perrote i pray you counsel me i am sore put to it to baffle my cousins inquirations touching our lady how she cometh to know there is any such cannot i say but i may lightly guess that agatha hath let it scape and in old days mine uncle was wont to say none never could keep hidlis secrets from ricarda truly might i have known aforehand my lady foljambes pleasure i could have found to mine hand to pray her not to advance ricarda hither not for that i would stand in her way but for my ladys sake herself i know nay as well not phyllis it should tend rather to thine own disease for folk might lightly say thou wert jealous and unkindly to thy kin the lord knoweth wherefore such things do hap at times i think it be to prevent us from being here in earth more blissful than it were good for us to be as for her inquirations parry them as best thou mayest and if thou canst not then say apertly openly that thou art forbidden to hold discourse thereanentis amphillis shook her head she pretty well knew that such an assertion would whet ricardas curiosity and increase her inquisitive queries mistress perrote are you ill at ease not in health thank god but i am heavy of heart child our lady is in evil case and she is very old we should not now call a woman very old who was barely sixty years of age we scarcely think that more than elderly but in when the numerous wars and insurrections of the earlier half of the century had almost decimated the population so that especially in the upper classes an old man was rarely to be seen and when also human life was usually shorter than in later times sixty was the equivalent of eighty or ninety with us while seventy was as wonderful as we think a hundred king edward was in his second childhood when he died at sixtyfive while old john of gaunt timehonoured lancaster scarcely passed his fiftyninth birthday is she sick said amphillis pityingly she had not seen her mistress for several days for her periods of attendance on her were fitful and uncertain she is very sick and father jordan hath tried his best the household doctor at that time for a country house was either the mistress of the family or the confessor there were few medical men who were not also priests and they only lived in chief cities ladies were taught physic and surgery and often doctored a whole neighbourhood in a town the druggist was usually consulted by the poor if they consulted any one at all who had learned medicine but the physicians most in favour were white witches namely old women who dealt in herbs and charms the former of which were real remedies and the latter heathenish nonsense a great deal of superstition mixed with the practice of the best medical men of the day herbs must be gathered when the moon was at the full or when mercury was in the ascendant patients who had the smallpox must be wrapped in scarlet the bloodstone preserved its wearer from particular maladies a hair from a saints beard taken in water was deemed an invaluable specific they bled to restore strength administered plasters of verdigris and made their patients wait for a lucky day to begin a course of treatment he hath given her pursued perrote sorrowfully myrrh and milelot and tutio oxide of zinc and hath tried plasters of diachylon litharge and ceruse but to no good purpose he speaketh now of antimony and orchis but i feari fear he can give nothing to do any good when our lord saith die not all the help nor love in the world shall make man live and i think her time is come o mistress perrote must she die without deliverance without earthly deliverance it is like my maid be it so but ah me what if she die without the heavenly deliverance she will not list me she never would if man would come by that she would list and might be suffered so to do i would thank god to the end of my days anentis what should she list good mistress phyllis she hath never yet made acquaintance with christ our lord he is to her but a dead name set to the end of her prayersan image nailed to a crossa man whom she has heard tell of but never saw the living loving lord who died and rose for herwho is ready at this hour to be her best friend and dearest comforterwho is holding forth his hands to her as to all of us and entreating her to come to him and be savedshe looketh on him as she doth on constantine the great as man that was good and powerful once but long ago and tis all over and done with i would fain have her hear man speak of him that knoweth him father jordan mistress no father jordan knows about him he knoweth him notat the least not so well as i want ay i count he doth know him after a fashion but tis a poor fashion i want a better man than he and i want leave for him to come at her and me feareth very sore that i shall win neither shall we ask our lord for it said amphillis shyly so do dear maid thy faith shameth mine unbelief what shall i say mistress say lord send hither man that knoweth thee and incline the hearts of them in authority to suffer him to come at our lady i will speak yet again with sir godfrey but i might wellnigh as good speak to the doorpost he is as hard and he knows as little and her time is very near there were tears in perrotes eyes as she went away and amphillis entirely sympathised with her she was coming to realise the paramount importance to every human soul of that personal acquaintance with jesus christ which is the one matter of consequence to all who have felt the power of an endless life the natural result of this was that lesser matters fell into their right place without any difficulty there was no troubling may i do this or how far is it allowable to enjoy that if this were contrary to the mind of god or if that grated on the spiritual taste it simply could not be done any more than something could be done which would grieve a beloved human friend or could be eaten with relish if it were illflavoured and disgusting but suppose the relish does remain then either the conscience is illinformed and scrupulous requiring enlightenment by the word of god and the heart setting at liberty or elseand more frequentlythe acquaintance is not close enough and the new affection not sufficiently deep to have expulsive power over the old in either case the remedy is to come nearer to the great physician to drink deeper draughts of the water of life to warm the numbed soul in the pure rays of the sun of righteousness if any man thirst let him come unto me and drinknot stay away hewing out for himself broken cisterns which can hold no water how many will not come to christ for rest until they have first tried in vain to rest their heads upon every hard stone and every thorny plant that the world has to offer for the world can give no restonly varieties of weariness are in its power to offer those who do not bring fresh hearts and eager eyes as yet unwearied and unfilled for those who do it has gay music and sparkling sweet wine and gleaming gems of many a lovely hue and they listen and drink and admire and think there is no bliss beyond it but when the eager eyes grow dim and the ears are dulled and the taste has departed the tired heart demands rest and the world has none for it a wornout worldling whom the world has ceased to charm is one of the most pitiable creatures alive sir godfrey foljambe had not arrived at that point he was in a condition less unhappy but quite as perilous to him the world had offered a fresh apple of sodom and he had grasped it as eagerly as the first the prodigal son was in a better condition when he grew weary of the strange country than while he was spending his substance on riotous living sir godfrey had laid aside the riotous living but he was not weary of the strange country on the contrary when he ran short of food he tried the swines husks and found them very palatable decidedly preferable to going home he put bitter for sweet and sweet for bitter the liberty wherewith christ would have made him free was considered as a yoke of bondage while the strong chains in which satan held him were perfect freedom in his estimation it was not with any hope that he would either understand or grant her request that perrote made a last application to her ladys gaoler it was only because she felt the matter of such supreme importance the time so short and the necessity so imperative that no fault of hers should be a hindrance perhaps too down in those dim recesses of the human heart which lie so open to god but scarcely read by man himself there was a mustardseed of faitha faint who can tell which did not rise to hopeand certainly a love ready to endure all if it might gain its blessed end sir said perrote i entreat a moments speech of you sir godfrey who was sauntering under the trees in the garden stopped and looked at her had he spoken out his thoughts he would have said what on earth does this bothering old woman want as it was he stood silent and waited for her to proceed sir my lady is full sick well let father jordan see her he hath seen her sir and full little can he do what would you no outer physician can be called in ah sir forgive me but i am thinking rather of the soul than the body it is the worser of the twain verily i guess not how for she should be hard put to it to commit mortal sin when mewed for eight years in one chamber howbeit if so be what then is not father jordan a priest one priest is full as good as another once more forgive me sir for the need that i behold one priest is not as good as another it is not a mass that my lady needeth to be sung it is counsel that she lacketh then let father jordan counsel her sir he cannot cannot what for trow hath he lost his wits or his tongue no he hath lost nothing for that which he lacketh i count he never had or so little thereof that it serveth not in this case man cannot sound a fathom with an inchline sir whether you conceive me or not whether you allow me or no i do most earnestly entreat you to suffer that my lady may speak with one of the poor priests that go about in frieze coats bound with leather girdles they have whereof to minister to her need sir godfrey thought contemptuously that there was no end to the fads and fancies of old women his first idea of a reply was to say decidedly that it was not possible to trust any outsider with the cherished secret of the countesss hidingplace his next that the poor priests were in tolerably high favour with the great that the king had commanded the prisoner to be well treated that the priest might be sworn to secrecy and that if the countess were really near her end little mischief would be done possibly in his inner soul too a power was at work which he was not capable of recognising humph was all he said but perrote saw that she had made an impression and she was too wise to weaken it by adding words sir godfrey with his hands in the pockets of his hautdechausses took a turn under the trees and came back to the suppliant where be they to be found sir there is wellnigh certain to be one or more at derby if it pleased you to send to the prior of saint mary there or to your own abbey of darley there were very like to be one tarrying on his way or might soon come thither and if under your good leave the holy father would cause him to swear secrecy touching all he might see or hear no mischief should be like to hap by his coming humph said sir godfrey again ill meditate thereon sir i give you right hearty thanks was the grateful answer of perrote who had taken more by her motion than she expected as she passed from the inner court to the outer on her way to the hall where supper would shortly be served she heard a little noise and bustle of some sort at the gate perrote stopped to look before the gate on a richlycaparisoned mule sat the abbot of darley with four of his monks also mounted on those ecclesiastical animals the porter his keys in his hand was bowing low in reverential awe for an abbot was only a step below a bishop and both were deemed holy and spiritual men unquestionably there were men among them who were both spiritual and holy but they were considerably fewer than the general populace believed the majority belonged to one of four typesthe dryasdust scholar the austere ascetic the proud tyrant or the jovial ton vivant the firstclass which was the best was not a large one the other three were much more numerous the present abbot of darley was a mixture of the two lastnamed and could put on either at will the man being jovial by nature and the abbot haughty by training he had now come to spend a night at hazelwood on his way from darley to leicester for the foljambes were lords of darley manor and many of them had been benefactors to the abbey in their time it was desirable for many reasons that sir godfrey and the abbot should keep on friendly terms perrote stepped back to tell the knight who stood at his gate and he at once hastened forward with a cordial welcome the abbot blessed sir godfrey by the extension of two priestly fingers in a style which must require considerable practice and in tones which savoured somewhat more of pride than humility informed him that he came to beg a lodging for himself and his monks for one night sir godfrey knew he said that poor monks who abjured the vanities of the world were not accustomed to grandeur a little straw and some coarse rugs were all they asked had the abbot been taken at his word he would have been much astonished but he well knew that the best bedchambers in the manor house would be thought honoured by his use of them his reverence alighted from his mule and followed by the four monks was led into the hall his bareheaded and obsequious host preceding them the ladies who were assembling for supper dropped on their knees at the sight and also received a priestly blessing the abbot was conducted to the seat of honour on sir godfreys right hand the servers now brought in supper it was a vigil and therefore meat eggs and butter were forbidden but luxury apart from these being unforbidden to such as preferred the letter to the spirit the meal was sufficiently appetising notwithstanding this beside some fishes whose names are inscrutable our ancestors at this time ate nearly all we habitually use and in addition whelks porpoises and lampreys there were soups made of apples figs beans peas gourds rice and wheat fish pies and fruit pies jellies honey cakes and tarts biscuits of all descriptions including maccaroons and gingerbread vegetables far more numerous than we use salads cucumbers melons and all fruits in season puddings of semolina millet and rice almonds spices pickleswent to make up a menu by no means despicable supper was half over when sir godfrey bethought himself of perrotes appeal and suggestion pray you holy father said he have you in your abbey at this season any of them called the poor priests or know you where they may be found the abbots lips took such a setting as rather alarmed his host who began to wish his question unasked i pray you of pardon if i ask unwisely he hastily added i had thought these men were somewhat in good favour in high place at this time and though i desire not at all to wheresoever is my lady princess there shall the poor priests find favour said the abbot with a slight shrug of his shoulders the king too is not illaffected toward them but i forewarn you my son that they be not over well liked of the church and the dignitaries thereof they go about setting men by the ears bringing down to the minds of the commoner sort high matters that are not meet for such to handle and inciting them to chatter and gabble over holy things in unseemly wise whereso they preach tis said the very women will leave their distaffs and begin to talk of sacred mattermost unbecoming and scandalous it is i avise you my son to have none ado with such and to keep to the wholesome direction of your own priest which shall be far more to your profit i cry you mercy reverend father truly it was not of mine own motion that i asked the same twas a woman did excite me thereto seeing that may i well believe said the abbot contemptuously women be ever at the bottom of every ill thing under the sun poor man he knew nothing about them how could he when he was taught that they were unclean creatures with whom it was defilement to converse and he could not remember his motherthe one womanly memory which might have saved him from the delusion sir godfrey in his earnest anxiety to get out of the scrape into which perrote had brought him hastily introduced a fresh topic as the easiest means of doing so trust me holy father i will suffer nought harmful to enter my doors nor any man disapproved by your lordship is there news abroad may man wit ay we had last night an holy palmer in our abbey responded the abbot with a calmer brow he left us this morrow on his way to jesmond you wist doubtless that my lord of york is departed no verilymy lord of york is yet any successor appointed ay so tis saidfather neville as men say amphillis looked up with some interest on hearing her own name who is he this father neville soothly who is he repeated the abbot with evident irritation brother to my lord neville of raby but what hath he done trow to be advanced thus without merit unto the second mitre in the realm some meaner bishop or worthy abbot should have been far fitter for the preferment the worthy abbot of darley in especial whispered agatha in the ear of amphillis what manner of man is he holy father by your leave one of these new sectaries replied the abbot irascibly a man that favours the poor priests of whom you spake and swears by the rector of ludgarshall this wycliffe that maketh all this bruit prithee who is the rector of ludgarshall that we must all be at his beck and ordering was there no truth in the whole church catholic these thirteen hundred years that this dan john must claim for to have discovered it anew pshaw tis folly and what other tidings be there pray you holy father scarce aught beside of note i think answered the abbot meditativelywithout it be the news from brittany of latetis said all brittany is in revolt and the king of france aiding the same and the duke is fled over hither to king edward leaving my lady duchess shut up in the castle of auray which tis thought the french king shall besiege man reckons he comes for littlei would say that our king shall give him little ado over that matter without it were to ransom my lady should she be taken she being stepdaughter unto my lord prince the lord king then showeth him no great favour favour enough to his particular to himself personally but you will quickly judge there is little likelihood of a new army fitted out for brittany when you hear that his grace writ to my lord archbishop of canterbury that he should in no wise submit to the tax laid on the clergy by my lord cardinal of cluny that came oer touching those affairs and charged the expenses of his journey on the clergy of england the king gave promise to stand by them in case they should resist and bade them take no heed of the censure of the said nuncio seeing the people of england were not concerned touching matters of brittany and where the cause quoth he is so unjust the curse must needs fall harmless brave words in good sooth said young godfrey ay our lord the king is not he that shall suffer man to ride roughshod over him added his father the which is full well in case of laymen said the abbot a little severely yet it becometh even princes to be buxom and reverent to the church and unto all spiritual men if it might please you holy father would you do so much grace as tell me where is my lord duke at this present it was perrote who asked the question and with evident uneasiness the abbot glanced at her and then answered carelessly she was only one of the household as he saw what did her anxiety matter to my lord abbot of darley by my lady saint mary that wis i little said he at windsor maybe or woodstockwith the king the palmer told us the king was at woodstock remarked one of the hitherto silent monks the abbot annihilated him by a glance verily an he were remarked sir godfrey it should tell but little by now when he may as like as not be at winchester or norwich our plantagenet sovereigns were perpetual travellers up and down the kingdom rarely staying even a fortnight in one place though occasionally they were stationary for some weeks but the old and infirm king who now occupied the throne had moved about less than usual of late years perrote was silent but her face took a resolute expression which sir godfrey had learned to his annoyance when the bothering old woman looked like that she generally bothered him before he was much older and sir godfrey like many others of his species detested being bothered he soon found that fate remembered him as he was going up to bed that night he found perrote waiting for him on the landing sir pray you a word said she sir godfrey stood sulkily still if my lord duke be now in england should he not know that his mother is near her end how am i to send to him trow growled the custodian i wis not where he is a messenger could find out the court sir answered perrote and it would comfort her last days if he came and if he refused perrotes dark eyes flashed fire then may god have mercy on himif he have any mercy for such a heartless wretch as he should so be keep a civil tongue in your head perrote de carhaix said sir godfrey beginning to ascend the upper stair you see your poor priests are no good youd better be quiet perrote stood still candle in hand till he disappeared i will be silent towards man she said in a low voice but i will pour out mine heart as water before the face of the lord the road toward heaven is alway open and they whom men beat back and tread down are the most like to win ear of him make no tarrying o my god chapter twelve wherein sundry people act foolishly why for the dead who are at rest pray for the living in whose breast the struggle between right and wrong is raging terrible and strong longfellow amphillis neville was a most unsuspicious person it never occurred to her to expect any one to do what in his place she would not have done and all that she would have done was so simple and straightforward that scheming of every sort was an impossible idea until suggested by some one else she was consequently much surprised when perrote said one evening phyllis i could find in mine heart to wish thy cousin had tarried hence the discovery of ricardas deception was the only solution of this remark which presented itself to amphillis but her natural caution stood her in good stead and she merely inquired her companions meaning hast not seen that she laboureth to catch master hylton into her net thoughts which were not all pleasant chased one another through the mind of amphillis if ricarda were trying to win norman hylton would she be so base as to leave him under the delusion that she was a neville possibly of the noble stock of the lords of raby mr hyltons friends if not himself would regard with unutterable scorn the idea of marriage with a confectioners daughter he would be held to have demeaned himself to the verge of social extinction and somehow somewhere and for some reasonamphillis pushed the question no further than thisthe thought of assisting by her silence in the ruin of norman hylton seemed much harder to bear than the prospect of being hated by ricarda altham even though it were for ever and ever when these meditations had burned within her for a few seconds amphillis spoke mistress perrote wit you how my cousin came hither why by reason my lady foljambe sent to thine uncle to ask at him if thou hadst any kin of the fathers side young maids of good birth and breeding and of discreet conditions that he should be willing to put forth hither with thee amphillis felt as if her mind were in a whirl surely it was not possible that mr altham had known far less shared the dishonesty of his daughter she could not have believed her uncle capable of such meanness sent to mine uncle seemed all that she could utter ay but thine uncle as i heard say was away when the messenger came and he saw certain women of his house only oh then my uncle was not in the plot said amphillis to herself with great satisfaction maybe i speak wrongly added perrote reflectively i guess he saw but one woman a wedded cousin of thine one mistress winkfield who said she wist of a kinswoman of thine on the fathers side that she was secure her father would gladly prefer and she would have her up from hertfordshire to see him if he would call again that day week how the conspiracy had been managed flashed on amphillis at once mr altham was always from home on a wednesday when he attended a meeting of his professional guild in the city that wicked alexandra had done the whole business and presented her own sister to the messenger as the cousin of amphillis on that side of her parentage which came of gentle blood mistress i pray you tell me if man know of wrong done or lying and utter it not hath he then part in the wrong very like dear heart is there here some wrongdoing i nigh guessed so much from thy ways speak out phyllis soothly mistress i would not by my good will do my kinswoman an ill turn yet either must i do so or else hold my peace at wrong done to my lady foljambe and peradventure to master hylton my cousin ricarda is not of my fathers kin she is daughter unto mine uncle the pattymaker in the strand i know of no kin on my fathers side holy mary cried the scandalised perrote has thine uncle then had part in this wicked work i cry you mercy mistress but i humbly guess not so mine uncle as i have known him hath been alway an honest and honourable man that should think shame to do a mean deed that he had holpen my cousins thus to act could i not believe without it were proven then thy cousin mistress winkfield alexandra i said not so much of her phyllis my lady foljambe must know this i am afeard mistress she must mistress i must in mine honesty confess to you that these few days i have wist my cousin had called her by the name of neville but in good sooth i wist not if i ought to speak or no till your word this even seemed to show me that i must my cousins have been somewhat unfriends to me and i held me back lest i should be reckoned to revenge myself perrote took in the situation at a glance poor child she said it is well thou hast spoken i dare guess thou sawest not that mischief might come thereof in good sooth mistress that did i not until this even i never thought of no such a thing verily i can scarce marvel for such a thing was hardly heard of afore to deceive a noble lady to present herself as of gentle blood when she came but of a trading stock tis horrible i can scarce think of worser deed without she had striven to deceive the priest himself in confession the act of ricarda altham was far more shocking in the eyes of a lady in the fourteenth century than in the nineteenth the falsehood she had told was the same in both cases or rather it would weigh more heavily now than then but the nature of the deceptionthat what they would have termed a beggarly tradesmans brat should by deceiving a lady of family have forced herself on terms of comparative equality into the society of ladieswas horrible in the extreme to their eclectic souls tradesmen in those days were barely supposed by the upper classes to have either morals or manners except an awe of superior people which was expected to act as a wholesome barrier against cheating their aristocratic customers in point of fact the aristocratic customers were cheated much oftener than they supposed on the one side and some of the beggarly tradesfolk were men of much higher intellect and principle than they imagined on the other brains were held to be a prerogative of gentle blood extra intelligence in the lower classes being almost an impertinence the only exception to this rule lay with the church she was allowed to develop a brain in whom she would the sacredness of her tonsure protected the man who wore it permitting him to exhibit as much or as little of manners intellect and morals as he might think proper perrotes undressing on that evening was attended with numerous shakes of the head and sudden ejaculations of mingled astonishment and horror and that agatha was one of the ejaculations amphillis looked for enlightenment why she is full hand in glove with ricarda the one can do nought that the other knows not of i dare be bound she is helping her to draw poor master norman into her netfor agatha will have none of him shes after master matthew lackaday i never thought nobody was after anybody said innocent amphillis keep thy seliness simplicity child said perrote smiling on her nor in truth should i say poor master norman for i think he is little like to be tangled either in ricardas web or agathas meshes if i know him his eyes be in another quarterwherein i would say he should have better content ah me the folly of men and women belike i leave not them out they be oft the more foolish of the twain the good god assoil forgive us all alack my poor lady it doth seem as if the lord shut all doors in my face i thought i was about to win sir godfrey overand hard work it had beenand then cometh this abbot of darley and slams the door afore i may go through well the lord can open others an he will he openeth and none shutteth he shutteth and none openeth and blessed be his holy name he is easilier come at a deal than men if i must tarry it is to tarry his leisure and he knows both the hearts of men and the coming future and he is secure not to be too late he loves our poor lady better than i love her and i love her wellnigh as mine own soul lord help me to wait thy time and help mine unbelief the ordeal of telling lady foljambe had to be gone through the next morning she was even more angry than perrote had anticipated and much more than amphillis expected ricarda was a goodfornought a hussy a wicked wretch and a near relative of satan while amphillis was only a shade lighter in the blackness of her guilt in vain poor amphillis pleaded that she had never guessed lady foljambes intention of sending for her cousin and had never heard of it until she saw her then said lady foljambe unreasonable in her anger she ought to have guessed it but it was all nonsense of course she knew and had plotted it all with her cousins nay dame said perrote i myself heard you to say the even afore ricarda came that it should give phyllis a surprise to see her if anything could have made lady foljambe more angry than she was it was having it shown to her that she was in the wrong she now turned her artillery upon perrote whom she scolded in the intervals of heaping unsavoury epithets upon amphillis and ricarda until amphillis thought that everything poor perrote had ever done in her life to lady foljambes annoyance rightly or wrongly must have been dragged out of an inexhaustible memory to lay before her at last it came to an end ricarda was dismissed in dire disgrace all that lady foljambe would grant her was her expenses home and the escort of one mounted servant to take her there even this was given only at the earnest pleading of perrote and amphillis who knew as indeed did lady foljambe herself that to turn a girl out of doors in this summary manner was to expose her to frightful dangers in the fourteenth century poor ricarda was quite broken down and so far forgot her threats as to come to amphillis for help and comfort amphillis gave her every farthing in her purse and desired the servant who was to act as escort to convey a conciliatory message to her uncle begging forgiveness for ricarda for her sake she sent also an affectionate and respectful message to her new aunt entreating her to intercede with her husband for his daughter indeed rica i would not have told if i could have helped it and bidden true to my trust was the farewell of amphillis o phyllis i wish id been as true as you and then i should never have fallen in this trouble sobbed the humbled ricarda i shouldnt have thought of it but for saundrina but there ive been bad enough ill not lay blame to other folks god be wi thee if i may take gods name into my lips but peradventure hell be as angry as my lady i suppose he is alway angered at sin said amphillis but rica the worst sinner that ever lived may take gods name into his lips to say god forgive me and we must all alike say that and mistress perrote saith if we hide our stained souls behind the white robes of our lord christ god the father is never angered with him all that anger was spent every drop of it upon the cross on calvary so there is none left now never a whit for any sinner that taketh refuge in him yea it was spent on him for this cause that all souls taking shelter under his wing unto all time might find there only love and rest and peace o phyllis thourt a good maid i would i were half as good as thou if i am good at all dear rica jesu christ hath done it and he will do it for thee for the asking so the cousins parted in more peace than either of them would once have thought possible for some hours amphillis was in serious doubt whether she would not share the fate of her cousin perrote pleaded for her it seemed in vain even mrs margaret added her gentle entreaties and was sharply bidden to hold her tongue but when on the afternoon of that eventful day amphillis went as was now usual to mount guard in the countesss chamber she was desired in that ladys customary manner bid avena foljambe come and speak with me amphillis hesitated an instant and her mistress saw it well hast an access a fit of the gout that thou canst not walk dame i cry your grace mercy i am at this present ill in favour of my lady foljambe and i scarce know if she will come for my asking the countess laughed the curt bitter laugh which amphillis had so often heard from her lips tell her she may please herself she said but that if she be not here ere the hour ill come to her i am not yet so sick that i cannot crawl to the further end of the house shell not tarry to hear that twice or i err amphillis locked the door behind her as she was strictly ordered to do whenever she left that room unless perrote were there and finding lady foljambe in her private boudoir tremblingly delivered the more civil half of her message lady foljambe paid no heed to her dame said poor amphillis i pray you of mercy if i do ill but her grace bade me say also that if you came not to her afore the clock should point the hour then would she seek you lady foljambe allowed a word to escape her which could only be termed a mild form of swearinga sin to which women no less than men and of all classes were fearfully addicted in the middle agesand without another look at amphillis stalked upstairs and let herself with her own key into the countesss chamber the countess sat in her large chair of carved walnut made easy by being lined with large soft cushions there were no easy chairs of any other kind she was in her favourite place near the window well avena good morrow didst have half my message or the whole i am here dame to take your graces orders i see it wanted the whole to take my graces orders soothly thou art pleasant well take them then my grace would like a couch prepared on yonder lawn and were i but well enough a ride on horseback but i misdoubt rides be over for me go to what is this i hear touching the child amphillisas though thou wentest about to be rid of her dame i have thought thereupon what for now avena i will know thou dost but lose thy pains to fence with me in answer lady foljambe told the story with a good deal of angry comment the countess was much amused a fact which did not help to calm the narrator ha jolife said she but i would fain have been in thy bower when the matter came forth howbeit i lack further expounding thereanentis whereof is phyllis guilty lady foljambe whose wrath was not up at the white heat which it had touched in the morning found this question a little difficult to answer she could not reasonably find fault with amphillis for being ricardas cousin and this was the real cause of her annoyance the only blame that could be laid to her was her silence for a few days as to the little she knew of this crime lady foljambe made the most now avena said the countess as peremptorily as her languor permitted hearken me and be no more of a fool than thou canst help if thou turn away a quiet steady decent maid of good birth and conditions for no more than a little lack of courage or maybe of judgmentand thou art not a shesolomon thyself as i give thee to wit but thou art a fearsome thing to a young maid when thou art angered and unjust anger is alway harder and sharper and fierier than the just as if it borrowed a bit of satan from whom it comethi say if thou turn her away for this thou shalt richly deserve what thou wilt very like get in exchangeto wit a giddypate that shall blurt forth all thy privy matter and i am a privy matter as thou well wist or one of some other ill conditions that shall cost thee an heartbreak to rule now beware and be wise and if it need more then mind thouand the tone grew regalthat amphillis neville is my servant not thine and that i choose not she be removed from me i love the maid she hath sense and she is true to trust and though that keeps me in prison yet can i esteem it when known tis a rare gift now go and think on what i have said to thee lady foljambe found herself reluctantly constrained to do the countesss bidding so far at least as the meditation was concerned and the calmer she grew the more clearly she saw that the countess was right she did not however show that she felt she had been in the wrong amphillis was not informed that she was forgiven nor that she was to retain her place but matters were allowed to slide silently back into their old groove so the winter came slowly on the time drew near the birth of christ that season of peace and goodwill to men which casts its soft sunshine even over the world bringing absent relatives together and suggesting general family amnesties perrote determined to make one more effort with sir godfrey about the middle of december as that gentleman was mounting his staircase he saw on the landing that bothering old woman standing lamp in hand evidently meaning to waylay some one who was going up to bed sir godfrey had little doubt that he was the destined victim and he growled inwardly however it was of no use to turn back on some pretended errand she was sure to wait till his return as he knew sir godfrey growled again inaudibly and went on to meet his fate in the form of perrote sir i would speak with you sir godfrey gave an irritable grunt sir the day of our lords birth is very nigh when men be wont to make up old quarrels in peace will you not yet once entreat of my lord duke being in england to pay one visit to his dying mother i wis not that she is dying folks commonly take less time over their dying than thus perrote as it were waved away the manner of the answer and replied only to the matter sir she is dying albeit very slowly my lady may linger divers weeks yet will you not send to my lord i did send to him snapped sir godfrey and he cometh said perrote eagerly for her no sir godfrey tried to pass her with that monosyllable but perrote was not to be thus baffled she laid a detaining hand upon his arm sir i pray you for our lords love to tell me what word came back from my lord duke our lords love was not a potent factor in sir godfreys soul more powerful were those pleading human eyesand yet more the sentiment which swayed the unjust judgebecause this widow troubleth me i will avenge her he turned back must you needs wit then take it it shall do you little pleasure my lord writ that he was busily concerned touching the troubles in brittany and ill at ease anentis my lady duchess that is besieged in the castle of auray and he could not spare time to go a visiting beside which it might be taken ill of king edward whose favour at this present is of high import unto him sith without his help he is like to lose his duchy so there ends the matter no man can look for a prince to risk the loss of his dominions but to pleasure an old dame one only sir it may be is like to look for it and were i my lord duke i should be a little concerned touching another matterthe account that he shall give in to that one at the last day in the golden balances of heaven i count a dying mothers yearning may weigh heavy and the risk of loss of worldly dominion may be very light i thank you sir goodnight may god not say one day to my lord duke thou fool perrote disappeared but sir godfrey foljambe stood where she had left him over his pleasurechilled goldhardened conscience a breath from heaven was sweeping such a breath as he had often felt in earlier years but which very rarely came to him now like the soft toll of a passing bell the terrible words rang in his ears with their accent of hopeless pitythou fool thou fool would god some day in that upper world say that to him the sound was so vivid and close that he actually glanced round to see if any one was there to hear but himself but he was alone only god had heard them and god forgets nothinga thought as dreadful to his enemies as it is warmly comforting to his children alas for those to whom the knowledge that god has his eye upon them is only one of terror yet there is one thing that god does forget he tells us that he forgets the forgiven sin as far as the sunrising is from the sunsetting note so far hath he removed our transgressions from usthou wilt cast all their sins into the depths of the sea but as it has been well said when god pardons sin he drops it out of his memory into that of the pardoned sinner we cannot forget it because he has done so for sir godfrey foljambe the thought of an omniscient eye and ear was full of horror he turned round went downstairs and going to a private closet in his own study where medicines were kept drank off one of the largest doses of brandy which he had ever taken at once it was not a usual thing to do for brandy was not then looked on as a beverage but a medicine but sir godfrey wanted something potent to still those soft chimes which kept saying thou fool anything to get away from god note this is really the hebrew of psalm verse the infidel objection therefore that since east and west meet the verse has no meaning is untenable as concerns the inspired original it is only valid as a criticism on the english translation chapter thirteen my lord elect of york she only saidthe day is dreary he will not come she said she wepti am aweary weary o god that i were dead tennyson what ho gate ho open unto my lord elect of york the cry startled the porter at hazelwood manor from an afternoon nap he sprang up and hurried out in utter confusion at his negligence to keep a priest waiting would have been bad manners enough and an abbot still worse but an archbishop was in the porters estimate a semicelestial being true this archbishop was not yet consecrated nor had he received his pallium from rome both which considerations detracted from his holiness and therefore from his importance but he was the archbishop of the province and the shadow of his future dignity was imposing to an insignificant porter poor wilkin went down on his knees in a puddle as soon as he had got the gate open to beg the potentates pardon and blessing and only rose from them summarily to collar colle who had so little notion of the paramount claims of an archbishop that he received the cavalcade with barks as noisy as he would have bestowed on any worldly pedlar nay so very unmannerly was colle that when he was let go he marched straight to the archbishop and after a prolonged sniff at the archiepiscopal boots presumed so far as to wag his very secular tail and even to give an uninvited lick to the archiepiscopal glove the archbishop instead of excommunicating colle laid his hand gently on the dogs head and patted him which so emboldened that audacious quadruped that he actually climbed up the prelate with more decided wagging than before nay my son said the archbishop gently to an officious young priest in his suite who would have dragged the dog awaygrudge me not my welcome dogs be honest creatures and dissemble not hast thou never heard the saw that they be ill folks that dogs and children will not go withal and with another pat of colles head the archbishop dismissed him and walked into the hall to meet a further welcome from the whole family and household all upon their knees blessing them in the usual priestly manner he commanded them to rise and sir godfrey then presented his sons and squire while lady foljambe did the same for the young ladies mistress margaret foljambe my sons wife an it please your grace and mistress perrote de carhaix my head chamberer these be my bowerwomen agatha de la beche and amphillis neville neville echoed the archbishop instantly of what nevilles comest thou my maid please it you holy father said the confused amphillis more frightened still to hear a sharp your grace whispered from lady foljambe i know little of my kin an it like your grace my father was walter neville and his father a ralph but more know i not under your graces pleasure how comes it thou wist no more may it please your grace my father dwelt in hertfordshire and he wedded under his estate so that his family cast him off as i have heard said amphillis growing every moment more hot and confused for it was no light ordeal for one in her position to be singled out for conversation by an archbishop and she sorely feared an after ebullition of lady foljambes wrath my child said the archbishop with great interest and very gently did thy father wed one margery altham of london whose father dwelt in the strand and was a baker he did so under your graces pardon said poor amphillis blushing for the paternal shortcomings but may it please your grace he was a masterpastiller not a baker a little smile of amusement at the delicate distinction played about the archbishops lips why then cousin amphillis i think thy cousin may ask thee for a kiss said he softly touching the girls cheek with his lips my lady foljambe i am full glad to meet here so near a kinswoman and i do heartily entreat you that my word may weigh with you to deal well with this my cousin lady foljambe with a low reverence assured his grace that she had been entirely unaware like amphillis herself that her bowerwoman could claim even remote kindred with so exalted a house and so dignified a person and that in future she should assume the position proper to her birth and to her astonishment amphillis was passed by her ladyship up the table above agatha above even perrotenay above mistress margaretand seated not by any means to her comfort next to lady foljambe herself from that day she was no more addressed with the familiar thou but always with the you which denoted equality or respect when lady foljambe styled her mistress amphillis she endured it with a blush but when perrote substituted it for the affectionate phyllis usual on her lips she was tearfully entreated not to make a change the archbishop was on his way south for the ceremony of consecration which required a dispensation if performed anywhere outside the cathedral of canterbury unless bestowed by the pope himself his visit set sir godfrey thinking here was a man who might safely be allowed to visit the dying countessbeing of course told the need for secrecy and if he requested it of him perrote must cease to worry him after that no poor priest nor all the poor priests put together could be the equivalent of a live archbishop he consulted lady foljambe and found her of the same mind as himself it would be awkward she admitted if the countess died to find themselves censured for not having supplied her with spiritual ministrations proper for her rank here was a perfect opportunity it would be a sin to lose it it was indeed in a different sense to that in which she used the words a perfect opportunity the name of alexander neville has come down to us as that of the gentlest man of his day one of the most lovable that ever lived beside this quality which rendered him a peculiarly fit ministrant to the sick and dying he was among the most prominent lollards he had drunk deep into the scriptures and therefore while not free from superstitionno man then washe was very much more free than the majority charms and incantations texts tied round the neck and threads or hairs swallowed in holy water had little value to the masculine intellect of alexander neville and along with this masculine intellect was a heart of feminine tenderness which would enable him to enter so far as it was possible for a celibate priest to enter into the sad yearnings of the dying mother whose children did not care to come to her and held aloof even in the last hour of her weary life in those times when worldliness had eaten like a canker into the heart of the church almost as much as in our own when preferment was set higher than truth and court favour was held of more worth than faithfulness one of the most unworldly men living was this elect archbishop the rank of his penitent would weigh nothing with him she would be to him only a passing soul a wronged woman a lonely widow a neglected mother after supper sir godfrey drew the archbishop aside into his private room and told him with fervent injunctions to secrecy the sorrowful tale of his secluded prisoner as much sternness as was in archbishop nevilles heart contracted his brows and drew his lips into a frown does my lord duke of brittany know his mothers condition ay if it please your grace sir godfrey repeated the substance of the answer already imparted to perrote holy saints exclaimed the archbishop and my lady basset what saith she an it like your grace i sent not unto her but wherefore my son an the son will not come then should the daughter i pray you send off a messenger to my lady basset at once and suffer me to see your prisoner is she verily nigh death or may she linger yet a season father jordan reckoneth she may yet abide divers weeks your grace in especial if the spring be mild as it biddeth fair she fadeth but full slow sir godfreys tone was that of an injured man who was not properly treated either by the countess or providence through this very gradual demise of the former the archbishops replypoor lady was in accents of unmitigated compassion lady foljambe was summoned by her husband and she conducted the prelate to the turretchamber where the countess sat in her chair by the window and amphillis was in attendance he entered with uplifted hand and the benediction of christ save all here amphillis rose hastily gathering her work upon one arm the countess who had heard nothing for she had been sleeping since her bowermaiden returned from supper looked up with more interest than she usually showed the entrance of a complete stranger was something very unexpected and unaccountable christ save you holy father i pray you pardon me that i arise not being ill at ease to entreat your blessing well avena what has moved thee to bring a fresh face into this my dungeon prithee it should be somewhat of import madame this is my lords grace elect of york who coming hither on his way southwards mine husband counted it good for your graces soul to shrive you of his graces hand my lord if your grace have need of a crucifix or of holy water both be behind this curtain come mistress amphillis his grace will be pleased to rap on the door when it list him to come forth and i pray you abide in your chamber and hearken for the same i thank thee avena said the countess with her curt laugh sooth to say i wist not my soul was of such worth in thine eyes and still less in thine husbands i would my body weighed a little more with the pair of you so i am to confess my sins forsooth that shall be a light matter methinks i have but little chance to sin shut up in this cage truly i should find myself hard put to it to do damage to any of the ten commandments hereaway a dungeons all out praisable for keeping folks goodnigh as well as a sick bed and when man has both together he should be marvellous innocent there go thy ways ill send for thee when i lack thee lady foljambe almost slammed the door behind her and locking it charged amphillis to listen carefully for the archbishops knock and to unlock the door the moment she should hear it the archbishop meanwhile had seated himself in the only chair in the room corresponding to that of the countess a chair was an object of consequence in the eyes of a mediaeval gentleman for none but persons of high rank might sit on a chair all others were relegated to a form styled a bench when it had a back to it stools however were allowed to all that certain formalities or styles of magnificence should have been restricted to persons of rank may be reasonable but it does seem absurd that no others should have been allowed to be comfortable the good old times were decidedly inconvenient for such as had no handles to their names i speak as i have been told to the lady marguerite duchess of brittany and mother to my lord duke inquired the archbishop and countess of montfort was the answer pray your grace give me all my names for nought else is left me to pleasure me withalsaving a twothree ounces of sleasilk and an ell of gold fringe and what else would you what else the question was asked in passionate tones and the dark flashing eyes went longingly across the valley to the alport heights i would have my life back again she said i have not had a fair chance i have done with my life not that i willed but only that which others gave leave for me to do six and twenty years have i been tethered and fretted and limited granted only the semblance of power the picture of life and thrust and pulled back whensoever i strained in the least at the leash wherein i was held no dog has been more penned up and chained than i and now for eight years have i been cabined in one chamber shut up from the very air of heaven whereunto god made all men freeshut up from every face that i knew and loved saving one of mine ancient waitingmaidsverily if they would use me worser than so they shall be hard put to it save to thrust me into my coffin and fasten down the lid on me i want my life back again i want the bright harvest of my youth which these slugs and maggots have devoured which i never had i want the bloom of my dead happiness which men tare away from me i want my dead lord and mine estranged children and my lost life tell me has god no treasury whence he pays compensation for such wrongs as mine must i never see my little child again the baby lad that clung to me and would not see me weep my pillow is wet now and no man careth for itnay nor god himself i was alway true woman i never wronged human soul that i know i paid my dues and shrived me clean and lived honestly wherefore is all this come upon me lady marguerite if you lost a penny and gained a gold noble would you think you were repaid the loss or no in very deed i should the sick woman replied languidly the fire had spent itself in that outburst and the embers had little warmth left in them yet said the archbishop significantly you would not have won the lost thing back what matter so i had its better we will return to that but first i have another thing to ask you say you never wronged man to your knowledge have you always paid all your dues to him that is above men i never robbed the church of a penny there be other debts than pence my daughter have you kept to the best of your power all the commandments of god in very deed i have you never worshipped any other god i never worshipped neither jupiter nor juno nor venus nor diana nor mars nor mercury that can i full readily believe but as there be other debts than money so there be other gods than jupiter honoured you no man nor thing above god cared you alway more for his glory than for the fame of marguerite of flanders or the comfort of jean de bretagne marry you come close said the countess with a laugh fame and ease be not gods good father they be not god was the significant answer ye are servants to him whom ye obey saith the apostle and man may obey other than his lawful master whatsoever you set or suffer to set himself in gods place that is your god what has been your god my daughter i am never a bit worse than my neighbours said the countess leaving that inconvenient question without answer and repairing as thousands do to that very much broken cistern of equality in transgression you must be better than your neighbours ere god shall suffer you in his holy heaven you must be as good as he is or you shall not win thither and since man cannot be so the only refuge for him is to take shelter under the cross of christ which wrought righteousness to cover him then man may live as he list and cover him with christs righteousness slily responded the countess with that instant recourse to the antinomianism inherent in fallen man if man say he knoweth him and keepeth not his commandments he is a liar quoted the archbishop in reply he that saith he abideth in him ought to walk as he walked man cannot abide in christ and commit sin for he hath no sin you left unanswered my question lady what has been your god i have paid due worship to god and the church was the rather stubborn answer pass on i pray you i worshipped no false god i took not gods name in vain no more than other folks i always heard mass of a sunday and festival day i never murdered nor stole and as to telling false witness beshrew me if it were false witness to tell avena foljambe she is a born fool the which i have done many a time in the day come now let me off gently father there are scores of worser women in this world than me god will not judge you lady for the sins of other women neither will he let you go free for the goodness of other there is but one other for whose sake you shall be suffered to go free and that only if you be one with him in such wise that your deeds and his be reckoned as one like as the debts of a wife be reckoned to her husband and his honours be shared by her are you thus one with jesu christ our lord in good sooth i know not what you mean i am in the church what more lack i the church must see to it that i come safe so long as i shrive me and keep me clear of mortal sin and little chance of mortal sin have i cooped up in this cage daughter the church is every righteous man that is joined with christ if you wist not what i mean can you be thus joined could a woman be wedded to a man and not know it could two knights enter into covenant to live and die each with other and be all unsure whether they had so done or no it were far more impossible than this that you should be a member of christs body and not know what it meaneth so to be but i am in holy church urged the countess uneasily i fear not so my daughter father you be marvellous different from all other priests that ever spake to me with all other i have shrived me and been absolved and there ended the matter i had sins to confess be sure and they looked i should so have and no more but youwould you have me perfect saint without sin none but great saints be thus as i have been taught not the greatest of saints truly there is no man alive that sinneth not what is sin breaking the commandments i reckon ay and in especial that first and greatestthou shalt love the lord thy god with all thine heart and with all thy mind and with all thy soul and with all thy strength daughter hast thou so loved himso that neither ease nor pleasure neither fame nor life neither earth nor self came between your love and him was set above him and served afore him speak truly like the true woman you are i wait your answer it was several moments before the answer came father is that sin my daughter it is the sin of sins the sin whence all other sins flowthis estrangement of the heart from god for if we truly loved god and perfectly should we commit sincould we so do could we desire to worship any other than him or to set anything before him could we bear to profane his name to neglect his commands to go contrary to his will should we then bear illwill to other men who love him and whom he loveth should we speak falsely in his ears who is the truth should we suffer pride to defile our souls knowing that he dwelleth with the lowly in heart answer me lady marguerite father you are sore hard think you god that is up in heaven taketh note of a white lie or twain or a few cross words by nows and thens not to name a mere wish that passeth athwart mans heart and is gone god taketh note of sin daughter and sin is sinit is rebellion against the king of heaven what think you your son would say to a captain of his which pleaded that he did but surrender one little postern gate to the enemy and that there were four other strong portals that led into the town all whereof he had well defended why the enemy might enter as well through the postern as any other to be in is to be in no matter how he find entrance truth and the lightest desire can be sin as well as the wickedest deed verily if the desire never arose the deed should be illset to follow then god is punishing me she said wistfully god is looking for you was the quiet answer the sheep hath gone astray over moor and morass and the night is dark and cold and it bleateth piteously and the shepherd is come out of the warm fold and is tracking it on the lonely hills and calling to it lady will the sheep answer his voice will it bleat again and again until he find it or will it refuse to hear and run further into the morass and be engulfed and fully lost in the dark waters or snatched and carried into the wolfs den god is not punishing you now he is loving you he is waiting to see if you will take his way of escape from punishment but the punishment of your sins must be laid upon some one and it is for you to choose whether you will bear it yourself or will lay it upon him who came down from heaven that he might bear it for you it must be either upon you or him the face lighted up suddenly and the thin weak hands were stretched out if god love me she said let him give me back my children he would if he did let them come back to me and i shall believe it without this i cannot father i mean none ill i would fain think as you say but my heart is weak and my life ebbs low and i cannot bleat back again o god for my childrenfor only one of them i would be content with one if thou lovest meif i have sinned and thou wouldst spare me give me back my child thou madest far from me friend and neighbourgive me back one o god daughter we may not dictate to our king said the archbishop gently yet i doubt not there be times when he stoops mercifully to weakness and misery and helps our unbelief may he grant your petition and now i think you lack rest and have had converse enough i will see you again ere i depart benedicite chapter fourteen posting a letter whose fancy was his only oracle who could buy lands and pleasure at his will yet slighted that which silver could not win rev horatius bonar dd the archbishop rapped softly on the door of the chamber and amphillis sprang to let him out she had to let herself in so he passed her with only a smile and a blessing and going straight to his own chamber spent the next hour in fervent prayer at the end of that time he went down to the hall and asked for writing materials this was a rather large request to make in a mediaeval manor house father jordan was appealed to as the only person likely to know the whereabouts of such scarce articles well of a surety exclaimed the old priest much fluttered by the inquiry methinks i may find the inkhornand there was some ink in itbut as for writingpaperand i fear there shall be never a bit of parchment in the house wax moreoverrichard butler took the last for his corks dear dear only to think his grace should lack matter for writing yet truly tis not unnatural for a prelate now whatever shall man do give his grace a tile and a paintbrush said careless matthew cut a leaf out of a book suggested illiterate godfrey father jordan looked at the last speaker as if he had proposed to cook a child for dinner cut a leaf out of a book murder theft and arson combined would scarcely have been more horrible in his eyes holy saints deliver us was his shocked answer norman hylton came to the rescue i have here a small strip of parchment said he if his grace were pleased to make use thereof i had laid it by for a letter to my mother but his graces need is more than mine the archbishop took the offered gift with a smile i thank thee my son said he in good sooth at this moment my need is great seeing death waiteth for no man he sat down and had scarcely remembered the want of ink when father jordan came up carrying a very dilapidated old inkhorn if your grace were pleased to essay this and could serve you withal suggested he dubiously soothly there is somewhat black at the bottom and there is alegar in the house plenty added matthew the archbishop looked about for the pen unlucky mortal that i am cried father jordan smiting himself on the forehead never a quill have i by my troth have you a goose that might mend matters said matthew had we but a goose there should be quills enow men culpa mea culpa cried poor father jordan as though he were at confession to the excessive amusement of the young men norman who had run upstairs on finding the pen lacking now returned with one in his hand here is a quill if your grace be pleased withal it is but an old one yet i have no better he said modestly it shall full well serve me my son was the answer and i thank thee for thy courtesy for his day the archbishop was a skilful penman which does not by any means convey the idea of covering sheet after sheet of paper with rapid writing the strip of parchment was about fourteen inches by four he laid it lengthwise before him and the letters grew slowly on it in the old black letter hand which took some time to form thus ran his letter alexander by divine sufferance elect of york to the lady basset of drayton wisheth peace health and the blessing of god almighty very dear lady let it please you to know that the bearer hereof hath tidings to deliver of serious and instant import we pray you full heartily to hear him without any delay and to give full credence to such matter as he shall impart unto you which having done we bid you as you value our apostolical blessing to come hither with all speed and we charge our very dear son your lord that he let not nor hinder you in obeying this our mandate the matter presseth and will brook no delay and we affy ourself in you lady as a woman obedient to the church that you will observe our bidding and for so doing this shall be your warrant given at hazelwood manor in the county of derby this wednesday after candlemas the archbishop laid down his pen folded his letter and asked for silk to tie it matthew foljambe ran off returning in a moment with a roll of blue silk braid wherewith the letter was tied up then wax was needed ha chetife said father jordan the saints forgive me my sins never a bit of wax had i lacked for many a month and i gave the last to richard butler hath he used it all asked matthew be sure he so did he should have some left only if none needed it responded his brother a search was instituted the butler regretfully admitted that all the wax supplied to him was fastening down corks upon bottles of alicant and osey sir godfrey had none he had sent for some but had not yet received it everybody was rather ashamed for wax was a very necessary article in a mediaeval household and to run short of it was a small disgrace in this emergency matthew usually the person of resources came to the rescue hie thee to the cellar dick and bring me up a twothree bottles of thy meanest wine said he well melt it off the corks by this ingenious means sufficient wax was procured to take the impress of the archbishops official seal without which the letter would bear no authentication and the recipient could not be blamed if she refused obedience it was then addressedto the hands of our very dear lady the lady joan basset at drayton manor in the county of stafford be these delivered with speed haste haste for thy life haste all nobles and dignitaries of the church in used the we now exclusively regal having finished his preparations the archbishop despatched young godfrey to ask his father for a private interview sir godfrey at once returned to the hall and ceremoniously handed the archbishop into his own room all large houses in those days contained a hall which was the general meetingplace of the inhabitants and where the family servants and guests all took their meals together this usually ran two storeys high and into it opened from the lower storey the offices and guardchambers and from the upper into a gallery running round it the private apartments of the family a spiral stair frequently winding down in the corner the rooms next the hall were private sittingrooms leading to the bedchambers beyond and where still greater secrecy was desired passages led out towards separate towers every bedroom had its adjoining sittingroom of course in small houses such elaborate arrangements as these were not found and there were no sittingrooms except the hall itself while labourers were content with a tworoomed house the lower half serving as parlour and kitchen the upper as the family bedchamber young godfrey carried a chair to his fathers room an archbishop could not sit on a form and there were only three chairs in the house two of which were appropriated to the countess the prelate took his seat and laid down his letter on a high stool before sir godfrey fair sir may i entreat you of your courtesy to send this letter with all good speed to my lady basset of drayton unto staffordshire is it needful holy father it is in sooth needful replied the archbishop in rather peremptory tones for he plainly saw that sir godfrey would not do this part of his duty until he could no longer help it it shall put her ladyship to great charges objected the knight the which if she defray unwillingly then is she no christian woman and be a journey mighty displeasant at this winter season my answer thereto is as to the last and it shall blurt out the kings privy matters in no wise i have not writ thereof a word in this letter but have only prayed her ladyship to give heed unto that which the bearer thereof shall make known to her privily then who is to bear the same i refer me thereon fair sir to your good judgment might one of your own sons be trusted herewith sir godfrey looked dubious godfrey should turn aside to see an horse or to tilt at any jousting that lay in his path and matthew i cast no doubt should lose your graces letter in a snowdrift then have you brought them up but ill said the archbishop but what hindereth that you go withal yourself i holy father i am an old man and infirm an it like your grace ay you were full infirm when the tilting was at leicester replied the archbishop ironically my son i enjoin thee as thine archbishop that thou send this letter go or send a trusty messenger as it liketh thee best and if thou have no such then shall my secretary father denny carry the same for he is full meet therefor but go it must poor sir godfrey was thus brought to the end of all his subterfuges he could only say ruefully that his eldest son should bear the letter the archbishop thereupon took care to inform that young gentleman that if his missive should be either lost or delayed its bearer would have to reckon with the church and might not find the account quite convenient to pay godfrey was ready enough to go life at hazelwood was not so exciting that a journey on whatever errand would not come as a very welcome interlude he set forth that evening and as the journey was barely forty miles he could not in reason take longer over it than three days at the utmost sir godfrey however as well as the archbishop had confided his private views to his son he charged him to see lord basset first and to indoctrinate him with the idea that it was most desirable lady basset should not receive the prelates message could he find means to prevent it lord basset was a man of a type not uncommon in any time and particularly rife at the present day he lived to amuse himself of such things as work and duty he simply had no idea in his eyes work was for the labouring class and duty concerned the clergy neither of them applied at all to him he was therefore of about as much value to the world as one of the roses in his garden and if he would be more missed it was because his temper did not at all times emulate the sweetness of that flower and its absence would be felt as a relief this very useful and worthy gentleman was languidly fitting on the jesses of a hawk when young godfrey was introduced into the hall lady basset was not present and godfrey seized the opportunity to initiate her husband into the part he was to play he found to his annoyance that lord basset hesitated to perform the task assigned to him had the letter come from an insignificant layman he would have posted it into the fire without more ado but lord basset who was aware of sundry habits of his own that he was not able to flatter himself were the fashion in heaven could not afford to quarrel with the church which in his belief held the keys of that eligible locality nay verily said he i cannot thwart the delivering of his graces letter then will my lady go to hazelwood and the whole matter shall be blazed abroad it is sure to creep forth at some corner as like as not well i would not so much careshould it serve you if i gave her strict forbiddance for to go would she obey lord basset laughed thats as may be shes commonly an easy mare to drive but there be times when she takes the bit betwixt her teeth and bolts down the contrary road you can only try her then under your leave may i deliver the letter to her here de sucherche said lord basset raising his voice bid emeriarde lead this gentleman to thy lady he hath a privy word to deliver unto her emeriarde made her appearance in the guise of a highly respectable middleaged upper servant and led godfrey up the staircase from the hall to lady bassets antechamber where leaving him for a moment while she announced a visitor to her mistress she returned and conducted him into the presence of the princess of bretagne he saw a woman of thirtysix years of age tall and somewhat stately only moderately goodlooking and with an expression of intense weariness and listlessness in her dark eyes the face was a true index to the feelings for few lonelier women have ever shut their sorrows in their hearts than the princess jeanne of bretagne she had no child and her husband followed the usual rule of people who spend life in amusing themselves and who are apt to be far from amusing to their own families his interest his attractions and his powers of entertainment were kept for the world outside when his wife saw him he was generally either vexed and consequently irritable or tired and somewhat sulky all the sufferings of reaction which fell to him were visited on her she was naturally a woman of strong but silent character a woman who locked her feelings her sufferings and her thoughts in her own breast and having found no sympathy where she ought to have found it refrained from seeking it elsewhere lord basset would have been astonished had he been accused of illusing his wife he never lifted his hand against her nor even found fault with her before company he simply let her feel as if her life were not worth living and there was not a soul on earth who cared to make it so if only now and then he would have given her half an hour of that brilliance with which he entertained his guests if he would occasionally have shown her that he cared whether she was tired that it made any difference to his happiness whether she was happy she was a woman with intense capacity for loving but there was no fuel for the fire and it was dying out for sheer want of material women of lighter character might have directed their affections elsewhere women of more versatile temperament might have found other interests for themselves she did neither though strong her intellect was neither quick nor of great range it was deep rather than wide in its extent it must be remembered also that a multitude of interests which are open to a woman in the present day were quite unknown to her the whole world of literature and science was an unknown thing and art was only accessible in the two forms of fancy work and illumination for neither of which had she capacity or taste she could sew cook and act as a doctor when required which was not often and there the list of her accomplishments ended there was more in her but nobody cared to draw it out and herself least of all lady basset bowed gravely in reply to godfreys courtesy broke the seal of the letter and gazed upon the cabalistic characters therein written had they been chinese she would have learned as much from them as she did she handed back the letter with a request that he would read it to her if he possessed the art of reading if not she would send for father collard for a moment but no more the temptation visited godfrey to read the letter as something which it was not he dismissed it not from any conscientious motive but simply from the doubt whether he could keep up the delusion good said lady basset when the letter had been read to her and now what is that you are to tell me dame suffer me first to say that it is of the gravest moment that there be no eavesdroppers about and that your ladyship be pleased to keep strait silence thereupon otherwise i dare not utter that wherewith his graces letter hath ado there be no ears at hand save my bowerwomans and i will answer for her as for myself i can keep silence when need is speak on then lady i give you to know that the duchess grace your mother is now in ward under keeping of my father at hazelwood manor and lady basset had risen to her feet with a strange glow in her eyes my mother she said your lady and mother dame and she my mother she said again my mother i thought my mother was dead and buried years and years ago verily no lady and my lord archbishops grace doth most earnestly desire your ladyship to pay her visit she being now near death and your lord and brother the duke denying to come unto her the glow deepened in the dark eyes my lord my brother refused to go to my mother he did so dame and she is near death very near i am told lady and he wist it he wist it lady basset seemed for a moment to have forgotten everything but the one lead on she said i will go to herpoor mother i can scarce remember her i was so young when taken from her but i think she loved me once i will go though no other soul on earth keep me company lady said godfrey saying the exact reverse of truth i do right heartily trust your lord shall not let you therein what matter she said if the devil and all his angels stood in the way i would go to my dying mother she left the room for a minute and to godfreys dismay came back attired for her journey as if she meant to set out there and then but lady he expostulated you need not tarry for me she said calmly i can find the way and i have sent word to bid mine horses this was unendurable godfrey in his dismay left the room with only a courtesy and sought lord basset in the hall ah shes taken the bit betwixt her teeth said he i warrant youd best leave her be shell go now if it be on a witchs broom ill forbid it an you will but i do you to wit i might as well entreat yon tree not to wave in the wind when she doth take the bit thus shes an emphatic shake of lord bassets head finished the sentence he rose as if it were more trouble than it was reasonable to impose walked into his wifes room and asked her where she was going that winter day you are scarce wont to inquire into my comings and goings she said coldly but if it do your lordship ease to wit the same i am going to hazelwood manor whence yonder young gentleman is now come how if i forbid it my lord i am sent for to my dying mother your lordship is a gentleman i believe and therefore not like to forbid me but if you so did yea twenty times twice told i should answer you as now i do seven years have i done your bidding and when i return i will do it yet again but not now neither you nor satan himself should stay me this one time your ladyship losengeth flatters was the careless answer fare you well ill not hinder you as for satan though it pleaseth you to count me in with him ill be no surety for his doings master foljambe go you after this crackbrained dame of mine or tarry you here with me and drink a cup of malvoisie wine godfrey would very much have preferred to remain with lord basset but a wholesome fear of his father and the archbishop together restrained him from doing so he was exceedingly vexed to be made to continue his journey thus without intermission but lady basset was already on a pillion behind her squire and emeriarde on another behind the groom a few garments having been hastily squeezed into a saddlebag carried by the latter this summary way of doing things was almost unheard of in the fourteenth century and godfrey entertained a private opinion that crackbrained was a truthful epithet needs must said he wherefore i pray your lordship mercy her ladyship shall scantly make good road to hazelwood without i go withal butha chetife lord basset slightly laughed kissed his hand to his wife lifted his hat to godfrey with a shrug of his shoulders and walked back into drayton manor house chapter fifteen too little gods very kindest answers to our prayers come often in denials or delays sw partridge lord basset turned back into his house with a sensation akin to relief not that he allowed the thought of his wifes unhappiness to deter him from any course on which he had set his heart but that he felt the pressure of her atmosphere and could not enjoy his transgressions with the full abandon which he would have liked her stately cold unbending reserve was like a constant chill and blight how much more happy they might have been if they had chosen the world held many a worse man than lord basset he was rather idle and careless than wicked though idleness and carelessness are very often the seed of wickedness when left to go to flower if she would only have dropped that haughty coldness he thought he could have felt interest in her and have taken some pleasure in her society while her conviction was that if he would only have shown some interest she could have loved him and returned it would both have done it together the result might have been attained mr godfrey foljambe was meditating not on this but on his own personal wrongs as he led the little cavalcade in an easterly direction first he had been deprived of that glass of malvoisie which would probably have been plural rather than singularand of a conversation with lord basset which might have resulted in something of interest and life was exceedingly devoid of interest thought mr godfrey in a pessimistic spirit he had not discovered that to a great extent life is to every man what he chooses to make it that he who keeps his eyes fixed on street mud need not expect to discover pearls while he who attentively scans the heavens is not at all unlikely to see stars let a man set himself diligently to hunt for either his misfortunes or his mercies and he will find plenty of the article in request misfortunes were the present object of mr godfreys search and he had no difficulty in discovering them he was disgusted with the folly of lady basset in thus setting off at once and making him set off without so much as an hours rest it was just like a woman women never had a scrap of patience this pleasing illusion that all patience was masculine was kept up in popular literature just so long as men were the exclusive authors when women began to write otherwise than on kingly sufferance of the nobler half of creation it was seen that the feminine view of that and similar subjects was not quite so restricted last and worst to young godfrey was the expectation of his fathers displeasure sir godfreys anger was no passing cloud as his son well knew to be thought to have failed in his missionas assuredly he would beby his own fault would result in considerable immediate discomfort and might even damage his worldly prospects in future he would gladly have prolonged the journey for his instinct always led him to put off the evil day rather than to face it and put it behind himwhich last is usually the wiser course but lady basset would brook no delay and on the afternoon of the second day after leaving drayton they rode up to hazelwood manor godfrey hastily despatched the porters lad to inform his mother of lady bassets arrival and lady foljambe met her on the steps of the hall the latter was scandalised to find that the former saw no need for secrecy or at any rate had no intention of preserving it dame said lady foljambe i am honoured by your ladyships visit pray you suffer me to serve you with hypocras and spice in your privy chamber this was intended as a gentle hint to the visitor that secrets were not to be talked in the hall but the hint was not accepted how fares my lady and mother was the response dame much worse than when my son departed said lady foljambe in a fluttered manner then i pray you to break my coming and lead me to her forthwith said lady basset in her style of stately calm a curtain was drawn aside and perrote came forward damoiselle jeanne she said greeting lady basset by the old youthful title unheard for years my darling mine own dear child a smile not at all usual there quivered for a moment on the calm fixed lips is this mine ancient nurse perrote de carhaix she said i think i know her face the smile was gone in a moment as she repeated her wish to be taken immediately to the countess lady foljambe felt she had no choice she led the way to the chamber of the royal prisoner requesting lady basset to wait for a moment at the door the countess sat no longer in her cushioned chair by the window she was now confined to her bed where she lay restlessly moaning at intervals but always on one theme my children my lost children will not god give me back one lady foljambe signed to perroteshe scarcely knew whyto break the news to the suffering mother lady the lord hath heard your moaning and hath seen your tears said perrote kneeling by the bed he hath given you back my son the cry was a pitiful one then as ever the boy was the dearest to his mothers heart very dear lady no your daughter it was painful to see how the sudden gleam died out of the weary eyes ah well she said after an instants pause well i asked but for one and when man doth that he commonly gets the lesser of the twain well i shall be glad to see my jeanne let her come in lady basset came forward and bent over the dying woman dame she said come now was the answer there be folks enough call me dame only two in all this world can call me mother mother was the response in a tremulous voice and then the icy stateliness broke up and passionate sobs broke in mingled with the sounds of o mother mother thats good little lass said the countess its good to hear that but once ma fillette but wherefore tarrieth thy brother away it must be king edward that will not suffer him to come it was piteous to hear her cling thus to the old illusion all the time of her imprisonment though now and then in a fit of anger she could hurl bitter names at her son yet when calm she had usually maintained that he was kept away from her and refused to be convinced that his absence was of his own free will the longer the illusion lasted the more stubbornly she upheld it tis not always the bestloved that loveth back the best said perrote gently without mans best love be as it should be fixed on god and tis common for fathers and mothers to love better than they be loved the which is more than all other true of the father in heaven thou mayest keep thy sermons old woman till mass is sung said the countess in her cynical style ah me my jean would come to the old whitehaired mother that risked her life for hishe would come if he could he must know how my soul hungereth for the sight of his face i want nothing else heaven would be purgatory to me without him ah my dear lady tenderly replied perrote if only i might hear you say that of the lord that laid down his life for you i am not a nun was the answer and i shall not say that which i feel not god forbid you should lady but i pray him to grant you so to feel i tell thee i am not a nun said the countess rather pettishly her idea was that real holiness was impossible out of the cloister and that to love god was an entirely different type of feeling from the affection she had for her human friends this was the usual sentiment in the middle ages but perrote had been taught of god and while her educational prejudices acted like coloured or smoked glass and dimmed the purity of the heavenly light they were unable to hide it altogether very dear lady she said god loveth sinners and he must then love other than nuns shall they not love him back though they be not in cloister thou hadst better win in cloister thyself when thou art rid of me was the answer in a tone which was a mixture of languor and sarcasm thou art scarce fit to tarry without old woman i will do that which god shall show me said perrote calmly dame were it not well your grace should essay to sleep nay not so i have my jeanne to look at that i have not seen for fiveandtwenty years i shall sleep fast enough anon daughter art thou a happy woman or no lady basset answered by a shake of the head why what aileth thee is it thy baron or thy childre i have no child mother the countess heard the regretful yearning of the tone thank the saints she said thou wert better soothly to increase objects for love is to increase sorrow if thou have no childre theyll never be torn from thee nor they will never break thine heart by ill behaving and most folks behave ill in this world ha chetife tis a weary dreary place this world as ever a poor woman was in hast thou a good man to thy baron child he might be worser said lady basset icily thats true of an handful of folks said the countess and i reckon he might be better eh thats true of most good lack i marvel wherefore we all were made was it by reason god loved or hated us say my predicant friaress very dear lady the wise man saith god made a man rightful and he meddled himself with questions without number ecclesiastes eight verse and saint paul saith that god commendeth his charity in us for when we were sinners christ was dead for us romans five verse moreover saint john hold there be two scriptures where is the sermon the scriptures lady preach a better sermon than i can thats but a short one mans ill and god is good behold all thine homily that man is ill i lack no preaching friar to tell me as to god being good the church saith so and there i rest mary mother if he were good he would bring my jean back to me very dear lady god is wiser than men and he seeth the end from the beginning have done perrotine i tell thee if god be good he will bring my jean to me there i abide ill say it if he do i would love any man that wrought that and if he will work it i will love himand not otherwise hold i desire no more talk the countess turned her face to the wall and perrote retired with tears in her eyes lord thou art wise she said in her heart wiser than i than she than all men but never yet have i known her to depart from such a word as that oh if it be possibleif it be possiblethou who camest down from heaven to earth come down once more to the weak and stubborn soul of this dying woman and grant her that which she requests if so she may be won to love thee father the time is very short and her soul is very dark o fair father jesu christ lose not this soul for which thou hast died perrotes next move was to await lady bassets departure from her mothers chamber and to ask her to bestow a few minutes private talk on her old nurse the princess complied readily and came into the opposite chamber where amphillis sat sewing damoiselle jeanne said perrote using the royal title of lady bassets unmarried days may i pray you tell me if you have of late seen the lord duke your brother ay within a year said lady basset listlessly would it please you to say if king edward letteth his coming i think not so would he come if he were asked yet again and knew that a few weeks maybe dayswould end his mothers life i doubt it perrotine wherefore he can love well where he list ay where he list but i misdoubt if ever he loved herat the least sithence she let him from wedding the damoiselle de ponteallen then he loved the damoiselle very dearly for a monthay but wherefore when the matter was by lady basset answered with a bitter little laugh which reminded perrote of her mothers because he loved jean de montfort and she thwarted him not the damoiselle he loved alix de ponteallen passionately and passion dies tis its nature it is not passionately but undyingly that he loves himself men do tis their nature perrote shrewdly guessed that the remark had especial reference to one man and that not the duke of bretagne ah that is the nature of all sinners she said and therefore of all men and women also dame will you hearken to your old nurse and grant her one boon that will i perrotine if it be in my power i grant not so many boons neither can i that i should grudge one to mine old nurse what wouldst dame i pray you write a letter to my lord duke the pitifullest you may pen and send one of your men therewith to pray him as he loveth you or her or god that he will come and look on her ere she die tell him his old nurse full lovingly entreateth him and if he will so do i will take veil when my lady is gone hence and spend four nights in the week in prayer for his welfare say i will be his bedeswoman for ever in any convent he shall name say anything that will bring him i passed thee my word and i will keep it said lady basset as she rose but if i know him what i should say certainly to bring him would be that sir oliver de clisson lay here in dungeon and that if he would come he should see his head strake off in yonder court he is a fair lover my brother but he is a far better hater perrote sighed amphillis came faintly up the stairs and along the gallery amphillis go child said perrote replying to a look from amphillis tis agatha calling thee what would the foolish maid amphillis left her work upon the bench and ran down well it is merry matter to catch hold of thee said agatha who was waiting at the foot of the stairs and who never could recollect unless lady foljambe were present that amphillis was to be addressed with more reverence than before here be friends of thine come to visit thee friendsof mine exclaimed amphillis in surprise why i havent any friends well enemies then said agatha with a giggle come go into hall and see who they be and then tell me amphillis obeyed and to her still greater surprise found herself in the presence of mr altham and regina ah here she cometh was her uncles greeting well my maid i am fain to see thee so welllooking i warrant thee canst love a new aunt thinkest that am i secure replied amphillis smiling and kissing the goldsmiths daughter and an old uncle belike pursued mr altham kissing her in his turn assuredly dear uncle but i pray how came you hither dat shall i tell you said mrs altham for oderwise you shall not know what good uncle you have he promise to take me to mine own home in dutchland to see my greatmoder and mine aunts and when we nigh ready were he say see you now shall we not go round by derbyshire to see amphillis and sail from hull so we come round all dis way he miss you so and want to make him sure you be well and kindly used see you how kind and good are you both said amphillis gratefully pray you good aunt regina came ricarda home safe she came safe and she had but de scold well tanks to your message if not she had de beat beat i ensure you and she deserve dat full well she was bad girl bad said i not to you de mans is bad and de womans is badder it is true shes a weary hussy said mr altham but shes been a sight better maid sithence she came back she saith tis thy doing phyllis mine exclaimed amphillis she saith so i wis not how and art happy here my maid doth thy dame entreat thee well and be thy fellows pleasant company because if no theres room for thee in the pattyshop i can tell thee saundrinas wed and ricarda looks to be and my wife and i should be full fain to have thee back for our daughter howbeit if thou art here welsome and comfortable we will not carry thee off against thy will what sayest truly dear uncle i am here full welsome saving some small matters of little moment and under your good pleasure i would fain not go hence so long as one liveth that is now sore sick in this house and nigh to death afterward if it like you to dispose of me otherwise i am alway at your bidding well said but what should best like thee amphillis felt the question no easy one she would not wish to leave perrote but if perrote took the veil that obstacle would be removed and even if she did not amphillis had no certain chance of accompanying her wherever she might go which would not improbably be to drayton manor to leave the rest of her present companions would be no hardship at all except amphilliss heart said except and her conscience turned away and declined to pursue that road norman hylton had shown no preference for her beyond others so far as she knew and her maidenly instinct warned her that even her thoughts had better be kept away from him before she answered a shadow fell between her and the light and amphillis looked up into the kindly face of archbishop neville the archbishop had delayed his further journey for the sake of the dying countess whom he wished to see again especially if his influence could induce her son to come to her he now addressed himself to mr altham master altham as i guess he asked pleasantly mr altham rose as in duty bound in honour to a priest and a priest who as he dimly discerned by his canonicals was not altogether a common one he and your humble servant holy father you be uncle i count of my cousin amphillis here sir amphillis your cousin amphillis is my cousin was the quiet answer and i am the archbishop of york to say that mr altham was struck dumb with amazement would be no figure of speech he stared from the archbishop to amphillis and back again as if his astonishment had fairly paralysed his powers that of sight only excepted and had not regina roused him from his condition of helplessness by an exclamation of ach heilige maria there is no saying how long he might have stood so doing ay uncle said amphillis with a smile this is my lord elect of york and he is pleased to say that my father was his kinsman and if it serve you master altham added the archbishop i would fain have a privy word with you touching this my cousin mr althams reply was twofold saints worshipped might they be was meant in answer to amphillis then to the archbishop he hastily continued sir holy father your graces most humble servant i hold myself at your graces bidding whensoever it shall please your grace that is well said the archbishop smiling we will have some talk this evening if it serve you chapter sixteen the request granted it is not love that steals the heart from love tis the hard world and its perplexing cares its petrifying selfishness its pride its low ambition and its paltry aims caroline bowles lady basset fulfilled her promise of writing to her brother and sent her own squire with the letter it was uncertain where the duke might be and consequently how long the journey might take the messenger was instructed to seek him first at windsor and to be guided in his further movements by what he might hear there no time was lost for the squire set out on his journey that very evening about the time of his departure the archbishop and mr altham held their little conference regina was at work in the windowseat by her husbands contrivance theoretically he took the popular view of the condign inferiority of the female intellect while practically he held his regina in the highest reverence and never thought of committing himself on any important subject without first ascertaining her opinion and the goldsmiths daughter deserved his esteem for she possessed a warm heart and a large reserve of quiet good sense they were both highly delighted to see that the archbishop seemed inclined to show kindness to the young cousin whose relationship he at least was not too proud to acknowledge nor should he not be said regina whose tiny bobbins were flying about on her lacecushion too fast for the eye to follow did we not come all from von man and von woman i tink adam was not too proud to speak to abel and if cain would not talk he was bad man and we should not take de pattern after de bad mans ach if dere was none but good mans and good womans what better of a world it should be regina had too much tact and sense of propriety to thrust herself into the conversation between the archbishop and her husband she sat silently listening and working and the sprigs of lace flowers grew rapidly under her skilful fingers i would fain speak with you mr altham said the archbishop touching the disposing of my cousin amphillis i cannot but feel that the maid hath been somewhat wronged by her fathers kin and though thanks be to god i never did her nor him any hurt yet being of his kindred i would desire you to suffer me a little to repair this wrong she seemeth me a good maid and a worthy and well bred in courtesy wherefore if my word might help her to secure a better settlement i would not it were lacking i pray you therefore to count me as your friend and hers and tell me how you think to order her life she hath i take it none other guardian than you my lord your grace doth us great honour tis true the maid hath none other guardian than i and her mother was mine only sister and i held her dear and seeing she had none other to give an helping hand i was in the mind to portion her with mine own daughters i gave to the two and shall give to the other five pound apiece to their marriages and likewise their wedding gear and seeing she is a good decent maid and a credit to her kin i would do the same by amphillis therein do you act full nobly master altham said the archbishop for the sum named was a very handsome one for a girl in mr althams station of life at that time only a tradesman very welltodo could have afforded to portion his daughter so highly with an amount equivalent in the present day to about pounds go to then will you suffer me that i endow my young kinswoman with the like sum and likewise find her in an horse for her riding in days when public conveyances of all kinds were totally unknown a horse was almost a necessity and only the very poor were without one at least the price of such a horse as would be considered fit for amphillis was about thirty shillings or two pounds the offer of the archbishop therefore struck mr altham as a most generous one and his thanks were profuse accordingly have you taken any thought for her disposal inquired the prelate no in very deed replied the worthy pattymaker with some hesitation there be nigh me divers youths of good conditions that i dare be bound should be fain to wed with a maid of good lineage and decent haviour with a pretty penny in her pocket but i never brake my mind to any and here mr altham glanced at regina and received an optic telegram across the bobbinsif your grace were pleased to think of any that you had a favour for i would not in no wise stand in the way thereto methinks said the archbishop under your leave worthy master altham my cousin might look somewhat higher truly i mean not to cast scorn on any good and honest man we be all sons of adam butin a word to speak out straightway i have one in my mind that i reckon should not make an ill husband for amphillis and this is sir godfrey foljambe his squire master norman hylton that is of birth even with her and i believe a full worthy young man and well bred if it may suit with your reckoning what say you to breaking your mind to him thereupon and seeing if he be inclined to entertain the same my lord replied master altham after exchanging another telegram with his mentor in good sooth both phyllis and i are much beholden unto you and i will full gladly so do yet master altham i would desire you to be satisfied touching this young mans conditions ere you do fix your mind upon him i hear well of him from all that do know himindeed i am myself acquaint with some of his near kinwith twain of his uncles and a brotheryet i would fain have you satisfied therewith no less than myself optic telegrams would not answer this time for reginas eyes were not lifted from the lacecushion mr altham hesitated a moment murmured a few words of thanks and at last came out openly withwhat sayest sweetheart he will do was reginas answer he is good man he have clear eyes he look you in de face he pray in de chapel and not run his eyes all round he laugh and chatterpatter not wid other damsels he is sad courteous and gent he will do husband little idea had amphillis that her future was being thus settled for her downstairs as she sat in the countesss chamber tending her sick lady the countess was slowly sinking father jordan thought she might live perhaps for another month it was only a question of time perrote said that the soul was keeping the body alive the old fiery flashes of passion were never seen now she showed a little occasional irritability and petulance but usually her mood was one of listless languid weariness from which nothing aroused her and in which nothing interested her the one burning crying desire of her heart was to see her son she did not know of the fruitless application which had been already made to him still less of the renewed appeal to which no answer could be returned for some days at least her belief was that sir godfrey would not permit any message to be sent and that if he did king edward would not allow the duke who was his vassal to obey it to the least hint that the duke might or could himself decline she refused to listen so decidedly that no one had the heart to repeat it more plaintive day by day grew the dying mothers yearning moans for her bestloved child in vain perrote tried to assure her that human love was inadequate to satisfy the cravings of her immortal soul that god had made her for himself and that only when it reached and touched him could the spirit which he had given find rest i cannot hearken to thee old woman said the dying prisoner my whole soul is set on my lad and is bent to see him before i die let god grant me that and i will listen to him afteri will love the good god then i cannot rest i cannot rest without my lad the days wore on and the snows of february passed into the winds of march lady basset remained at hazelwood but her squire had not returned the countess was very weak now the archbishop of york had delayed his departure too he would answer for it he said both to his superior of canterbury and to the king in his own heart he was not satisfied with the ministrations of kindly ignorant father jordan who was very desirous to soothe the perturbed soul of the countess and had not the least idea how to do it he thought he might yet be of service to the dying princess very cautiously mr altham ventured with some trepidation to sound norman hylton as to his feelings towards amphillis notwithstanding the archbishops countenance and solid help he was sorely afraid of being snubbed and sat upon for his presumption he was therefore proportionately relieved when norman assured him he wished no better fate to overtake him but that he was unable to see how he could possibly afford to marry verily master altham i do you to wit i have but five possessions myself my raiment mine harness armour was termed harness up to the seventeenth century mine horse and my book not a yard of land have i nor look to have nor one penny in my plack further than what i earn how then can i look to keep a wife well i wot that mistress amphillis were fortune in herself to him that is so lucky as to win her but in good sooth no such thing is there as luck and i should say that hath so much favour of god seeing the wise man saith that a prudent wife is given properly of the lord yet i reckon that the wisest in the world can scarce keep him warm of a winter day by lapping him in his wisdom and the fairest and sweetest lady shall lack somewhat to eat beside her own sweetness could i see my way thereto trust me i would not say you nay but but how master hylton if she carried her pocket full of nobles ah then it were other matter i would stand to it gladly if so were well for how much look you amphillis should bring you a portion of ten pound beside her wedding gear and an horse say you so methinks we were made then could we win into some great house to serve the lord and lady thereof i cast no doubt if he had the opportunity my lords grace of york should help you at that pinch he seems full ready to do his young kinswoman all the good he may may i but see my way afore me master altham nought should make me gladder than to fulfil this your behest mr altham laid the case before the archbishop tell master hylton he need give himself not so much thought thereon as a bee should pack in his honeybag was the smiling reply i will warrant so soon as it is known in the court that i lack place for a newlywedded cousin and her husband there shall be so many warm nests laid afore me that i shall have but to pick and choose if that be all the bar to my cousins wedding i may bless it tomorrow it was evident that there was no other difficulty from the glad light in norman hyltons eyes when he was told the archbishops answer the matter was settled at once only one small item was left out considered of no momentthe brideelect knew nothing about the transaction that was a pleasure to come that it would should might or could be anything but a pleasure never occurred either to the archbishop or to mr altham they would not have belonged to their century if it had done so it was the afternoon of the ninth of march no answer had been received from the duke and perrote had almost lost hope the countess petulantly declined to allow any religious conversation in her chamber she was restless and evidently miserable perrote thought more so than merely from the longing desire to see her son but some strange and unusual reserve seemed to have come over her physically she sank day by day it would soon be hour by hour amphillis was off duty for the moment and had seated herself with her work at the window of her own room which looked into the outer court and over the walls towards derby she kept upstairs a good deal at this time there were several reasons for this she wished to be close at hand if her services were needed she had no fancy for agathas rattle andshe had not asked herself whyshe instinctively kept away from the company of norman hylton amphillis was not one of those girls who wear their hearts upon their sleeves who exhibit their injuries bodily or mental and chatter freely over them to every comer her instinct was rather that of the wounded hart to plunge into the deepest covert away from every eye but the omniscient mr and mrs altham had pursued their journey without any further communication to amphillis it was lady foljambes prerogative to make this indeed a very humble apology had to be made to her for taking the matter in any respect out of her hands this was done by the archbishop who took the whole blame upon himself and managed the delicate affair with so much grace that lady foljambe not only forgave the althams but positively felt herself flattered by his interference she would inform amphillis after the death of the countess how her future had been arranged the maiden herself in ignorance of all arrangements made or imagined was indulging in some rather despondent meditations the state of the countess whom she deeply pitied the probably near parting from perrote whom she had learned to love and another probable parting of which she would not let herself think were enough to make her heart sink she would of course go back to her uncle unless it pleased lady foljambe to recommend which meant to command her to the service of some other lady and amphillis was one of those shy intense souls for whom the thought of new faces and fresh scenes has in it more fear than hope she knew that there was just a possibility that lady foljambe might put her into ricardas place which she had not yet filled up three or four different negotiations to that end having failed to effect it and either this or a return to her uncle was the secret hope of her heart she highly respected and liked her new aunt regina and her uncle robert was the only one of her relatives on the mothers side whom she loved at all yet the prospect of a return to london was shadowed by the remembrance of alexandra who had ever been to amphillis a worry and a terror as amphillis sat by the window she now and then lifted her head to look out for a moment and she did so now hearing the faint ring of a horn in the distance her eyes lighted on a party of horsemen who were coming up the valley they were too far away to discern details but she saw some distant flashes as if something brilliant caught the sunlight and also as she imagined the folds of a banner floating was it a party of visitors coming to the manor or more likely a group of travellers on their way to chesterfield from derby or was itoh was it possiblethe duke of bretagne amphilliss embroidery dropped on the rushes at her feet as she sprang up and watched the progress of the travellers she was pretty sure presently that the banner was white then that some of the travellers were armed then that they were making for hazelwood and at last that the foremost knight of the group wore a helmet royally encircled she hardly dared to breathe when the banner at last showed its blazon as pure ermine and it scarcely needed the cry of notre dame de gwengamp to make amphillis rush to the opposite room beckon perrote out of it and say to her in breathless ecstasy the duke o mistress perrote the lord duke is it so said perrote only a little less agitated than amphillis is it surely he may it not be a messenger only i think not so there is an ermine pennon and the foremost knight hath a circlet on his helm pray god it so be phyllis i will go down anon and see how matters be go thou into our ladys chambershe slept but nowand if she wake mind thou say not a word to her hereupon if it be in very deed my lord duke i will return with no delay but if she ask parry her inquirations as best thou mayest amphillis knew in her heart that she was an exceedingly bad hand at that business but she was accustomed to do as she was told and accordingly she said no more she was relieved to find the countess asleep the cry for admission not having been loud enough to wake her she sat down and waited perrote meanwhile had gone down into the hall where lady foljambe sat at work with agatha sir godfrey was seated before the fire at which he pointed a pair of very straight and very lengthy legs his hands were in his pockets and his look conveyed neither contentment nor benevolence in a recess of the window sat young matthew whistling softly to himself as he stroked a hawk upon his gloved wrist while his brother godfrey stood at another window looking out with his arms upon the sill the only person who noticed perrotes entrance was agatha and she pulled a little face by way of relief to her feelings lady foljambe worked on in silence sir said perrote addressing herself to the master of the house phyllis tells me a party be making hither that she hath seen from the window and under your good pleasure i reckon from what the maid saw that it be my lords grace of bretagne and his meynie sir godfrey struggled to his feet with an exclamation of surprise his elder son turned round from the window the younger said ha jolife now gille go on thy perch sweet heart and set the falcon on its perch agathas work went down in a moment lady foljambe alone seemed insensible to the news at the same moment the great doors at the end of the hall were flung open and the seneschal with a low bow to his master and mistress cried room for the dukes grace of brittany as the new arrivals entered the hall lady basset came in from the opposite end the duke a fine rather sternlooking man strode forward until he reached the dais where the family sat and then doffing his crowned helmet addressed himself to sir godfrey foljambe sir i give you good even king edward your lord greets you by me and bids you give good heed to that which you shall find herein at a motion from the duke quick and peremptory one of his knights stepped forth and delivered the royal letter sir godfrey took it into his hands with a low reverence and bade his seneschal fetch father jordan without whose assistance it was impossible for him to ascertain his sovereigns bidding father jordan hastened in cut the silken string and read the letter messireour will and pleasure is that you shall entertain in your manor of hazelwood for such time as shall be his pleasure our very dear and wellbeloved son john duke of brittany and count de montfort neither letting nor deferring the said duke from intercourse with our prisoner his mother margaret duchess of brittany but shall suffer him to speak with her at his will and for so doing this shall be your warrant by the king at our castle of winchester the morrow of saint romanus lady foljambe turned to the duke and inquired when it would be his pleasure to speak with the prisoner when her physician counts it meet said he with a slight movement of his shapely shoulders which did not augur much gratification at the prospect before him by my faith had not king edward my father insisted thereon then had i never come on so idle a journey when i looked every morrow for news from bretagne bidding me most likely thither to trot over half england for an old dames diversion were enough to try the patience of any knight on earth i shall not tarry long here i do ensure you his highness bidding fulfilled and i trust your physician shall not long tarry me sir godfrey and lady foljambe were full of expressions of sympathy lady basset came forward and spoke in a slightly cynical tone good morrow my lord said she to her brother you came not to see me i think more in especial as i shall one of these days be an old woman when your graces regard for me shall perish father jordan i pray you let it not be long ere you give leave for this loving son to have speech of his mother twere pity he should break his heart by tarrying father jordan nervously intimated that if the countess were not asleep he saw no reason why his graces visit should be delayed at all nay but under your leave my good host i will eat first said the duke were it but to strengthen me for the ordeal which waiteth me lady foljambe disappeared at once on hospitable thoughts intent and sir godfrey was profuse in apologies that the suggestion should have needed to come from the duke but the only person in the hall who except his sister was not afraid of the duke stepped forth and spoke her mind chapter seventeen satisfied at last i am not eager bold nor strongall that is past im ready not to do at lastat last my halfdays work is done and this is all my part i give a patient god my patient heart and grasp his banner still though all its blue be dim these stripes no less than stars lead after him fair lord said perrote de carhaix in the native tongue of both herself and the duke i am your old nurse who held you in her arms as a babe and who taught your infant lips to speak i taught you the ten commandments of god have you forgotten them or do you call such words as you have spoken honouring your mother is this the reward you pay her for her motherlove for her thousand anxieties for her risked life if it be so god pardon you as he may but when you too reach that point which is the common lot of all humanitywhen you too lie awaiting the dread summons of the inevitable angel who shall lead you either into the eternal darkness or the everlasting light beware lest your dearest turn away from you and act by you as you have done by her the dukes black eyes shot forth fire he was an exceedingly passionate man mademoiselle de carhaix do you know that you are my subject i am aware of it my lord and that i could order your head struck off in yonder court you could if yonder court were in bretagne in the realm of another sovereign i scarcely think so under your gracious pleasure but do you suppose i should be silent for that when god puts his words into the lips of his messengers they must speak them out whatever the result may be mademoiselle considers herself then an inspired prophetess was the contemptuous response the lord put his words once into the mouth of an ass replied perrote meekly i think i may claim to be an asss equal i have spoken fair lord and i shall add no more the responsibility lies now with you my message is delivered and i pray god to give you ears to hear sir godfrey foljambe is this the manner in which you think it meet that one of your household should address a prince most gracious lord i am deeply distressed that this gentlewoman should so far have forgotten herself but i humbly pray your grace to remember that she is but a woman and women have small wit and much spitefulness in good sooth i have need to remember it answered the duke wrathfully i never thought when i put myself to the pains to journey over half england to satisfy the fancies of a sick woman that i was to be received with insult and contumely after this fashion i pray you to send this creature out of my sight as the least reparation that can be offered for such an injury you need not sir was the immediate reply of perrote i go for mine errand is done and for the rest may god judge between us and he will the duke sat down to the collation hastily spread before him with the air of an exceedingly injured man he would not have been quite so angry if his own conscience had not been so provoking as to second every word of perrotes reprimand and as it is never of the least use for a man to quarrel with his conscience he could do nothing but make perrote the scapegoat unless indeed he had possessed sufficient grace and humility to accept and profit by the rebukewhich in his eyes was completely out of the question had the archbishop of york been the speaker he might possibly have condescended so far but the whims of an old nursea subjecta womanhe told himself must needs be utterly beneath the notice of any one so exalted the excellence of the medicine offered him could not even be considered if it were presented in a vessel of common pottery chipped at the edges notwithstanding his wrath the duke did sufficient justice to the collation and he then demanded if it must be to be taken to his mother at once the sooner the ordeal was over the better and he did not mean to remain at hazelwood an hour longer than could be helped lady foljambe went up to prepare the countess for the interview in her chamber she found not only amphillis who was on duty but the archbishop also he sat by the bed with the book of the gospels in his handsa latin version of coursefrom which he had been translating a passage to the invalid well what now avena faintly asked the countess who read news in lady foljambes face there was no time to break it very gradually for lady foljambe knew that the dukes impatience would not brook delay dame she said shortly my lord your son bring him in cried the countess in a voice of ecstasy without allowing lady foljambe to finish her sentence how it was to end she seemed to have no doubt and the sudden joy lent a fictitious strength to her enfeebled frame bring him in my jean my darling my little lad said i not the lad should never forsake his old mother bring him in lady foljambe drew back to allow the duke to enter for his step was already audible he came in and stood by the bedtall upright silent my jean cried the dying mother madame was the answer decorous and icy kiss me my jean why dost thou not kiss me lad i have not seen thee all these weary years the duke in a very proper manner kissed the weak old hand which was stretched out towards him his lips were warm but his kiss was as cold as a kiss well could be madame said the duke mindful of the proprieties it gives me indescribable grief to find you thus i am also deeply distressed that it should be impossible for me to remain with you i expect news from bretagne every dayalmost every hourwhich i hope will summon me back thither to triumph over my rebellious subjects and to resume my throne in victory you will therefore grant me excuse if it be impossible for me to do more than kiss your hand and entreat your blessing not stay my jean she said in piteous accents not stay when thou hast come so far to see me dost thou know that i am dying madame i am infinitely grieved to perceive it but reasons of state are imperative and paramount my lord will pardon me for observing said the archbishops voice with a royal kinsman of his own that god may grant him many kingdoms but he can never have but one mother the dukes answer was in his haughtiest manner i assure you of my regret holy father necessity has no law and no compassion jean my jean only one minute moreone minute cannot be of importance my little lad my bestloved lay thy lips to mine and say thou lovest thine old mother and let me bless thee and then go if it must be and i will die amphillis wondered that the piteous passion of love in the tones of the poor mother did not break down entirely the haughty coldness of the royal son the duke did indeed bend his stately knee and touch his mothers lips with his but there was no shadow of response to her clinging clasp no warmth however faint in the kiss into which she poured her whole heart jean little jean say thou lovest me madame it is a sons duty i pray your blessing i bless thee with my whole heart she said i pray god bless thee in every hour of thy life grant thee health happiness and victory and crown thee at last with everlasting bliss now go my dear heart the old mother will not keep thee to thy hurt god be with thee and bless thee even then he did not linger he did not even give her unsolicited one last kiss she raised herself on one side to look after him and listen to him to the latest moment the light still beaming in her sunken eyes his parting words were not addressed to her but she heard them now then du chatel said the duke to his squire in the corridor let us waste no more time this irksome duty done i would be away immediately lest i be called back the light died out of the eager eyes and the old white head sank back upon the pillow the face turned away from the watchers amphillis approached her and tenderly smoothed the satin coverlet let be she said in a low voice my heart is broken amphillis who could scarcely restrain her own sobs glanced at the archbishop for direction he answered her by pressing a finger on his lips perrote came in her lips set and her brows drawn she had evidently overheard those significant words then they heard the tramp of the horses in the courtyard the sound of the trumpet the cry of notre dame de gwengamp and they knew that the duke was departing they did not know however that the parting guest was sped by a few exceedingly scathing words from his sister who had heard his remark to the squire she informed him in conclusion that he could strike off her head if he had no compunction in staining his spotless ermine banner with his own kindly blood it would make very little difference to her and judging by the way in which he used his dying mother she was sure it could make none to him the duke flung himself into his saddle and dashed off down the slope from the gate without deigning either a response or a farewell as the archbishop left the countesss chamber he beckoned amphillis into the corridor i tarry not said he for i can work no good now this is not the time a stricken heart hath none ears leave her be and leave her to god i go to pray him to speak to her that comfort which she may receive alone from him none other can do her any help tomorrow maybewhen the vexed brain hath slept and gentle time hath somewhat dulled the first sharp edge of her cruel sorrowthen i may speak and be heard but now she is in that valley of the shadow where no voice can reach her save that which once said lazarus come forth and which the dead shall hear in their graves at the last day god comfort her poor lady said amphillis ay god comfort her and the archbishop passed on he made no further attempt to enter the invalid chamber until the evening of the next day when he came in very softly after a word with perroteno part of any house was ever closed against a priestand sat down by the sufferer she lay much as he had left her he offered no greeting but took out his evangelistarium from the pocket of his cassock and began to read in a low calm voice the spirit of the lord is upon me for he hath anointed me he hath sent me to evangelise the poor to heal the contrite in heart to preach liberty to the captives and sight to the blind to set the bruised at liberty to preach the acceptable year of the lord and the day of retribution luke four verses vulgate version there was no sound in answer the archbishop turned over a few leaves come unto me all ye that labour and are heavyladen and i will refresh you matthew nine verse and god shall dry all tears from their eyes and there shall be no more death nor sorrow nor clamour nor shall there be any more pain revelations twentyone verse trouble not your heart believe in god and believe in me peace i bequeath to you my peace i give to you not as the world giveth give i to you trouble not your heart neither be it afraid john fourteen verses whom the lord loveth he chastiseth and whippeth also every son whom he receiveth hebrews twelve verse he read or quoted from memory as passages occurred to him when he had reached this point he made a pause a deep sigh answered him but no words and he looked round about on them which sat about him and said behold my mother and my brethren for whosoever shall do the will of god the same is my brother and my sister and mother i dare say he kissed his mother said the low plaintive voice she evidently knew of whom the reader spoke the world giveth not much peace heavyladen ay heavyladen thou hast removed from me friend and neighbour i have lost my liberty and i am losing my life and nowgod have mercy on mei have lost my son dame will you take for your son the lord that died for you he offers himself to you the same is my mother he will give you not love only but a sons love and that warm and undying with perpetual charity i delighted in thee he saith wherefore pitying i drew thee to me oh my daughter let him draw thee what you will father was the low answer i have no bodily strength pray you make not the penance heavier than i can do elsewise what you will my will is broken nothing matters any more now i scarce thought it should have so beenat the end howbeit gods will be done it must be done my daughter this is the will of god your sanctification the end and object of all penances of all prayers is that you may be joined to christ for he is our peace and we are in him complete in him not in your penances nor in yourself if so were that my lord basset had done you grievous wrong it might be you forgave him fully not for anything in him but only because he is one with your own daughter and you could not strike him without smiting her his dishonour is her dishonour his peace is her peace to punish him were to punish her so is it with the soul that is joined to christ if he be exalted it must be exalted if it be rejected he is rejected also and god cannot reject his own son the archbishop was not at all sure that the countess was listening to him she kept her face turned away he rose and wished her good evening the medicine must not be administered in an overdose or it might work more harm than good he came again on the following evening and gave her a little more for three days after he pursued the same course and further than courtesy demanded he was not answered a word on the fourth night he found the face turned a pitiful face whose aspect went to his heartwan white haggard unutterably pathetic that night he read the fourteenth chapter of saint johns gospel and added few words of his own on leaving her he said my daughter god is more pitiful than men and his love is better than theirs it had need be so were the only words that replied in the corridor he met father jordan the archbishop stopped how fareth she in the body as ill as she may be and live her life is counted by hours the archbishop stood at the large oriel of stained glass at the end of the corridor looking out on the spring eveningthe buds just beginning to break the softened gold of the western sky his heart was very full o father of the everlasting age he said aloud all things are possible unto thee and thou hast eternity to work in suffer not this burdened heart to depart ere thou hast healed it with thine eternal peace grant thy rest to the heavyladen thy mercy to her on whom man hath had so little mercy was it not for this thou earnest o saviour of the world good shepherd wilt thou not go after this lost sheep until thou find it the next night the silence was broken father she said tell me if i err it looks to me from the words you read as if our lord lacketh not penances and prayers and good works he only wants me and that by reason that he loveth me and why all this weary life hath been mine he knoweth and i am content to leave it so if only he will take me up in his arms as the shepherd doth the sheep and will suffer me to rest my weariness there do i err father my daughter you accept the gospel of gods peace this it is to come to him and he shall give you rest the work was done the proud spirit had stooped to the yoke the bitter truth against which she had so long fought and struggled was accepted at the pierced hands which wounded her only for her healing that night she called lady basset to her my little girl my jeanne she said i was too hard on thee i loved thy brother the best and i defrauded thee of the love which was thy due and now thou hast come forty miles to close mine eyes and he turneth away and will have none of me jeanette darling take my dying blessing and may god deal with thee as thou hast dealt by the old mother and pay thee back an hundredfold the love thou hast given me kiss me sweet heart and forgive me the past two days later the long journey by the way of the wilderness was over on the th of march perrote folded the aged wasted hands upon the now quiet breast all was ended now the hope and the fear and the sorrow all the aching of heart the restless unsatisfied longing all the dull deep pain and the constant anguish of patience and as she pressed once more the lifeless head to her bosom meekly she bowed her own and murmured father i thank thee the fate which had harassed poor marguerite in life pursued her to the very grave there was no sumptuous funeral no solemn hearse no regal banners of arms for her had there been any such thing it would have left its trace on the wardrobe rolls of the year there was not even a court mourning it was usual then for the funerals of royal persons to be deferred for months after the death in order to make the ceremony more magnificent but now in the twilight of the second evening which was monday a quiet procession came silently across from the manor house to the church headed by father jordan twelve poor men bore torches beside the bier the mass for the dead was softly sung and those beautiful pathetic words which for ages rose beside the waiting coffin king of awful majesty by thy mercy full and free fount of mercy pardon me think o saviour in what way on thine head my trespass lay let me not be lost that day thou wert weary seeking me on thy cross thou madst me free lose not all thine agony then they prayed for her everlasting restnot joy the thought of active bliss could hardly be associated with that weary soul jesus grant her thine eternal rest and the villagers crept round with bared heads and whispered to one another that they were burying the white ladythat mysterious prisoner whom no one ever saw who never came to church nor set foot outside the walls of her prison and they dimly guessed some thousandth part of the past pathos of that shadowed life and they joined in the amen and over her grave were set up no sculptured figure and table tomb only one slab of pure white marble carved with a cross and beneath it the sole epitaph of marguerite of flanders the heroine of hennebonmercy jesu so they left her to her rest ten years later in a quiet manor house near furness abbey a knights wife was telling a story to her three little girls and you called me after her mother said little fairhaired margaret but what became of the naughty man who didnt want to come and see his poor mother when she was so sick and unhappy mother asked compassionate little regina naughty man echoed baby perrotine lady hylton stroked her little margarets hair he led not a happy life my darlings but we will not talk about him ay little meg i called thee after the poor white lady i pray god thou mayest give thine heart to him earlier than she did and not have to walk with weary feet along her wilderness way let us thank god for our happy life and love each other as much as we can a hand which she had not known was there was laid upon her head thinkest thou we can do that my phyllis any better than now asked sir norman hylton we can all try said amphillis softly and god our god shall bless us appendix marguerite of flanders countess of montfort was the only daughter of loys de nevers eldest surviving son of robert the first count of flanders who predeceased his father and of marie or jeanne daughter of the count de rethel she had one brother count loys the first of flanders who fell at crecy many modern writers call her jeanne but her name in the contemporary public records of england is invariably margareta her birth probably took place about and it may have been about that she married jean of bretagne count de montfort a younger son of duke arthur the second duke arthur the son of beatrice of england had been twice marriedto marie of limoges and violette of dreux countess of montfort in her own right with other issue who are not concerned in the story he had by marie two sons duke jean the third and guyon and by violette one jean count of montfort the husband of marguerite on the childless death of jean the third in a war of succession arose between the daughter of his deceased brother guyon and his halfbrother the count of montfort the daughter jeanne la boiteuse claimed the right to represent her father guyon while montfort stood by the law of nonrepresentation according to which no deceased prince could be represented by his child and the younger brother even by the halfblood was considered a nearer relative than the child of the elder the king of france took the part of jeanne and her husband charles de blois he captured the count of montfort and imprisoned him in the louvre the countess marguerite who had the heart of a lion thenceforth carried on the war on behalf of her husband and son in the spring of she obtained the help of king edward the third of england which however was fitfully rendered as he took either side in turn to suit his own convenience some account of her famous exploits is given in the story and is familiar to every reader of froissarts chronicle shortly after this the countess brought her son to england and betrothed him to the kings infant daughter mary but she soon returned to bretagne in the count of montfort escaped from his prison in the disguise of a pedlar and arrived in england but the king was not at that time disposed to assist him and montfort took the refusal so much to heart thatprobably combined with already failing healthit killed him in the following september when the war was reopened the countess took captive her rival charles de blois and brought him to england the king appointed her residence in tickhill castle granting the very small sum of pounds per annum for her expenses there or wherever we may order her to be taken while she remains in our custody patent roll edward the third part it is evident that while treated overtly as a guest the countess was in reality a prisoner a fact yet more forcibly shown by an entry in december recording the payment of shillings expenses to john burdon for his journey to tickhill to bring up to london the duchess of bretagne and the knight who ran away with her this seems to have been an attempt to free the prisoner to whom as the upholder of her husbands claim on the throne of bretagne the king of course accorded the title of duchess the testimony of the records henceforward is at variance with that of the chroniclers the latter representing marguerite as making sundry journeys to bretagne in company with her son and others and as being to all intents at liberty the rolls on the contrary when she is named invariably speak of her as a prisoner in tickhill castle in keeping of sir john delves and after his death of his widow isabel that the rolls are the superior authority there can be no question the imprisonment of charles de blois was very severe he offered a heavy ransom and his two elder sons as hostages king edward demanded deniers and afterwards gold florins in charles was released his sons jean and guyon taking his place they were confined first in nottingham castle and in were removed to devizes where guyon died about christmas in edward and charles agreed on a treaty which jeanne refused to ratify alleging that she would lose her life or two if she had them rather than relinquish her claims to young montfort two years later charles was killed at the battle of auray and jeanne thereon accepted a settlement which made montfort duke of bretagne reserving to herself the county of penthievre the city of limoges and a sum of ten thousand livres tournois the only authority hitherto discovered giving any hint of the history of marguerite after this date is a contemporary romance le roman de la comtesse de montfort which states that she retired to the castle of lucinio near vannes and passed the rest of her life in tranquillity even mrs everett green in her lives of the princesses of england accepted this as a satisfactory conclusion it was indeed the only one known but two entries on the public records of england entirely dissipate this comfortable illusion on th september the patent roll states that we allowed pounds per annum to john delves for the keeping of the noble lady the duchess of bretagne and we now grant to isabel his widow for so long a time as the said duchess shall be in her keeping the custody of the manor of

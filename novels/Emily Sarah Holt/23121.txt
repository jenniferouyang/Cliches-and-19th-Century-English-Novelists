our little ladysix hundred years ago by emily sarah holt this is one of the approximately thirty books by emily holt about life in the middle ages the language of the book is basically english as we would understand it strongly flavoured with words and phrases from the middle ages the other thing that comes across strongly is how different the attitudes to life were in those days avice one of the elder women in the book tells the story of how she had become a nurserymaid in the royal palace first at windsor and then later at westminster one of the princesses she had to look after was a most beautiful child but had been born deaf and dumb she had various gestures with which she communicated but the sadness was that they never could teach her to pray yet they were sure she spoke to christ in her own way the poor child died young this all took place at the end of the thirteenth century hence the six hundred years of the title our little lady six hundred years ago by emily sarah holt chapter one six hundred years agowhat things were like the afternoon service was over in lincoln cathedral and the congregation were slowly filing out of the great west door but that afternoon service was six hundred years ago and both the cathedral and the congregation would look very strange to us if we saw them now those days were well called the dark ages and how dark they were we can scarcely realise in the present day let us fancy ourselves coming out of that west door and try to picture what we should have seen there six hundred years ago the cathedral itself is hardly to be known it is crowded with painted images and embroidered banners and filled with the smoke and scent of burning incense the clergy are habited not in white surplices or in black gowns but in large stiff cloakscopes they are calledof scarlet silk heavy with gold embroidery the bishop who is in the pulpit wears a cope of white thick with masses of gold and on his head is a white and gold mitre how unlike that upper chamber where the disciples gathered together after the crucifixion of their master is it better or worse do you ask well i think if the master were to come in it would be easier to see him in the quiet upper chamber where there was nothing else to see than in the perfumed and decorated cathedral where there was so much else but now let us look at the congregation as they pass out are they all women for all alike seem to wear long skirts and thick hoods there are neither trousers nor hats nor bonnets no there is a fair sprinkling of men but men and women dressed more alike then than they do now you will see if you look that some of these long skirts are open in front and you may catch a glimpse of a beard here and there under the hood this is a poor woman who comes now she wears a serge dress which has cost her about threehalfpence a yard and a threadbare hood for which she may have given sixpence are things so cheap then no just the other way about money is so dear the wages of a mason or a bricklayer are about sixpence a week haymakers have the same reapers get from a shilling to halfacrown and mowers one and ninepence the gentlemen who wait on the king himself only receive a shilling a day here comes one of them in a long green robe of shining silky stuff which is called samite round his neck is a curiously cut collar of dark red cloth and in his hand he carries a white hood men do not confine themselves to the quiet sober colours that we are accustomed to see they are smarter than the ladies themselves this knight as he passes out throws his gown back before mounting his horse and you see his yellow hose striped with blacktrousers and stockings all in a piece as it werewith low black shoes and gilt spurs but who follows himthis superbly dressed woman in rich blue glistening samite with a black and gold hood under which we see her hair bound with a golden fillet and a necklace of costly pearls clasped round her throatfor it is a warm day and she has not tied her hood she must be somebody of consequence for a smart gentleman leads her by the hand and one with a long staff walks in front to keep the people from pressing too close on her she is indeed somebody of consequence the countess of lincoln herself by birth an italian princess and she is so grand and so rich and so beautiful and statelyand i am sorry to add so proudthat people call her the queen of lincoln she has not far to go homeonly through the archway and past saint michaels church and the bull gate and then the great portcullis of the grim old castle lifts its head to receive its lady and she disappears from our sight do you notice that carpets are spread along the streets for hernot carpets like ours but the only sort they have which are a kind of rough matting and indeed she needs them if those purple velvet shoes of hers are not to be quite ruined by the time she reaches home for there are no pavements and the streets are almost ankledeep in mud and worse than mud dead cats rotten vegetables animal refuse and every kind of abominable thing that you could see or think of all lie about in heaps in these narrow narrow streets where the sun can hardly get down to the ground and two people might sometimes shake hands from opposite windows in the upper stories for they come farther out than the lower ones everybody throws all his rubbish into the street all his slops all his ashes all his everything of which he wants to get rid the smells are something dreadful as soon as you come out of the perfumed churches it is pleasanter to have the churches perfumed undoubtedly but it would be a good deal healthier if they kept the streets clean quietly following the grand young countess at a respectful distance come two women who are evidently mother and daughter their dress shows that they are not absolutely poor but it tells at least as plainly that they are not at all rich just as they reach the west door a little girl of ten comes quickly after them dressed just like themselves a woman in miniature why avice where hast thou been says the elder of the two women i was coming grandmother explains little avice and father thomas called me and bade me tell you that the holy bishop would come to see you this afternoon and sup his fourhours with you fourhours taken as its name shows at four oclock was the meal which answered to our tea bishops do not often drink tea with women of this class but this was a peculiar bishop and the woman to whom he sent this message was his own fostersister truly and i shall be glad to see him says the grandmother and on they go out of the west door the carpets which were spread for the countess have been rolled away and our three humble friends pick their steps as best they may among the dirtheaps occasionally slipping into a puddlei am afraid avice now and then walks into it deliberately for the fun of the splashand following the road taken by the countess as far as the bull gate they then turn to the left leaving the frowning castle on their right and begin to descend the steep slope well named steephill they have not gone many yards when two people overtake thema man and a woman the man stops to speak the woman marches on with her arms folded and her head in the air as if they were invisible good morrow dan says the old lady good morrow mother answers dan whats the matter with filomena a touch of the old complaint thats all answers dan drily wed a few words o th road acomingleastwise she had for she got it pretty much to herselfand for th next twelve hours or so shell not be able to see anybody under a squire is she often like that dan well it doesnt come more days than seven i th week why you dont mean to say its so every day said agnes the younger woman of our trio dan shook his head happen theres an odd un now and then as gets let off said he but i must after her or therell be more hot water and it comes to table boilin i can tell you good morrow dan runs rather heavily after his incensed spouse and our friends continue to pick their way down steephill for rather more than half the way they go and when just past the church of saint lawrence they turn into a narrow street on the left and in a few yards more they are at home home is one of the smallest houses you ever saw it has only two rooms one above the other but they are a fair size being about twentyfive feet by sixteen the upper of course is the bedroom the lower one is kitchen and parlour and a ladder leads from one to the other the upper chamber holds a bed which is like a box out of which the bottom has been taken filled with straw and on that is a hard straw mattress two excessively coarse blankets and a thick shaggy woollen rug for a counterpane there are not any sheets or pillowcases but a thick hard bolster stuffed like the mattress with straw serves for a pillow at the foot of the oak bedstead is a large oak chest big enough to hold a man in which the owners keep all their small property of any value there are no chairs but the deep windows have wooden seats and two wooden stools are in the corners as to wardrobes chests of drawers dressingtables and washstands nobody knows of such things at that day the chest serves the purpose of all except the washstand and they find that as much as they have of it at the drawwell in the little back yard the window is just a square hole in the wall closed with a wooden shutter so that light and airif not wind and raincome in together a lookingglass they have but a poor makeshift it is being of metal and rounded and those who know what a comical aspect your face takes when you see it in a metal teapot can guess how far anybody could see himself rightly in it it is nailed up too so high on the wall that it is not easy to see anything this is all the furniture of the bedroom downstairs there is more though there are no chairs and tables unless a leaftable in the wall which lets down can go by that name there are two or three long settles stretching across the wallthe settle was called a bench when it had a back to it and a form if it had not there is a large bakestone in one corner the bread is put on the top to bake with the fire underneath and when there is no fire the top can be used as a table a moulding board or in many other ways but it must not be supposed that such bread is in large square or cottage loaves like ours it is made in flat cakes large or small thick or thin by the side of the bakestone is the sink or rather that which answers to one being a rough brick basin with a plug in the bottom and just beneath it is a little channel in the brick floor by which when the plug is pulled up the dirty water finds its way out into the street under the house door people who live in this way needand wearshort gowns and stout shoes the opposite corner holds the pinetorches and chips they burn nothing but wood for though coal is known it is very little used this is partly because it is expensive but also because it is considered shockingly unhealthy the smoke from wood or turf is thought very wholesome but that from coal is just the reverse opposite the bakestone is the window a very little one much wider than it is high and rilled with exceedingly small diamondshaped panes of very poor greenish glass set in lead there being so much lead and so little glass that the room is but dark in the brightest sunshine indeed it is decidedly a sign of gentility that the house has any window at all beyond the square hole with the wooden shutter up and down the room there are several stools high and low the high ones serve when wanted as little movable tables in the third corner is a breadrack filled with hard oatcake above and the soft flat cakes of wheat flour below in the fourth stand several large barrels containing salt fish salt meat flour meal and ale from the top of the room hang hams herbs in canvas bags strings of smoked fish a few empty baskets and pails and anything else which can be hung up the rafters are so low that when the inmates move about they have every now and then to courtesy to a ham or a pail which would otherwise hit them on the head a door by the window leads into the street and another beyond the barrels gives access to the back yard how would you like to go back gentle reader to this style of life this was the way in which your forefathers lived six hundred years agounless they were very grand people indeed then they lived in a big castle with walls two or three feet thick and ate from gold or silver plates and had the luxury of a chimney in their diningrooms but even then there were a good many little matters in respect of which i do not fancy you would quite like to change with them would you like to eat with your fingers and to find creeping creatures everywhere and to have no books and newspapers and no letters and no shops except in great towns and no way of getting about except on foot or horseback and no lamps candles clocks or watches china spectacles nor carpets on the floor yet this was the way in which kings and queens lived six hundred years ago in respect of clothes people were much better off they dressed far more warmly than we do and used a great deal of fur not only for trimming or outdoor wear but to line their clothes in winter but their furs comprised much commoner and cheaper skins than we use ordinary people wore lambskins with the fur of cats hares and squirrels such furs as ermine and miniver were kept for the great people for there were curious rules and laws about dress in those days it was not as it is now a question of what you could afford to buy but of what rank you were you could not wear ermine or samite unless you were an earl at the lowest nor must you sleep on a feather bed unless you were a knight nor might you eat your dinner from a metal plate if you were not a gentleman such notions may sound ridiculous to us but they were serious earnest six hundred years ago we should not like to find that we had to go before a magistrate and pay a fine if our shoes were a trifle too long or our trimmings an inch too wide but in the time of which i am writing this was an everyday affair in the house women wore an odd sort of headdress called a wimple which came down to the eyebrows and was fastened by pins above the ears when they went out of doors they tied on a fur or woollen hood above it the gown was very loose and had no particular waist the sleeves were excessively wide and long but when women were at work they had a way of tucking up their dresses at the bottom so as to keep them out of the perpetual slop of the stone or brick floor rich people put rushes on their floors except in winter and as these were only moved once a year all manner of unspeakable abominations were harboured underneath in this respect the poor were the best off since they could have their brick floors as clean as they chose as even yet there are points in which they have the advantage of richer peopleif they only knew it but our picture is not quite finished yet look out of the little window and notice what you see can this be sunday afternoon in a good street for every shop is open and in the doorways stand young men calling out to the passersby to come in and look at their goods what lack you what lack you cherry ripe buy my fine kerchiefs any thimbles would you maids such cries as these ring on every side yes it is sunday afternoonthe rest of the holy sabbath unto the lord but look where you will you can see no rest everywhere the rich are at play and the poor are at work what does this mean think seriously of it friends for it will be no light matter if england return to such ways as these again and there are plenty of people who are trying to bring them back what it means is that if holiness be lost from the sabbath rest will never stay behind play for the few means work for the many and let play get its head in and work will soon follow if you want to walk the road of happiness and to arrive at the home of heaven you must follow after god for any other guide will lead in the opposite direction the people who tell you that religion is a gloomy thing are always the people who have not any themselves and things are very different according to whether you look at them from inside or outside how can you tell what there may be inside a house so long as all you know of it is walking past a shut door ever since adam hid himself from the presence of the lord god among the trees of the garden men and women have been prone to fancy that god likes best to see them unhappy the old heathen always used to suppose that their gods were jealous of them and they were afraid to be too happy lest the gods should be vexed but the real god takes pleasure in the prosperity of his people and godliness hath the promise of the life that now is as well as of that which is to come what language are our three friends talking it sounds very odd it is english and yet it is not yes it is what learned men call middle englishbecause it stands midway between the very oldest english or anglosaxon and the modern english which we speak now it is about as much like our english as broad scotch is a few words and expressions through the story will give an idea how different it is but if i were to write exactly as they would have spoken nobody would understand it now and how do they live inside this tiny house well in some respects in a poorer and meaner way than the very poorest would live now look up and you will see that there is no chimney but the smoke finds its way out through a hole above the fire and when it is wet the rain comes in and puts the fire out they know nothing about candles but burn long shafts of pinewood instead there are such things as wax candles indeed but they are only used in church nobody dreams of burning them in houses and there are lamps but they are made of gold and silver and are never seen except in the big castles there is no crockery and metal plates as i said are only for the grand people the middle classes use wooden trenchersour friends have twohollowed out to keep the gravy in and the poor have no plates at all beyond a cake of bread their drinkingglasses are just cows horns with the tip cut off and a wooden bottom put in they have also a few wooden bowls and one precious brass pot half a dozen knives rough unwieldy things and four wooden spoons one horn spoon is kept for best forks oh dear no nobody knows anything about forks except a pitchfork tablelinen no nor bodylinen those luxuries are only in the big castles let us watch avices mother as she sets the table for fourhours remembering that they are going to have company and therefore will try to make things a little more comfortable than usual in the first place there will be a table to set if they were alone they would use one or two of the high stools but agnes goes out into the little yard and brings back two boards and a couple of trestles which she sets up in the middle of the room this is the tablerather a rickety affair you may say and it will be quite as well that nobody should lean his elbow on it next she puts on the boards four of the cows horns and the two trenchers with one bowl she then serves out a knife and spoon for each of four people putting the horn spoon for the bishop her preparations are now complete with the addition of one thing which is never forgottena very large wooden saltcellar which she puts almost at one end for where that stands is a matter of importance great peopleand the bishop is a very great personmust sit above the salt and small insignificant folks are put below we may also notice that the bishop is honoured with a horn and a trencher to himself this is an unusual distinction husband and wife always share the same plate and other relatives very frequently as to avice we see that nothing is set for her the child will share her mothers spoon and horn and if the bishop brings his chaplain he will have a spoon and horn for himself but will eat off the grandmothers plate our picture is finished and now the story may begin chapter two how things changed open the door avice quick said agnes as a rap came upon it yonder methinks must be the holy bishop avice ran to the door and opened it to find two priests standing on the threshold they entered the foremost with a smile to the child after which he held up his hand saying christ save all here then he held out his hand which both agnes and her mother kissed and sat down on one of the forms by the table every priest was then looked upon as a most holy person some of them were a long way from holiness but there were some who really deserved the title and few deserved it so well as robert copley bishop of lincoln whom according to the fashion of that day people called grosteste or greathead for surnames were then only just beginning to grow and very few people had themi mean very few had received any from their fathers they had therefore to bear some name given to them sometimes a man was named from his fatherhe was robert johnson or john wilson sometimes it was from his trade he was robert the smith or john the carter sometimes it was from the place where he lived he was robert at the mill or john by the brook but sometimes it was from something about himself either as concerned his person or his ways he was robert rednose or john whitehood or william turnagain this is the way in which all surnames have grown now as bishop copleys soul lodged well as queen elizabeth said of lord bacon in a large head and massive brow people took to calling him greathead or grosteste and it is as bishop grosteste not as bishop copley that he has been known down to the present day i have said that he was a peculiar man he was much more peculiar at the time when he lived than he would have been if he had lived now saint peter told bishops that they were not to be lords over gods heritage but to be ensamples to the flock but when bishop grosteste lived most bishops were very great lords and very poor examples bishops and clergymen too were fond of going about in gay clothes of all colours playing at games and even drinking at alehouses many of them were positively not respectable men but bishop grosteste and his chaplain were dressed in plain black and they were of the few who walk not according to the course of this world to them i like was of no moment and i ought was of great importance and what other people would say or what other people might be going to do was a matter of no consequence whatever such men are scarce in this followmyleader world if you are so fortunate as to be related to one of them take care you make much of him for you may go a long way before you see another with most people i like comes up at the top and what will people say comes next and often pretty near but what does god tell me to do is a long way off and sometimes so far off that they never come to it at all bishop grosteste lived in one of the darkest days of christianity thick dense ignorance of all kinds overwhelmed the masses of the people books were worth their weight in gold there were so few of them and still worse very few could read them when we know that there was a law by which a man who had been sentenced to death could claim pardon if he were able to read one verse of a psalm it gives us an idea how very little people can have known and what a precious thing learning was held to be even the clergy were not much wiser than the rest and they were generally the best educated of any most of them could just get through the services not so much by reading them as by knowing what they had to say and they often made very queer blunders between words which were nearly alike a few here and there were really learned men and bishop grosteste was one of them he had learned all that europe could furnish and he knew so much that the poor ignorant people about him fancied he must have obtained his knowledge by magic but far better than all this bishop grosteste was taught of god his soul was like a plant which grew up towards the light and jesus christ was his sun in this day of full brilliant gospel light we can hardly imagine the state of affairs then perhaps one fact will help us to do it as well as many in every house there was an image set up before which all prayers were said sometimes it was a crucifix sometimes an image of the virgin mary sometimes of some other saintfor the saints male and female were a great crowd but the crucifix or the virgin mary were generally preferred and why because the poor worshippers fancied that the crucifix had more power than the image of a saint and that the virgin was able to look after her own candle a torch or in later times a candle was always burning in front of the image and of course if the image could keep it alight it was much less trouble to the worshipper but had they no common sense in those days well really it looks sometimes as if they had not when men once turn aside from gods word it is impossible to say to what folly or wickedness they will not go the entrance of thy words giveth light yea it giveth understanding unto the simple very few bishops then living would have taken any notice of the humble fostersister who lived in that tiny house and worked for her living she and her daughter being both widows and the child dependent on them it was hard work then as now for such people to get along it is often really harder for them than for the very poor the guests being now come agnes dished up the fourhoursif that can be called dishing up when there were no dishes she lifted a great pan off the hook where it hung over the firefor it must be remembered there were no bars and pans had to be hung over the fire by a handle like that of a kettleand poured out into the bowl a quantity of soup she then served out a cake of white bread to the bishopa rare dainty black bread to the chaplain and her mother and hard oatcake for herself and avice they then began to eat after the bishop had made the sign of the crossover the bowl which answered to saying grace all the spoons going into the one bowl the bishop being respectfully allowed to help himself first and how goes it now with thee my sister muriel asked the bishop the grandmother gave a little shake of her head though she answered cheerfully enough things go pretty well holy father i thank you work is off and on as it may be but we manage to keep a roof over our heads as you see and we can even find a bowl of broth and a wheatcake for our friends the lord be praised for all his mercies well said my sister and what do you intend to make of your little maid here marry i intend to make a good worker of her said agnes in her turn and not an idle giggling goodfornought as most of the lasses be she shall spin and weave and card and sew and scour and wash and bake and brew and churn and cook and not let the grass grow under her feet or else ill see truly a goodly list of duties for one maid replied the bishop with a smile and yet good agnes i am about to ask if thou canst find room for another on the top of them verily holy father i am she that should work my fingers to the bone to pleasure you was the hearty answer i thank thee good my daughter how shouldst thou like to go to london to london father and agness eyes grew as round as shillings to go to london was then looked on as a very serious matter people made their wills before they started and to ignorant agnes who had never in her life been ten miles from lincoln it sounded almost as tremendous an idea as being asked to go to the moon the bishop smiled he had been to paris and lyons ay even to london town i do indeed mean it my daughter there is methinks a career open to thee which most should reckon rare preferment and good success ah what is success he added as if to himself howbeit thou shalt hear the lady queen lacketh nurses for her children and reckoning thou shouldst well fill such a place i made bold to speak for thee and she thus far granted me that thou shouldst go up to windsor where the kings children are kept and she herself is at this present there to talk with her and let her see if thou art fit for the post if on further acquaintance she be pleased with thee then shalt thou be made nurse to one of the children and if not then the lady queen will pay thy charges home what sayest my daughterand thou also muriel my sister both muriel and agnes felt as if their breath were taken away as to avice she was listening with those large ears for which little pitchers are proverbial the bishop had spoken quietly as if it were an everyday occurrence of this enormous change which would affect their whole lives verily father you are too good to us said muriel gratefully and i will try to thank you father added agnes when i get back my senses and can find out whether i am on my head or my heels the bishop and his chaplain laughed and agnes recalled to her duties by seeing the soupbowl empty jumped up and took down the spit on which a chicken was roasting at the fire chickens were dear just then and this one had cost three farthings having been provided in honour of company people helped themselves in those days in a very rough and simple manner agnes held the chicken on the spit to the bishop who cut from it with his own knife the part he preferred then she served the chaplain and muriel in the same way and lastly cut some off for herself and avice finally when little was left beside the carcase she opened the back door and bestowed the remains on manikin the turnspit dog a little wiry shaggy cur which released from his labours had sat on the hearth licking his lips while the process of helping went on knowing that his reward would come at last manikin trotted off into the yard with his treasure and agnes came back to the table and the subject truly holy father i know not how to thank you but indeed i will do my best to deserve your good word should it please god so to order the same i doubt not thou wilt do well my daughter bear thou in mind that christ our lord is thy master and thy service must be good enough to be laid at his feet then shalt thou well serve the queen agnes was a very ignorant woman bishop grosteste being himself a wise man could not at all realise how ignorant she was she knew very little how to serve god but she did really wish to do it and that after all is the great thing those who have the will can surely sooner or later find out how when the guests were gone agnes threw another log of wood upon the fire and came and stood before it well mother what must we do touching this matter verily i am all of a tumblement what think you i think my daughter said old muriel calmly from the chimneycorner that we are not going to set forth for london within this next halfhour nay truly yet we must think well on it we shall do well to sleep on it and yet better to ask counsel of the lord but we must go mother it would never do to offend the holy bishop bishop robert my brother is not he that should be angered because we preferred gods counsel to his but it may be that we shall find after prayer and thought that his counsel is gods it was to that conclusion they came the next day after the bishops departure for a long time all was bustle and confusion agnes declared that she did not know where her head was nor sometimes whether she had any avice was at the height of enjoyment old muriel went quietly about her work keeping at it doing the next thing and got through more work than either the bishop did all he could to help them he found them a tenant for the house lent them moneyall his money not spent on real necessaries was either lent or given to such as needed it more than he did and at last he sent them southwards on his own horses and in charge of three of his servants from lincoln to windsor was a five days journey of rather long stages and when at last they reached the royal borough simpleminded agnes had begun to feel as if no further power of astonishment were left in her mind dear i never thought the world was so big she had said before they left grantham and when they arrived at aylesbury her cry waseh what a power of folks be in this world old muriel took her journey as she did everything calmly she like bishop grosteste himself lived too much with god to be easily startled or overawed by the grandeur of man avice was in a state of excitement and delight through the whole time they slept at a small inn and the next morning one of the bishops servants who had received his orders beforehand took up to the castle a letter from his master and waited to hear when it would please the queen to see them he came back in an hour with the news that the queen would receive them that afternoon agnes was in a condition of restless flutter till the time came then they dressed themselves in their very best and luke the bishops servant took them up to the castle if agnes had felt confused at the mere idea of her interview she found the reality still more overwhelming than she expected the first thing she realised was that she stood in an immense hall surrounded by what seemed to her a crowd of very smart gentlemen then they were led through passages and galleries upstairs and downstairs till agnes felt as though she could never hope to find her way back and at last in a very handsome room where the walls were covered with painting and the furniture upholstered in silk they came into the midst of a second crowd of very grand ladies by this time poor agnes had quite lost her head and when one of the fine ladies asked her what she wanted she could only drop a succession of courtesies and look totally bewildered old muriel managed better under your leave madam we have been sent for by my lady the queen oh are you the people who come about the nurses place said the young lady who looked goodnatured enough follow me and i will lead you to the queens chamber how many more chambers can there be was the wonder uppermost in the mind of agnes but they walked through several more each to her eyes grander than the last painted with stained glass windows and silkcovered furniture at length the young lady desired them to wait a moment where they were while she took in their names to the queen she drew back a crimson silk curtain and disappeared behind it and the threefor they had never thought of leaving avice behindstood looking round them in admiring astonishment they were not left to wonder long the curtain was drawn back and the voice of some unseen person bade them go forward they found themselves in a smaller room than the last beautifully decorated the walls were painted a very pale blue and large frescoes ornamented each side of the chamber thick marble columns highly polished jutted out into the room and in the recess between each pair was a marble bench with cushions of crimson samite two walnutwood chairs furnished with crimson samite cushions stood in the middle of the room small leaftables were fixed to the walls here and there the floor was of waxed wood very slippery to tread upon at the farther side of the room two doors stood open side by side the one leading to a little oratory in the turret the other to a balcony which ran round the tower in one corner a young lady sat at an embroidery frame and in another a little girl of seven years old who deeply interested avice was feeding her pet peacock in one of the chairs with some fancy work in her hand sat a lady whose age was about twentyeight and whose rich dress of goldcoloured samite and the gold and pearl fillet which bound her hair divided avices attention with the child and the peacock agnes was dropping flurried courtesies to everybody at once muriel who seemed to have a much better notion of what she ought to do took a step forward and knelt before the lady who sat in the chair lady she said we are the queens servants queen eleanor for it was she looked up on them with a smile she was a beautiful brunette lively and animated when she spoke but with an easygoing lazy expression when she did not it struck avice who had eyes for everything and was making good use of them that her majesty might have brushed her rich dark hair a little smoother and have fastened her diamond brooch less unevenly than she had done it was the pleasanter side of queen eleanor which was being shown to them she could be very pleasant when she was pleased and very kind and affable when she liked people but she could be very harsh and tyrannical to those whom she did not like and she was one of those many people with whom out of sight is out of mind let her see a suffering child and she would be sorry and anxious to help but a thousand suffering people whom she did not see even if something which she did had made them suffer were nothing at all to her the queen liked her visitors she thought old muriel looked reliable she was amused with the bewildered reverence of agnes and as to avice a child more or less in windsor castle mattered very little she would do to feed the peacock when princess margaret did not choose to attend to it so the bargain was soon struck and almost before she had discovered what was going to happen to her agnes found herself the daynurse of the lord richard the little prince who was then in the cradle muriel was made mistress of the nurses and even little avice received a formal appointment as waitingdamsel on the princess margaret the little girl who was feeding the peacock they were then dismissed from the royal presence thou hadst better go with them margaret bysset said the queen with a rather amused smile to the young lady who had brought them in otherwise they may wander about all day guided by margaret bysset they retraced their steps through the suite of rooms down winding stairs and across the hall to the great door which led into the courtyard of the castle can you find your way now asked the young lady nay we can but try said agnes pray you my mistress how many chambers be there in this castle truly i have not counted them was the laughing answer eh dear but i marvel if i can ever find mine own when we come to dwell here that will you soon enough look here cometh your servingman give you good morrow a few days saw them safely housed in the castle where two of them were to dwell for ten years before they returned to their own home at lincoln but old muriel was never to return she lived through half that time just long enough to hear of the death of bishop grosteste who passed away on the ninth of october he literally died weeping for the sins of his age christ came into the world to save souls were the words uttered with his last breath he who takes pains to ruin them shall he not be called antichrist god built the universe in six days but it took him thirty years to redeem fallen man the church can never be delivered but by the sword from the egyptian bondage in which the popes hold her the good old bishop could say no more his voice broke down in tears and with one great sob for england he yielded up his soul chapter three at uncle dans smithy the royal baby for whose benefit muriel and agnes had been engaged did not live long but he was succeeded by his brother prince william and before he was old enough to do without nurses a little princess came upon the scene she was the last of the family and she lived three years and a half after her death the services of the nurses were no longer needed queen eleanor dismissed them with liberal wages and handsome presents and the two who were leftagnes and avice determined to go back to lincoln avice was now a young woman of twenty but when they reached their old home they found many changes the good bishop grosteste was gone but his chaplain father thomas had looked after their interests and agnes found no difficulty in recovering her little property happily for them their tenants were anxious to leave the house and before many days were over they had slipped quietly back into the old place there were no banks in those days a mans savings bank was an old stocking or a tin mug agnes disposed of the money she had left from the queens payment partly in the purchase of a cow and partly in a stocking which was carefully locked up in the oak chest they could live very comfortably on the produce of the cow and the garden aided by what small sums they might earn in one way and another and so the years went on until avice in her turn married and was left a widow but she had no child and when her mother died avice was left alone i can never do to live alone she said to herself i must have somebody to love and work for and she began to think whom she could find to live with her as she sat and span in the twilight one name after another occurred to her mind but only to be all declined with thanks there was her neighbour next door annora goldhue she had three daughters no none of them would do joan was idle and amy was conceited and frethesancia had a temper little roese might have done who lived with old serena at the mill end but old serena could not spare her at last as avice broke her thread for the fourth time she pushed back the stool on which she was sitting and rose with her determination taken and spoke it out i will go and see aunt filomena aunt filomena lived about a mile from lincoln on the newport road her husband was a greensmith that is to say he worked in copper and hawked his goods in the town when made avice lost no time in going but set out at once as she rounded the last turn in the lane she heard the ring of daniel greensmiths hammer on the anvil and a few minutes more walking brought her in sight of the smith himself who laid down his hammer and shaded his eyes to see who was coming why uncle dan dont you know me said avice nay who is to know thee when thou comes so seldom said old dan wiping his hot face with his apron art thou come to see me or my dame i want to see aunt filomena is she in uncle dan shes in unless shes out said dan unanswerably and her tongues in too its at home that is was this morning anyhow what dost thou want of her well said avice hesitating i want her advice then thou wants what thoult get plenty of said dan with a comical twist of his mouth as he turned over some long nails to find a suitable one ill be fain if thoult cart away a middling lot for theres more coming my way than ive occasion for at this present avice laughed i daresay aunt is overworked a bit she said perhaps i can help her uncle dan folks are apt to lose their tempers when they are tired some folks are apt to lose em whether they are tired or not said the smith with a shake of his grizzled head ive got six lasses and four on em takes after her i could manage one and maybe i might tackle two but when five on em gets atop of a chap why hes down afore he knows it im a peaceable man enough if theyd take me peaceable but them five rattling tongues that gallops faster than sir othos charger up to the manoreh i tell thee what avice they do wear a man out poor uncle dan i should think they do but are all the girls at home i thought mildred and emma were to be bound apprentices in lincoln fell through wi mildred said the smith didnt offer good enough and sheby which pronoun he usually designated his vixenish wifewouldnt hear on it emmas bound worse luck i could ha done wi emma she and berthas the only ones as can be peaceable like me mildreds still at home then mildreds at home yet and sos elnor and sos susanna and sos ankaret and every one on ems tongues worse nor tother anda very heavy sighsos she avice knew that uncle dan was usually a man of fewer words than this for him to be thus loquacious showed very strong emotion or irritation of some sort she went round to the back door and before she reached it she heard enough to let her guess the sort of welcome she might expect to receive just inside the open door stood aunt filomena a thin redfaced voluble woman with her arms akimbo pouring out words as fast as they could come and in the yard just outside the door opposite to her stood her daughter ankaret in exactly the same attitude also thin redfaced and voluble the two were such precise counterparts of one another that avice had hard work to keep her gravity inside the house susanna and mildred and outside eleanor were acting as interested spectators the funniest part of the scene being that neither of them listened to a word said by the other but each ran at express speed on her own rails the youngest daughter bertha was nowhere to be seen for a minute the whole appearance of things struck avice as so excessively comical that she could scarcely help laughing but then she realised how shocking it really was what sort of mothers in their turn could such daughters be expected to make she waited for a moments pause and when it occurred which was not for some minutes she said aunt filomena oh youre there are you demanded the amiable filomena you just thank the stars youve got no children if ever an honest woman were plagued with six goodfornothing sluttish slatternly shrews of girls as me heres that ankaretive told her ten times oer to wash the tubs out and get em ready for the pickling and i come to see if they are done and theyve never been touched and my lady sitting upstairs amaking her gown fine for sunday i declare ill her intentions were drowned in an equally shrill scream from miss ankaret you never told me a wordnot once and taint my place to scour them tubs out neither its susanna as always then i wont broke in susanna and you might be ashamed of yourself i should think to put such messy work on me when eleanor youd best let me alone fiercely chimed in eleanor oh dear dear cried avice putting her hands over her ears my dear cousins are you going to drive each other deaf why i would rather scour out twenty tubs than fight over them like this are you not christian women come now who is going to scour the tubs i will take one myself if you will do the others who will join me and avice began to turn up her sleeves in good earnest no avice dont you youll spoil your gown said eleanor looking ashamed of her vehemence see ill get them done mildred wont you help well i dont mind if i do was the rather lazy answer but ankaret and susanna declined to touch the work the latter cynically offering to lend her apron to avice as avice scrubbed away she began to regret her errand to be afflicted with such a lifelong companion as one of these lively young ladies would be far worse than solitude but where was the youngestthe quiet little bertha who took after her peaceable father and whom avice had rarely heard to speak she asked eleanor for her youngest sister oh shes somewhere said eleanor carelessly she took her work down to the brook added mildred shes been crying her eyes out over emmas going ay emma and bertha are the white chicks among the black said eleanor laughing theyll miss each other finely ive no doubt avice finished her work returned susannas apron and instead of requesting advice from her aunt went down to the brook in search of bertha she found her sitting on a green bank with very red eyes well my dear heart said avice kindly to bertha the kind tone brought poor berthas tears back she could only sob outemmas gone and thou art all alone my child said avice stroking her hair she knew that loneliness in a crowd is the worst loneliness of all well so am i and mine errand this very day was to see if i could prevail on thy mother to grant me one of her young maids to dwell with me what sayest thou shall i ask her for thee o cousin i would be so berthas ecstatic tone went no farther it was in quite a different voice that she saidbut then theres father oh no cousin thank you so much but it wont do that will we ask father said avice father couldnt get on with me and emma both away said bertha in a tone which she tried to make cheerful hed be quite losti know he would well but began avice then hed find his self again as fast as he could said a gruff voice and they looked up in surprise to see old dan standing behind them thous done well lass thous taen advice o thy

the hedge when they were out of sight with a belt of trees between old dan took leave of them thoull be good to the little maid avice said he i know thou will or id never ha let her go but shell be

hear thee and as to combinstars knows i shall get enough o that and a bit oer that i can spare for old christopher next door hes got no wife and only one lass and shes a peaceable un hes a deal to be thankful for now god be wi ye both keep a good heart and step out ill let ye get a bit on afore i tell her and then ill run fort avice and bertha stepped out accordingly and as nobody came after them they concluded that things were tolerably smooth they did not see anybody from the smithy until two days later and then rather late in the eveningnamely about six oclockdan himself made his appearance with one bundle slung on a stick over his shoulder and another carried like a baby well said he as he sat down on the settle and wiped his hot face with his apron well o father im so glad said bertha are those my things how good of you to bring them ay they be said dan emphatically take em and make the best thou can of em for thoull get no more where they came from i can tell thee was aunt filomena very much put out asked avice in a rather penitent tone she wasnt put out o nothing answered dan except conduct becoming a christian woman she was turned into a wild dragon all oer claws and teeth and there was three little dragons behind her and they was all atop o me together if elnor hadnt thought better ont and come and stood by me there wouldnt have been much o me to bring these here then you did not run uncle dan replied avice she clutched me lass responded dan with awful solemnity and tothers they had me too thee try to run with a wild dragon holding on to thy hair and three more to thy arms and legsjust do i wonder im not tore to bitsi do howsomeer here i be and i just wish i could stop ay i do so and dans apron took another journey round his face uncle dan would you like to take bertha back was avices selfsacrificing suggestion dont name it cried dan dropping the apron dont name it there wouldnt be an inch on her left by morning light i wonder theres any o me eh but this world is a queer un is she a good lass avice yes indeed she is said avice im fain to hear it and im fain thous fallen on thy feet my little un and aviceif thou knows of any young man as wants to go soldiering and loves a fray just thee send him oer to th smithy and he shall ha the pick o th dragons i hope hell choose ankaret hell get my blessing aunt filomena seemed to have washed her hands of her youngest daughter she never came near them and avice thought it the better part of valour to keep away from the smithy when emma had a holiday which was a rare treat she often spent it with her sister and on still rarer occasions eleanor paid a short visit but the only frequent visitor was old uncle dan and he came whenever he could and always seemed sorry to go home chapter four baby a very quiet life was led by avice and bertha the house work was done by the two in the early morningcleaning washing baking churning and brewing as they were severally needed and in the afternoon they sat down to their work enlivened either by singing or conversation sometimes both were silent and when that was the case unknown to avice bertha was generally watching her features and trying to read their meaning at length one evening after a long silence she suddenly broke the stillness with a blunt question aunt i wish you would tell me what you are thinking of when you look so how do i look bertha as if you were looking at something which nobody could see but yourself sometimes it seems to be something pretty and sometimes something shocking but oftener than either something just a little sad and yet as if there were pleasantness about it i dont know exactly how to describe it that will do when a woman comes to fifty years little bertha there are plenty of things in the past of her life which nobody can see who did not go through them with her and often those who did so cannot see them that will leave a scar upon one which makes not a scratch upon another but of what were you thinking aunt if i may know that thou mayest i fancy when thou spakest i was thinkingas i very often doabout my little lady now if aunt avice is very good said bertha insinuatingly and with brightened eyes that means a story aunt avice smiled ay thou shalt have thy story only let us be sure first that all is done which need be cast a few more chips on the fire and light another pinetorch that is burnt nigh out and see thy bodkin on the floorcareless child bertha jumped up and obeyed from one corner of the room where lay a heap of neatlycut faggots she brought a handful and threw it into the wide fireplace which stretched across half one side of the room and had no grate the fire burning on the stone hearth then from a pile of long pointed stakes of pitch pine she brought one lighted it and set it in an iron frame by the fireplace made for that purpose and lastly she picked up from the brick floor an article of iron about a foot in length and nearly as thick as her little finger which she called a bodkin but which we should think very rude and clumsy indeed hast thou heard bertha said avice that when i was young i dwelt for a season in the castle of windsor and my mother was nurse to some of the children of the lord king that then was brothers and sister they were of our lord king edward that reigns now berthas eyes brightened she liked as all girls do to hear a story which had to do with great people no aunt avice i never knew that wont you tell me all about it so avice began and told her what we know alreadyhow the bishop had recommended agnes to the queen and all about the journey and the castle and the queen herself then she went on to tell the rest of the story we lived nigh five years said avice in the castle of windsoruntil the lord richard was dead and the lord william was nearly four years old then the lady queen removed to the royal palace of westminster for the lord king was gone over seas and she with earl richard his brother was left to keep england it was in august the year of our lord at we took up our abode in thorney island where the palace of westminster stands it is a marshy placenot over healthy some folks say but i never was ill while we dwelt there and it was there on saint katherines daywhich is the th of novemberthat our little lady was born her royal mother named her katherine after the blessed saint she was the loveliest babe that eye could rest on and she was christened with great pomp and on saint edwards day when the lady queen was purifiednamely churchedthere was such a feast as i never saw again while i dwelt with her the provisions brought in for that feast were fourteen wild boars twentyfour swans one hundred and thirtyfive rabbits two hundred and fifty partridges sixteen hundred and fifty fowls fifty hares two hundred and fifty wild ducks thirtysix geese and sixtyone thousand eggs only think cried bertha did you get some aunt surely i did child the lady queen i told thee was then keeper of england for the lord king was away across the seas and good provision she made truly she was freehanded enough at spending would she had been as just in the way she came by her money why aunt what mean you asked bertha when avice expressed her wish that queen eleanor had been as just in gaining money as she was liberal in spending it why child taxes came heavy in those days when the lord king needed money he sent home to his treasurer and it was had as he could get itsometimes by selling up divers rich folks or by levying a good sum from the jews or any way man could not always by equal tenths or fifteenths as now which comes not nigh so heavy on one or two when it is equally meted out to all but never was there king like our late lord king henry whom god pardon for squeezing money out of his poor subjects yet old folks did use to say his father king john was as ill or worse taxes in those days were a very different thing from what they are now and were far more at the mere pleasure of the king not only as to the collecting of them but as to the spending ignorant people fancy that this is the case still but it is not so queen victoria has no money from the taxes for her private spending when she became queen she gave up all the land belonging to her as queen on condition that her daughters should be portioned and that she should receive a certain sum of money every year of less value than the land she gave up so that it would be fraud and breach of trust in the people if they did not keep their word to pay the sum agreed on to the queen there is so much misunderstanding on this point that it is worth while to mention it then were the king and queen bertha began avice answered the halfasked question they were like other folks child they liked their own way and tried to get it and they liked fine clothes and great feasts and plenty of company and so forth so they spent their money that way ill not say they were bad folks though they did some bad things they were folks that only thought what they liked and did it and folks that do that are sure to bring sorrow to themselves and others too whether they be kings and queens or cooks and haymakers the kings and queens can do it on a larger scale that is all the difference there are few enough that think what god likes as holy bishop robert did and like to do his will better than their own those that do scatter happiness around them as the other sort scatter misery well after a while the lady queen left england to join the lord king across seas but before she went she took our little lady down to the castle of windsor to the rest of the kings children there was first the lady beatrice who was a maiden of twelve years and the lord edmund a very pretty little boy of nine and the lord william who was but four and there were also with them other children of different ages that were brought up with them but only one was near our little ladys age or had much to do with her that was alianora de montfort daughter of earl simon of leicester that bold baron that headed the lords against the king and her mother was the kings own sister the lady alianora she was fifteen months older than our little lady and being youngest of all the two used to play together a sweet child she was too but not like my own little ladythere never was a child like her what was she like aunt tell me what the angels are like in heaven and thou shalt hear then she is an angel nowshe hath been one these threeandtwenty years but methinks there can have been little to change in her face when she blossomed into a cherub and the wings would unfold themselves from her as by nature never a child like herno there never was one she had bright dark eyes wonderful eyeseyes that her whole soul shone in and that took in everything which passed she spoke with her eyes she had no other way the souls of other children came out of their lips but she had not spent many months in this lower world before we saw with bitter apprehension and deep sorrow that god had sealed her sweet lips with eternal silence she saw all she heard nothing she could never speak my darling was deaf and dumb o aunt avice ay verily at times i wondered if she were indeed an angel that god had sent down to earth for whose pure lips our english was too rough and our french too rude and who could only speak the tongue they speak in heaven she went back but whence she came we were not fit company for her methinks she was sent to let our earthbound hearts have one glimpse of that upper world and when her work was done her father sent for her back home though our little lady could never speak yet long before we discovered that we found how lively and earnest and intelligent she was as i told thee she talked with her eyes nothing could be done in her presence but she must see and know all about it a little pull at my gown would tell me she was there and then i turned to see the bright eager eyes looking into mine and asking me as plainly as eyes could ask to let her know all about it she would never rest till she knew what she wanted ay me those eager eyes look into angels faces now and maybe into the face of god upon the throne but aunt how could she understand if she could not hear god told her somehow child he taught her not we we did our best truly but our best would have been a poor business if he had not taken her in hand many a time before i had finished trying to explain something to her that quick little nod would come which meant i understand then she had certain signs for different things she made those herself we never taught them to her she stroked what she liked as man would stroke a dog when she disliked anything she made a feint of throwing her open hand out from her as though she were pushing it away she had odd little ways of indicating different persons by something in them which struck her master russell the queens clerk and keeper of the royal children used often to have a sprig of mint or thyme in his lips as he went about her sign for him was a bit of stick or thread between her lips for the priest she tolled a bell for the lady beatrice her sister who had a little airy way of putting her head on one side when anything vexed her and my lord henry de lacy who pouted if he were cross which he was pretty oftenmy little lady imitated them exactly the lady alianora flourished her hands when she spoke that was the sign for her for the lord king her father whose left eyelid drooped over his eye she pulled her own down she had some such sign for everybody she noticed everything could she not say one word aunt yes she could say three verily sometimes i marvelled if she might not have been taught more but we knew not how and how she got hold of those three we could never tell what were they they were up who and poor well she could not do much with those could she not who asked all her questions it answered for who what where when how and why she went on saying it until we understood and replied to the sense in which she meant it poor was the word of emotion it signified i pity you i love you i am sorry and forgive me and sometimes it meant forgive him or dont you feel sorry for her and i think up served for everything else aunt said bertha softly how did you teach the little lady to pray she could tell her beads i suppose but would she know what they meant for bertha like everybody else at that time thought it necessary to keep count of her prayers prayer in her eyes was not so much communion with god as it was a kind of charm which in some unaccountable way brought you good luck beads would have meant nothing to her but toys was avices reply the lady de la mothe taught her the holy signby which avice meant the crossand led her to the image of blessed mary that she might do it before her but i do not think she ever properly understood that she seemed only to have an idea that it was something she must do when she saw an image and she did it to the statue of the lady queen in the great hall we could not make her understand that one image was not the same thing as another image but i fancy she had some ideastrange and dim it might beof what we meant when we knelt and put our hands together and looked up i know she did it very often without telling always at night before she slept but it was strange that she never went to the holy images at that time she always seemed to go away from them and kneel down in a corner and in her last illness several times coming into the chamber i found her lying with her hands folded in prayer and her eyes lifted up to heaven perhaps god himself told her how to speak to him one of the strangest things of all was when the little lord william died she was nearly three years old then she had been very fond of her little brother he was nearest her age of all her brothers and sisters though he was almost four years older than herself she came to me sobbing bitterly and with her little cry of who who i took it to mean what has happened to him and i was completely puzzled how to explain it to her but all at once while i was beating my brains to think what i could say that would make her comprehend it she told me herself what i could not tell her making the sign for the little lord who was dead she laid her head upon her hand and closed her eyes and then all at once with a peculiar grace that i never saw in any child but herself she lifted her arms fluttering her fingers like a bird flaps its wings and gazing up into the sky while she said up up in a kind of rapture and i could only smile and bow my head to the truth which god had told her see note but how could she know it asked astonished bertha avice shook her head i cannot explain it i can only tell what happened she was always very tenderhearted she never could bear to see any quarrelling or cruelty or injustice if two of the children strove together our little lady would run to them with a face of deep distress and take a hand of each and draw them together as though she were begging them to be friends and if she could not get them to kiss each other she would kiss first one and then the other i missed her one day and after hunting a long while i found her in the gallery before a fresco of our lord upon the cross she was stroking it and kissing it with tears in her eyes and she turned to me saying poor poor her eyes always filled with tears when she saw the crucifix the moon used to interest her exceedingly she would sit and watch it and kiss her hand to it but dear me how the time must be getting on jump up bertha and prepare supper bertha folded up her work and put it aside she drew one of the high stools between her aunt and herself and put out upon it the two wooden trenchers and two tin mugs going to a corner cupboard bertha brought out a few cakes of black bread which she set on a smaller stool beside the other and then lifting a pan upon the fire she threw into it some pieces of mutton fat as soon as these were melted bertha broke four eggs into them stirring this indigestible mixture with a wooden thiblean article of which my northern readers will not require a description but the southern must be told that it is a long flat instrument with which porridge is stirred for the eggs were not merely fried in the fat but were beaten up with it the dish when finished bearing the name of franchemule a sprig or two of dried herbs were then shred into the pan and the whole poured out half on each of the trenchers it is more than possible that the extraordinarily rich incongruous indigestible dishes wherein our fathers delighted may have something to do with the weaker digestions of their children the tin mugs were filled with weak ale from a barrel which stood under the ladder it was an oddity at that time to drink water when supper was finished bertha washed the mugs and scraped the trenchers clean water never touched those putting them back in their places she had scarcely ended when a tap was heard at the door step in hildith said bertha as she opened it christ give thee a good even the like to thee was the answer as a rather wornlooking woman came in mistress avice your servant pray you would you lend me the loan of a tinderbox i am but now come home from work and am that weary i may scarce move and yon careless jaket hath let the fire out and i must needs kindle the same again ere i may dress supper for the children it was no wonder if hildith looked worn out or if she could not afford a tinderbox that precious article cost a penny and her wages were fifteen pence a year if we do a sum to find out what that would be now when money is much more plentiful we shall find that hildiths wages come to twentytwo shillings and sixpence and the tinderbox was worth eighteenpence we should fancy that nobody could live on such a sum but we must remember two things first they then did a great deal for themselves which we pay for they spun and wove their own linen and woollen did their own washing brewed their own ale and cider made their own butter and cheese and physicked themselves with herbs secondly prices were very much lower as respected the necessaries of life bread was four loaves or cakes for a penny of the very best quality a lamb or a goose cost fourpence eight chickens were sold for fivepence and twentyfour eggs for a penny clothing stuffs were dear but then as people sometimes say they wore for everlasting and ladies of rank would send halfworn gowns to one another as very handsome presents fourpence was a good price to give for a pair of shoes and a halfpenny a day for food was a liberal allowance any news tonight hildith asked avice as she handed her neighbour the tinderbox well nay without you call it news that sheriffs man brought word this morrow that the lord king had granted the half of her goods to old barnaba o the lichgate she that was a jew and was baptised at whitsuntide i am glad to hear that ay she i am not oer sorry she is a good neighbour jew though she be then i reckon she will tarry here and not go to dwell in the house of converts in london town marry she will so if she have any wisdom teeth left i would not like to be carried away from all i know up to yon big town though they do say the houses be made o gold and silver avice smiled for she knew better nay hildith london town is built of brick and stone like lincoln is it now i always heard it was made o gold but arent there a vast sight o folk there nigh upon ten thousand ay and more however do they get victuals for them all i got mine when i lived there said avice laughing and dont they burn seacoal they did once it is forbidden now dirty poisonous stuff i wouldnt touch it well goodeven shut the door quick bertha and dont watch me out o sight tis the unluckiest thing man can do and bertha believed it as she showed by shutting the door old barnaba the jewess had been dealt with tenderly in those days if a jew were baptised he forfeited all he had to the king most unaccountable it is that any christian country should have let such a law exist for an hour these destitute jews however were provided for in the house of converts in london which stood at the bottom of chancery lane between it and saint dunstans church it was bedtime soon after avice put away her distaff bertha folded up her sewing and they mounted the ladder this was about seven oclock which was then as late an hour as it was thought that respectable people ought to be about but by two oclock the next morning bertha was sweeping the kitchen and avice carding flax in the corner they did not trouble themselves about breakfast it was an unknown luxury except for people who were very old or very delicate two meals a day were the rule dinner at nine in the morning supper at three in the afternoon in those days they lived in a far harder and less comfortable way than we do and they had generally better health but it must be admitted they did not live nearly so long and the infant mortality among them was very great morning was no time for storytelling the rooms had to be swept the bread to be baked the clothes to be washed the pigs and chickens to be fed moreover today was the first day of the michaelmas fair and things must be bought in to last till christmas the active work was finished by about seven oclock dinner was now got ready it consisted of two bowls of broth then boiled dumplings and lastly some stewed giblets having made things tidy our friends now tied on woollen hoods and each taking down from the rafterhooks a capacious basket they went forth to do their shopping note the peculiar ways attributed to the little princess and especially this incident are taken from an account of a real deaf and dumb child published many years ago there was certainly something about the princess which her attendants considered wonderful and beautiful chapter five the dumb playmates out into the michaelmas fair our friends went in these days when fairs have quite changed their character we cannot easily form a notion of what they once were the fair held in every town four times a year was a very important matter there were much fewer shops than now and not only in the town but from all the surrounding villages people flocked to the fair to lay in food and clothes and all sorts of necessaries enough to last till the next fairday they had very little fresh butchers meat and very few vegetables except what they grew themselves so they ate numbers of things salted which we have fresh not only salt fish and salt neat but salt cabbage formed a great part of their diet the consequence of all this salt food was that they suffered dreadfully from scurvy but they did not run to the doctor for except in rare instances there was no doctor to run to all doctors were clergymen then and there were very few of them in the large towns there were apothecaries or chemists who often prescribed for people and there were wise women who knew a good deal about herbs and sometimes gave good medicines along with a great deal of foolish nonsense in the way of charms and all sorts of silly fancies at that time ladies were taught a good deal about medicine and a benevolent lady was often the doctor for a large neighbourhood but we are wandering away from the michaelmas fair and we must come back the fair was a very busy scene in some places it was hard work to get along at all the booths were set up not in the streets but in the churchyards the market place and on any waste space available and what with the noise of business the hum of gossip the shouts of competing sellers and the sound of hundreds of clogs on the round pavingstones it may be readily supposed that quiet was far away avices first business was to lay in a stock of salt meat and salt fish very little of either was used fresh for it was not obtainable and still less would have been used so far as fish is concerned had not the law alike of the church and of the state compelled it to be eaten throughout lent and on every friday in the year little enough fish would anybody have touched then but for that provision avice bought half of a salted calf which cost a shilling five hundred herrings at halfacrown a bushel of salt at threepence which was dear twentyfive stockfish at two shillings a quarter of a sheep at fourpence a quarter of wheat at six shillings a quarter of oats at five shillings half a quarter of salt cabbage at five shillings and five pounds of figs at threehalfpence a pound this was her provision for the three months which would elapse before the christmas fair she then went to the drapery stalls and laid in two hoods for herself and bertha at a shilling each ten ells of russet to serve for two gowns at eighteenpence the ell twelve ells of serge at threehalfpence the ell two pairs of shoes at fourpence each the russet was intended for their best dresses the serge for common considering how very little went to make a garment it seems likely that our ancestors wove their stuff a good deal wider than we do avice also laid in a few other articles of different kinds a brass pot which cost her shillings pence five pounds of tallow at threehalfpence a pound and as many of wax at sixpence wax was largely used for a variety of objects her last and costliest purchase she would have been better without it was a painted and gilded image of saint katherine and cost fifteen shillings but avice though a good woman according to her light had enjoyed very little light and did not understand half so well as we do that she might go straight to god through the new and living way opened upon the cross without the intervention of any mediator except the lord jesus she thought she must pray through a saint and she had no idea of praying unless she could see something to pray to her old image had lost much of its paint and half an arm and its nose was hopelessly damaged therefore as she must have one poor avice thought it best to buy a new one rather than have her old saint tinkered up alas for the gods or the mediators who require to be tinkered by the time that these purchases were made and the goods brought home it was not far from the supper hour and bertha prepared that meal by boiling a dish of salt cabbage from one of the barrels this with black bread and ale made their supper the meal was just ready and avice had put away her carding having finished that kind of work for the day when a rap at the door was followed by the lifting of the latch and the old smith put in his head any room for a man have ye plenty for you uncle dan answered avice heartily and berthas eyes lighted up at the sight of her father dan came forward and sat down on the stool which bertha set for him has it not been a charming day said avice ay its fine weather i lincoln was dans dry answer up at smithy its none so bad neitheryet just a touch of thunder we had this morninga bit of a grumble i th distance like but ive known worser storms a deal ay i have so avice quite understood what kind of storm he meant how do

send down a chap all over steel to th smithy hed get plucked o pieces else well god be wi thee avice god bless thee bertha my lass goodnight and uncle dan disappeared into the darkness there were no street lamps then every man had to carry his own lantern unless he chose to run the risk of breaking his neck over the round stones which formed the streets or the rough ground interspersed with holes and pits to be found everywhere else they now sat down to work for the rest of the evening avice on the settle in the corner bertha on one of the low stools which she brought up to the hearth lackaday what have i forgot said avice as bertha drew up her stool and unfolded the apron she was making i thought to have asked nora goldhue for a sprig of betony or else purslane tis oer late tonight and verily i am too weary to go forth again have you bad dreams aunt asked bertha knowing that a sprig of either of those herbs under the pillow was believed to drive them away ay child they have troubled me these four nights past but last night more especially no wonder after a supper on franchemule but it never occurred to ignorant avice that supper and dreams could have anything to do with one another shall i fetch you a laurel leaf aunt suggested bertha ay do child maybe that shall change the luck best go ere it rain too and that will not be long for i saw a black snail in the channel as we came in bertha tied on her hood and ran out to the house of the nextdoor neighbour who had a laurel in her garden to beg a few of its leaves which were supposed to bring pleasant dreams having placed these under her aunts bolster she sat down again to her work and avice resumed her interrupted story it was in july when our little lady was but eight months old that the lady queen set forth to join the lord king in gascony there were many ships taken up for her voyage amongst which were the savoy the falcon and the baroness that was my lord of leicesters ship in the ship wherein the lady queen sailed was built a special chamber for her of polished wood for the which three hundred planks were sent from the forest to portsmouth but so short was she of money that she was compelled to bid the treasurer to send her all the cups and basins which the king had of silver and all gold in coin or leaf that could be found in the treasuries moreover the jews throughout england were distrained for five thousand marks for the ransom of their bodies and their wives and little ones and by sale of their lands and houses the lady queen took with her divers pieces of english cloth for the lord king seeing that french cloth is not nigh so good some things also she commanded for the children who were to tarry at windsor during her absence twentyfour silver spoons were made and fifty wild animals taken for their provision in the park at guildford robes were served out furred with hares fur for edmund the kings son and henry de lacy four robes for the gentlewomen that had the care of the children and for richard the chaplain master simon de wycumb the keeper and master godwyn the cook these were of sendal and there were robes furred with lamb for the kings wards and for john the varlet and julian the rocker and my mother and me thine aunt see note both to avice and bertha it seemed quite a matter of course that the jews should find the money when the king wanted silk or the kings children silver spoons but it seems to me aunt suggested bertha that the lady queen must have spent all her money before she started oh no the money was for the lord king in truth i know not whether she paid for the other things but i did hear that as soon as the lord king knew she would come and that she was bringing with her so much money and plate he began to spend with both hands on his side of the sea he sent at once for six cloths of gold that the queen and lord edward might offer in the churches of bordeaux when they should arrive there he commanded to be made ready a fair jewel for saint edward the martyr and a hundred pounds of jewels for saint edward the king and divers more for saint thomas of canterbury all which were offered when he and the queen returned home in december there came in also for the kings coming back many frails of figs raisins dates cinnamon saffron pepper ginger and such like i remember seeing them unpacked in antioch chamber the little chamber by the garden and what did it all cost aunt i know not child maybe he never paid for those he used to pay for such things as he offered to the holy saints but for debts to tradesfolk and such they took their chance if he had money he might pay some of them or no at his pleasure and if not then of course they had to wait very sure am i that many a pound of musk came into the wardrobe more than was paid for never was such a prince for scents he loved musk as much as he feared lightning and there was only one thing in all this world that he feared more and that was earl simon of leicester and did the lady queen squander her money as much as the lord king aunt avice she was every bit as bad she always seemed to me as if a piece of her brains had never grown up along with the rest some folks are like that in respect of money she was a very child she had not a notion how far it would go and she never would wait to have it before she spent it she always appeared to think it would come somehow and so far as she was concerned it often did but then she never saw the homeless jews who were sold up to furnish it nor the ruined tradesmen who had to wait till they could not pay their own way and were sent to prison for debt i think she might have been sorry if she had done i suppose we should all be sorry if we knew half the evil we do well god pardon hershe is a holy sister now in the priory at amesbury and our present queen always pays her bills i have heard say long may she live to do it how old was the little lady when her parents came back she was just over a year old i waited on her from the castle of windsor to the palace at westminster for the lord king desired to behold her at once and was not he delighted with her i doubt if any of the royal children were as dear to the hearts of their parents as our little lady was she pleased to go pleasedshe gave nobody a bit of rest said avice laughing all the journey through she was plucking at my gown and pointing first here and then there with her little cry of who whofor she talked at fifteen months old as much as she ever spoke in this world and before i could find out what she meant she was pointing to something else and who who came over again did you know then that she was deaf and dumb no nor for months after truly all her ways were so bright and her sense so keen and her laugh so gladsome that we never thought of such a thing till she was long past the age when children ought to speak freely but when at last they began to fear the truth it was indeed a bitter grief to the royal parents the lord king offered five cloths of gold at saint edwards shrine for the children and specially for our little lady in hope that the divine mercy might be moved to have pity on her but it was all in vain avice sighed heavily and there was no one to say to her o woman small is thy faith was the divine mercy no greater which called that little child unspotted by the world to tread the fair streets of the golden city than the mercy thou wouldst have had instead of it it was not long after that said avice slowly drawing out the white threads that our little ladys health began to fail the heats of summer tried her sorely she drooped like a flower that had no water instead of playing with the other children her gleeful laughter ringing through the galleries of the castle she would come and draw her little velvet stool to my side and lay her head on my knee as if she were very weary and when i looked down and smiled on her instead of smiling back as she was wont the great dark wistful eyes used to look up so sadly as if her soul were looking out of them oh it was pitiful to read the dear eyes when they said i am suffering cannot you help me and as time went on they said it more and more when the lady queen came to windsor she was shocked at the sad change in our darling little lady she called in master thomas the kings surgeon and he advised that our little lady should be removed from windsor to some country place where the air was good and where she could play about in the fields so she was put in charge of emma la despenser lady de saint john at her manor of swallowfield in berkshire of course i went with her and her cousin alianora also who was her favourite playfellow for it was not thought well she should be entirely with older people though i cannot say i was sorry to get rid of all those rough boys the lord king also commanded that a kid should be taken in the forest as small and fair as might be found for our little lady to play with and very fond she was of it it was a lovely little creature and grew as tame as possible ah they were much alike those two little thingsboth young soft lovelyand both dumb i marvelled sometimes whether they understood each other and did she not get any better aunt yes for a time she did the country air and food and quiet did seem to do her good she was so much better that she came back to windsor for the winter but it was not thought well by master thomas that she should go to london to be present at the great rejoicings that were made when the lady alianora came from spainour queen that now is the holy saints bless her there were grand doings then i heard all london city was curtained in her honour and processions in every church and all superbly decorated and the poor fed in the halls at westminster as many as could get in and the lord king presented a silver cross to the abbey and a golden plate of an ounce weight oh it must have been a grand sight who paid that bill i wonder said bertha laughing bless thee child how do i know that was the autumn when there was so much ado here at lincoln touching the crucifixion of the blessed hugh son of beatrice by the wicked jews one hundred and more of them were brought to prison first here and afterwards at westminster and when eighteen had been hanged the rest were graciously allowed to buy their lives for eighteen thousand marks i daresay some of that went for itthat is for as much of it as got paid for that sum would now be equal to about two hundred and sixteen thousand pounds it never came into avices head to doubt whether the jews had crucified little hugh such charges were often enough brought against themwhen those who called themselves christians wanted an excuse for stealing the jews money and jewels there has never been a single instance in this country or any other in which the charge has been proved true a further favourite accusation that the jews used the blood of christian children to make their passover cakes we know cannot have been true for the bible tells us that the jews were strictly forbidden to eat blood but what absurdity might not be expected from people who had no bibles and of whom not more than one in a thousand could have read it if he had had one are we half thankful enough for our own privileges well continued avice after this the lady alianora came down to windsor with the lady queen and our little lady and she took to one another wonderfully and indeed it was little wonder for she was as fair and sweet a damsel as ever tripped over the greensward our little lady would run to her whenever she sat down in the childrens chamber and say up up and then the lady alianora would smile sweetly and take her up beside her in the great state chair and there they sat with their arms round one another looking like two doves with their heads resting on each others necks and the lady alianora once said to me stroking our little ladys hairi hope avice thou givest her plenty of love she can understand that if she cannot anything else ay and so she could she fretted sadly over the lady alianora when she went away from windsor i think she and the little kid were more than ever together after that i have found them both asleep in a corner of the chamber resting on one another was she fond of pets she loved her little kid dearly and she seemed to go to it for comfort i do not know that she cared much for anything else the lord king was the one for gathering curious animals of all sorts he had three leopards in the tower and a white bear which was taken out to fish in the thames the citizens of london paid fourpence a day for the bears keep and had to provide a chain and muzzle for it and a long cord whereby it was held when it fished in the river and in the spring before the coming of the lady alianora the french king sent to our king a very strange animal the like of which was never before seen in england it had scarcely any eyes that man might see and not much of a tail but great flapping ears and a most extraordinary thing that hung down from its face which was hollow like a pipe and it could pick things up with it as thou dost with thy fingers it was a leadcoloured beast and ate nought but grass and hay and suchlike it would not touch meat nor bones they called it an oliphantfor so in old time people pronounced elephant the lord king thought great things of this beast and had a house built for it forty feet by twenty at the tower it was made very strong lest the great beast should break forth and slay men but truly it seemed a peaceable beast enough we dwelt much more quietly at windsor after the departure of the lady alianora for she went abroad with the lord edward her husband and mariot de ferrars who had been there for some timeshe went too and the kings son edmund was made king of sicily by the lord pope and he and the other lads were taken away our little lady and her cousin alianora de montfort alone were left the king thought to have made money by edmund his son he was a fair boy in very truth and he clad him in sicilian dress which was graceful and comely and showed him before the parliament entreating them to find him money for all these many expenses but the parliament did not seem disposed to pay for seeing the young lord and indeed i heard master russell say that he thought it strange the lord king should make merchandise of his childs beauty as though he were some curious animal to be seen in a show but bertha my dear heart we clean forgot to buy any honeyand only this minute is it come to my mind tie on thine hood i pray thee and run to the druggist for an halfdozen pounds when it is understood that honey held in avices cookery and diet the place that sugar does in ours the necessity of remedying this mistake will be seen sugar was much too expensive to be used by any but wealthy people note the robes provided for agnes and avice are the sole imaginary items in this account sendal was a very thin silk chapter six set free as bertha came back carefully carrying her jar of honey she heard a considerable tumult in a street on her left hand which led to the jews quarter of the city in every town the jews were shut up in a particular part of it and after london itself the towns in which the greatest number of jews lived were lincoln york norwich oxford and northampton since the dreadful persecution arising from the real or supposed murder of little hugh lincoln had been comparatively quiet from such tumults and bertha was too young to know anything about it but from hearsay wondering if some fresh commotion was going to arise and anxious to be safe at home before it should begin bertha quickened her steps there were only three more streets to cross one of which was a dark narrow alley leading directly to the jews quarter as bertha crossed this she heard a low frightened call upon her name and a slight figure crept out and crouched at her feet o bertha said a girls voice broken by sobs and terrified catching of the breath you are kindhearted i know you are you saved a little dog that the dreadful boys were trying to drown will you save me though i am beneath a dog in your eyes who are you asked astonished bertha i am hester the daughter of aaron said the girl and there is a deadly raid on our quarter they accuse us of poisoning the wells o bertha they lay things to us that we never do save me for my womanhoods sake poor soul said bertha looking down at her come with me to aunt avice maybe she will let thee tarry in some corner till the tumult is over i dare say it will not be much bertha spoke in rather contemptuous tones though they were not wanting in pity everybody in england was taught then to rank jews with vermin and to look upon it as a weakness to show them any kindness the two girls reached the door in safety and bertha led hester in aunt avice she said there is a commotion in the jews quarter and here is a jew maiden that wants to know if we will shelter her i suppose she wont hurt us much will she the very breath of a jew was fancied to be poisonous avice looked at the pale terrified face and trembling limbs of the girl who had cast herself on her mercy well i dare say not said she at any rate we will risk it perhaps the good lord may not be very angry or if he is we must say more prayers and beg our lady saint mary to intercede for us come in child poor avice she knew no better she had been taught that the lord who died for her was a stern angry judge and that all the mercy rested in his human mother and the jews had crucified christ so thought avice he must hate them perhaps of such christians as she was he may have said again father forgive them for they know not what they do hester came in quietly may god bless you she said i will try not to breathe on you for i know what you think and she sat down meekly on the floor in a dark corner not daring to offer any help lest they should imagine that she would pollute anything she touched avice threw her a cake of bread as she might have done to a dog and hester knew that it was a kinder act than she would have received from most of the christians around it was not yet quite bedtime and bertha sat down again to her work begging her aunt to finish the tale they took no notice of hester it is almost finished said avice there is little more to tell the winter got over but spring was scarcely begun when our little ladys health failed again the lord king was so anxious about her that when he was away from windsor he bade the lady queen to send him a special messenger with news of her and so delighted was he to hear of her recovery that he commanded a good robe to be given to the messenger and offered in thanksgiving an image of silver wrought in the form of a woman to the shrine of saint edward then she did recover aunt ay but it was for the last time as the summer drew on the lady queen asked master thomas if he thought it well that the little lady should have change again and be sent into the country till the heat was past master thomas answered that he reckoned it unnecessary and the lady queen departed well pleased but as soon as she was gone master thomas said to me and julian the rocker who were tending our little ladyshe will have a better change than to swallowfield quoth julian say you so master whither do you purpose sending her and he said looking sadly on the child i purpose sending her truly good julian no whither but ere long time be over the lord our god will send for her by that angel that taketh no bribe to delay execution of his mandate and then i knew his meaning my darling was to die but the steps of the angel were very slow the autumn came and went the child seemed languid and dull and the lord king offered a chasuble of samite to the blessed edmund of pontigny at his altar at canterbury edmund rich afterwards called saint edmund of pontigny was an archbishop of canterbury with whom king henry the third was at variance as long as he lived much in the same way as henry the second had been with becket now he was dead a banished man the pope had declared him a saint and king henry made humble offerings at his shrine but it is amusing to find that with respect to this offering at least his majestys instructions were to buy the samite of the lowest price that could be found it was all of no use pursued avice sorrowfully the angel had received the mandate great feasts were held at easterthere were twenty beeves and fifty muttons fifteen hundred pullets and six hundred shillings worth of bread beside many other thingsbut ere one month was over the feast became a fast when saint philips day dawned my darling lay in her bed with her fair eyes turned up to heaven and her hands folded in prayer and who may know what she said to god or yet more what he told to her she had never been taught to pray she could not be avices only notion of prayer was repeating a form of words and keeping time by a string of beads but i shall always think that in some way beyond our comprehension my darling could speak to god and on the evening of the invention of the crosswhich is may rdshe spoke to him in heaven and did the lady queen sorrow very much aunt i suppose though great ladies like her would not care as much as poor people wouldst thou child ah a mother is a mother let her be a cottager or a queen and she sorrowed so sorely that for weeks afterwards she lay ill and all the skill of her physicians could avail nothing the lord king too fell sick of a tertian fever which held him many days and i believe it was out of sheer anguish for his dearest child he commanded a brass image of her to be placed on the tomb but ere it was finished he would have one of silver and he gave fifty shillings a year to the hermit of charing for a priest to pray daily for her in the chapel of the hermitage do you think she is still in purgatory aunt avices religion as taught not by the word of god but the traditions of men led her to be doubtful on that point but her heart broke its way through the bonds what my white dove my little unspotted darling that never wilfully sinned against god and holy church child if our holy father the pope were to tell me himself that she was there i would not believe him do the angels go to purgatory nay i do verily believe that seeing her infirmity christ our lord did all the work of salvation for her and that she sings now before our fathers face poor avice she could get no further but we who know gods word know that there is but one mediator between god and man and that he has offered a full perfect and sufficient sacrifice for the sins of the whole world before bertha could reply an answer came unexpectedly from the dark corner your god must be hard to propitiate said the young jewess in old times after the sacrifice was offered a man was cleansed from sin he had not to cleanse himself by his own pain but you are heathens said avice feeling it a condescension to argue with a jew our religion is better than yours how was hesters rejoinder because we have been redeemed by our lord who died to save us from hell it does not sound like it then why had the little child to go there she did not go there she went to purgatory she went to pain if i understood you rightly why did your messiah not finish his work and keep her from going to pain altogether i cannot answer such wicked questions said avice the church teaches that gods love purifies his servants in purgatory and as soon as their souls are clean they go to heaven our god does better for us than that was hesters quiet answer i do not know what the church is but i suppose gods love is not for gentiles and she relapsed into silence avice sat and spanand thought both of them were terribly ignorant but avice did honestly desire to know gods will and such truth as was in hesters words troubled her and as she thought other words came to her heard years ago from the pulpit of lincoln cathedral and from the long silent lips of that holy bishop grosteste whom she so deeply revered by leaning on christ the bishop had said every true christian rises into true life peace and joy he lives in his life sees light in his light is invigorated with his warmth grows in his strength and leaning on the beloved his soul ascends upwards then for those who loved christ and leaned on him either he must be with them in purgatory and then it would be no pain at all oravice shrank from the alternative that perhaps there was no purgatory at all it is hard to break free from trammels in which we have been held all our lives bertha did not follow the course of her aunts thoughts and wondered why she said after long silence methinks god is enough for his people wherever they are hester also had been thinking and to as much purpose it is written in his name shall the gentiles trust she said and i think if he can love any gentiles it must be kindly and merciful hearts like yours perhaps the great sacrificethe messiah himselfis meant for all men but i think he will finish his work and not leave it incomplete as your priests seem to teach you he will do right by all men if thou meanest our lord replied avice gently and what was right for all and best for us we shall know when we come to him then the little lady knows it now aunt said bertha yes my darling knows it now it may be she knows why her ears were sealed and her tongue bound now that they are unstopped and loosed and i marvel if any voice in the choirs of the angels can be so sweet as hers there was silence for a little while then hester rose i thank you very much for your kindness she said i think i might go home the streets seem quieter now avice went to the door unlatched it and peered forth into the night yes there seems to be no noise in the direction of your quarter now i think you will be safe but if you feel uneasy you can stay the night in this room no thank you replied hester gratefully i will not put you to that trouble you have been very good to me may the god of israel bless you with his blessing avice felt rather uneasy she had always been taught that jews were idolaters and she never imagined that hester could be blessing her in the name of the one living god she fancied that the benediction of some horrible moloch was being called down upon her and feared it accordingly but she answered kindly for unkindness was not in her simple loving godfearing heart hester went out and latched the door behind her i am glad she is gone said bertha i could not feel easy while she was here yet i could not have borne to turn her away without asking you if you would take her in aunt i hope we have not done wrong i hope not indeed replied avice who was not quite easy in her own mind i wonder why it should be so wrong to pity jews and be kind to them it looks so different from all the other commands of our lord different most truly but such causes for wonder were likely to be frequent enough so long as men allowed the traditions of men to run alongside of the infallible word of god and they had no power to read for themselves the real words of the lord who had said to the father of all israel i will bless them that bless thee and curse him that curseth thee but the influx of visitors was not yet over for the evening hester had not been gone long when a heavy rap came on the door come in said avice and uncle dan appeared could you spare a chap a seat think ye said he ive come for a bit o peace weve got thunder and lightning and rain up at smithy shes thunder and ankarets lightning and mildreds rain for shes acrying and elnor and me we re wet to skin wi t so i put my cap on and come here to dry me a

waps is considered a vulgar way of pronouncing the word but it was correct english at the time of which i am writing wasp is really the corrupt pronunciation in the same way they said claps where we say clasp uncle dan i sometimes wonder you do not come and live in lincoln town dost thee think i havent noise enough at smithy but i think you would make friends here and find things pleasanter humph

onceand got knocked down as sharp as ninepins standing up id love to see thee try it thoud not be right end up long bertha had gone upstairs or avice perhaps would not have spoken so plainly though the smith himself had long passed the stage of ignoring his wifes failings in the presence of her children but you are her husband uncle dan i reckon i know that thou would if shed plucked as much of thy whiskers out as she has o mine and wives ought to obey their husbands thoull oblige me by saying so to her and ill be glad to know if thou likes what thoull get you think she cannot be managed not without one o th archangels likes to try ill not say he wouldnt be sorry at after it does seem such a sad way for you to live said avice pityingly grin and bide said dan philosophically grin while i

reckon ill have a rare capful o larks by th sky falling first the sky will fall some day my son said the voice of father thomas behind dan his soft rap had been unheard through dans bass voice and he

buti ask your pardon father but she belongs to tother lot and you dont know her eh you dont so and with an ominous shake of his head and a goodnight to avice and bertha dan passed out our lord could do that father said avice softly certainly my daughter whatsoever the lord pleased that did hein the heavens and in the earth and in the sea and in all depths father thomas had not much of the bibleonly one gospel and a book of psalmsbut what he had he studied well and one page of the word of god will do a great deal for a man with the spirit of god to bring it home to a willing ear and a loving heart may i pray for aunt filomena i am so sorry for uncle dan he is not a bad man and she makes his home unbearable god forgive her by all means pray for both chapter seven a spice of philosophy while dan was thus detailing his troubles in avices kitchen his daughter emma was finishing her days work she was apprenticed to an embroideress for all kinds of embroidery were in much greater use then than now there was no sort of trimming except embroidery and fur there were no such things as printed cottons and not only ladies dresses but gentlemens and all kinds of curtains and hangings were very largely ornamented with the needle mrs de la laund kept eighteen apprentices and they worked in a long narrow room with windows at each endnot glass windows but just square openings where light wind and rain or snow came in together it was about half an hour before it would be time to stop work there was no clock in the room and there were only three in all lincoln clocks such as we have were then unknown they had but two measures of timethe clepsydra or waterclock and the sundial when a man had neither of these he employed all kinds of ingenious expedients for guessing what time it was if the day were cloudy and the sun not to be seen king alfred had invented the plan long before of having candles to burn a certain time the monks knew how long it took to repeat certain psalms mrs de la laund stopped work when the cathedral bell tolled for vespersthat is at four oclock you look tired antigone said emma to her nearest neighbour a pale girl of eighteen tired of course im tired was the unpromising answer wheres the good one must go on she does not like the work said the girl on the other side of her do you responded antigone turning to her the girl gave a little laugh i dont think whether i like it or not she said i like being taught what will get me a living some day i hate it answered antigone why should i have to work for my living when lady margaret up at the castle never needs to put a needle in or out unless she pleases nay youre wrong there my sister justina is scullionmaid at the castle and i am sure from what she tells me you wouldnt like to change with lady margaret my word but i would why not sarah asked emma well replied sarah with a smile antigone likes what she calls a bit of fun when the days work is over and she would not get nearly so much as she does if she were in lady margarets place she dwells in three chambers in her mothers tower and never comes down except to hall namely to meals with now and then a decorous dance under the eyes of the lady countess no running races on the green nor chattering away to everybody nor gamesexcept upstairs in her own room with a few other young damsels antigone would think she was in prison to be used like that and learningwhy she has to learn latin and surgery and heraldry and all sorts of needleworknot embroidery only and cooking and music and i do not know what else how would you like it antigone well at any rate she has a change said antigone with some acerbity not quite the same thing as no work at all for which i thought you were longing and no liberty remember but her gowns sarah her gownsand her hoods and cloaks and everything else did you see her last saint michael id have given a bit of liberty for that orange samite and those lovely blue slippers sarah laughed and gave a little shake of her head i know who is fond of hunt the slipper said she a pretty figure an orange samite gown would cut after an evening of it i think too i would rather be free to go about on my feet than even to wear lovely blue slippers nay antigone you may depend upon it there are less pleasant things in lady margarets life than orange gowns and blue slippers we can have a say about our weddings remember but she will be handed over to somebody she never saw as like as not id rather be as i am mother says folks lots are more even than they like to think poor folks fancy that rich ones have nothing to trouble them worth mention and a sick man thinks if he were only well he would not mind being poor and a man in prison says that if he could but be free he could bear both illness and poverty the truth is everybody thinks his own trouble the worst and yet if we had our neighbours instead nine times out of ten we should be glad to get back to our own we know the worst of them and often we dont of the others so that is why i say id rather be as i am but people look down on you said antigone well let them that wont hurt me answered sarah sarah i do believe youve not a bit of spirit id rather keep my spirit for what it is good forto help me over hard places and along weary bits of road all women have those at times mother says wheres the good of quoting old women they have outlived their youth well at any rate they lived through it and some of them picked up a bit of wisdom by the way you may keep your musty wisdom to yourself i want none of it said antigone scornfully i want all i can get quietly responded sarah mother says if you dont care for it emma may that discontent is the worst companion a girl can have for making everything look miserable youll be a deal happier she says with a dry crust and a good will to it than with a roast ox and a complaining temper ay thats true said emma with a sigh poor emma laughed antigone you get enough of it dont you at the smithy i would rather not talk over my mother and sisters if you please returned emma oh you dont need to take airs my lady i know come let emma be said sarah lets keep our tempers if we havent much else theres the vesper bell antigones work was not likely to be improved by the hasty huddledup style in which it was folded while sarah and emma shook theirs straight and carefully avoided creases they had then to give it in to the mistress who stood at one end of the room putting all away in a large coffer when the last girl had given in her work mrs de la laund called for silence on thursday next said she i shall give you a holiday after dinner the queen comes to lincoln on that day and i wish to give as many as are good girls the chance of seeing her enter but i shall expect to have no creased work like antigones nor split and frayed like genevevas nor dirtied like femianas now you may go they had odd names for girls in those days among the nobles and gentry most were like ours young ladies of rank were alice cicely margaret joan isabel emma or agnes a strange name being the exception but among working women the odd names were then the rule they were yngeleis sabelina orenge pimma cinelote argentella and very many more of the same highsounding kind when the apprentices left the workroom they were free to do as they liked till seven oclock when they must all reassemble there answer to their names called over repeat some prayers after mrs de la laund and go to bed in a large loft at the top of the house characters came out on these occasions the majority showed themselves thoughtless and giddy they went to run races on the green and to play gamesthe better disposed only among themselves but the wild adventurous spirits soon joined a lot of idle youths as unsteady as themselves with whom they spent the evening in rough play loud laughter and not altogether decorous joking the little group of sensible girls kept away from such scenes most of them went to see their friends if within reasonable distance those who had none at hand sat or walked quietly together emma and sarah were among these any person entering lincoln on the following wednesday would plainly have seen that the town was preparing for some great event every house draped itself in some kind of hangingthe rich in coarse silk the poorer in bunting or whatever they could get the iron hoops here and there built into the walls for that purpose held long pinesticks to be lighted as torches after dark and they would need careful watching for a great deal of the city was built of wood and if a spark lighted on the walls a serious fire might be the result in the numerous balconies which projected from the better class of houses sat ladies dressed in their handsomest garments on the thursday morning and below in the street stood men and women packed tightly into a crowd waiting for the queen to arrive there was not much room in a mediaeval street and the sheriffs did not find it easy to keep a clear passage for the royal train as to keeping any passage for the traffic that would have been considered quite unnecessary there was not much to keep it for and what there was could go round by back streets just as well as not few people set any value on time in the middle ages queen alianora was expected to arrive about twelve oclock she was not the queen eleanor of whom we read at the beginning of the story for alianora is only one of the old ways of spelling eleanor but her daughterinlaw the lady alianora who had been a friend to the dumb princess she was a spanish lady and was one of the best and loveliest queens who ever reigned in england goodness and beauty are not always found in companyperhaps i might say not often but they went together with her she was a spanish blondewhich means that her hair was a bright shade of goldenneither flaxen nor red and that her eyes were a deep deep bluethe blue of a southern sky such as we rarely if ever see in an english one her complexion was fair and rosy her features regular and beautiful her figure extremely elegant and wellproportioned the crowd though goodhumoured was beginning to get tired when she came at last the queen who was not quite thirty years of age rode on a white horse whose scarlet saddlecloth was embroidered with golden lions and roses and which was led by garcia her spanish master of the horse she was dressed in green samite trimmed with ermine on her left hand rode the earl of lincoln on her right her eldest surviving son the little prince alphonso who was only seven years old he died at the age of eleven after the queen rode her two damsels aubrey de caumpeden and ermetrude and after them and the officers of the household came a number of lesser people the mob of sightseers closing in and following them up the street see note her majesty rode up steephill to the castle where the countess of lincoln and her daughter lady margareta girl of about fifteenreceived her just inside the gate then the mob cheered the queen looked back with a smile and a bow the almoner flung a handful of silver pennies among them the portcullis was hauled down and the sight was over as emma turned back from the castle gate she met her father and her sister eleanor who like her had been sightseeing well said dan did thou see her oh yes beautifully answered emma isnt she handsome father handsome is as handsome does philosophically returned dan some folks looks mighty handsome as doesnt do even to it she was just like a pictur when i wed her ay she was sowhere art thou going emma i thought of looking in on aunt avice father are you and eleanor coming too im not said eleanor im going to see laurentia atte gate so ill wish you good even she kept straight on while dan and emma turned off for avices house it was not surprising that they found nobody at home but the turnspit dog who was sufficiently familiar with both to wag a welcome but somebody sat in the chimneycorner who was not at home but was a visitor like themselves when the door was unlatched father thomas closed the book he had been reading and looked up good even father said dan to the priest i reckon youve come o th same errand as us what is that my son dan sat down on the form and put a big hand on each knee well its someat like t shepherd comin to count t sheep to see at none of ems missin said he its so easy to get lost of a big moor full o pits and quagmires and this worlds someat like itah avice folks as goes asightseeing mun expect to find things of a mixtur when they gets home a very pleasant mixture uncle said avice pray you of your blessing holy father father thomas gave it and bertha stooping down kissed dan on his broad wrinkled forehead did thou get a penny asked dan i got two cried bertha triumphantly and aunt avice got one did you father nay lassnone o my luck silver pennies and such knows better nor to come my way nor theyd better not without theyll come right number i should get tore to bits if i went home wi one as like as not she d want it and so d ankaret and so d susanna and so d mildred and atwixt em all it d get broke i pieces and so should i and see thou its made i quarters and i amnt so it wouldnt come so convenient to me pennies were then made with a deep cross cut athwart them so that they were easily broken when wanted into halfpence and farthings for there were no separate ones coined father have one of mine cried bertha at the beginning of dans answer nay nay lass keep thy bit o silveror if thou wants to give it let emma have it shell outlive it i shouldnt the silver penny changed hands at once avice had meanwhile been hanging up her hood and cloak and she now proceeded to prepare a dish of eggs foreseeing company to supper supper was exceedingly early today as it was scarcely three oclock but dinner had been equally so for nobody wanted to be busy when the queen came a large dish of eggs and butter was speedily on the tablethe buttered eggs of the north of england which are i believe identical with the scrambled eggs of the united states the party sat down to supper father thomas being served with a trencher to himself and how dost thou get along wi thy missis my lass said dan to his daughter oh things is very pleasant as yet father answered emma with a smile theres a mixture as you said just now somes decent lasses enough and somes foolish and somes middlin theres most of the middlin ones im fain to hear it said dan lasses is so foolish i should ha thought there d be most o that lot so s lads too eh its a queer world this un mortal queer but i asked thee how thou got on with thy missis and thou tells me o th lasses never did know a woman answer straight off ask most on em how far it is to newark and theyll answer you that t wind was west as they come fro barling thou hast not a good opinion of women my son said father thomas who looked much amused ive seen too much on em responded dan conclusively ive got a wife and six lasses bertha wed better mind our ways said emma laughing nay its none you was dans comment youre middlin decent you two sos avice and sos old christophers regina i know of neer another without it s t catand she scratches like t rest when shes put out there is other decent uns happen they havent come my way yet why father cried emma think

different sorts child somes snowy white when so be theyve none been i th ashhole and somes tabby and somes black as iron but they all scrats womens like emyoure wise men you parsons and such as have nought to do wi em old christopher my neighbour up at smithy he says weddins like a bag full o snakes wi one eel amongst em you ha to put your hand in and you may get th eel but if you dunnawhy youve got to do t best you can wi one o t other lot if youll keep your hand out of the bag youll stand best chance of not getting bit it is a pity thou wert not a monk my son said the priest whose gravity seemed hard to keep ay it is was dans hearty response im alway fain to pass a nunnery says i to myself theres a bonnie lot o snakes safe tied up out o folkses way theyll never fly at nobody no more im fain for the men as hasnt got em ay i am avice and her young cousins laughed do you think they never fly at one another uncle dan asked the former let em returned that gentleman with much cordiality a man gets a bit o peace then its t only time he does if theyd just go and make a reglar end o one another but they never doesand the smith pushed away his trencher with a sigh well i reckon i mun be going she gave me while fourand im feared o vesper bell ringing afore i can get home therell be more bells nor one if so god be wi ye lasses good even father and the door was shut on the unhappy husband of the delightful filomena emma took leave soon after and bertha went with her to see another friend before she returned to her employers house avice and the priest were left alone for a few minutes both were silent but perhaps their thoughts were not very unlike i wish under your leave father said avice at length that somebody would say a word to aunt filomena i am afraid both she and uncle dan are very ignorant truly so am i and it should be some one who knows better i doubt if he quite means all he says but he thinks too ill of womenand indeed with five such as he has at home who can wonder at it he has no peace from morning to night and he is naturally a man who loves peace and quietas you are yourself holy father unless i mistake thou art not mistaken my daughter said father thomas something inside him was giving him a sharp prick or two did he love quiet too much so as to interfere with his duties to his fellowmen and then something else inside the priests heart rose up as it were to press down the question and bid the questioner be silent i wonder said avice innocently quite unaware of the course of her companions thoughts whether if aunt filomena knew her duty better she might not give poor uncle dan a little more rest he is good in his way and as far as he knows i wish i knew more but then avice concluded with a little laugh i am only a woman yet thou art evidently one of the few whom he likes and respects answered the priest be it thine my daughter to show him that women are not all of an evil sort do thy best up to the light thou hast and cry to god for more light so that thou mayest know how to do better pour forth thy prayers to him as saith the collect for the first sunday after the epiphany that thou mayest know what thy duty requires of thee and be able to comply with what thou knowest it is a good prayer and specially for them that are perplexed concerning their duty see note but when one does know ones duty asked avice with simplicity it seems so hard to make ones self do it didst thou ever yet do that daughter dost thou believe in the holy ghost avices immediate answer was what would be the instinctive unthinking response of most professing christians why father of course i do good what dost thou believe avice was silent ah said the priest it is easy to think we believe but hard to put our faith into plain words if the faith were clearer maybe the words would follow it is so difficult to get things clear and plain sighed poor avice have one thing clear daughterthe way between god and thine own soul let nothing come in to block up thathowever fair howsoever dear it be and thou shalt have thy reward father is it like keeping other things clear the way to have the floor clear and clean is to sweep it every morning ay my daughter sweep it every morning with the besom of prayer and every night bear over it the torch of selfexamination so shall the evil insects not make their nests there i dont quite know how to examine myself said avice and thou wilt err answered father thomas if thou set about that work alone with a torch lighted at the flame of thine own righteousness light thy torch at the fire of gods altar examine thyself by the light of his holy law and do it at his feet so that whatever evil thing thou mayest find thou canst take at once to him to be cleansed away content not thyself with brushing away thoughts but go to the root of that same sin in thine own heart say not i should not have spoken proudly to my neighbourbut i should not be proud in my heart deal rather with the root that is in thee than with the branches of acts and words there are sins which only to think of is to do take to our lord then thy sins to be cleansed away but let thine own thoughts dwell not so much on thy sins thy deeds done and words said but rather on thy sinfulness the inward fount of sin in thy nature that were ugly work said avice ay i reckon thou countest not the scouring of thy floor among thine enjoyments but it is needful my daughter and is it no enjoyment to see it clean ay that it is admitted avice i remember my child many years agothou wert but a little maidthat holy bishop robert came to sup with thy grandmother muriel tell me wouldst thou have been satisfiedi say not as a little child since children note not such thingsbut as a woman wouldst thou have been satisfied to receive the holy bishop with a dirty floor and offer to him an uncleansed spoon to put to his lips oh no father surely not then see daughter that when the bishop of thy soul lifteth the latch to come in and sup with thee he find not the soiled floor and the unclean vessel and turn sorrowfully away saying i thought to sup with my child this night but this is no place for me trust me thou wilt lose more than he if he close the door and depart avices eyes filled with tears o father pray for me i cannot bear to think of that father thomas rose and laid his hand on avices head his words as coming from a priest rather surprised her my child he said softly let us pray for each other avice stood looking out of the window after him as he went down the street i wonder she said to herself if our lord ever turned away thus because father thomass chamber was not clean he seemed to know what it was so wellyet how could such a good holy man know anything about it note aubrey is now a mans name only but in the earlier hall of the middle ages it was used for both sexes note this collect was slightly altered from that in the sarum missal the form here quoted is the older one chapter eight as a little child if you put a single straw into an eddying stream other straws and bits of rubbish of all sorts will come and join it until by and bye it looks like a little island in the midst of the water and we often see something like this going on in mens minds a man drops one idea which another man takes up and considers till ideas of his own come to join it many things seen and heard contribute their help and at last the single sentence grows into a mountain of action avice would have been astonished if any one had told her that she had made an island but her simple suggestion fell like an odd straw into the stream of father thomass thoughts and grew and grew there until a few days later it led to decided action father thomas was by nature a quiet man his temper was gentle and even he hated everything like noise and bustle far more tumult and quarrelling he was not fond even of conversation except now and then as a pleasant variety to a quiet life full of thinking and reading a man of this sort is generally an innocent manby which i mean a man who does no harm to his neighbours and considering how many men and women spend their lives in doing their neighbours harm of one sort or another that is a good deal to say of any man but there is another point to be taken into account namely what good does such a man do why no more than a chrysalis and he is a poor specimen of manhood who is content to be of no more use in the world than a chrysalis and to be as little missed when he goes out of it this was the point which troubled father thomass meditations it was as if an angel had come down to him and pointed to the old smithy on the green and said what are you doing for those people god will demand an account of their souls some day and from somebody are you not your brothers keeper hitherto father thomas had gone on very comfortably with a reflection which serves a great many of us to excuse our pride or our lazinessi wish it might never be heard again from human lipsit is not my place it was true in one sense the smithy was in newport parish and father thomas belonged to the cathedral he tried to quiet the angelwhich was really his own consciencewith the thought that he had no business to intrude into somebody elses parish but the angel would not be quiet will god take that answer at the judgment day he said you know very well that the vicar of newport is an idle careless man who never troubles himself about the souls of his people that so long as you observe the proper forms of civility and ask his leave to visit these people he will give it you in a minute and be glad enough to think he is saved the trouble that is the truth and you know it now it is very unpleasant when ones conscience says in that blunt downright cutting way you know it and father thomas found it so he made a few more excuses which his conscience blew to the winds before they were well finished and at last it laid hold of him as it were by the shoulders and said look there father thomas looked thereat the cross which then hung in every clergymans room there were two lines carved on the wood at the bottom of thislines which it was then not unusual to put at the bottom of these crosses this did i for thee what dost thou for me look there cried the angel conscience christ bore that heavy cross for youbore the reviling and the agony the spitting the scourging and the shame and you wont face the vicar of newport for him you cant walk half a mile and ask a civil question of a man from whom you expect a civil answer for love of the man who came down all the way from heaven to earth and endured all the contradiction of sinners for threeandthirty years and faced all the malice of the devil for the love of you are you ashamed of yourself thomas de vaux or are you not when it reached that point father thomas was painting in a book books in those days were often ornamented with very beautiful paintings and the one on which the priest was working represented peter denying christ in the high priests palace he had just painted one side of peters hair but the other side was still blank but when the angel asked that question down went the brush lord pardon thy servant said father thomas humbly i am not worthy to carry so much as the corner of thy cross after thee but i will take it up and go forth indeed i did not know i was such a selfish lazy easeloving man as i am saint peter had to put up with only half his hair for the rest of that day for father thomas determinately washed and wiped his brush threw a cloth over his book and painting tools to keep them from the dust put on his fur cap and went off to see the vicar of newport when a man braces himself up to do something which he does not like for the love of god sometimes god makes it a great deal easier and less disagreeable than he expected to find it the vicar was just coming out of his door as father thomas reached it a fine daypeace be with thee said he whither go you brother may i have your leave father to visit one of your parishionersthe smith that dwells about a mile hence on the newport road the saints love you you may visit every man jack of my parishioners and take my blessing with you said the vicar with a hearty laugh i am not over fond of that same visiting of smiths and tailors and fellows of that sort i never know what to say to them save hear confession and they never have nought to say to me you are cut from another quality of stuff i reckon go your way brother thomas and make decent christians of them if you can theres a shebear lives there i wish you luck with her and with a farewell nod the careless vicar strode away and into such hands as these mens souls are given thought father thomas lord purify thy church ah dear old bishop you might well weep in dying he walked on rapidly till he came within sight of the forge daniel greensmiths ringing blows on the anvil grew more and more distinct and at last the words he was singing as he worked came to the priests ears all things turn unto decay fall and die and pass away sinketh tower and droppeth wall cloth shall fray and horse shall fall flesh shall die and iron rust pass and perish all things must well i understand and say all shall die both priest and lay and small time for praise or blame when man dieth lives his fame note this is translated from an old french poem written before the time of the story father thomas stopped beside the anvil but the smiths back was turned so that he did not see him a sad song my friendif that were all eh said dan looking behind him and then immediately throwing down the hammer and giving a pull to his forelock great respect was paid to priests at that day axe your pardon father didnt see who it were i came to see thy wife my son shall i go forward not if youre o my mind happen you arent is she not at home oh ay shes at home the smiths tone might have meant that he could have wished she was somewhere else father thomas waited till dan flung down the hammer and looked up at him had ye eer a mother asked he ay replied the priest was she one at took th andirons to you when you didnt suit her truly no she was a full good and gentle woman and had ye eer a sister ay three was they given to rugging your hair when they wasnt pleased not at all my son ah youd best go home i reckon what meanest thou asked father thomas feeling much amused at the very unusual style of dans reception well said dan passing his fingers through his hair i mean if thats the way you was fetched up you dont know the animal youve got to deal with here theres five dragons i that house o mine and each on ems got teeth and claws and they knows how to use em they does if one on em wernt a bit better nor tothers and did not come and stand by me now and then i should neer ha lived to talk to you this even nay i shouldnt best go home father while youve getten a coat on your back and some hair on your head is it so bad as that ah it is was dans short but emphatic reply but surely my son thy wife would never use a man ill that meant her good think shell stop to ask your meanin said dan with a contemptuous grunt if shes not changed sin i come fro dinner shell be atop of you before you can say mercy and shes none a comfortable thing to have atop of you i give you fair warning how was she at supper thenno better supper i durstnt go in for no supper i likes hunger better nor a fray happen elnor ll steal out to me with a crust after dark she does sometimes and how long does it take thy wife to cool down dan rubbed his forehead with his blackened hand i was wed to her said he th year afore the great frost if you know when that wereand id better have been fruz a deal ive had it mortal hot ever since shes had that time to cool down in and shes no cooler nor she were then rather if either tother way on i reckon before father thomas could reply the shrillest scream that had ever met his ears came out of the window of the smithy ankaret it said ankaret ankaret ha thats her whispered dan as if he were awed by the sound an answering scream as shrill but scarcely so loud came from the neighbouring cottage whatever do you want now said the second shriek what dost thou yonder thou slatternly minx returned the first ill mash every bone of thee if thou doesnt come in this minute then i shant shrieked the second voice two can play at that who is ankaret asked father thomas of the smith shes th eldest o th dragonsthats our ankret said dan in the same halffrightened whisper if you mun face her youd best do it while ankrets next door both on ems too much for any man th angel gabriel couldnt match the pair on em leastwise if he comes down to axe me i shant send him forward and dont you go and say i sent you now for pitys sake dont father thomas walked off and knocked at the house door he was beginning to think that if the former part of his task had been easier than he expected the latter was going to prove more difficult the door was opened by a young woman good day my daughter is thy mother within shes here father pray you come in the priest stepped inside and sat down on a bench for those times the house was comfortable and it was very clean the young woman disappeared and presently a pair of heavy boots came clattering down the stairs and father thomas felt pretty sure that the sweet filomena herself stood before him now then what do you want quoth she in a tone which did not sound as if she were delighted to see her visitor my daughter i am a priest said father thomas gently and i am come to see thee for thy good ive got eyes snapped filomena cant i see youre a priest whats the good of such as you fat lazy fellows that lives on the best o the land wrung out of the hard earnings o the poor and never does a stroke o work theirselves but sits atwirling o their thumbs all day long thats what you arethe whole boiling of you get you out o my house or ill help you and filomena took up a formidablelooking mop which stood in the corner as if to let the priest clearly understand the sort of help which she proposed to give him she had tried this style of reception when the vicar took the liberty of calling on her some months before with the result that the appalled gentleman in question never ventured to renew his visit and told the anecdote with many shakes of the head over that shebear up at the smithy she understood how to deal with a man of the vicars stamp and she mistakenly fancied that all priests were of his sort sadly too many of them were such lazy careless selfindulgent men who having just done as much work as served to prevent the bishop or their consciences when they kept any from becoming troublesome let all the rest go and thought their duty done but father thomas as the vicar had said was cut from another kind of stuff very sensitive to rudeness or unkindness his feelings were not permitted to override his duty of perseverance and while he dearly loved peace he was not ready to buy it at the cost of something more valuable than itself while he might be slow to see his duty yet once seen it would not escape him again the personal taunts which filomena had launched at him he simply put aside as not worth an answer they did not apply to him he was neither fat nor lazy and if filomena were so ignorant as to fancy that the clergy were paid out of the earnings of the poor what did it matter when he knew they were not he went straight to the root of the thing his words were gentle enough but his tone was one of authority daughter what an unhappy woman thou art filomenas fingers slowly unclosed from the mop which fell back into the corner father thomas said no more he merely kept his eyes upon her his calm dignity took effect at last her angry eyes fell before his unchanged look she was not accustomed to hear her abuse answered in this manner i just am she muttered with intense bitterness dost thou wish to be happy thats none for the like of us its only for rich folks isnt thatfolks as has all they wants and a bit over no man has that said father thomas except the little children who sit at the feet of jesus christ become thou as a little child and happiness shall come to seek thee me a little child there was no merriment in the laugh which accompanied the words ay even thou for if there be a new creature in christ old things pass away behold all things are made new note corinthians five vulgate version that is the very childhood my daughterto be made new will thou have it it may be had for the asking if it be asked of god by a true heartthat childhood of grace which is meek patient gentle loving obedient humble for it is not thou that canst conquer satan but christ in thee that shall first conquer thee thou in christthis is safety christ in theehere is strength seek and thou shalt find farewell and without giving filomena time to answer father thomas turned away and was lost in a moment behind the bushes which separated the cottage from the smithy she stood for a minute where he left her as if she had been struck to stone the whole style of his address was to her something completely new and so unlike anything she had expected that for once in her life she was at a loss filomena took up the corner of her apron and wiped her forehead as if she were settling her brains into their places well thats a queer setout said she at last to nobody for she was left alone me a baby whatever would the fellow be at i reckon i was one once eh but it would be some queer to get back again what did he say meek patient gentle loving obedient humble thats not me old dan wouldnt think hed picked up his own wife if i were made new o that fashion it didnt sound so bad though wonder how it d be if i tried it that chap said it would make me happy im none that neither nor havent been these many years eh deary me to think of me a baby while these extremely new ideas were seething in filomenas mind father thomas reached the smithy glad to see you said dan laying down his hammer you did not bide so long with a grim smile long enough said the priest shortly i believe you if you wasnt glad to get your back turned you liked a tussle wi a dragon better nor most folks was she whitehot or nobut only red elnor she came down to me while you was in there wi a hunch o bread and cheese and she said it were gettin smoother a bit nor it had been most part o th day what said she to you less than i said to her you dunnot mean she hearkened you not at first but in the end she hearkened me and made me no answer dan looked his visitor all over from head to foot well said he and shook his head slowly well and wiped his face with his apron well he exclaimed a third time if id ha knowed id ha given forty marks note to see th like o that eh do bide a minute and let me take th measure on you t chap that could strike our filomena dumb mun ha come straight fro heaven for there isnt his like o earth now father do just tell a body what did you say to her i told her how to be happy dan stared she wants no tellin that ill go bail shes got every mortal thing her own way that is not the way to be happy answered the priest nay my son she is a most unhappy woman and her face shows it thou art happier far than she dan dropped the big hammer in sheer astonishment and if father thomas had not made a rapid retreat more than his eyes and ears would have told him so me happier nor our filomena me father dunnot be angered wi me but either youre downright silly or youre somewhat more nor other folks i have told thee the truth my son now wilt thou do somewhat to help thy wife to be happy if she is happy she will be humble and meek happy that is in the way i mean ill do aught as ll make our filomena meek replied dan with a shake of his grizzled head but how thats going to be shaped beats me i can tell you mun i climb up to th sky and stick nails into th moon nay said the priest with a smile thou shalt pray god to make her as a little child thats a corker that is dan picked up the hammer and began meditatively to fashion a nail our ankret were a babby once said he as if to himself she were a bonnie un too she were so i used to sit o th bench at th door of an even wi her on my knee asmilin up likeeh father but ill tell you what if them times could come back it d be enough to make a chap think hed getten into heaven by mistake i trust my son thou wilt some day find thee in heaven not by mistake said the priest but if so daniel thou must have a care to go the right road thither which roads that father it is a straight road my son and it is a narrow road and the door to it goes right through the cross whereon jesus christ died for thee and me daniel dost thou love the lord jesus well you see father im not much acquaint wi him hes a great way up and im down here i t smithy he will come down here and abide with thee my son if thou wilt but ask him so dear he loveth man that he will come any whither on earth save into sin if so be he may have mans company greater than this love hath no man that he give his life for his friends well that stands to reason said dan when man gives his life he gives all there is of him thou sayest well and is it hard to love man that giveth his life to save thine i reckon it d be harder to help it father father thomas turned as if to go my son said he wilt thou let the lord jesus say to the angels round his thronei gave all there was of me for daniel greensmith and he doth not love me for it the big smith had never had such an idea presented to him before his simple transparent childlike nature came up into his eyes and ran over men did not think it in those earlier ages any discredit to their manliness to let their hearts be seen perhaps they were wiser than we are eh father but you never mean itd be like that cried poor dan somehow it never come real to me like as youve put it do you mean at he caresthat it makes any matter to him up yonder whether old dan at t smithy loves him or not im nobut a common smith theres hundreds just like me does he really care think you thou art a man said the priest and it was for men christ died and there is none other of thee though there were millions like thee is a true mother content with any babe in exchange for her own because there are hundreds of babes in the world nay daniel greensmith it was for thee the lord christ shed his blood on the cruel cross and it is thyself whose love and thanksgivings he will miss though all the harps of all the angels make music around his ear shall he miss them any longer my son once more dan threw aside the big hammerthis time on the inner side of the smithy father said he youve knocked me clean oer i never knowed till now as it were real as a little child said father thomas to himself as he went back to lincoln the road into the kingdom will be far smoother for him than her yet the good lord can lead them both there the very next visit that dan paid to avice and bertha showed them plainly that a change of some sort had come over him and as time went on they saw it still more plainly his heart had opened to the love of christ like a flower to the sunlight the moment that he really saw him he accepted him with how many is it not the case that they do not love christ because they do not know him and they do not know him because no one of those who do puts him plainly before them it was much longer before father thomas and avice saw any fruit of their prayers for filomena there was so much more to undo in her case than in her husbands that the growth was a great deal slower and less apparent avice discovered that dans complaints were fewer but she set it down entirely to the change in himself long before she noticed that filomenas voice was less sharp and her fats of fury less frequent but at length the day came when filomena having been betrayed into a very mild copy of one of her old storms of temper would suddenly catch herself up and walk determinately out of the back door till she grew cool and when she came back would lay her hand upon her husbands shoulder and say dan old man im sorry i was bad to thee forgive me and dan at first astounded beyond measure grew to accept this conclusion as a matter of course and to say let her alone and shell come round and then avices eyes were opened one day when she was unusually softened by the death of susannas baby filomena opened her heart to her niece eh avice its hard work nobody knows how hard that hasnt had a temper as mastered em ive pretty nigh to bite my tongue through many a time a day i wish id begun sooneri do itd ha come easier a deal then but im trying hard and i hope our lordll help me thou does think hell help me doesnt thou avice im not too bad am i father thomas says aunt replied avice that god helps all those who want his help and the worse we are the more we want of his mercy thats true said filomena and father thomas says continued avice that we must all go to our lord just like little children ready to take what he sees good for us and telling him all our needs of body and soul as a child would tell its mother they were walking slowly up steephill when avice said this father thomas has one apt scholar said the priests unexpected voice behind her but it was a greater than i my daughter who told his disciples that whosoever did not receive the kingdom of god as a little child should in no wise enter therein note a mark was shillings pence and was the largest piece of money then known the end

segregation slave of the court the mercy of the lord god movesn a mystere'ras way iswon derstuper form craddock was polishing the brass of his safety valve and singing the while at high pressure between set teeth his choice of a ditty determined by one of his transitory lapses into conventional righteousness the cause of which in the present instance being an equally transient admiration for a good little eurasian girl fresh from her convent as the sun which shines equally on the just and the unjust flamed on his red face and glowed from his corn coloured beard it seemed to me waiting in the comparative coolth of the pointsman's mud oven shelter till the one mail train of the day should appear and disappear leaving the ribbon of rail which spanned the desert world to its horizon free for our passaging that both he and his engine radiated heat that they gave out as the burning bush or the flaming swords of the paradise protectors must have given out a message of fiery warning that suited the words he sang eplants 'isfootsteps inthesea craddock punctuated the rhythm with an appropriate stop of shrill steam which ought to have startled me but it did not because my outward senses had suddenly become slaves to my memory the desert was a garden full of cool fragrance which comes with the close of an indian day and the only sound to be heard in it was a glad young voice repeating these words oh god of the battle have mercy have mercy have mercy bravo young bertram said someone even those who scarcely knew whether bertram were his christian or his surname called him that easy to see you're fresh from the higher standard young bertram smiled down on us from the plinth of the marble steps leading up to the marble summer house which stood in the centre of this garden of dead kings posed there on his pedestal holding orb like in his raised right hand the battered bronze cannon ball whose inscription roughly lettered in snaky spirals he had just translated young bertram reminded me of the young apollo you bet he answered gaily but what does it mean here on this blessed ball who knows the story for there is one of course the company looked at me partly because as a civilian such knowledge was expected of me mostly because i was responsible for the invasion of this peaceful eastern spot by a restless curious horde of westerns my only excuse for the desecration being that as the most despicable product of our indian rule a grass widower bound to entertain i had naturally clutched at the novelty of a picnic supper and dance some few miles out of the station perhaps had i seen the garden first i might have relented but i took it on trust from my orderly who assured me it held all things necessary for my salvation including a marble floor on which a drugget could be stretched it held much more there was in it an atmosphere not all orange blossom and roses though these drugged the senses which to my mind made a touch of tragedy lurk even in our laughter though in sooth we brought part of the tragedy with us for a frontier war was on and all the men and half the women present knew that the route might come any moment some few i as chief district officer the colonel and his adjutant were aware that it probably would come before morning but ours were not the sober faces our plans were laid all things even the arrangements for the women and the children and the unfit for service were cut and dried but the certainty that someone must as the phrase runs take over documents and the uncertainty as to who the unlucky beggar would be lent care to a young heart or two not however to young bertram as he stood questioning me with his frank blue eyes even the white garments he had donned because he said it might be a beastly time before he wore decent togs again told the same tale as his glad voice the tale of that boundless hope which holds ever the greatest tragedy of life who is that pretty boy said a low soft voice at my elbow i did not answer the spoken question of the voice but as i replied to the unspoken question of many eyes i was conscious that of all the many incongruous elements i had imported into that eastern garden this western woman who had appraised young bertram's beauty was the most incongruous it was not the paris frock and hat purchased on the way out she had only rejoined her husband the day before which made her so it was the woman inside them i knew the type so well and my soul rose in revolt that she should soil his youth with her approval i've no doubt there are stories i replied but i don't happen to know them i'm as much a stranger here as you all are so come let us look round till it's dark enough to dance dark enough to sit out he means said someone to the paris frock and hat whereat there was a laugh but not so general and not half so hearty as the one which greeted young bertram's gravity as he replaced the cannon ball on the plinth with the profound remark something about a woman you bet do introduce me pleaded the paris frock and hat as the lad came down bearing the brunt of chaff gallantly but i pretended not to hear though i knew such diplomacy was vain with women of her type women whose refinement makes them shameless yes she was a strange anomaly in that garden though heaven knows it appealed frankly enough to the senses so frankly that it absorbed even such meretricious western additions as cosy corners and iced champagne on tables laid for two without encroaching a hair's breadth on the inviolable spiritual kingdom of the ivory orange blossom the silver jasmine stars even the red hearts of the roses they were lighting up the lines of the cressets about the dancing floor when we began to reassemble and as each star of light quivered into being the misty unreal radiance grew around the fretted marble of the summer house until arch and pilaster seemed to lose solidity and the whole building leaving its body behind in shining sleep found freedom ass a palace of dreams and there as a foreground to its mystical beauty was young bertram dangling his long legs from the pedestal and nursing the battered old bronze ball on his lap as if it had been a baby i've found out all about it he said cheerfully that chap he pointed to a figure below him told me a splendid yarn and if you lite he turned to me as they haven't done lighting up yet and we can't dance till they finish he could tell it again i could translate you know for those who can't understand the innocent pride made me smile until the paris frock said i shall be so grateful if you will mr bertram in a tone of soft friendliness which proclaimed her success and my failure both however i recognised were inevitable when i remembered that she was the wife of the lad's captain a silent bullet headed briton of whom he chose to make a hero as boys will of older men who are not worthy to unlatch their shoes the figure rose and salaamed it was that of a professional snake charmer who had evidently come in hopes of being allowed to exhibit his skill for his flat basket of snakes slung to a bambu yoke lay beside him and it was about a woman as i said continued young bertram with the same innocent pride she was of his tribe the snaky tribe and so of course he knows about it all i had my doubts the man looked a cunning scoundrel but there was an awkward five minutes to fill up so chairs and cushions were requisitioned and on them and the marble steps we circled round to listen the paris dress i noticed choosing the latter close to the translator he performed his task admirably catching not only the meaning of the words but the rhythm of the snake charmer's voice and so quickly too that the message for the east and for the west seemed one yet it seemed to come from neither of the speakers 'oh god of the battle have mercy have mercy have mercy' such was her prayer to the bright one and this is the tale of it straight was her soul as the saraph who tempted eve mother but crooked her body as snakes that deal death in the darkness crookt in her childhood crookt in the siege of the town by a spent shot which struck her asleep in her cradle the ball that you nurse on your knee sahib they found it beside her her crushed limbs caressing the foe that destroyed her she grew in this garden a cripple but fair still of face and twice cursed in such gifts of beauty all barren and bitter so bitter she veiled it away hiding loveliness hatefulness both from the eyes of the others a soul stricken sore ere the battle began yet insatiate of life insatiate of blessing and cursing insatiate of power and look you she gained it most strangely for fluttering through thickets like birds that are wounded and dragging herself like a snake to the blossoms she threaded the jasmine to necklets and pressed out the roses to perfume so giving to women uncrippled love lures for the fathers of sons hid in the jasmine and screened by the trails of the roses here on this spot stood her chamber of charm for the secret distilling of itr the silent repeating of ritual the murmur of musical mantras and none dare to enter since death lurked unseen in the thickets and serpents her kinsmen slid swift to the threshold to guard it and watched with still eyes her command 'it was witchcraft' they said with a shudder those fortunate women yet came in the dusk for her charms but she gave them not always for years brought her wisdom she learnt the love lore of the flowers the close starry heart of the jasmine the open red heart of the rose told their dream of fair death through the ripening of seed and her voice would grow bitter with scorn 'go find your own lures for your lovers i work for the seed for the harvest of men' high perched on the wall of the city the balcony women waxed wroth it was money to them till the cripple who fought them with flowers prevailed in the battle for life to the world and narghiza the chief of them all felt her youth on the wane so one night in the darkness ere dawning men crept to the garden where only the women might enter men heated by wine and by lust inflamed by the balcony lies yea the witch who wrought evil to all who had killed gulanar in her prime by a wasting whose frown was a curse must be reckoned with killed and her devilish chamber destroyed but the sound of the rustling leaves as the snakes slid soft in the darkness made even the wine bibbers think so that secret and soft as the snakes in the thickets they crept back to safety till there in the darkness the fragrance of flowers but one man remained a man who grew old beautiful tired of the life he had squandered and reckless yet angered because of the girl who had wasted to death a girl he had paid for 'cowards' he said with a smile and crept on in the dark a rustle but not of a snake in the leaves a faint glimmer of white and a voice such a beautiful voice 'in this garden of women what seek you my lord' 'i seek you for your death' but as swift as his hand with the dagger around him there rose in a shimmering shelter the wide hooded curves of the serpents their still watchful eyes giving out a cold gleaming that shone like a halo about her 'what harm have i done' such a beautiful voice 'come and see if you will' on his head fell the spent leaves of roses the frail stars of jasmine were hers as she dragged herself on and he followed through darkness and fragrance and flowers the serpents lay thick on the threshold she stayed them with this 'wait friends till he touches me' opened the door and said scornfully 'there stands my charm' the dim light of the cresset showed emptiness save for yon ball with its legend 'tis scratched as you see in the shape of a snake sahib she read it aloud and then turned to him 'yea that is all i appeal to the god of the battle of life and i call unto him to have mercy have mercy have mercy what mercy he chooses ' her voice sank to silence the cresset's dim light showed the folds of her veiling to him and to her showed his beauty of face as he knelt to her crippledom 'mercy' his voice was a whisper 'have mercy the charm lies within let me see it' his hand sought the folds of her veil and responsive the shelter of snakes rose about her 'wait friends till he touches me' swift with quick fear in it came the stern warning and then there was silence oh beautiful night with spent stars of the jasmine spent leaves of the roses spent life nigh to death 'mid its darkness its fragrance oh beautiful face free of veiling with spent stars of eyes and spent rose leaves of lips 'my beloved' like a sigh came the whisper and slowly as stars in the evening their eyes grew to brightness and closer and closer their lips grew to kisses 'wait friends till he touches me' that was her order and swift to the second the snakes struck between them oh beautiful death by the kiss of a lover oh merciful poison of passion the sing song ceased and as if to take its place the first notes of the liebestraum waltz sounded from the rose and jasmine thicket in which the band had been concealed that's a mercy of the lord anyhow laughed some young philistine i thought they'd never stop or the band begin in a moment the listening circle had changed into an eager hurrying of couples towards the dancing floor but young bertram still sat on the pilaster nursing the old bronze ball his glad young face strangely sober i think this is our dance said the paris frock in a voice of icy allurement which positively rasped my nerves young bertram sprang to the ground hastily i beg your pardon by george what's that he had upset one of the snake charmer's flat baskets and there was a general stampede as the occupants slid out don't be alarmed i cried they always have their fangs drawn and he will get them back in a moment even as i spoke the hollow quavering of the charmer's gourd flute began and three snakes stayed their flight to sit up on their tails and sway drowsily to the rhythm there was a fourth one wasn't there said young bertram it slipped our way didn't it he spoke to the paris frock which had taken refuge on the opposite pilaster so that the whole expanse of the wide marble steps now lay between them huzoor no interrupted the owner of the snakes hastily there were but three there could only have been three for see my serpents obey me he was slipping the brutes back to prison again as he spoke but i noticed his eyes were restless are you quite sure i asked he gave me a furtive glance then carelessly held up a loathsome five footer cobras like these are very easily counted huzoor besides as the presence said they are all fangless the one whose jaws he as carelessly prized open certainly was and i should have dismissed doubt had not young bertram at that moment taken up the flute gourd and with the gay remark let me have a shot at it commenced out of fastidiousness as to the mouthpiece no doubt to blow into it upside down i never saw fear better expressed in any face than on the snake charmer's when he heard the indescribable sound which echoed out into the garden it grew green as without the least ceremony he snatched the instrument away the presence must not do that the snakes do not like strangers young bertram laughed nor the noise i expect the beastly thing makes a worse row wrong side up than right doesn't it what the paris frock replied i do not know as they were already hurrying up to make the most of the remaining dance not that there was any necessity for hurry to judge by the number of times i saw his white raiment and her fancy frills floating round together during the next hour or so the adjutant a man i particularly disliked possibly because he seemed to me the antithesis of young bertram remarked on it also when he found me out seeking solitude in one of the latticed minarets going it he said cynically he won't be quite such a young fool when he comes down from the hills i turned on him in absolute dismay the hills but surely you're going on service the adjutant shrugged his shoulders someone has to take over and he'll soon console himself i felt i could have kicked him and was glad that the roast beef called me to my duties as host they had laid the supper table where we had listened to the snake charmer's chant somehow through all the laughter i seemed to hear that refrain going on oh god of the battle have mercy have mercy have mercy what mercy would she show him none and what chance would he have in an atmosphere like that of semoorie none even the husband whom rumour said was bullet headed to some purpose would be away we were very merry in spite or perhaps because of an insistent trend of thought towards impending change and i was just about to propose the health of my guests with due discreet allusion to the still doubtful future when it was settled by the appearance of a telegraph peon in the instant hush which followed i observed irrelevantly that our brief feasting had made a horrid mess of what not half an hour before had seemed food for the gods then the colonel looked up with a grim conscious smile which fitted ill with the fragrant lantern lit garden behind him the route has come gentlemen we start to morrow at noon he checked a quick start to their feet on the part of some of the youngsters by addressing himself to me but as everything has been cut and dry for some days we needn't spoil sport yet awhile there's time for a dance or two in that case i'll go on i replied and with greater will than ever somehow it never struck me what was likely to happen seeing that young bertram was junior subaltern and in addition the pride of his fellows until i heard the calls for our speaker to return thanks he had been sitting of course next to the paris frock and beside him had been the adjutant looking i had noticed as if he thought he ought to be in young bertram's place i wish to god he had been they both rose at the same moment the adjutant to work no doubt for pushing his chair back he left the table young bertram to his task of responding i saw at once that he knew his fate i think he had that instant been told of it by the adjutant and perhaps in a way it was wiser and kinder to tell him before so to speak he gave himself away he stood for an appreciable time as if dazed then pulling himself together spoke steadily if a trifle artificially mr commissioner ladies and gentlemen i thought a minute ago that i was the last person to return thanks for our host's regrets and good wishes i know now that i am really the only person in the regiment who could do it honestly because i am the only person who can sympathise with him thoroughly who can like he does regret the regiment's departure and and at the same time give it god speed while i i he paused and suddenly the strenuous effort after conventional banalities left his young face free to show its grief almost its anger it's no use my trying to talk bosh he broke out and swept away by realities as you know i'd give everything not to say god speed but i suppose i must and then a sudden remembrance seemed to come to him he turned in swift impulse his face alight leapt to the pedestal behind him and there he was again with that blessed battered old ball in his raised right hand and i don't think i can do it better than this does it this his voice had the notes of life's divine tragedy of hope in it fits us all fits everything and so his eyes sought mine we thank you sir for all and everything and wish that the god of the battle may have mercy all round for a second he stood there almost triumphant beautiful as a god below him the guttering candles and disorder of the supper table above him the stars of heaven then with a light laugh he was calling for the band to begin and heading the hurried return to the dancing floor as he passed me gallant and gay i heard the paris frock quote in a consoling whisper they also serve who only stand and wait the grateful admiration of his eyes told the delicacy of her art i realised this again when shortly after i had an opportunity for one word of consolation also she said that too he replied his voice trembling a little she's been awfully good to me you know but so you all are and i daresay it is all right i knew that to be impossible but i resolved to do my level best to protect him then my duties claimed me despite the colonel's coolness the party began to drift away to preparations their measure of responsibility shown by the order of their going until only a dozen or so of lighthearted youngsters were left for another and yet another waltz the prime instigator of delay being of course young bertram i never saw the lad look better an almost reckless vitality seemed to radiate from and invade the still scented peace of the whole garden i found myself trying to evade it by wandering off to the furthest stillest corner where i could smoke in peace till called on finally to say good night or good morning to my guests i must have fallen asleep in one of the latticed minarets and slept long for when i woke a grey radiance was in the sky that showed above the scented orange trees dawn was breaking the garden held no sound save a faint rustle as of leaves and not a sign remained of western intrusion the swiftness of indian service had taken away as it had brought as i made my way to where we had danced and supped the immediate past seemed a dream and i strained my eyes into the starred shadows of the jasmine thicket half expecting to see a white veil creeping like a snake what was that i had no time to find fancy or fact my eyes had caught sight of something unmistakable at the foot of the marble pedestal it was young bertram he was lying as if asleep his cheek caressing the battered bronze ball that he had encircled with his arms his face turned up to the stars showed nothing but content he must have stayed on after the others had gone probably to think things out the legend of appeal must have drawn him back to the very spot where the snake charmer's basket had been upset like it had to me the fragrant peace must have brought to his weariness sleep for the rest had there really been a fourth snake was it true that serpents always revenged themselves for wrong charming or were those two faint blood spots on the rose leaves of young bertram's lips an 'e' willmakeit plain craddock's rolling baritone mingled with a shriek of steam welcoming a swift speck on the horizon with a roar and a rush it was on us past us ef that 'ymn 'ad bin wrote these times sir remarked craddock blandly as he turned on steam the h'author might 'ave put in a h'engin there ain't anythin' more mysterious in its goin's on except per'aps wimmen i'd ruther trust for grace to the mercy o' the lord than to them any day salt duty i lo nigh on fifty years have passed since that dark night just such a night as this o children of the master and yet remembering the sudden yell of death which rose upon the still air just such an air as this hot and still nay fear not children of the master since i iman the faithful one so named and natured watch as i watched then and yet i say the hair upon my head which then grew thick and now is bald the down upon my skin which then was bloom and now is stubble starts up even as i started to my feet at that dread cry and catching sonny baba in my arms fled to the safer shadows of the garden and the child slept the voice declamatory yet monotonous paused as if the speaker listened it is always so with the master children it went on tentatively they sleep the second and longer pause which ensued allowed soft breathings to be heard from the darkness even unmistakable and when the voice continued something of the vainglorious tone of the raconteur had been replaced by a note of resignation and wherefore not my friends seeing that as masters they know no fear wherefore indeed iman khan whilom major domo to many sahibs of high degree now in his old age factotum to the eurasian widow and children of a conservancy overseer asked himself the question boldly yet the heart which beat beneath the coarse white muslin coatee starched to crackle point in the effort to conceal the poorness of its quality felt a vague dissatisfaction in god's truth the memory of the great mutiny still sent his old blood shivering through his veins and some of the tribe of black and tan boys who slept around him in the darkness were surely now old enough to thrill helplessly responsive to the triumphal threnody of their race yet it was not so the tale on the contrary was a sure sleep compeller indeed he was never able to reach his own particular contribution to the sum total of heroism before sleep came except in his own dreams there he remembered as he remembered so many things how to decorate a ham for instance though it was an abomination to the lord how to ice champagne though that also was damnable when to say not at home or dismiss a guest by announcing the carriage though these were foreign to him soul and body out there beyond the skimp verandah amid the native cots set in the dusky darkness in hopes of a breath of fresher air old iman's imagination ran riot in etiquette and yet the faint white glimmer of the grand trunk road which showed beyond the cots was not straighter more unswerving than the khansaman's creed as to the correct card to play in each and every circumstance of domestic life his present mistress a worthy soul of the most doubtful portuguese descent knew this to her cost it was a relief in fact for her to get away at times from his determination for instance to have what he called sikkens for dinner but then she did not divide her world into the sheep who always had a savoury second course in their menu and the goats who did not to him it was the crux of social position so an opportunity of escape having arisen in the mortal illness of a distant relation she had gone off for a weeks holiday full of tears and determination while away to eat as much sweet stuff as she chose leaving iman khan in charge of the quaint little bastion of the half ruined caravanserai in which she was allowed free quarters in addition to her pension he was relieved also he had in truth a profound contempt for her but as this was palpably the wrong game he covered his disapproval with an inflexible respect which allowed no deviation from duty on either side yet it was a hard task to keep the household straight sometimes even iman's solid belief in custom as all sufficing wavered and he half regretted having refused the offers of easier services made him by rich natives anxious to ape the manner of the alien but it was only for a moment the claims of the white blood he had served all his life as his forbears had before him were paramount and whatever his faults the late e stink sahib conservancy overseer had been white or nearly so did not his name prove it had not warm e stink sahib warren hastings left a reputation behind him in india for all time yea he had been a real master the name was without equal in the land save perhaps that which came from the great conqueror jullunder alexander undoubtedly e stink sahib had been white so it was a pity the children took so much after their mother more and more so indeed since the baby girl born after her father's death was the darkest of the batch it was as if the white blood had run out in consequence of the constant calls upon it for elflida norma the eldest girl they all had fine names except the black baby whom that incompetent widow had called lily was ah what was not elflida norma the old man drowsing in the darkness after a hard day of decorum wandered off still more dreamily at the thought of his darling she did not sleep out on the edge of the high road her sixteen years demanded other things ah so many things yet the incompetent one could perceive no difference between the claims of the real miss sahiba that is e stink sahib's own daughter by a previous wife and those of the girl brat she herself had brought to him by a previous husband and whom she had cheerfully married off to a black man with a sahib's hat for this was iman khan's contemptuous classification of xavier castello one of those unnecessarily dark eurasians who even in the middle of the night are never to be seen without the huge pith hats which they wear apparently as an effort at race distinction the incompetent one was quite capable of carrying through a similar marriage for the miss sahiba horrible thought to iman all the more horrible because he was powerless to provide a proper husband he could insist on savouries for dinner he could say the door is shut to undesirable young men he could go so far in weddings as to provide a suffer supper and a wedding cake here his wrinkles set into a smile but only god could produce the husband especially here in this mere black man's town where sahibs lived not where sahibs did not even seek a meal or a night's rest in these evil days when they were whisked hither and thither by rail trains instead of going decently by road through the darkness his dim eyes sought the opposite bastion of the serai in the olden days any moment might have brought someone but those days were past it would need a miracle now to bring a sahib out of a post carriage to claim accommodation there yea a real heaven sent car must come still god was powerful if he chose to send one there might be a real wedding such a wedding as there had been when he so tired out iman was once more in his dreams decorating hams icing champagne and giving himself away in the intricacies of sugar piping when he woke it was with a sense that he had somehow neglected his duty but no in the hot dry darkness there was silence and sleep even lily baba had her due share of horatio menelaus' bed he rose and crept with noiseless bare feet to peep in through the screens of elflida norma's tiny scrap of a room that was tacked on to the one decent sized circular apartment in the bastion like a barnacle to a limpet one glance even by the dim light of the cotton wick set in a scum of oil floating on a tumbler of water showed him that she was no longer where an hour or two before he had left her safe without a pause he crept on across the room and looked through the door at its opposite end which gave on the arcaded square of the serai all was still here and there among the ruined arches a twinkling light told of some wayfarer late come and from the shadows a mixed bubbling of hookahs and camels could be heard drowsily she was not there however as he had found her sometimes listening to a bard or wandering juggler for she was not as the others tame as cows but rather as the birds wild and flighty so he passed on out through the massive doorway built by dead kings and stood once more on the white gleam of the road listening from far down it nearer the town came the unmelodious hee haw of a concertina played regardless of its keys hee hee haw haw hee hee his old ear knew the rhythm that was the dance in which the sahib logue kicked and stamped and laughed this was julia castello's doing there was a nautch among the black people with the sahib's hats and the miss sahiba his miss sahiba had been lured to it once more without a pause the instinct as to the right thing to do coming to him with certainty he turned aside to his cook room and lighting a hurricane lantern began to rummage in a battered tin box which bespattered still with such labels as wanted on the voyage proclaimed itself a perquisite from some past services so ten minutes afterwards a starched simulacrum of what had once been a chief commissioner's butler even to a tarnished silver badge in the orthodox headgear shaped like a big pith quoit appeared in the verandah of mrs castello's house and pointing with dignity to the glimmer of a hurricane lantern in the dusty darkness by the gate said as he produced a moth eaten cashmere opera cloak trimmed with moulting swansdown as per previous order the miss sahiba's ayah hath appeared for her mistress with this slave as escort elflida norma a dancing incarnation of pure mischief looked round angrily on the burst of noisy laughter which followed and the pausing stamp of her foot was not warranted by the polka why you laugh she cried passionately he is my servant he belongs to our place then turning to the deferential figure her tone changed and she drew herself up to the full of her small height nikul jao she said superbly which being interpreted is the opprobrious form of get you gone the old man's instinct had told him aright there amid that company the girl in the white muslin she had surreptitiously pinned into the semblance of a ball dress her big blue eyes matching the tight string of big blue beads about her slender throat showed herself apart absolutely despite her dark hair and 'almost sallow complexion the huzoor has forgotten the time said iman imperturbably it is just twelve o'clock and sin an hella dances of this description here he looked round at the squalid preparations for supper with superlative scorn always close at midnight there was something so almost appalling in the answering certainty of his tone regarding cinderellas that even mrs castello hesitated looking round helplessly at her guests in addition added the old man following up the impression is not the night saturday and even in the great lat sahib's house where i have served was there no nautch on saturdays excepting sin an hellas he yielded the last point graciously but the concession was even more confounding to mrs castello than his previous claim besides old iman's darkling allusion to service with a governor general was a well known danger signal to the whole hastings family including elflida norma who now hesitated palpably i t'ought you more wise insinuated her partner who had actually laid aside his hat for the polka than to have such a worn out poor fellow to your place pay no heed to him miss 'astin' and polk again once more elflida drew herself away from his encircling arm haughtily no thanks she drawled her small head with its short curls in air i am tired of polking and he is a more better servant than your people have in your place anyhow but elfie protested mrs castello the girl interrupted her step sister with an odd expression in her big blue eyes it will be sunday as he says julia besides the princess always goes home first from a cinderella you know because because why inquired mrs castello fretfully that will be some bob dash from the silly books she adores so much mr rosario elflida stood for a moment smiling sweetly as it were appraising all things she saw from the greasy tablecloth on the supper table to old iman's starched purity from the cocoanut oil on the head of one admirer to the tarnished silver sign of service on the head of the other because she was a princess of course she replied demurely and straightway stooped her white shoulders for the yoke of cashmere and swansdown with a dignity which froze even mr rosario's remonstrance thank you she said loftily in the verandah when he suggested escort but my ayah and my bearer are sufficient good night so down the pathway inches deep in dust she walked sedately towards the glimmer of the lantern by the gate followed deferentially by iman but only so far for once within the spider's web halo round the barred light she sprang forward with a laugh the next instant all was dark cimmerian darkness indeed to the old man as he struggled with the moulting swansdown and moth eaten cashmere she had flung over his head miss sahiba miss baba norty norty girl he cried after her desperately in his double capacity of escort and ayah then he consoled himself with the reflection that it was but a bare quarter of a mile to the serai along a straight deserted high road even a real miss sahiba might go so far alone unhurt so after pausing a moment from force of habit to re light the lantern he ambled after his charge as fast as his old legs could carry him suddenly he heard a noise such as he had never heard before close behind him a horrid panting noise and then something between a bellow and a whistle he turned saw a red eye glaring at him and the next instant the infernal monster darted past him whirring snorting in pursuit of course of elflida norma what tyranny was here what defiance of custom saw anyone ever the like on a decent metalled road and only the ayah god forgive him the lie wanting to make all things in order these confused helpless thoughts ran swifter in the old man's mind that his legs carried his body as he followed in pursuit of the monster the lantern swinging wildly hindered such light as there might have been without it but he knew the thing was ahead of him by the truly infernal smell it left behind it and then from the darkness ahead came a curiously familiar cry hut hut get out of the way oh damn a crash followed then silence a few seconds afterwards he was gazing helplessly bewildered at two figures who were looking at each other wrathfully across the white streak of road one he knew it was elflida norma her impromptu ball dress metamorphosed by her race into loose white draperies out of which the small dark head and slim throat with its circlet of big blue beads rose as from clouds the other unknown was that of a tall fair young man if you had only stood still the latter was saying angrily i could have managed but you dodged about like like his eyes had taken her in by this time and he paused in his simile but hers had wandered to the monster prone in the dust and she stepped closer to it curiously i suppose it is named a motor bicycle she said coolly i have not seen one in our place before only in picture books i am glad there were no regrets or apologies and even iman khan when he recovered his breath made no inquiries as to whether the young man had hurt himself in getting out of the miss sahiba's way he simply looked at the wheels of the bicycle and then at its stalwart young rider god had been kind and sent a husband in a miraculous car ii iman khan sate in the early dawn putting such polish as never before was put on a pair of rather large size oxford shoes so far all had gone well his own vast experience aided by the stranger's complete ignorance of indian ways had sufficed for much and alexander alexander sahib all the twelve imans be praised for such a name was now comfortably asleep in the bastion opposite the widow's quarters under the impression that the hastily produced whisky and soda with a sand beef sandwich in case hunger had come on the road the simple but clean bedding and briefly all the luxuries of a night's sleep after a somewhat severe shaking were due to the commercial instincts of a good old chap in charge of the usual rest house that being exactly what iman had desired as a beginning the sequel required thought and as he polished his brain was full of plans for the immediate future one thing was certain however quite certain the husband god had sent in a car must not be allowed to ride away on it before seeing more of the miss sahiba arrangements must be made as they always had to be made in the best families generally it began with a tennis party but this of course was out of the question and perhaps the accident on the road might be taken as an equivalent for that introduction then there were dances and fools food picnics the one might be considered as taken also the others were out of season in the heats of may there remained drives and dinners both possible but both required time therefore time must be had the chota sahib must not ride away after breakfast as he had settled on doing should he and the monster be found fit for the road now the chota sahib seemed none the worse for his fall as iman in his capacity of valet had had opportunities of judging the inference therefore was obvious it must be the monster who was incapable iman gave a finishing glisten to the shoes and placed them decorously side by side ready to be taken in when the appointed hour came for shaving water then he went over and looked at the motor bicycle which was accommodated in the verandah it did not pant or smell now as if it were alive but for all that it looked horribly healthy and strong it was evidently not a thing to be broken inadvertently by a casual push then a thought struck him and he ambled off to the old blacksmith who still lived in the serai arcade and boasted of his past trade of mending springs shoeing horses and selling to travellers his own manufactures in the way of wonderful soft iron pocket knives with endless blades and corkscrews warranted to draw themselves instead of the corks ari bhai said iman mildly to this worthy thou art a prince of workmen truly but come and see something beyond thy art in iron bapri bap i warrant thou couldst not even guess at its inner parts could he not tezoo the smith thought otherwise and being clever as well as voluble hit with fair correctness on pivots cog wheels and such like inevitables of all machinery the result of the interview being that iman armed with his kitchen chopper and a bundle of skewers had a subsequent tete a tete with the monster in which the latter came off second best so that when its owner fortified by a most magnificent breakfast served in the verandah by reason of the central room of that bastion having an absolutely unsafe roof went to overhaul his metal steed he was fairly surprised it is a verra remarkable occurrence he said softly to himself as his deft hands busied themselves with nuts and screws for he was a scotch engineer on his way to take up an appointment as superintendent in a canal workshop most remarkable and would be a fine example to the old ministers thesis that accident is not chance there's just a method in it that is absolutely uncanny in short even with the smithy on the premises of which the good old chap in charge spoke consolingly it was clear he could not start before evening if then not that it mattered so much since he had plenty of time in which to join his billet thus as he smoked his pipe the question came at last for which the old matchmaker had been longing and who would the young lady be who smashed me up last night in his reply iman dragged in warm e stink sahib bahadur and a vast amount of extraneous matter out of his own past experiences regarding the present however he was distinctly selective without being actually untruthful the late e stink sahib's widow and children for instance being also at rest in the serai were equally under his charge and this being so since there was but one public room in which dinner could possibly be served as it should be served here iman made a digression regarding the rights of the sahib logue at large and e stink sahib's family in particular it was possible that the huzoor might meet his fellow lodgers and the miss sahiba again in fact he iman would find it more convenient if the meal were eaten together and at the same time and the mem her absence being one of the eliminated truths would he knew fall in with any suggestion of his which statement again was absolutely true alec alexander lost in the intricacies of a piston rod acquiesced mechanically though in truth the likelihood of seeing such a remarkably pretty face again was not without its usual unconscious charm to a young man this charm however became conscious half an hour afterwards when hard at work in the smithy his coat off his sleeves rolled up showing milk white arms above his tanned wrists he looked up from the bit of glowing iron on the anvil and saw a large pair of blue eyes and a large string of blue beads about an almost childish throat it struck him that both were as blue as the sky inarching the wide inarched square of the old serai it struck him also that the eyes anyhow had more in common with the sky than with the house made with hands in which he stood even though dead kings had built it yes the whole figure did not belong somehow to its environment to the litter of wasted forage the ashes of dead fires to the desertion and neglect of a place which having served its purpose of a night's lodging has been left behind on the road it seemed worth more than that i gave you a nice toss didn't i said elflida norma breaking in on his quasi sentimental thought with a certain complacency if you had got out of my way it would have been more better you mean if you hadn't got in mine he replied grimly but don't let us quarrel about that now the mischief's done so far as i am concerned the blue eyes narrowed in eager interest have you broken things inside too she asked sympathy absent pure curiosity present in her tone no i didn't he said shortly i'm not of the kind that breaks easily she considered him calmly from head to foot no o o she admitted sparingly i suppose not but your arms look veree brittle like china i suppose that is from being so being so chicken white perhaps he said still more shortly and was relieved when iman having from the cook room where he was feverishly feathering fowls in preparation for the night's feast detected elflida's flagrant breach of etiquette in having anything whatever to do with a coatless sahib hurried across to beguile his charge back to the paths of propriety by reporting that lily baba to whom the girl was devoted evinced a determination to eat melons with her brothers which he iman was far too busy to frustrate you need not make such pother about big dinner to night she said viciously when with the absolutely accommodating lily in her arms she stood watching the far less interesting process of pounding forcemeat on a curry stone for i heard him tell the smith that he would go this evening if well if somebody kept his temper in boiling oil such a queer idea as if anybody could old iman's hands fell for an instant from the munadu maintenon cutlets he was preparing for he understood the frail foundation on which his chance of manufacturing a husband stood jullunder sahib must be making a spring and if the oil in which it had to be boiled but no as cook he knew something of the properties of hot fat and felt convinced that the spring would never be fried in time so all that long hot day he toiled and slaved in company with an anatomy of a man whom he had unearthed from the city a man who had also in his youth served the white blood but had never risen beyond the scullery a man who called him great artificer and fanned him and the charcoal fire indiscriminately according to their needs and all that long hot day on the other side of the arcaded square work went on also so that the clang of metal on anvil or cook room fire rose in antagonism on the dusty sunshine which slept between them dinner or no dinner spring or no spring and the circling dark shadows of the kites above in the blue sky were almost the only other signs of life for elflida norma had found sleep the easiest way of keeping lily baba from the melons and the boys slept as they slept always but as the sun set iman knew that fate had decided in favour of the dinner for jullunder sahib came over from the smithy with empty hands and found hot water in his room and the change of white raiment he carried in his knapsack laid out decorously on the bed he took the hint and dressed for dinner even to the buttonhole of jasmine which he found beside his hair brush elflida norma under similar supervision dressed also in fact everything was dressed including the flat tin lids of the saucepans which iman had impressed into doing duty as side dishes surrounded by castellated walls of rice paste supporting cannon balls of alternate spinach and cochinealed potatoes they really looked very fine so did iman himself starched to inconceivable stiffness of deportment so even did the anatomy who promoted for once to the dining room grinned at the young man and the girl at the great artificer and all his works with his usual indiscrimination and in truth each and all deserved grins yet elflida norma looked at alec alexander he at her and both at the dinner table set out marvellously with great trails of the common pumpkin vine looped with the cheap silver tinsel every indian bazaar provides and felt a sudden shyness of themselves of each other and the unwonted snowiness and glitter cler or wite said iman his old hands in difficulties with two soup plates there was a dead silence he means soup faltered elflida norma desperately wishing herself with the boys who were being regaled with curry and rice in her room and thereinafter became dumb until the next course when a sense of duty made her supplement iman's fish bar'l with the explanation that it was not really fish which was not procurable but another form of fowl so in fact were the side dishes which followed and in which iman had so far surpassed his usual self that elflida was perforce as helpless as her companion for all save eating them solidly in due order the old man however was too much absorbed in the due handling of bredsarse with the fowl which was at last allowed to appear under the title of roschikken too much discomforted by the subsidence of his favourite sikken a cheese soufflee to notice silence or the lack of it until just as the worst strain over he was perfunctorily apologising for the impossibility of hice puddeen a fateful cry came from the next room and elflida started to her feet it's lily she began but iman frowned her into her seat again and turned to the anatomy superbly go he said with dignity and bid the ayah see to lily baba the result however was unsatisfactory and a certain obstinacy grew to elflida's small face which finally blossomed into open rebellion and a burst of confidence you see she said those blue eyes of hers almost blinking as she narrowed them with earnestness she smells guavas and they are more her hobby than melons even the young man smiled who's lily he asked your sister i suppose my half sister she replied solemnly but she will cry on you see if she is not let to come to my place then let her come why not it is an evil custom began iman as the order was given he knew no graver blame than that even for a whole decalogue in ruins but elflida norma stamped her foot as she had stamped it in the polka so he had to give in and thus avoid worse exposures and after all the introduction of the dimpled brown child in a little white night shift who leant shyly against elflida's blue beads seemed to help the conversation so much so that after coffee and cigarettes had been served in the verandah old iman felt as if success must crown his efforts if only there were time but how could there be time when the possible husband had arranged since the motor bicycle refused to be mended with the appliances at his disposal to have it conveyed by country cart overnight to the nearest railway station five miles off whither he must tramp it he supposed next morning to catch the mail train it was when pleasantly yet still carelessly alec alexander was saying good bye to the blue eyes and the blue beads with the brown baby cuddled up comfortably in the girl's slender arms that iman with a sinking heart played his last card by saying that there was no need for the huzoor to tramp the miss sahiba and lily baba invariably took a carriage airing before breakfast and could quite easily drop the huzoor at the railway station yes i could drop you quite easily at that place it would be more better than the walk assented elflida norma with a sphinx like smile her heart was beating faster than usual she was beginning to be amused with the tinsel glitter and the general pretence it was like playing a game still she slept soundly and so did the young engineer and lily baba and the boys gorged with as a rule prohibited native dainties even the smith slept and the anatomy had already reverted to reality his transient dignity vanishing into thin air so that in that wide ruined serai built by dead kings all were at rest save the great artificer iman who sate among the ruins of his dinner satisfied yet still conscious of failure something was lacking which once more only god could create only a miraculous car could bring in truth if any vehicle might from outward appearance claim miraculous powers it was the extraordinary sort of four wheeled dogcart which in the cool morning air appeared as iman's last card he had indeed not wandered from the truth in telling alec alexander that carriages were not to be hired in that sahib forsaken spot and it had been only with extreme difficulty that he had raised these four wheels of varying colours and a body painted with festoons of grapes all tied together with ropes still it held the party iman with lily baba in his arms on the box by the driver elflida and the young engineer disposed on the back seat the horse it is true showed signs of never having been in harness before but this was not so evident to those behind and iman held tight and set his teeth knowing that success has sometimes to be bought dearly still it was with no small measure of relief when they were close on their destination and the beast settled down to the two hundred yards of collar work leading up to the small station level with the high embankment of the permanent way that he turned round to peep at progress on the back seat had anything happened his heart sank at the cool collected air with which the possible husband took his ticket but it rose again when after saying good bye to lily baba and tipping the coachman the young man went off to the platform with elflida as if it were a matter of course she should see him off in truth that is exactly what he did feel concerning this distinctly pretty and rather jolly little girl with a bad temper and elflida her world seemed to have had a fresh start in growth it held greater possibilities than before that was all so everything had been in vain even iman's sense of duty towards the white blood he had served so long good bye he could not hear the words but he saw the young hands meet to unclasp again as with a whistle the mail train rushed out from behind a dense mango clump and the westinghouse brakes brought a sudden grinding rattle to the quiet morning air all was over thought iman sadly as still sitting on the box with lily baba he watched surely it had not been his fault he had done all only the cheese soufflee had failed and that happened sometimes even in the house of lat sahibs yet it was over it was indeed almost including the miraculous car as deprived of its driver who was spending part of his tip in the sweet stall the horse frightened at the train reared bounded forward and then finding its progress barred in front by a railing swerved on its track and came past the station again heading for that downward incline with the steep banks falling away on either side elflida grasped the position first and with a cry of lily lily was at the horse's head as it passed the possible husband was not far behind just far enough to make the off rein as convenient to his pursuing feet as the near one to which she clung half dragged helpless half in wild determination to keep pace with the terrified beast let go he shouted he'll get you down and then let go i say she did not answer in truth she had no breath for words and besides her mind was not clear enough to grasp his order though it grasped something else namely that relief from her dead weight on one side must bring a swerve to the other and that must not be till the embankment was passed or the man holding to the off rein must go under let go he shouted again and again as he in his turn grasped her purpose but he might as well have shouted to the dead i believe i hope she has fainted said alec alexander with a catch in his voice not all due to breathlessness as the runaway safe held by other captors he stooped over the girl who lay in the dust her hands still clenched over a broken rein then he lifted her tenderly and carried her back to the station whence the mail train careless of such trivialities as miraculous cart had departed and if on his way he kissed the closed blue eyes and the blue beads round the childish throat who shall blame him anyhow the hot dry nights of may were not over before old iman's voice rose once more in declamation over the unforgettable story of the white blood but this time sleep did not come to the black and tan tribe gathered in the light of the floating oil wick for the boys were watching something they had never seen before the icing of a wedding cake and so the long deferred personal climax came at last the trouble being over the masters were masters again and i took sonny baba back to his people and wherefore not seeing i had eaten of their salt all my life and they of mine yea even unto wedding cakes look my sons that is done and i iman the faithful one by name and nature made it there was but one flaw in the old man's content on the great day for he had managed to get a ham cheap for the suffer and mrs hastings only too glad of greater freedom in the future had consented to his turning his attention to the education of the young couple and lily baba who was to live with them that flaw was a slight irregularity in what he was pleased to call a too liver ot on the said cake not that it really mattered the true lover's knot itself was there though the hands which fashioned it were not so young and steady as they had been when they caught up sonny baba and carried him to the safe shadows yet old as they were those hands had forgotten no duty e stink sahib's widow absorbed with a friend in the recipe of a mango pickle she meant to make on the morrow a pickle full of forbidden turmeric and mustard oil had to be reminded of her role as bride's mother over and over again but it was iman who hung a horseshoe for luck on the miraculous car drawn this time by an old stager iman who was ready with rice iman who finally ran after the departing lovers to fling the old white shoe in which elflida had danced the hee haw polka into their laps as they sate on the back seat and then overbalancing himself in the final effort to tumble into the dust where he remained blissfully uncertain as to praise or blame murmuring blandly what a custom is here the wisdom of our lord ganesh the wisdom of sri ganesh the wisdom of our lord ganesh through and through my fever drugged brain the words came compelling insistent forcing me away from reality forcing me back into the past yet i knew perfectly where i was i remembered distinctly that having felt unusually tired after rather a hot day's march i had pitched the little tente d'abri which was my home during a sketching tour in wales rather closer to the main road than i generally did and had thereinafter promptly succumbed to an unmistakable go of fever and ague a half forgotten legacy left behind by many years of indian life yes i could remember distinctly the bramble and nut hidden quarry hole with its little inner sward of sweet sheep bitten grass where i had pitched the tent i knew that if i were to call someone of the rumbling cart wheels which came at intervals along the road might stop and seek for the caller but i lay still i was hard happed round and round with the curious content which comes as the chills and the aches are passing into the fire flood of fever that thrills the finger tips and sets the brain fizzling like champagne the wisdom of sri ganesh the wisdom of our lord ganesh why on earth should that haunt me here in wales on a piece no doubt of nat gwynne's property nat gwynne then i knew it was because i had seen him in the distance that day driving a pair of grey ponies tandem with a pretty young girl beside his coarse heavy good looks heavier than they had been though heaven knows refinement had never stood much in his way and they were to be married to morrow married to gwynne of garthgwynne couldn't anyone tell her what she was doing couldn't anyone save her as the wisdom of sri ganesh had saved that other one and then in a second i was gone i was under the brassy blue sky of india and from the twisted tufts of marsh grasses by the elephant's feet came a native beater's lament as god sees me it is invisible what a tyranny is here bid ganesh seek said nat gwynne's voice imperatively from the howdah from which we were both shooting he was in a lancer regiment cantooned in the native state where for many years i had been consulting engineer the mahout seated on the big brute's neck turned calmly it is against the orders that sri ganesh king of elephants and lord of wisdom should touch carrion even of the huzoor's i looked at my old friend mahadeo with astonishment he and i had been out on ganesh the rajah's finest elephant scores of times and again and again the cunning old rogue's inquisitive trunk had nosed out and up a partridge or snipe which the coolies had failed to find he hath a scent like a bed of roses old mahadeo would say proudly and as for wisdom doth he not hold the huzoor even as his own mahout which delicate piece of flattery was true for old ganesh pad elephant to the bankrupt young scoundrel of a rajah had taken a fancy to me as elephants do take fancies so seeing at a glance that something lay beneath the surface of the bitter hatred in the dark face and the wild wicked rage of the white one i said quickly seek my brother ganesh swayed forward his trunk curling like a snake his wicked little eyes alert a faint frou frou of a blowing sound seeming to quiver the grasses and there grasped softly in the prehensile end was a dead jack snipe as he put it deferentially and politely into my outstretched hand i seemed to catch a contemptuous flicker in his eye as who would say what an amount of fuss about such a very little piece of pork as the jew said when a thunderstorm found him eating sausage but that it was not a little piece of pork between those two still glaring at each other was evident mahadeo's usually gentle face had taken on a stony stare that held in it something of limitless power while nat gwynne's anger was almost obscured by sheer disgust at having to keep his hands off another man's servant by god he cried it's lucky for you you pig that i'm not your master but but i'll try to be i'll buy this big brute when they sell the bankrupt state up next month and i'll buy you curse you and i'll do hold your tongue gwynne i said to him in a low voice for his temper was notorious and once he lost control over himself he would often behave like a madman as indeed he had every right to be since the record of the gwynnes of garthgwynne was a black one mahadeo however supplied the return to calm the huzoor is mast he said to me rapidly in low contemptuous hindustani turning the while to sit immovable as ever a mere head and trunk of a man all else being hidden by the elephant's great shields of ears he is as the beasts that perish and ganesh too nears his time of power he pointed to the great head he bestrode where oozing apparently from a slight hollow in the skin a few drops of ichor showed half hardened into amber so let those who would harm him or his friends beware but there was nothing of which to be beware thereinafter for all became peace how hot the sun was and the guns too almost too hot to hold but how cool it was in the camp down in a mango grove beside a tank with great cane brakes stretching away into the stars under the moonlight and how peaceful how one slept and slept and slept drowsed to dreamlessness by the great peace of the immovable shadows the greater peace of the light behind them ye powers above what was that even now remembering it all was as it had seemed then shadow on light light on shadow a curse a cry something young and slim fleeing half in light half in shadow then a sudden trumpet a rattle as of chained front feet one little sob how steadily the moonlight shone through the branches on that small upturned face which was all ganesh's feet had spared who what i gasped uncomprehending staring stupidly at mahadeo on his knees beside the dead girl at gwynne still dressed the buttons on his mess jacket glittering like diamonds his face all working with horror and dismay but there was no room for anything but the old man's voice quiet restrained she was my granddaughter huzoor but a light thing she must have gone too near the king of elephants being as this slave said near to his time of power what then it is the wisdom of our lord ganesh the wisdom of sri ganesh the sound of his voice died away softly and the wind carried it further and further and further such an odd wind soft warm with a faint perfume in it blowing on my hands my face and behind it a familiar sighing sound with the echo of a chuckle in it was it possible i started up my brain in a whirl did i or did i not see in the moonbeam which stole through a chink in the tent flap something sinuous that curved and bent caressingly and beyond it where the flap divided was or was that not a rough image of the elephant headed god of wisdom painted in hot ochres on an elephant's fore front i was out of the blankets in a second flinging back the tent flaps with a delirious laugh aye it was true earth and air alike seemed blocked by a huge mass of flesh that quivered all over with delight come this was something like a fever dream to have an indian rajah's pad elephant to ride on to go whither you would for a fresh breeze to cool your brain baito ganesh baito i cried giving the familiar order but the next instant my vaingloriousness ended in a shiver almost of fear as the brute obeyed sinking noiselessly and laying its trunk curled round to protect itself against injury ready for me to mount scarcely knowing what i did i caught familiarly at the big drooping ears i felt the trunk beneath my feet tilted gingerly to aid me and there i was my head reeling madly in the old familiar place but around me around me half wales bathed in broad moonlight lay peaceful with in the distance a faint shimmer telling of the sea the far sea that still seemed to sound in my ears as if indeed i lay upon its very shore listening to the break and burden of the waves which came from far away so very far away i think the effort must have made me relapse into unconsciousness for the next thing i remember is finding myself propped up by pillows in the howdah and hearing a familiar voice break in upon the ceaseless fall of the waves which filled my ears and from the voice i gathered vaguely that it was not a dream at all this was indeed ganesh who had been sold because of his great height to an english showman and this was no other than old mahadeo who would not leave his charge and had come over the black water also where there was nothing good to be had save rum rum that kept the cold out on these chill september nights when ganesh had to do his marches from town to town since the sight of an elephant might frighten the traffic by day there was evidently some of that rum still in the old man's voice as he chid ganesh glibly for having been restive and thrown his unsteady mahout on the road but then had not the animal always loved the huzoor even as his master and must he not have nosed him out as he passed the lord of elephants having as ever a scent as of rose gardens which was as well since now the huzoor would be able to get a doctor sahib and medicine i tried to understand but it was hard to get at anything with fever raging in one's brain while the rhythmic roll of the elephant's pace as we lilted away over half wales seemed to blend with the fall of those waves from very far away once i remember asking how many couple of snipe we had killed after that mahadeo furtively brought out a bottle and gave me something fiery which seemed to do me good though he muttered to himself that he could but do his best his was not the wisdom of sri ganesh you you shouldn't say that to me you you old fool i murmured weakly you should say it as you said to to to gwynne sahib gwynne sahib who is going to be married to morrow don't you know such a pretty girl such a very pretty girl such a poor pretty girl i don't know quite what i said i am glad indeed not to be able to remember but i have a vague recollection of becoming a trifle maudlin and finally of pointing out amid a cloud like shadow of trees that lay on the far horizon the position or thereabouts of garthgwynne whither the young bride was to be led the next evening now in all this as i recount it from a blurred fever stricken memory allowance must be made for illusion i don't know if it really happened i can only vouch for my belief that i actually saw and did these things i think now therefore that i fell asleep always with that recurring fall of distant waves in my ear until i woke suddenly to a loud hilarious burst of half drunken laughter stop him hie gone away hello gwynne pity the bride if you don't go to bed there'll be no wedding day yoicks poor devil wants to escape the halter hie you there best man you're bound to bring him up sober we were in the deep shadow of the famous cedar trees and one look at the old house beyond the lawn was enough for recognition yes it was plas garthgwynne favoured of picture postcards favoured of wild wicked romance and legend it was all blazing with lights so despite the waning of the moon i could see clustering at the door and dispersed over the gravel sweep the mad rush of gwynne of garthgwynne's last bachelor party as it tumbled tipsily in chase of a reeling figure that came straight towards us across the lawn to lose itself in the opposite shadows and then a hard feminine voice dominated the uproar leave him alone you fools the night air will sober him and if it doesn't there's no hurry to carry on the breed something of brutal truth behind the brutal coarseness of the remark fell like a wet blanket over the half fuddled guests some of them picked themselves up moodily from the gravel others found stability from friends and so they drifted in unsteadily dominated once more by that hard feminine unwomanly voice asserting that if he didn't crawl back to burrow in a quarter of an hour she'd send the butler to look for him and thereinafter came quiet while one by one the glittering windows of the house sank to darkness and yet it was not dark after all surely or was there a curious halo of light emanating from old mahadeo's head a halo which distorted him somehow which piled his low turban into a high tiara and made his nose show long so long almost as long as the elephant faced god of wisdom in the indian shrines ah there he was gwynne of garthgwynne standing on a bit of open beyond the shadow behind him a grey shimmer of mere set thick with water lilies his legs very wide apart his watch in his hand it had some electric appliance about it and the feeble light streaming upwards showed his face full of hard soul revealing lines what a face the face of a devil let loose set free from the fetters of conventional life two o'clock he muttered well whats'h a matter sh'upposin' am drunk she'll have to put up gwynne garthgwynne d mn her my wife mother of gwynne's garth forward sri ganesh the order came soft but swift and we were out of the shadows what was it out of the shadows also out of the dim shadows which shroud life in the beginning and the end which caught me irresistibly making me say sharply as one who has waited long come along gwynne do there's a good fellow for an instant surprise seemed to struggle with satisfaction in his drink sodden brain the tall heavy figure swayed lurched i could see its every detail the very buttons on the mess jacket worn doubtless out of bravado this last evening of bachelorhood shone as they had done that night years ago amid the shadow and shine of the mango tope for a radiance seemed to have sprung from earth and sky in which nothing could be hidden then suddenly came his old reckless half insane burst of laughter come he echoed drunkenly why why shno't whatsh' larks chursh fl'rs joll' lit' bride no bridegroom joll' good' larks'h eh off to phildelp'ia in the mornin' see th'other one joll' lit' one bait you pig ganesh bait it all passed like a flash of lightning the elephant was down and up again and the last thing i remember was hearing gwynne of garthgwynne's drunken voice say hello old mahadeo eh well go it ol' man givs'h some of wish dom shri ganesh eh what when i roused again it was dawn pale primrose dawn over a cloudless sea it was the strange wind that roused me the soft warm wind that passed over my face and sought something else and found it soft as a snake the elephant's trunk found the drunken man's neck as he lay asleep half hanging out of the cushioned howdah and closed on it the sight drove the blur from my mind and in an instant i saw all things clearly we were on the very edge of a high cliff below us lay the scarce dawn lit waters of the calm sea but between me and that tender distant sky what form was this with triple crown and wise stern human eyes looking out of an animal's face wisdom itself wisdom come to judgment there was a moment's pause i clung to the howdah's side as if turned to stone i seemed to know what was coming to realise the verdict which that ultimate wisdom must give then in a clarion voice the words came by the order of the lord ganesh kill the softness the tenderness of the snaky coil so sensitive that the finest thread in god's world can scarce escape it changed suddenly to iron there was no cry no struggle gwynne of garthgwynne's body swung high in air then flung from it with all leviathan's strength fell and fell and fell when the roaring of the distant sea ceased in mine ears about a fortnight afterwards i found that the nine days' wonder of gwynne of garthgwynne's disappearance on his wedding night had died down he had rushed out rollicking drunk that all knew he had not returned the butler sent out to seek for him had sought other seekers but all in vain they were still dragging the mere for him but the flood gates of the river of which it was a backwater had been open that night and the body might have drifted out to sea so there had been no wedding and a distant heir barely related to the old stock was ready to take possession so soon as doubt was over as for me the early postman attracted by my moaning had found me half in and half out of my blankets in the tente d'abri behind the bramble screen of the quarry was it then all a dream even if it were not was it not the wisdom of our lord ganesh i decided at last to say nothing about that dream of a marvellous moonlight ride on an elephant over half wales twinges of conscience assailed me at times but they were laid to rest for ever about christmas tide when going through a small town in the midlands i was met in passing a new cottage hospital on its environs by a glad cry the very man i want i've got a poor soul here who won't die he ought really to have been at peace two days ago but he goes on and on you see he's an indian or something and we can't speak the lingo you can i expect i followed the doctor with whom i had a slight acquaintance into the ward with a foreboding at my heart i knew it was old mahadeo and that indeed he wanted me and it was he lay tucked up between clean sheets on an english bed with two english hospital nurses fadding about him speechless gasping at the very point and spit of death yet waiting waiting i knew what he wanted and without a word his dark eyes following me in dim gladness i threw back the clothes and got a firm grip of the sheet at his head he should at least die as a hindu should die now doctor i said if you'll take the feet we will let him find freedom outside a nurse started forward but the case is pneumonia double pneumonia the doctor hesitated they always are in the hands of the nurses look here jones i cried sharply this man doesn't want clinical thermometers and draw sheets and caps he wants freedom he wants to die as his religion tells him he must die on mother earth aye even if her bosom is white with snow and it was for it was christmas tide so we lifted him out the doctor and i and laid him down on heaven's white quilt he just rolled over face down into the cool pillow ram ram sita ram i whispered kneeling beside him to give the last dying benediction of his race such a quaint one only the name of what to it is superman and superwoman a last appeal to the higher instincts of humanity there was one little sob i thought i heard the beginning of the old refrain the wisdom of our lord ganesh then he had found freedom you seem to know their ways sir said a horsey looking man who had come in with us and who had evidently something to do with the show so if you could give us a 'elp with this pore fellar's beast i'd be obliged hasn't touched food this ten days never since the old man took worse and a elephant sir is a dead loss to a show the master lef' 'im here with me but i'm blowed if i can do nothing with him i found ganesh happier than his master for no place being large enough for him he lay in the open but they had stretched a tarpaulin over him like a rick cover as a protection a glance told me he was far gone though he lay crouched not prone his trunk marvellous agent for good or ill stretched out before him beyond shelter into the snow as i came up to him i fancied i saw a flicker in his eyes those eyes so small so full of wisdom then i laid in front of him the old man's turban ragged worn which i had begged of the prim nurses in a second the whole huge inert mass of flesh became instinct with life he rose to his feet with incredible swiftness and softly encircling the old ragged pugree raised it gently and placed it in the master's seat for a moment i doubted what would come next but the instinct which is held in leviathan's small brain is great he knew by some mysterious art that the master was dead that the human mind which had been his guide was gone he took one step forward threw up his trunk and the echoes of the surrounding houses cracked with the roaring bellow of his trumpet as he swayed sideways and fell dead that was all the little smug provincial english town ever knew of the wisdom of our lord ganesh the son of a king i barring my pay he said ruefully i haven't a coin in the world and for the moment newly accepted lover as he was his eyes actually left hers and wandered away to the reddening yellow of the sunset with a certain resentment at the limitations of his world father has plenty she put in joyously and for the moment her hand actually touched his in a new born sense of appropriation and right of re assurance which made her blush faintly it also made his eyes return to hers whereat she blushed furiously and then tried to cover her confusion by a jest well he has hasn't he the best collection of coins in india he wouldn't part with one of them though for love or money and i doubt his parting with you though i could pay a lot in love he had both her hands now and the very newness of the position made her fence with the emotion it aroused he parted with duplicates but you aren't one there isn't anyone like you in the wide wide world and i'm glad you're not i don't want anyone else to be as lucky as i am she retreated still further from realities into jesting then he exchanges quite often so if you only set yourself to find something she broke off and her face lit up oh jim i have such a delightful idea you shall find the gold coin you know the one i mean with the date that is to settle or unsettle half the history of the world do you know i really believe if you helped him to confound all those german wiseacres that father would be quite willing to exchange his daughter for the ducat perhaps but unfortunately and quite between ourselves i have my doubts about the existence of that coin or if it does exist it is hopelessly hidden away for ever and ever and aye like that blessed old buried city of his that we have all been hunting after this month past in the wilderness i don't wish to be disrespectful to your father queenie but i believe he dreamt of it that is to say if it didn't dream of him one never knows which comes first he paused arrested in the egoism the absolute individualism of love by the mystery of the collective life which was part even of that love and once more his eyes wandered to the sun setting the sky had darkened on the horizon as the dust haze shadowed into purple so that the distant edge of the low sand hills losing definite outline seemed almost level yet far and near from the feet of the lovers as they sat close together to that uncertain ending of their visible world not a straight line was to be seen everything showed in curves curves that told their unflinching tale of unseen circlings the wrinkled ripples left by the last wind upon the sea of sand around them waved over the endless undulations of the desert the sparse tussocks of coarse grass fell in fountains from their own centres the stunted thorn bushes were coiled and twisted on themselves like tangled skeins without a clue the faint tracks of the sand rats and the partridges wound snake like in every direction and even the footprints which had brought the two lovers in their present resting place held the same hint of reference to unseen continuity for absorbed in love's new world they had wandered on aimlessly unheeding of the old one at their feet the result stared them in the face now in a firm yet undecided trail that was by far the most salient feature in the indefinite landscape jim forrester laughed as he directed her attention to it we seem to have gone round and round on our tracks so the tents and your respected father and civilisation generally must be well exactly where i would have sworn they were not but that just bears out what i was saying for all we know the whole thing may be a peculiarly vicious circle the world may be going back when we think it is going forward and all the fine new things we think we find may only he ourselves again you and i and the buried city and the gold coin everything that we dream of or that dreams of us may only be part of the hidden circle which belongs to the curve of a life which has no straight lines my god take care what the devil is that that if anything was a straight line straight as an arrow and an arrow it was still vibrating in the soft sand at their very feet jim forrester stood up angrily and looked round for the archer who had drawn his bow at such an unpleasantly close venture but no one was visible so he stooped down and drew the arrow out of the sand he had seen its like or almost its like before in those wild central tracts of sandy desert where the wandering tribes of goatherds still cling to the weapons of a past age his companion however had not and she bent to examine it curiously the attitude made the fair coils of her hair which were plaited round her head look more than ever like a heavy gold crown it takes one back to another world altogether she said watching him as he balanced it critically to appraise the perfection of its poise to a world where it was made perhaps for it looks old doesn't it i wonder who she paused becoming conscious that someone was standing behind her jim forrester became conscious of the fact also and showed it in such an aggressive way that she exclaimed hastily don't be angry with him please it must have been quite a chance he couldn't have known we were here even without the plea it would have been difficult for the young englishman to refuse the chance of explanation to the figure which had appeared so unexpectedly for though in all outward accessories it was only that of a wandering goatherd there was a calm dignity about it which claimed consideration the fillet which bound the hair sun ripened to a rich brown on its waves and curls was only a knotted bit of goats' hair string but the head it encircled had a youthful buoyancy such as the greek sculptors gave to the young apollo a resemblance enhanced by the statuesque folds of the rough goats' hair blanketing which was sparsely draped over the bare sinewy yet fine drawn frame the face however was faintly aquiline and the eyes deep set between prominent brow and cheek bone had the mingled fire and softness which in india so often redeems an otherwise commonplace countenance i was stalking bustard huzoor said the goatherd frankly with a flash of very white teeth and being face down on the sand yonder behind the grasses saw nothing till the presences stood up but a glint of the sun on something he spoke to the man but his eyes were on the girl's golden crown of hair jim forrester suddenly broke the arrow across his knee and threw the fragments from him into the sand ripples hand me over the bow too he said peremptorily then paused hullo where the deuce did you get that it is very old the oldest i've seen with a looped string too he added handling it curiously the goatherd smiled the presence is welcome to keep it if he likes i can get plenty more in the old city once again in speaking to the man his eyes askance were on the girl she started in the old city she echoed jim do you hear that then you know where the old city is the goatherd almost laughed wherefore not malika sahiba queen lady have i not lived in it always lived in it then where is it he swept a bronze hand in a circle which clipped her and him and the distant horizon here queen lady here echoed jim forrester incredulously but there are absolutely no signs of a city here plenty huzoor replied the goatherd if the protector of the poor will only use his eyes look yonder how the ground rises to meet the curve of the sky yonder sahib where the sunset red dyes deepest the young englishman looked and frowned but the girl gave a quick exclamation and laid a hasty surprised touch on her lover's arm he is right jim she said why didn't we notice it before it stands out quite clear an even rise all round centring on the unseen sun how very curious ask him his name jim and all that so that father may be able to get hold of him fancy if we find the buried city it would be as good almost as the gold coin though somehow it makes me feel creepy she gave a faint shiver as she spoke the queen lady should not remain in the wilderness when the sun has set came in swift warning from the goatherd there is a fever fiend lurks in it and brings strange dreams something almost of familiarity and command in the liquid yet vibrant voice made jim forrester frown again and say shortly yes we must get back it grows quite cold the girl looked half bewildered first to one and then to the other of the two tall figures that stood between her and the fast fading light against which she still saw clearly that faint swelling domed blue shadow as of some other world forcing its way through the crust of the visible one so she stood silent vaguely disturbed while the few questions necessary to identify the man who answered them were asked she did not speak indeed until with faces set on the right path for their camp and civilisation generally they paused on the top of the first sand rippled wave to look back the shadowy dome was still there swelling towards the vanished sun and from its side the figure of the young goatherd rose into the darkening dust haze he was calling to his flock and the words of his old time chant were clearly audible o seekers for life's meat your course is run come home with weary feet rest is so sweet what though one day be done another has begun the flock the fold are one where long years meet i hope he told us his real name she said suddenly ii my dear child all your geese are swans and so were your poor mother's before you said her father and then his eyes grew dreamy perhaps over the intricacies of some new coins he was classifying though in truth the memory of the young wife who had left him alone with a week old baby in the days of his youth had somehow come harder to him during the last few happier more home like years since his daughter had returned to take her mother's place as mistress of the house for the girl was very like the dead woman she had brought her father his afternoon cup of tea to the office tent cleared for that brief recess of the cloud of clerks and witnesses who through the wide canvas wings set open to let in the air could be seen huddled in groups among the sparse shadows of the stunted kikar trees amid which the camp was pitched they could be heard also since in the limited leisure at their disposal they were hubble hubbling away at their hookahs conscientiously the noise in its rhythmic intermittent insistency seemed like a distant snore from the sleepy desert of sand that stretched away to the horizon on all sides of course he went on you could hardly be expected to know though really my dear you have all your mother's quickness of perception regarding people and places but the mere fact of that goatherd fellow giving his name as khesroo and admitting he was low caste should have made you doubt his assertion i confess i had little hope for such knowledge as he professed to have is generally in the keeping of the priesthood only but jim was there i mean mr forrester she began her father coughed uneasily because i call my personal assistant whom i have known as a child jim that is no reason my dear queenie why you should contract the habit i don't think your poor mother would have liked it besides though he is an able young man very much so indeed and when he grows older will make an excellent officer mr forrester ahem he made a violent effort over the name has no genius for antiquities he utterly fails for instance to realise the far reaching importance for it would of course alter the whole chronology of the graeco bactrian era of my contention concerning what hausmann and the german school generally venture to designate a post vicramaditya yet some day i feel sure the gold coin of which kapala gives so exact a description in bc with the date under the legend and a double profile on the obverse will turn up and then the point will be settled even if i do not live to see it he was fairly off on his hobby and had risen to pace the tent his hands behind his back many a time and oft she had listened to him patiently almost eagerly for the story of india's golden age always fired her imagination but to day she was thinking of other things of her engagement for one which she must break to him sooner or later so she went up to him and tucked her arm into his coaxingly you may father it might be found any day do you know i believe you would give almost anything even your daughter for that ducat wouldn't you absolute jest as it was her voice trembled over the trivial words as voices often do unconsciously when fate means to turn them to her own purposes he smiled and patted her hand undoubtedly i would my dear but nice as you are no one is likely to offer me that exchange to begin with the coin as a simple unique would be worth a fortune and then there is the fame think of it half the philologists most of the historians and all those german fellows routed on their own ground who knows she said and then a frown dimmed the amusement in her eyes though i can't understand she added why that man khesroo denied as you say he did having met jim i mean us yesterday he can't be the wrong man can he mr forrester thinks he is not but you can see for yourself replied her father returning to his tea and his treasures for he is still over in the orderlies' tent they had such trouble hunting him out of the jungles and persuading him to come here that they said they must keep him overnight anyhow in case he was wanted an hour or so afterwards therefore a yellow legged constable escorted the goatherd who had answered to the name of khesroo into the verandah of the miss sahiba's drawing room tent it also was set wide to the cool of the desert evening and its easy chairs and low flower decked tables strewn with books and magazines struck a curiously dissonant note from that sounded by the wilderness of sandy waste which on all sides hemmed in the little square of white winged camp with a certain hungry emptiness he is the man jim said the girl in an undertone for her father had come over from office and was seated within reading the daily papers which the camel post had just brought and yet he looks different somehow and so ill too he did look ill with the languid yet harassed air which follows on malarial fever the buoyancy of his carriage was replaced by an almost dejected air yet it was unmistakably the goatherd they had met the evening before who in obedience to a sign squatted down midway as it were between the culture inside the tent and the savagery without it you look as if you had been having fever have you asked the girl abruptly for her years of authority had made her knowledgeable in such things the malika sahiba says right replied khesroo indifferently i have had it much this long while back and you had it yesterday or the day before it was yesterday i was put past by it all day and yet here a vague perplexity came to the dulled yet anxious face as he looked first at the girl then apologetically at jim forrester what the presence said about meeting me is perhaps right after all yes it is right i did see the huzoor i have remembered from the graciousness of the queen lady and the gold crown of her hair the young englishman frowned angrily you work miracles in memory my dear queenie he said and there was quite an aggrieved tone in his voice as he turned shortly on the speaker why on earth didn't you tell the truth before then and the old city i suppose you remember all about that too the old city echoed khesroo doubtfully no huzoor what should i know about it beyond what all know that there was a city and that it is lost such as i know only what the wise tell them he paused and even to his deprecation came a half resigned self assertion and yet i had more chance than most seeing that my mother was twice born she was was she put in his hearer and then looked round towards his chief do you hear that sir his mother was a brahmani that may account for his profile which you said this morning puzzled you in a low caste man i said it was scythic in type and so it is was the answer as the speaker laid down his paper and came forward for further inspection so your mother was twice born he continued addressing the goatherd a child widow i suppose khesroo stretched his hand out the fingers wide spread in a dignified assent which suited him better than his former almost cringing humility huzoor yes her people however did not find her till i was nigh six but after that of course i was alone a hush fell on the group for to those three listeners who understood them the simple words told of a common enough tragedy in india of a life denied all natural outlet of unworthy love of outraged pride of race followed by sure if slow revenge and your father who was he kresroo shook his head i had no one but my mother huzoor there was another hush on which the girl's voice rose clear with a curious thrill in it and she was very beautiful was she not her son is a good looking fellow at any rate remarked jim forrester coolly and moving away he took up the newspaper conscious of a certain irritation and began to read the latest report of wireless telegraphy with the unsuspicious and unquestioning assent which we of these latter days reserve for the marvels of matter only her father having gone back to his papers also the girl and the goatherd were left alone midway between civilisation and savagery huddled in his coarse blanketing his bare arms crossed over his bare knees there was nothing distinctive or unusual in khesroo's figure behind which the background of shadowy desert was fast fading into shadowy sky except the haggardness of the aquiline face the hollowness of the dark eyes these struck her and she stretched out her hand to feel his have you fever now no you are quite cool he shivered slightly at her touch and his eyes passing hers seemed to rest on the plaits of her hair no huzoor he replied it is a thief fever it is hard to catch she smiled i think quinine will manage it he shook his head nothing catches that which robs us of life at its own time it will leave me none some day he spoke unconcernedly as if the fact were beyond question then why do you wear that amulet if it is of no use she said pointing to the little leathern bag such as the wild tribes use for the carrying of charms which was tied round his arm khesroo shook his head again but smiled this time and the flash of his white teeth must have removed any doubt of his identity had such doubt existed the queen lady mistakes he said it does not contain a charm it is my photongrar your what she echoed uncomprehending photongrar the picture huzoor that the sun holds always of all things it has ever seen in the world it showed this to a memsahiba long ago when i was little and she showed it to my mother you mean your photograph huzoor yes perhaps the queen lady might care to see it since it is like my mother as she was before they found her perhaps it was the thought of what the poor woman must have been like after that finding which made the english girl feel a vague oppression as she took the tight roll of paper that khesroo unfolded from a piece of red rag i was five huzoor he said simply and my mother loved me much small wonder was the girl's first thought as she looked at the sedate yet childish face half concealed by the high turban which had evidently been borrowed for the occasion at the quaint dignity of the childish figure huddled into finery too large for it and holding a flower in its hand as if it had been a sceptre but as she looked a startled expression came over her face she stood up and hurried to her father with appeal in her voice oh father do look here how very curious this photograph of khesroo when he was a child i think mother must have taken it for i am almost sure there is one like it in her diary in the volume you gave me to read the other day because we were camping through the same country stay i'll fetch it she was back in a moment with an unclasped book in her hand and fluttered hastily through pages and sketches almost to the end there she cried suddenly i was sure of it her father laid the one photograph beside the other and jim forrester looking over his shoulder curiously compared them also they were identical but underneath the one pasted into the book a woman's hand had written the son of a king the title fitted the picture and reminded the girl of something in khesroo which had struck her yesterday and which was absent to day she turned over the page but beyond it all was blank those words were the last in the diary i think i remember something about it now my dear said her father taking his hand away from the book gently it may have been the last she took for i was camping round here as assistant just before before you were born and she was always taking children and giving pictures to the mothers not that i remember that particular one you see it must be fifteen years ago at least nearer five and twenty dear she said softly and as she realised the impotence of what the world counts as time to touch the smallest thing that once has been the utter irrelevance of days and weeks and years in connection with a single thought the photographs before her grew dim to her eyes the fine feminine writing with its verdict the son of a king became invisible so through her tears she saw only blurred and indistinct the wondering face of khesroo the goatherd look she said in sudden impulse the sun must have held two pictures of you he stared at the duplicate stupidly i did not steal it he began uneasily of course you didn't she replied smiling now it was my mother who took the picture and gave it to yours she was the mem sahiba you spoke of perhaps you remember her a look almost of relief came to the goatherd's haggard anxious face yes perhaps your slave remembers and that is why he thought he recollected the graciousness of the queen lady and the gold crown of her hair that will be it and your slave did not lie to the huzoor he looked apologetically towards the young englishman but the latter had once more an aggrieved tone in his voice as he said shortly in english whether he did or did not doesn't much matter there isn't anything to be got out of him apparently so perhaps you had better tell the orderly to take him back to the tent and see that he takes the quinine you send as i suppose you will iii i meant to tell him yesterday jim said the girl in an undertone glancing with almost maternal solicitude at her father who was writing within his grey somewhat bald head shining out in the light of the lamp by which he was working against the intense shadowy darkness of the tent walls but that disappointment about the lost city wasn't so to say propitious and to day there was that letter from hausmann about the coin somebody has discovered which has quite upset him poor father she added turning to her lover again it will be hard on him did you notice how he said it was but fifteen years she broke off and looked out into the night the stars were showing overhead through the fine fret of the kikar trees though the horizon still held a hint of the day that was dead against this paler background she fancied she could see itself a shadow yet half hidden by shadow that curving dome as of a new world forcing its way through the crust of the old or an old one through the new it was odd about those photographs wasn't it she said irrelevantly he must be five years older than i am his age is honoured by the comparison my dear jim she interrupted opening her eyes this unfortunate goatherd seems i said he was fortunate i think but i admit hating things i don't quite understand then you must hate me now don't be angry she added i mean no blame i very often don't understand myself i know that and that is why i want this business settled and clear you you seem so far off sometimes there was a passion in his voice he stretched his hands out to her as she stood apart her filmy dinner dress looking ghostly and elusive seen half in the dark half by the feeble light from within the tent she stretched out her hands also but there was all the world between his almost pathetic appeal and her almost amused repulse you must make haste and find the ducat jim i feel sure that without it and especially in his present mood father will never consent he certainly did not seem in a consenting frame of mind as he came out to them with the offending letter from hausmann in his hand i've answered it he said sternly but as the man is an ass he will most likely miss the point which is of course kapala's description of this coin he says distinctly that it has one profile superimposed on another with the legend beneath and the date below the flower on the obverse really child i think i will get you to figure it for me since hausmann seems unable to understand words you could use the handsome goatherd as a model you know remarked jim forrester vaguely surprised at his own irritation your father said his features were scythic yes assented the numismatist abstractedly as he tried to re read part of the offending missive by the distant light of the lamp rather an uncommon type in india nowadays though one sees it elsewhere queenie has it partly your mother had russian blood in her you know perhaps that is why i feel so interested in khesroo said the girl looking coldly askance at her lover oh by the way put in her father breaking in on his own indignation and the silence which ensued between those two who loved each other a silence which both felt to be at once incomprehensible yet inevitable intolerable yet in a way rascinating that reminds me the orderlies reported he was bad with fever to night send him over some more quinine i'll take it if you like said jim forrester faintly penitent she looked at the two men with disdainful tolerance i will see him first one never knows what these people call fever it may be pneumonia she moved off as she spoke into the night meaning to cross over towards the orderlies' tent then paused to glance back at the figure which followed are you coming too she said curtly i can manage all right of course i am coming replied jim forrester it is pitch dark to begin with and i can at least help you to find your patient i think you had better keep outside the camp so as to avoid the tent ropes it isn't any longer really it was if anything shorter but it brought them instantly into the grip as it were of the desert which crept hungrily upon the camp on all sides so that ere they had gone five steps beyond the canvas wings of the tent they seemed as much alone as far from conventional twentieth century life as they had been two days before when they first sat together as betrothed lovers in the sunset of a world of curves telling the tale of eternal of unseen circlings even so much of life's secret was invisible now all they saw was a darkness they knew to be wilderness a dim outline of themselves close together hand in hand for with the knowledge that they were alone perhaps with the memory of the wilderness they had clasped hands instinctively and for the time the sense of stress and strain had passed it returned again however with curious vividness as right in their path a shadow dim as their own showed suddenly she knew who it was instinctively before it spoke i thought you had fever she said why are you here i have been waiting the graciousness of the queen lady came the reply and the voice was buoyant with joyous vitality i have to tell her my dreams the fever always brings dreams and i remember now yea i remember all things from the beginning so if she will come i will show her the lost city where we lived and she will dream the dream also dimly in the darkness she fancied she could see the shining of his eyes see his beckoning hand what her lover saw was a movement of the shadow towards the wilderness what he felt was a faint increase in the distance between his hand and hers which made him claim it again queenie he cried what are you thinking of you can't possibly go now the man is delirious with fever surely you hear that in his voice you had better come back to the tent and let me send someone to take him into shelter and look after him for an instant no one spoke and then it seemed almost a bodiless voice from the desert which broke the silence for in his desire to detain her jim forrester had drawn the girl back a pace or two so that the darkness lay deeper between their two shadows and that third one nearer the wilderness let the queen lady decide for herself if she comes i will show her all forgotten things the golden crown that is not plaited hair the golden coin that was made for the lovers jim she whispered almost fiercely do you hear it is the gold coin it is waiting to be found i must go this is pure folly protested the young englishman if anyone has to go i will of course but what hurry is there why not wait till to morrow now do be reasonable queenie and consider she ceased trying to release her hand and when she spoke again it was in a natural tone yes i forgot that khesroo i will come with you to morrow it will be easier by daylight go back to the orderlies' tent now and i will send you over some more medicine and when the fever has gone the dreams will have gone too came the voice out of the night but it also was more natural more like that of khesroo the goatherd i shall forget again and then the gold coin that was struck for her and her lover for her and her lover echoed the girl softly did you hear jim i must go and get it for you long long ago came the voice again she echoed the words almost inaudibly this time and jim forrester drew her closer as he said sharply if anyone goes i will but i don't see the voice interrupted him but the queen lady sees she is like her mother she sees pictures in the sun of course the huzoor can come but if the queen lady really wants this thing if she believes if she trusts let me go jim let me go you shall not he cried seizing her round the waist in swift antagonism to some unseen influence in sudden consciousness of conflict and so to both him and her in the darkness and stillness of the desert within a few steps only of quiet comfortable commonplace civilisation came like a whirlwind a perfect tumult of bewildering emotions and all the deathless forces which never slumber or sleep in their work of moulding the soul of man leapt from silence into speech love jealousy hatred resolve high courage all these seemed to sweep through their every fibre of mind and body leaving them breathless wondering uncertain if they were awake or dreaming if they were real or mere shadows of a reality which time cannot touch or alter for an instant only they were conscious of all this but the instant might have been an hour in its suggestion of infinite experience then time claimed them once more time and trivialities and commonsense so that ten minutes afterwards jim forrester having made his preparations for a tramp into the desert was stooping to say good night to his betrothed and to assure her of his speedy return the moon would rise in half an hour the distance to the place where they had first met khesroo could not be over three miles he would be back by midnight meanwhile she could tell her father he had turned in but if she chose herself to sit up well as their lips met lingeringly a little breeze that had wandered from the desert shifted a ripple or two on the sand waves about their feet and died away like a sigh in the fine fret of the kikar trees above the unseen tents iv it was an hour before dawn the desert itself could scarcely have been stiller than the camp in the white moonlight the white tents looked like some shrouded city of the dead forgotten yet unburied for here and there some out in the moonlit open other flecked with the fine shadow of the kikar trees lay corpse like figures swathed in sheets as if waiting for their graves there was no sound no sign of life not even where the moonlight slanting through the still wide set wings of the drawing room tent showed the folds of a woman's dress the daintiness of a high heeled shoe the rest of the figure was in shadow though the light in its last effort against the darkness of the tent claimed the pages of the open book which lay on the sleeping girl's lap and turned one of them into a silver framing for the photograph of a child so vivid was the light that even the fine feminine writing beneath it showed in the dead woman's verdict the son of a king for the girl had been pondering over the strange chance which had brought her in her turn within the influence of this nameless kingship when as she waited for her lover's return she had fallen asleep in her chair and yet as she had sat there thinking watching she had felt very wide awake indeed not with anxiety however that had passed in fact as she followed in her mind what had gone before jim forrester's quite prosaic start to walk three or four miles into the wilderness on a moonlight night to be shown the bearings of a buried city and possibly to be given proof positive that there were ruins beneath the sand she had been in grave doubt as to what had actually occurred had there been conflict had love and jealousy and hatred and resolve risen up and claimed them all surely not why indeed should it be so though doubtless in her in her lover in the goatherd there was something held as it were in common yet which had struggled to be individual separate and this had been most marked between the young englishman and the goatherd unaccountable as it was she felt that in some mysterious fundamental mind of hers these two were associated indissolubly that they stood towards her on the same plane nay more that it was the consciousness of this which kept her calm which overbore the possibility of future danger the memory of past conflict what harm could happen to the son of a king or with the son of a king the phrase had been on her lips as she fell asleep it was on them as she awoke and stood up suddenly the open book sliding soundless from her lap into the soft sand but the phrase brought no comfort with it now had she been asleep for long had her lover returned was it past midnight the anxious questions surged up through the crust of calm before she was half awake and instinctively she was outside the tent in a moment on her way towards her lover's her rapid feet shod in the dainty high heeled slippers dimpling the shifting sand the coming dawn had sent cloud heralds to the west and an advanced pursuivant drifting across the moon shadowed all things faintly and seemed to increase the silence she called softly there was no reply so she looked in a glance told her that her lover had not returned and the light stealing in through the uplifted screen showed her by the travelling clock hung to the tent pole that it was already past three o'clock three what had happened and what was to be done for an instant the ordinary inrush of anxiety made her think of rousing the camp of sending out search parties but the next brought her a curious conviction that in this case danger lay in seeking outside help a certainty that in this matter she must stand alone that in this crisis whatever it was there must be but three alone if indeed there were three herself her lover and this nameless son of a king so almost without a pause the dimples left by her rapid feet were curving towards the highest sand wave within sight of the camp thence she could watch the desert sea and perhaps find him even now close at hand but once there the next sand wave attracted her as being a better point of vantage and so from wave to wave she flitted in her white dress like some desert bird leaving behind her a curved track of dimples in the sliding sand until a little wind the herald blast of the hurrying clouds overhead crept low down over the world and swept the dimples back into the old ripples khesroo she called suddenly for a shadow seemed beside hers in that empty wilderness but there was no answer jim she called again uncertainly but there was no reply yet she was not frightened she knew now in that mysterious fundamental mind of hers that she alone was responsible that she and she only could solve the riddle khesroo had been right if she wanted this thing if she had believed if she had trusted she would have gone before and now she must hurry or it would be too late wherefore or for what she scarcely considered khesroo she called once more and this time there was a faint inflection of fear in her voice for was that figure khesroo the goatherd or was it her lover or was it neither but someone only of whom she had dreamt as the son of a king should she go back the wish struck her keenly but she ignored it and went on she must she knew have left the camp far behind her and if she had kept the right direction would soon be close on the spot where that straight line of an arrow had startled her by its intrusion into her dream of love if she had kept it and surely she had for behind her the east was faintly lightening with the dawn yonder therefore in the dark of the heralding clouds which had huddled upon the western horizon must lie the domed shadows of the buried city khesroo she cried instinctively the very soul of her speaking show it to me for the sake of the woman who died as women die for a life of love a love of life show it to me and then behind her she heard a voice chanting as khesroo the goatherd had chanted the call of guidance for the wanderers in the desert yet the words were different for these were they seekers for sleep arise your rest is done go forth with weary eyes to find your prize in vain in vain to none will slumber have begun till from the heart of one desire dies listening she turned to look then realised that in her searching she must once more have circled back on her own footsteps for behind and not before her dark clear unmistakable the domed shadow of the lost city lay against the lightening east and on its swelling side as khesroo had stood before he stood again was it the rising sun which turned the fillet of knotted cord about his head to gold which dyed the coarse blanketing to royal purple and transformed the wearer into the perfect kingliness of buoyant youth and beauty she never knew she only felt that something stronger than herself caught her held her clasped her and yet drew her on so that with hands outstretched she ran towards it crying between smiles and tears the son of a king the son of a king the next instant she had tripped and fallen heavily on her face over a tangled tuft of grass concealing an unusually deep descent of a desert wave as she picked herself up confused somewhat dazed and paused to free her eyes from the sand grains which clouded them something almost at her feet brought her back to realities and she gave a quick exclamation for in the hollow beneath the wave where he had evidently sought shelter deliberately jim forrester lay curled up comfortably fast asleep at least so it seemed though khesroo's quaint old bow must surely make rather an uncomfortable pillow she stooped over the sleeping man and for an instant her face whitened she bent lower to listen to his breathing and as she listened a couple of startled sand chaffs fled from a neighbouring thorn bush their chuckling cry echoing over the desert like an evil laugh but a minute afterwards in answer to her touch jim forrester was staring at her trying to collect his sleep scattered senses hullo he said slowly how on earth did i ah i remember that brute of a goatherd played the garden ass and i lost him so after wandering about for hours i turned in till daylight but you my dearest dear he started to his feet as he realised her presence there and held out both his hands to her as he did so something dropped from them and lay glittering on the sand at his feet it was a gold coin they looked at each other amazed then she stooped and picked it up a double profile she said slowly holding it so as to catch the growing sunlight and the legend round she spelt it out from the greek lettering 'basileus basileon' and the date he cried the date yes the date is there she replied still more slowly turning to the obverse the bird and the date it is all right but i was thinking of the other what other basileus basileon 'the king of kings' she said softly and looked out towards the sunrise but the light had claimed the whole world and sent all shadows flying so happily prosaically they went home to breakfast yet there was one thing which she never told anyone perhaps because it might have stood in the way of the popular explanation of the whole affair namely that khesroo had happened on the coin and must have put it in jim forrester's hand after the latter fell asleep so not even when her father proudly pointed out to admirers that the double profile was that of a man and a woman and that the latter curiously enough might almost be a portrait of his married daughter did she ever say that when she found her husband asleep in the sand that morning the looped bowstring of khesroo the goatherd's bow was loose about his neck but she often wonders if it would have been drawn tighter had she not gone to seek for what she wanted the birth of fire the night was clear and silent the light pulse of the stars as they wheeled with slow certainty to meet the dawn was the only visible movement in the whole expanse of shadowed earth and sky and the only sound audible was my own life breath as i sate beside the glowing embers of the camp fire strictly speaking however there was no camp for i and the two coolies who carried my breakfast had missed our way in our detour through the eternal sameness of faint curve and level in the wide uplands and finally in despair of rejoining our tents had bivouacked as best we could on the shore of a small frozen lake one of those obstinate rock bound pools which even when spring has set seal of conquest on the world refuse to melt and so yield up their treasure of sweet water to its renewed thirst for life my servants had forced this particular lakelet to philanthropy with rude blows wantonly rude it had seemed to me as i watched the swift shiver with which the stable unity of surface had split into forlorn fragments of ice each adrift at the mercy of that which they had held prisoner for so long the other necessary element fire my men had also commandeered by a raid on the low juniper which crept like moss below the taller grasses of the plain the result had not been altogether satisfactory for the pungent smoke of the aromatic wood had at least so the sufferers averred though at the time i suspected a recourse for comfort to my whisky flask produced unmistakable symptoms of intoxication in the amateur cooks who after valiantly serving me up a rechauffe of breakfast had succumbed to sleep the mattress of creeping juniper on which they lay like logs was springy enough to have hidden them from sight even if the shadowed earth had not been so dark for it was dark formless void as only an unbroken expanse of featureless plain can be when the very sky grows velvet black because of the infinitely distant brilliance of the stars indeed the uniformity of indefinable shadow was almost oppressive although i knew right well the scene that lay around me for who that has once seen it can fail of seeing again with the mind's eye the marvellous mosaic as of white marble and precious jewels which covers the high upland stretches of the world's roof when the winter snow retreats reluctantly as if loth to leave the carpeting of spring flowers which follow on its fleeing footsteps i even remembered as i watched the embers that just behind them finding faint shelter from a solitary boulder there grew a tiny azalea i had never seen before a fragile leafless thing set sparsely with sweet scented flowers that were flecked rose on saffron like a sunset sky and the silence was oppressive also i caught myself listening listening almost breathlessly for a sound for some sound but there was not even a whisper among the tall grasses in sudden impulse i threw a fresh juniper branch upon the embers and the silence the stillness ended as if by magic for the green spines spat and sputtered as they shrivelled and sent out a dense cloud of smoke to circle up endlessly into the darkness a pungent smoke indeed involuntarily i drew back from it and covered my eyes with my hand waiting until the smouldering should lighten into flame the waiting however prolonged itself strangely no flicker of light reached me and i began to wonder dreamily what had happened so dreamily indeed that when at last i looked up i did so reluctantly and with a curious sense of confusion it was this no doubt which prevented surprise at finding that i was no longer the solitary watcher of those dull embers opposite me nearly hidden in the endless curlings of the juniper smoke was a man crouching towards the fire as if he felt the cold of the high uplands only his face and the hands he held towards the heat showed clearly the rest was lost in billowy clouds which drifting upwards behind him obscured the very stars i sate silent for a while disinclined even for curiosity and then rather to my own surprise i spoke as i might have spoken to a familiar friend you are cold i'm afraid to this day i do not know in what language he replied if indeed he spoke at all my only recollection is of the eloquence of liquid lustrous eyes the confident certainty of comprehension which is the child's ere it can speak articulately i am a star gazer so the fire draws me why why surely all know it is the star fire which fell when she first came to me hai me hai me when she first came and laid her hand in mine the drifting billows parted showing the stars above his head then closed again blotting them out blotting out all things it seemed to me even my own self as i sate listening to the faint wail which rose vaguely filling the wide shadows io io disturber of dreams why didst thou come io io bringer of dreams why didst go lo the star fire was not thine though thou earnest with the fire of the star through the pungent aroma of the burning branches a faint breath of perfume from the sunset dyed azalea swept mingling with it and so passing with it into the endless circling the lustrous eyes drooped losing their brilliance but when they looked up again only serene confident comprehension was there in forest days none of us were star gazers for there was no rim to the world on which the following footsteps could be seen but when we left the forest for the upland with its milch kine and seed grains we learnt to look for there was the rim and all things went to stand on it and disappear among the stars so gazing we saw that the stars disappeared also they too were following the footsteps but they never came back as they went like other things their footsteps were faithful so faithful that you could foretell by them the ripening of the seed grains the coming of milk to the herds so gazing we wondered here by this pool i watched taking no need of harvest or milk time but i saw nothing but the following footsteps and the footsteps of the stars nothing though i followed with mine eyes wheeling as the stars wheeled to meet the dawn while the shadows and my kind and all other things slept as they do now they slept indeed the very smoke had ceased to circle it hung in motionless curves soft impenetrable and i could see nothing now save the lustrous eyes and the dull glow of the fire so i gazed until one night as i stood following the footsteps of the faithful stars with mine eyes the knowledge came to me that as i stood watching them so someone stood watching me and all things someone who did not move and i was glad though i was afraid but that dawn when i went down after our custom to gather the seed grains with my kind they looked at me askance as if i were a stranger only io she of the beautiful young one that all cherished paused as she suckled it to follow me with curious wondering eyes there was a pause and through it came soft as a sigh that faint wail io io disturber of dreams why didst come io io bringer of dreams why didst thou go it was cold here on the uplands gazing but the faithful stars shone quite near me it seemed as if i could reach up and clasp them and i was faithful as they in the footsteps for i have driven a stake of wood into the ground firm as the ground itself and night after night as i watched the stars wheel i twirled the slender wand i held in my hands upon it following their faithful footsteps so that the someone who watched might see me even as they were and i was happy though i was afraid but one night when the tall grasses were stiff and the low green things were white with the cold my fingers could scarce twirl the wand and the fear lest the someone might grow angry with me came so strong that suddenly i lifted my head and cried to it to be kind how the stars shone my hands longed to leave the wand and reach them and in me there rose a great new joy as if i had found myself but that dawn when i went after the custom to gather the grain with my kind they fled from me as if i had been an enemy only io she of the beautiful young one with her breasts full of milk left the cherished one athirst to follow my footsteps and hold out a handful of the grain she had gathered for herself but i feared her and she feared me so she left it lying on the ground and afterwards i went and ate it for i was hungry but the touch of her hand that was on the grain touched my lips so that i felt it even as i gazed io io disturber of dreams why didst come io io why didst thou go the star fire was not thine though thou wast in the fire of the star even the lustrous eyes were hidden from me now i saw nothing but the fading glow of the embers as i sate listening amid the uttermost peace of all things to that soft almost voiceless wail the nights grew hot and the tall grasses crackled in the drought and the low green things wilted to greyness but i cared not for i had found myself and i knew there was a beginning and an end and even that touch on my lips did not disturb my dreams as faithful as they i followed the faithful footsteps of the stars until one night it was so hot that something in me seemed to out beat the beating of the stars a great darkness that was not night came from the rim and swallowed up all things i had seen it come before and had hidden my face from it like the rest of my kin but now my fear was too strong for hiding besides who could hide when someone watched always and why should i hide if i were faithful if i were as the stars thus a great joy mingled with my fear until something in me cried out with a great longing for something that was not in me and something that i had not seemed to come to me until my wand twirled faster as if other hands were on it and my lips as i cried out that i was faithful felt the touch of other lips upon them so through the darkness that hid the stars while the hot wind howled about me and flung hot earth grains in my face i shouted to the stars to come down to me the very fire had gone now and i strained my eyes into the shadows seeing nothing but endless curves as of smoke and lo one came just where the wand whirled by my hot hasty hands touched the steady stake of wood i saw a tiny star but as i saw it something came to me also making me forget the star it was io she had left her cherished one with her breasts full of milk she had left the little drinker athirst she had followed my footsteps through the darkness to find me and lay her hand in mine io io bringer of dreams io io disturber of dreams thou didst come and the touch of our hands and our lips together made us forget the starshine which had come with it but the shine grew and grew so that when we looked again it was not a star at all but something new and strange something that crept among the dry grasses and the wilted green things something that leaped and laughed amid the darkness something that sent hot arms towards us till i caught her in mine and fled from it leaving the wand and the steady stake behind so we fled and fled with the fire which came from the starshine behind us always fled in the faithful footsteps of the stars fled to find the dawn there was silence a long silence and was that the dawn the gracious dawn something surely all rose flecked on saffron and suffused with light lay before my upturned eyes it was an azalea blossom but as i rose to my feet from the springy juniper where i had been lying my head sheltered by the straggling branches of the leafless bush the dawn had come indeed on the far rim of the wide plain and between it and me rising from the retreating snow and the carpeting of spring flowers was a white vapour which lit by the rosy sun rays behind it showed like smoke from a prairie fire but our fire was out only a heap of grey ashes remained though the sleep which had come from the juniper branches still held the sleeping servants it needed a rough awakening as rough as that which had left the prisoning ice at the mercy of the prisoned water to rouse them and make them stand yawning stretching in the dawn avowing that haschish itself could not bring wilder dreams than those which had been theirs that night but was it a dream or does the man hand in hand with the woman still fly from the fire which came from the star shine the gift of battle then you recommend them both said the mild little commissioner doubtfully he was a vacillating man by nature lawful prey to his superiors tim o'brien cie the uncoveted distinction had been to his great disgust bestowed on him after a recent famine in which his sheer vitality had saved half a province and earned him rightfully the highest honour of the empire removed his long burmah cheroot from his lips and smiled brilliantly he was a thin brown man with a whimsical face and what would i be doing with wan of them on the bench and the other in the dock for it would be that way ere a week was past it is very kind of the lg to suggest putting either sirdar bikrama singh or khan buktiyar khan on the honorary magistracy but he doesn't grasp that they are hereditary enemies and have been the same for eight hundred years ever since the pathans temporarily conquered the rajputs in the year av' grace so you couldn't in conscience expect wan of them not to commit a crime if the other was to be preferred before him ye see he'd just have to kill someone but if ye appoint them both the dacencies of court procedure and the hair splittin' formalities of the local bar will conduce to dignity to say nothing of their own sense of justice which i'll go bail is stronger than it is in most people ye could appoint equity's apt to go by the board if ye've too much legal knowledge and they have none of that last but i'll give them a good clerk of the court and guarantee they come to no harrm yes sir i recommend them both to sit in banco when tim o'brien spoke as he did in the last sentence curtly and without a trace of his usual rollicking irish accent his superior officers invariably fell in with his views it saved trouble so in due course what answers to a jp's commission at home with no small extra powers thrown in was sent to sirdar bikrama singh rajput at his castle of nagadrug the snake's hole and also to khan buktiyar khan at his fortress of shakingarh the falcon's nest both buildings had been for some centuries in a hopeless state of dilapidation as from a worldly point of view were their owners' fortunes but just as the crumbling walls still commanded the wide arid valley which lay between the rocky steeps of the sandhills on which they stood so the position of the two most ancient families of hindus and mahomedans in the district still commanded the respect of the whole sub division of course they were antagonistic had they not been so always but in truth the old story of how they came to be so was such a very old story that none knew the rights of it not even the two high nosed high couraged old men who having in due time succeeded to the headship of their respective families had done as their fathers had done that is to say glared at each other over their barren fields formulated every possible complaint they could against their neighbour and denied any good quality to him his house his wife his oxen or his ass yet the two had one thing in common they were both soldiers by race their sons were even now with the colours of empire and in their own youth both had served john company and afterwards the queen this bond however was not one of union but rather of discord for the one had belonged to the crack hindu and the other to the crack mahomedan corps of the indian army and their respective sons naturally followed in their fathers' footsteps indeed on occasions the pair of dear old pantaloons would appear in the uniforms of a past day hopelessly out of date as regards buttons and tailoring but still worn with the distinctive cock of the turban and swagger of high boots that had belonged of old days and still belonged to the rigimint bikrama singh was seated on the flat roof which had sheltered him and his for centuries when he received the little slip of silk paper so beautifully engrossed which appointed him to the honorary magistracy it was a barren honour since he was not one of those and there are many who make a stipend out of an unpaid post but his thin old fingers trembled a little and his eye lost the faintly blue film which age draws between the real and the unreal whether his mind reverted at once to his hereditary enemy who was not mentioned in the paper is doubtful but he felt it to be an honour in these miserable days when a moneylender had more chance of being elected to a district council than a gentleman of parts to be chosen by the sirkar it was a thousand times better than being puffed by rabble votes to wisdom's chair it is well he said simply but with a superior air to his womenfolk the wife and daughters and grand daughters and daughters in law and their kind who filled up the wide old house i shall do my duty and punish the evil doer notably those who do evil to my people and my land since true justice begins at home and he curled his thin grey moustache to meet his short grey whiskers and looked fierce as an old tiger over in shakingarh also the commission met with approval it is well said buktiyar khan as he sate amongst his crowding womenfolk with a poultice of leaves on his short beard to dye it purple i shall do my duty and punish the evil doer notably him who has done evil to my people and my land since that is the beginning of justice and his hawk's eye travelled almost unconsciously from his flat roof to that other one far over the valley yet when they met a few days afterwards duly attired in their uniforms on the threshold of brine sahib's verandah whither they had repaired full of courteous acknowledgments to one whom they recognised as being at the bottom of the appointment a faint frown came to their old faces but brine sahib broke it to them gently with the graceful tact which gained him so much confidence government recognising their many and great excellencies had found it impossible to do otherwise than elevate them both to the bench where they would doubtless remain as they were now the best representatives of hindu and mahomedan feeling in the district and then tim o'brien made a few remarks about the king emperor and devoted service which sent both old hands out in swift stiff salute doubtless it was a shock to find themselves equally honoured but regarding the in banco they both admitted instantly to themselves that it was better to sit next a hereditary enemy than a stinking scrivener or a mean moneylender so bikrama singh twirled his grey moustache and said it is well and buktiyar khan twirled his purple one and said the same thing thereinafter they began work the women of both houses made the first court day a regular festival and sent the two old men from home dressed and scented and decorated as if for a bridal the purple of buktiyar's beard was positively regal while the points of bikrama's thin trembling fingers were rosy as the dawn they were fearsomely stately with each other of course but that only added to the dignity of the bench an excellent clerk of the court had been provided for them and their first cases had been carefully chosen by tim o'brien for their simplicity thus there had seemed no possibility of friction yet the two new judges returned to their womenkind vaguely dissatisfied dimly uneasy the mahomedan is no fool remarked bikrama singh thoughtfully he saw as quickly as i did that truth lay with the defendant lies with the plaintiff by god's truth admitted buktiyar khan grudgingly the hindu is not such a blockhead as i deemed him he saw as quickly as i did that lies were with the plaintiff truth with the defendant it was almost intolerable but it was true the hereditary enemies had agreed about something on god's earth and as time went on this unanimity of opinion became the most salient feature of the newly constituted court they agreed about everything of different race different religion something deeper in them than these surface variations coincided their innate sense of justice fostered by the fact that they had both been brought up in the india of the past that they represented its laws its morals its maxims made their judgments identical we waste time babu jee broke in old bikrama singh on the lengthy peroration of a newly passed pleader eager to air his eloquence words are idle when facts stare you in the face 'who knows is silent he who talks knows not' as the proverb hath it that is enough we are satisfied wah wah assented buktiyar khan at once acquiescent and regretful truly pleader jee thou hast said that before why say it again if sugar kills why try poison we are satisfied so that is enough it was more than enough for the local bar they went in a body to tim o'brien and complained that they were not treated as lawyers should be treated as usual brine sahib met them with sympathy but it was the sympathy of inaction i sincerely regret gentlemen he said softly that sufficient toime is not allowed you to get all the words you have at command off your stomachs i beg pardon your minds but ye see the judgments of the bench are unfortunately quite sound they'd be watertight against the full forensic flood of the whole high court bar so i don't see what the divvle is to be done do you they did not in sober truth the sense of equity in the hereditary enemies was too strong for the lawyers the old men were honestly fulfilled with the desire of punishing the evil doer and praising those who did well such flimsy overlays as race and tribe and caste and family and creed did not touch their agreement on all things necessary to salvation the fact was rather a pain and grief to them it did not make them treat each other with less stately dignity or cause them to be one whit more friendly out of court sirdar bikrama singh went home to his womenfolk and railed as ever against his neighbour and khan buktiyar khan as he rolled his little opium pill betwixt finger and thumb would do the same thing but in their heart of hearts they knew that since a judge must always be an ignorant man between two wise ones the plaintiff and defendant it must be some common ground in themselves which made their views coincide meanwhile the fame of the collective wisdom grew amongst the litigants and indignation at its brevity increased amongst the lawyers tim o'brien however when the timid little commissioner showed him a numerously signed petition from the local bar protesting against the strictly non regulation curtailment of eloquence only smiled suavely they get at the rights of a case by congenital intuition sir the high court have upheld their judgments in the few appeals the pleaders have cared to make so i don't see what the div i mean sir i don't see what is to be done do you once again there was no answer and tim o'brien as he dashed off here and there to institute enquiries in obedience to the cipher telegrams which came pouring in from calcutta by day and by night felt comfort in knowing that one sub division of his district at any rate was being well administered for they were troublous days for officers in charge someone somewhere had been unwise enough to take the thumb marks of a peripatetic preacher who was suspected of being an anarchist he was proved to be an apostle of unrest he was also unfortunately a man not only of thumb mark but of mark a professor briefly in some far away college so the official who had ordered the indignity in the interests of public order was degraded and thereinafter naturally began a campaign of would be terrorism amongst the schoolboys and students of the province which shattered the nerves of government by the lord who made me ejaculated tim o'brien angrily as he flung aside the last urgent communiquee from headquarters one would think from that bosh we were in danger of losing india to morrow can't they see it's only schoolboy rot sheer daredevil schoolboy mischief like throwing caps under a motor car and heads you win tails i lose you're over last i'll tell you what it is smith here he addressed his assistant a pale faced boy not yet recovered from the strain of examinations if i was worth my salt and had the courage of my opinions i'd have up those boys' masters and give 'em each thirty with the cane for not keeping their pupils in order that 'ud stop it instead of that i have to arrest a poor child of thirteen who threw a badly made bomb as harmless it turned out as a squib however my pension stares me in the face there isn't even a house of lords left to which i could appeal so here goes for the innocent victim av' education inspector arrange the arrest please naturally of course as tim o'brien had known every other schoolboy in the district marched about singing patriotic songs and doing wanton mischief to their hearts' content thus there was quite a crop of minor arrests in fact when the bench of hereditary enemies held its next sitting it was confronted with a lengthy police case against a gang of boys whose ages varied from ten to thirteen bikrama singh listened gravely to the details and twirled his grey moustache buktiyar khan also listened gravely and stroked his purple beard they listened very patiently yet a vague impatience came to their old faces then they looked in each other's eyes and at last the wisdom of their hearts found speech where is the teacher of these children bring him hither that he may show cause for himself to be brief that night the head master of the sub divisional school could neither sit down nor stand up comfortably but the streets were quiet the boys peacefully in their beds glory be to them cried tim o'brien exultantly when the news was brought to him they've more spunk than i have so now to get them out of the scrape he did his best and that was a good deal but the law and lies were against him the schoolmaster happened to be somebody's nephew by marriage and though there was ample evidence to prove that he had misused his position as a government servant the utmost favour tim o'brien could screw out of the powers was permission for the offenders to retire instead of being dismissed from the honorary magistracy he broke this to the old men with his usual tact applauding them between the lines for their courage to his surprise and relief they accepted the position calmly the better the subordinate they said the less likely he was to be always in agreement with others during their three years' work which in truth had been laborious not one of their decisions had been upset on appeal how many judges could say the same and as for head master jee would brine sahib if he could remove those thirty stripes from the miscreant's back ye have me there sahiban tim o'brien replied with conviction i would not an' that's god's truth so the old men sent in their resignations not altogether regretfully for one thing the unanimity of their opinions had been disturbing the old antagonism seemed more natural and there the matter should have ended unfortunately for all it did not to be brief tim o'brien was asked one day as district officer to sign a warrant for the arrest of sirdar bikrama singh and khan buktiyar khan on a charge of assault and battery against the head master jee who turned out to be sib to half the local bar there is no reason to go into the legal points of the incident or to tell of the vain efforts of tim o'brien to save the whilom bench from this last affront an epidemic of cases against magistrates had set in and late one evening the district officer started to ride over and break the news of the coming arrest to the hereditary enemies nagadrug stood on the nearest scarp of sand so he went there first he found the old sirdar looking rather frail engaged as usual in glaring out over the arid fields to shakingarh but this time all tim o'brien's tact did not avail for calm incredulous anger half dazed indignation took its place it could not be true what was he rajput of rajput to be dragged to court at the bidding of a miserable hound whom he had whipped and rightly whipped had not brine sahib himself applauded the act had they not done right the plural pronoun came out naturally was not a false guree god's basest creature did not the law say so he who teaches false teaching who kills his own soul and another let him die why had they not given the vile reptile an hundred stripes and so got rid of him altogether and now were they to have a degree decree against them shinjee it should never be never never they would not have it the old tongue found no difficulty in thus claiming companionship in revolt the old heart knew it was certain of sympathy in the ancient enmity utterly sickened at a tragedy he could not prevent the district officer went tactfully as ever to shakingarh only to meet with even deeper indignation innocent though he knew himself to be the englishman positively writhed under the contemptuous unsparing scorn of the old pathan what was the sirkar not strong enough to protect itself then let it pack up its bundle and get out of hindustan let it leave india and its problems to his people those northern folk who had harried bengal in the past who god willing would harry it again had brine sahib not heard the saying he who uses his public office to betray the state commits a crime against himself his country and his god and had not the base hound betrayed the state a thousand times yes it was a pity they had not flogged him to death the moon rose over the low sandhills before the district officer bruised and broken by the verdict of past india on the present rode back to the sessions bungalow where he meant to pass the night for with the dawn he would go up with the police officer and so soften the arrest of the hereditary enemies so far as it could be softened they would be let out on bail of course and at the worst a fine more or less heavy would see them through it was not so bad not so very bad the district officer tried to comfort himself with such reflections in his heart he knew they were futile that nothing would soften the degradation to those two old warriors nothing unless it was the calm moonlight that lay over the arid valley and turned the round old fortresses to dim mysterious palaces of light perhaps the peace of it sank into the wearied hot old eyes that looked out from the ancestral roofs with a new feeling of comradeship each for each dulling the hereditary hatred yet bringing with it old memories old tales of past enmity bring me my uniform women said bikrama singh suddenly half a dozen weeping daughters and daughters in law and an old wife too blind to see did as they were bid and in a short time the old man stood arrayed as for a bridal his sword buckled tight to his bowed back and the shield women the shield of my fathers that hangs in the entry i shall need it too over in shakingarh buktiyar khan impelled likewise by those memories of the past that hatred of the present had donned his uniform likewise and so the moonlight shone on cold steel and damascened gold as silently obeying some inward community of thought the two old men started silently alone leaving all behind them to seek for peace in their own way steadily over the arid fields nearer and nearer to each other the fields had been cut and carried the harvest was over it was nigh time to plough again for a fresh crop of what the peace of the unknown be upon you oh mine enemy said bikrama singh when at long last they stood face to face in the open and the peace of the most mighty be on you my foe answered buktiyar khan so for a moment there was silence then the rajput spoke his old voice full of fire full of vibration in the old days to which we belong oh mahomedan did brave men wait for fate they did not wait oh hindu came the answer when brave men found sickness or dishonour before them when there was no longer hope of victory when that which lay ahead was hateful and they left sons to carry on the race did not the ancestors of my race claim of their enemies the glorious gift of battle they did so claim it oh bikrama singh dost claim it now the reply quick vibrant rang through the moonlight a veritable challenge yea pathan robber thief i claim it now jug dan jug dan the gift of battle to the death take it pig of an idolator jug dan jug dan the gift of battle the still hot air became full of faint chinkings as buckles were settled straight scabbards thrown aside then there was an instance silence as the two old warriors faced each other art ready friend the question came softly yea i am ready friend the reply was almost a caress so with a quick clash of sword on sword youth and health and strength came back to the hereditary enemies it matters little if the combat ended in quarter of an hour half an hour or an hour whether bikrama singh or buktiyar khan got in the first blow the moon shone peacefully on the gift of battle she still hung a white shield on the grey skies of dawn when tim o'brien and the police officer coming to do their disagreeable duty found the two old men lying stone dead within swords' thrust of each other on the stubble they are really an incomprehensible lot said the police officer almost mournfully why the deuce should the two poor old buffers come out and kill each other as presumably they have tim o'brien smiled a grim smile you haven't heard i suppose why should ye of what they call the gift of battle well i have it's an ould rajput custom by which a man who feared he'd die in his bed or be put to it any way by any other stupid inept limitations could claim a decent death from his nearest foe well they've done it that's all and small blame to them by god who made me it's a protest with a vengeance but the worst of it is the government won't see it and i can't explain it cipher telegrams won't run to it so peace be with you friends the value of a vote a sketch from life he was an old man a very old man a syyed that is a mahomedan who claims direct descent from the prophet by trade a yunani hakeem or physician according to the grecian system introduced to india doubtless by alexander the great he had a little sort of shop close to the principal gate of the city where he was in touch with all those who with its ship the camel went out or came back from the desert beyond and with all strangers and sojourners in the land so all day and every day you might see wearied travellers resting on the hard wooden platform set in a dark archway of which his shop consisted drinking out of green glass tumblers some restorative sherbet of things hot or things cold things dry or things wet while he showed dimly in the background a visionary outline of long grey beard and high white turban in this way he heard a good deal of what was going on both inside and outside the city and as he was of the old school of the absolutely loyal outspoken mahomedan who while he holds our rule to be inferior to that of his own faith emphatically believes it to be superior to all others i used often to pause in riding into or out of the city for a chat with the old man seldom without benefit to myself one morning i remember it so well the gram fields outside the city were literally drenched with dew making the fine tufts look like diamond plumes amongst which the wealth of tiny purple blue pea blossom showed like a sowing of sapphires i found him sitting with a troubled look on his high wrinkled forehead peering through his horn spectacles at a blue printed paper a patient was snoring contentedly on the boards with tucked into the hollow of his neck a hard roly poly bolster which made me ache to look at nothing brings home to one the impossibility of any western judging what is or is not pleasant or convenient to an eastern more than the ordinary rolling pin two feet by six inches stuffed hard with cotton wool which the latter habitually uses as a pillow the sight of it makes a western neck feel stiff i recognised the paper at once we were then in the throes of local self government and a violent effort was being made to induce this little far away town inhabited for the most part by pathans exiled these centuries back from northern wilds to the indian plain to elect a municipal committee i had spent the better part of the day before in explaining to various rais'es or honourable gentlemen of the city that no insult was intended by asking them to put themselves up to auction as it were by the votes of their fellow citizens instead of being discreetly and as ever nominated to the office of councillor by the hated alien a few had gravely and dutifully given in to this new and quite incomprehensible fad of the constituted authorities others had hesitated but one a fiery old khan bahadur who was a retired risseldar from one of our crack native cavalry regiments had sworn with many oaths that never would he take office from amongst others the perjured vote of gunpat lal pleader who belonged to his ward and whose evil eloquent tongue had deliberately diddled him out of ancestral rights in a poppy field in the huzoor's own court no he had served the sirkar with distinction he had with his own hands nearly killed an agitator he had found in the lines nay more he had absolutely sent his daughter to school to please the sahib logue but this was too much it had been all i could do to prevent the hot tempered old soldier from giving up the sword of honour with which he had been presented on retirement as a signal of final rupture with the government so as i say i recognised the blue paper at once as one of many voting papers which had been sent out for marking and return for in these out of the way places in those days the secret ballot box was not the best blessing of the world as it is now and my old friend the hakeem was i knew on the aga khan's ward what have you got to do with it i echoed in reply to an anxious question why put a mark against the aga khan's name and give it back whence it came he salaamed profoundly huzoor that was the settled determination of this slave thus combining new duties with old which is the philosophy of faithful life but being called in last night to an indigestion in his house which i combatted with burnt almonds he told me that if i so much as went near his honourable name with my stylus i should cease to be physician in ordinary to his household and father and son we have been physicians to the aga khan ever since our fathers followed his fathers from ghazni in that capacity with the great mahomed on whom be peace then mark one of the other names which you choose and send it in i replied taking no notice of the scandalous attempt at coercion on the old aga khan's part a still more profound salaam was the answer that also would have occurred to me came the suave old voice but that the aga khan said with oaths that if i so much as made a chance blot on this cursed paper against any of the names thereon i should be cast for life from his honourable company i felt quite nettled her majesty's lieges must not be intimidated in this fashion well you must think of the person whom you consider most fitted to fulfil all the many duties which will devolve on him and put down his name i said for in these days when we really wished to get at the wishes of the people we were not so strict about nominations and proposings and secondings as we are now and i will speak again to the khan bahadur and see if i cannot induce him to stand i meant to do so by threats of exposure for using force to her majesty's lieges as i rode off my horse picking its way through the piles of melons the bags of corn the jars of milk the nets of pottery and all the olla podrida of trivial daily merchandise which finds pause for a few minutes about an active gate at dawn time the patient sat up straight from his backboard and yawned then asked for another violet drink but the hakeem was absorbed in the problem of voting i happened that day to have business in the city in the evening also but i entered by another gate so that the sun was nigh setting when on my homeward way i saw my old friend the yunani hakeem sitting with his pile of little medicine bottles and tiny earthenware goglets of pills and ointments beside him he was pounding away at something in a minute jade mortar and looked no longer disturbed but weary utterly have you settled that knotty point hakeem sahib i asked he gave a sigh of relief but pounded away faster than ever i give god thanks i have been led into the way of wisdom he replied else would i be harried indeed never within the memory of man have so many gentlemen of rank been sick as during this day i am but now compounding the 'thirty six ingredient drug' for one honourable house and have but just finished the 'four great things' for another 'tis anxiety about the elections methinks for they talk of nothing else hardly had your honour left this morning than gunpat lal sent to say he had a belly ache which his idolatrous miracle monger could not touch i had it away in half an hour with cucumber and lemon juice cold things to cold and lala ji full of compliments and regrets that the aga sahib would not be elected a faintly worried air crept over the high old face did he ask you to give him your vote i enquired with a sinking at my heart yea replied the yunani hakeem cheerfully and offered me five rupees for it ye gods above how soon political corruption seizes on the innocent i thought but others have offered more continued the old man with a certain self satisfaction then his face clouded yonder pasty faced knock kneed student who calls himself 'hedditerlile jackdaw' editor loyal objector told me it was his by right since he and his like were hindustan but i told the lad god had ordained otherwise for look you huzoor we mussalmans came from the north many long years before the sahib logue came from the west so i let him talk having by god's mercy come to a decision what is that hakeem ji i asked curious to know what had influenced the old man he salaamed quite simply the huzoor bade me think who could best do the work so i decided to vote for him he is noble and he knows what has to be done he knows santation and inspekshon conservance also new tense and karl ra pre kar sons and he added with the most beautiful supplementary salaam of pure flattery all other noble arts and philosophies it quite gave me a pang to tell him that this scheme of his would not work that i was ex officio president of the municipal committee and thus beyond the reach of voters his face was illumined by a vast relief even amidst his perplexities that is as it should be he said simply the sirkar then has not as they say quite lost its head the huzoor retains it still but what am i to do i left him looking the picture of woe absolutely unheeding of two patient travellers who had been awaiting my departure with that calm stolid disregard of the passing hour which brings with it to the western such a sense of personal grievance whereas to the eastern it only emphasises his trust in providence by proving the omnipotence of fate next morning however the whole aspect of affairs had been changed hakeem ji was alert spry surrounded by quite a congregation of would be patients to whom he was giving out his dicta with quite a lordly air there was no need to ask him if he had settled his vexed question that was apparent i simply asked him what he had done about the paper huzoor he said again with that lucid candour which was so marked a feature of the man himself the lord mercifully directed me therefore i ate it and it hath done me much good ate it i echoed you don't mean to say huzoor he interrupted cheerfully this is how it was after your honour left it was the time of evening prayer so i went after my usual custom to the house of god to await the cry of the muazzim and prepare myself for the presence of the most high by the necessary ablutions and as i sat squatted on the edge of the pool of purification my hands in the cool water i felt as if naught could cleanse me from that accursed paper that lay folded in my breast so i cried in my heart to the prophet that he should show me a way and then in one moment i saw where the error lay i was arrogating to myself decisions that should be left to the almighty so i did what i do ever when life and death are at issue when even the mighty skill of medicine has to stand on one side and do nothing i took my stylus and i wrote all over that paper the attributes of the most high his mercy his truth his wisdom his great loving kindness and then huzoor i crushed it into the form of a bolus covered it with silver foil and swallowed it as a pill it hath done me much good i am now free from anxiety the decision of all things rests with the most mighty the salt of the earth the huzoor is the salt of the earth said hoshyari mull submissively he had been educated he asserted at a mission school thus the words of scripture came handy to him so also did a variety of other things and you are the biggest scoundrel unhung i know that though i can't find you out yet retorted the boy almost savagely he was really a boy a round faced fresh coloured english boy though his years numbered twenty four and he was a full blown salt patrol on the great customs hedge which in the 'fifties and 'sixties still stretched between the river indus as it flows to the arabian sea and the mahanuddi river that finds its way to the bay of bengal in other words stretched for fifteen hundred miles across the vast continent of india it was a strange weird barrier this vast hedge of cactus and thorny acacia of prickly palms and still more prickly agaves that thrust out their spiked swords boldly from a buckler of spine set thicket it was fully fourteen feet high and of its width one could only guess in passing through the break every ten miles or so where some first class road claimed a long passage way through it here it was that the patrols had their bungalows and it was at one of these that the boy lived it was a very important post because it was so to speak the gateway between the south west and the north east that is to say between bombay and the central provinces and delhi oude bengal then lying as it did right in the rajputana desert with no other roadway within twenty miles of it on either side it needed a sharp look out all along the line to prevent isolated attempts at smuggling but the boy was quick at his work and spent all his youthful energy in preserving the intactness of his customs hedge the life however was as strange and weird as was the barrier absolute loneliness absolute isolation for long months together not one word of your mother tongue with luck a weekly post no books no newspapers no civilisation of any kind on the other hand there was endless sport unfailing interest for those who loved wild things and the boy had never been one for books harrow had left him one may say uncontaminated by them examinations had passed him by so though both his grandfathers had been high indian officials he had drifted naturally into the salt department the last refuge not of the incompetent but the unlearned there to be a man was all that was asked of you without manhood the salt had lost its savour there was no possibility of salting it with all the 'ologies in existence hoshyari mull paused in his deft winding on of the huzoor's putties to say submissively the salt of the earth speaks truth whereat the boy laughed he and hoshyari were at once friends and enemies the latter was chief native supervisor a man of about forty above middle height smooth faced and lissome there was nothing the boy soon found out which he could not do which in fact he did not do an excellent accountant he was also an excellent shot if he knew or said he knew every smuggler of salt between attock and cuttack he also knew every bird and beast and butterfly by name and could tell you the habits of all and sundry he knew the history of ancient india by heart and could pour forth legend and tale by the yard he was a magnificent swordsman and could teach the boy who had learnt singlestick many cuts and thrusts in short he was all things to the boy without him life in the patrol bungalow would indeed have lost its savour and yet the boy mistrusted him for no reason except vaguely that he was too clever by half hoshyari for his part regarded the boy as he had regarded no other master he had been as it were impresario of amusement to several huzoors of the ordinary type this one was different this one was as the angels of god that is how hoshyari put it to himself and on the whole it was a sufficiently comprehensive description and led to thoroughly wholesome treatment here was no necessity for itr of rose no distilled waters of any description save the dew of heaven as it gathered on the gram fields where the black buck lay or hung like a diamond on a cactus flower over which some rare butterfly hovered but there was no dew this hot may dawn when hoshyari mull with the deftness of an expert was putting the woollen bandages on the huzoor's long legs it was not his work but then half the things he did were not that i thought you were a brahman but i don't believe you are even a hindu the boy had said scornfully to him one day when foraging for breakfast in a village hoshyari had come back triumphantly with half a dozen eggs in his high caste hand hoshyari had smiled i am a srimali brahman huzoor he had replied tolerantly the maharajah of jaipur salaams to me there are none here in the wilderness able to say hoshyari hath defiled himself so he made no ado about this putting on of putties they were as he had proved to the boy the best of all protection against snake bite with them on you might almost venture on trying to find a gap in the great salt hedge without them it was madness for is not the prickly pear called in the vernaculars naga pan or serpent shelter and on these hot may mornings as well as at noontide were there not along the customs line many pairs of watching unwinking eyes lying in wait for the unwary beside those of the fourteen thousand humans who patrolled its long length day and night truly there were as they cantered along it after passing through the gateway many a faint rustle among the colocynth apples at its base told of death among the flowers for the hedge was at its blossom time thorny salmon coloured capers began it with here and there a yellow cactus bloom or perhaps a rare red one on whose stems the wild cochineal insect lay like tiny spots of blood above it a wilderness of these same cactus flowers big as a tea cup primrose within the white stamens ranged sedately round the whiter star pistil then yellow without shading to purple above them the violet scented puff balls of the thorny mimosa with every now and again a great lance of aloe blossom brown and white all set with flower bells and above all butterflies dragon flies moths flitting in myriads that is the gap huzoor where the ill begotten hound of a poorbeah managed to smuggle in a back load of salt last week he was going to carry it all the way to kashi benares he said as the salt of the earth will see it is now thoroughly mended remarked hoshyari with a debonair smile of superiority the boy frowned there was too much to his liking of these petty discoveries that long line of hedge had not been planted was not kept up to prevent the smuggling of a poor back load of salt he looked at hoshyari with dissatisfaction in his face when are we going to find something worth finding out he asked cavalierly if it is god's will before long huzoor was the reply and there was a curious undertone of certainty about it look my lord yonder are the buck they are on the move already we must hasten they were off at a gallop rifles crossed on the saddle bow over the hard white putt ground that was interspersed by ribbed drifts of fine white sand hoshyari sate his horse like an englishman indeed the boy looking at him used often to think that barring his colour he seemed of kindred race as in truth he was since the srimali brahman is aryan of the aryans there was in fact only that vague distrust to keep them apart and that always vanished before sport it was a hot day they followed the buck far then the boy having a sudden headache from the sun paused by hoshyari's advice at some wandering goatherd's thatch for a hearth baked cake a drink of milk and a rest till noon should have passed a very hot day and the boy rested in the shade of jund tree on a string bed and slept profoundly when he woke the shadows were lengthening and hoshyari squatted on the ground beside him had a new look on his face a look of anxiety mingled with satisfaction huzoor he said i have news for you what i have always prophesied what i have always told you would happen if the sirkar were not more careful has come to pass the native troops in meerut have mutinied they have gone to delhi and murdered the sahib logue i rode back to the depot while the salt of the earth slept to see all was right and and i heard it at the gate at the gate echoed the boy still stupid with sleep who brought the news has the post come in hoshyari's face was a study he must break this thing gently to the boy who was a full blown salt patrol or he would see red try to kill and be killed and that must not be quite a pang at the very thought shot through heart and brain making him realise that this boy of an alien race had grown dear to him the post had not come in salt of the earth he said evasively men brought it from the south the south echoed the boy again with a relieved yawn then it's a lie how could they know if we didn't how hoshyari could have answered that question easily he knew the strange wordless rapidity with which news travels in india in delhi to day in peshawur to morrow a mystery that has passed undiscovered with the coming of telegraphs and telephones that do it for pennies and twopences yes he knew but his task was to prevent this angel of god from putting his life into the hands of men who at best were devils as he was himself at bottom he knew that also most men with brains did it is not a lie huzoor he said simply these men are mutineers themselves they are going to join those at delhi murdering all the sahibs they can on the way he had laid his plan while the salt of the earth slept and watched the effect of his words upon the boy narrowly hoping that even the defence of a post might take second place before the duty of giving a warning and that would mean being out of danger for the time the boy's face blanched he had been away to the nearest station fifty miles off for a three days' holiday at christmas and the remembrance of a laughing girl with blue eyes came back to him now with a rush hoshyari saw his chance and went on the plans were laid for later on huzoor so they are taken by surprise themselves yet it gives them advantage also since everywhere the sahibs are taken by surprise also if only they had been prepared it might be different the cunning told the boy's face hardened into thought fifty miles on along the road he might do it when did they come in i suppose they forced the guard he added his voice almost breaking in its resentment about noon huzoor came the wily tones they were wearied out so much the better they would not start likely till just before dawn next day if he could give warning he rose and looked round for his horse hoshyari rose also the salt of the earth cannot ride through the gate he said the time for dissuasion had come now he will only be killed in the attempt the boy rounded on him instantly didn't i always tell you you were the greatest scoundrel unhung now i've found you out you skunk has this slave not always said the huzoor was as the salt of the earth came the instant rapid reply my lord listen this is the hand of fate wise men bow to it you are here safe alone none know of you come with this slave and he will save you d n you you scoundrel shouted the boy blindly and fumbled for the stirrups huzoor that is useless came hoshyari's voice quiet now all entreaty gone in its place almost command you cannot force the barrier where we had one man they have ten i will try muttered the boy doggedly i can but try the huzoor can do better said hoshyari he can come with me i know a way even in his excitement the full meaning of this came home to the boy you know he echoed under his breath didn't i always say you were the greatest scoundrel unhung and the huzoor is the salt of the earth came the unfailing reply the rapid indian dusk was falling as they made their way on foot to a village which though almost exactly opposite the barrier still lay the orthodox half mile from the hedge within which by rule of the salt department no building might be erected the boy was now in native dress for hoshyari had utilised the interval of time in arranging for the former's midnight ride of warning in reporting on these arrangements he had given scope to his imagination as to their difficulty in reality he had only had to ride up to the barrier give the password and enter to be welcomed as one of the party within whether he was at heart one of them or whether all things considered his cleverness had come to the conclusion that it was best for his purpose to fall in with their mood for the time being is uncertain but that purpose was clear namely to get the boy out of the danger zone if he could so he raised no objection to the looting of the salt patrol's bungalow the little salt patrol who doubtless had run away into the jungle in the hope of escape being but a mere boy but the office must be let alone there must be no tampering with books and registers since he hoshyari mull srimali brahman whose father god rest him had been prime minister to a prince was accountable for them to the powers that be be they john company or the badshah therefore the doors must be locked and the keys given to him and that kathyawar mare in the stable was his so that was an end of it whoever laid hands on the beast would rue the deed but all this was past now he had to get the boy through the hedge incredible though it seemed the furthermost house in the village is mine huzoor said hoshyari gravely it is thence that in disguise i penetrate the evil designs of the smugglers the boy ground his teeth and was silent he knew what he would say but this was not the time to say it this was the time to warn his countrymen they found the tiny hamlet deserted as all knew half india fled before the mutineers it is as well remarked hoshyari hardily since they might talk though none know of the secret save this slave and suchet singh the waiting house keeper but as they came upon what was called the waiting house since here salt that arrived without proper papers or that failed to pay the toll was held up they found suchet singh the sikh lying dead at his post the boy ground his teeth again so would he be lying but for his desire not only to die but to do look sharp will you he said roughly to his companion we lose time the moon will be up ere long hoshyari led the way across a yard an ordinary village house yard with a row of three or four native corn granaries standing against one wall these are huge basketwork erections each taller than a man in shape not unlike a big pickle bottle fixed to the ground and carefully plastered over with mud and cow dung they are all full said hoshyari with a curious smile as he passed one and sure enough as he lifted the little sliding door at the bottom a tiny moraine of wheat fell forward in the half light but the next instant with a dexterous twist of his hand the whole kothe slid round as on a pivot disclosing a round well like hole we shall need a light said hoshyari in a matter of fact tone and produced a tinder box and a candle from a niche at his feet once again the boy ground his teeth so this was the way was it and all the time this biggest scoundrel that ever went unhung was discovering miserable back loads of smuggling words had failed him long since now thought failed him also he plodded on his head bent down the narrow subterranean passage that scarcely showed in the flickering candle light but here surely there was less gloom and more room he stood upright and glanced above him a star showed through a tangle of branches we are under the great hedge huzoor said hoshyari deferentially in answer to his look the passage needed air and we also required to have a store closer at hand he held up the light and it fell faintly on rows on rows of sacks of salt ranged round a central space it is quite light here in the daytime huzoor he went on cheerfully sometimes the sun actually shines in and the snakes do not fall down now that we have put a net across the opening so this was one of the things concealed in the great width of the hedge who would have dreamt of it who could have dreamt it something of the comicality of the whole affair was beginning to filter into the boy's brain he caught himself wondering where the passage ended under his bed maybe it was almost as bad we are there huzoor said hoshyari mounting some steep steps and then swung a panel blocking the passage backwards it had shelves on it and books he heard the turning of a key he followed his leader and the next minute stood in the growing light which presages a rising moon inside the office room looking stupidly at what lay behind him only a cupboard in the mud wall where the ledgers were kept dazed as he was he yet realised partly how it was done the wall must be thicker than it seemed twice three times perhaps four times as thick but who would have dreamed and for the rest he looked at hoshyari defiantly the latter answered in words it was quite easy huzoor he replied lightly we could always replace salt that was taken from the government storehouse next door with salt from our storehouse yonder and that paid nothing the boy gave a little gasp but there was no time for that sort of thing now the kathyawar mare was waiting the moon would be up in ten minutes or so and he must be beyond sight of the chattering devils he could hear outside before them but perhaps yes perhaps he might be able to come back to come back and give these fellows their deserts i'll pay you out yet you're the greatest scoundrel unhung he said thickly as hoshyari held the stirrup for him and the huzoor is the salt of the earth came the urbane reply after that there was silence on the far side of the office for five minutes for ten minutes then faint and far only to be heard of an anxious listener came the sound of a horse's hoofs as it was let into its stride the huzoor had got through the picket and if he only remembered instructions might be considered safe for those fifty miles across country hoshyari drew a breath of relief shut the door and lay down placidly to sleep feeling he had done his best it is true he had sent the angel of god on a wild goose chase for briefly the mutineers had gone on straight that morning only leaving a strong guard at the gate to keep it until the second body of rebels should come in next day so by this time doubtless the fate of englishmen aye and every englishwoman too on the route to delhi must have been settled but the ride would keep the salt of the earth out of danger since it prevented him from doing rash things which otherwise he was sure to have done for what was the use of losing one's life in fighting two to a hundred still less if it were only one and these things were on the knees of the gods no there was no use especially when the store ammunition was in the hands of the enemy and you had expended your pouch full on black buck the huzoor was best away with luck he would only find the cold ashes of outbreak the hurricane of revolt would have spent itself for after all it was only the soldiers who would mutiny the rabble in the towns might follow suit but there was safety yet in the country so he fell asleep when he woke it was broad daylight daylight why it must be nigh on noon he stepped to the door and looked through the panes aye the sentry in the verandah was eating his bread and the other detachment had come in the courtyard was crowded with men so much the better for they would only rest during the heat of the day and go on at sundown thus there would be peace before the salt of the earth could possibly return if he did return but once away from his post he would most likely and wisely make for security to the north meanwhile it was time for him to think of himself there was gold in the safe yonder and it would be folly to leave it to new masters who had no more right to it than he he went over to it set the iron door open and began to gather together what he found the room was very still but on the one side came the clamour of the newly arrived rebels he gave one last glance at them through the closed door then slipped into the verandah on the other side then he paused before a dusty swaying figure that throwing up its arms as it saw him came at him like a wild beast it was a time for calm with those men in the courtyard a time of calm for both he stood back a step and said quietly so you have returned salt of the earth the boy seemed for an instant dazed then a loud reckless laugh rang out come back yes i've come back to kill you you d d scoundrel i've come back as i said i'd come i saved the huzoor's life interrupted hoshyari quietly and i'll save it again if he will not speak so loud the sentry will hear and then let him hear i'll have time to kill you first went on the boy blindly for all that he lowered his voice the instinct of belief in hoshyari's wisdom was strong the huzoor would not have time whispered the latter blandly i am no fool at wrestling as he knows and he knows also that i tried to save him there was a sudden unexpected appeal in the tone which surprised even the man himself he could have cried over this angel of god who refused to be saved the boy looked at him with dry hot eyes there were no tears there he had seen too many horrors for that and he had ridden all night all day till the kathyawar mare had dropped with him then he had stumbled on as best he might intent on revenge and now the sight of hoshyari was as the sight of a friend's face it brought back the memory of so many jolly times they had had together and what he said was true the man had tried to save him he had to bolster up his anger it it's the other thing you've got to answer for you you thief hoshyari's eyes gleamed don't call me that again huzoor i am no thief i was only cleverer than other folk i'll call you it ten times over if i choose thief mean miserable petty thief there was something more savage in the whispered quarrel than if the two had been shouting at each other and hoshyari's gasp of rage fell on absolute silence as breathing hard they looked at each other then the boy passed his hand wearily over his forehead no he said i can't you're right i can't kill you like a dog we must fight it out there are foils or swords somewhere foils with the buttons off where are they his dependence on the elder man showed in his helplessness he asked as a child might have asked there was almost a sob in his throat but the voice which answered was firm they are on the wall huzoor but we cannot fight here the sentry would hear and d n the sentry said the boy again helplessly what can we do hoshyari thought for a moment there is light enough in the storehouse under the great hedge he began the boy leapt up fire in his eyes by god in heaven it shall be there and mind you it's to the death you cursed smuggler to the death salt of the earth a minute later the false back to the record cupboard swung to its lock with a click and the office was empty the cactus flowers bloomed and faded the violet scented mimosa puff balls fell in gold showers on the green lobes the aloe bells withered in silence the waiting watching eyes waited and watched in vain if the snakes as they slid over the netting covered round hole in the thickness of the great salt hedge had looked down into the widening sunlit circle below them what would they have seen who knows since suchet singh the sikh lay dead at his post an appreciated rupee she was a poor mahomedan widow and lived in an unconceivable sort of burrow under the tall winding stair of a big tenement house which in its turn was hidden away in a long winding sunless alley the stair centred round a sort of shaft barred at each storey by iron gratings narrow enough to admit of refuse being thrown down the shaft being briefly the rubbish shoot of the building so that old maimuna who seldom left her seclusion till the evening had in passing to and fro to step over quite a pile of radish parings cauliflower stalks fluff rags a whole day's sweepings and leavings of the folk higher up in the world than she and even when she reached the odd shaped cell of a place whose only furniture consisted of a rickety bed with string halt in two of its emaciated legs a low stool and a spinning wheel she was not free from her neighbours' off scourings for down the wall beside the low latticed window where perforce she had to set her spinning wheel crept a slimy black streak of sewage from above which smelt horribly on its way to join the open drain in the middle of the alley yet here maimuna begam patha ni from kasur had lived for fifteen years of childless widowhood lived far away from her home and people too poor to rejoin them too ignorant to hold her own among strangers for she had been that most intolerable of interlopers the wife of a man's old age not a suitable wife bringing a dower into the family but one who as a widow might unless the other heirs took active measures to prevent it claim her portion of one sixth for life a wife too without a pretence of any position save that of the strictest seclusion a seclusion so untouched by modern latitude as to be in itself second rate without good looks also and married simply and solely because old jehan latif had fancied some quail curry which he had eaten when business called him to kasur and as the best way of securing repetition of the delicacy had married the compounder and carried her back to lucknow where to tell truth he found more attractions in the cook than he had anticipated when he paid a good round sum for his middle aged bride for maimuna was a good woman kindly gentle pious who had lived discreetly in her father's house and helped to cook quail curry for that somewhat dissolute old swashbuckler ever since as a girl of twelve her husband had died before she had even seen him so while she pounded the spices and boned the quails since that was one of the refinements of the bonne bouche for old jehan latif maimuna used sometimes to think with a kind of wondering regret what life would have been like if the husband of her youth had not died of the measles but being conscientious she never allowed the tears to drop into the quail curry it was no carelessness of hers therefore which led to fat jehan latif falling into a fit shortly after partaking of his favourite dish which for ten years she had dutifully prepared for him none the less his heirs who had had all these years in which to cook their accounts of the matter treated her as if it were there is no need to enter into details those who know india know how unscrupulous heirs can oppress a strange lone woman ignorant secluded a woman whose position as wife has from the first been cavilled at resented impugned it is sufficient to say that maimuna after a few feeble protests found herself in the little cell under the stairs earning a few farthings by her spinning wheel and thankful that her great skill at it kept her from that last resort of deserted womanhood in india the quern even so it was hard at times to wait till there was sufficient thread in the percentage she got back for her spinning to make it worth while for the merchant to buy it from her or for her to break in by a cash transaction on the curious succession of cotton bought and thread returned without a coin changing hands and this winter it was harder than ever for the unusual cold made her fingers stiff and sent shoots of rheumatism up her arm as she sat spinning in the ray of light which came in with the smell it was very cold indeed that new year's afternoon and maimuna felt more than usually down hearted for there had been a death upstairs and she knew that the stamping and shufflings she could hear coming rhythmically downwards over her head were the feet of those carrying a corpse now weary and worn as she was maimuna between the fifties and sixties did not yet feel inclined to fold her hands and give in even now it needed a very little thing to bring a smile to her face and once when a child had fallen downstairs she had surprised the neighbours by her alert decision so that when she heard girls' shrill voices in half giggling alarm through her door which was ajar she guessed at the cause and called to the owners to come in until the stairs should be clear one a slip of a thing ten years old she knew as the daughter of a gold thread worker higher up the stairs the other not more than five or six was a stranger a fat broad faced morsel with a stolid look and something held very tight in one small chubby hand she was dressed in the cleanest of new clothes scanty of stuff but gay with a yard or two of tinsel on her scrap of a veil maimuna paused in the whirr and hum of her wheel to look at the children wistfully her own childlessness had always seemed a crime to her it is fatma the pen maker's girl mai said the gold worker's daughter patronisingly she is just back from the missen school where they have been having a big festival because it is the sahib log's big day tchuk dissented the solemn faced baby clucking her tongue in emphatic denial it is not the big day it is because malika victoria is is the solemnity merged in confusion finally into a sort of appealing defiance is is that she unclasped her fist and held out a brand new shining silver two anna bit it was one of those struck when her majesty the queen assumed the imperial title the gold worker's daughter giggled she means wictoria kaiser i hind you know what the guns were about this morning they are to go off every year they say that will be fun but why asked maimuna puzzled her life for close on five and twenty years had been spent in the cooking of quail curry and spinning of cotton the very mutiny had passed by unknown to her she had heard vaguely of the queen and knew that it was her head on the rupee which despite the hard times she always wore on a black silk skein round her neck because she had worn it since her babyhood when the parents of the boy who had died of the measles had sent it her but what the queen had to do with john company bahadar or he to her was a mystery why giggled the elder girl because she is going to be the king and turn all the men out that is what father says he says she is sure to favour the women and i think that will be fun but fatma knows it all come dear one sing maimuna that song the miss sahibs made the schools sing to day sing it soft close close up to her ear so that no one may hear it for they don't like her singing you know at home mai it isn't respectable so standing on tip toe steadying herself against maimuna's arm by the hand which held the two anna bit fatma began in a most unmelodious whisper to chant a hindee version of god save our gracious queen the words as well as the tune were a difficulty to the fat solemn faced child but the old woman sat listening and looking at the two anna bit with a new interest a new wonder in her weary eyes bismillah she said half way through when the gold worker's daughter becoming impatient declared the corpse must have passed and dragged fatma off incontinently and she is a woman only a woman the girls paused at the door the elder to nod and giggle the younger to stand sedate and solemn wagging one small forefinger backwards and forwards in negation tchuk you shouldn't say that mai little girls are made of sugar and spice it is little boys that are made nasty the miss says so she should not say so faltered maimuna aghast the very idea was preposterous upsetting her whole cosmogony but when they had closed the door she sat idle too astonished to work then suddenly she took off the black silk hank with its precious rupee and looked at the woman's head at the back it was a young woman there young and unveiled strange incomprehensible but that other on the two anna bit had been an old woman more decently dressed and with a crown on her head frustrate their knavish tricks fatma's song returned to memory so the queen too had enemies and yet she was kaiser i hind and what is more she made men like the gold thread worker upstairs tremble on thee our hopes we fix maimuna sat and sat and sat looking at that rupee it was a day or two after this that an english official was sitting smoking in his verandah when he became aware of a whispered colloquy behind him it was someone no doubt trying through the red coated chaprasi to gain an audience of him and he was newly back from office tired impatient perhaps of the hopelessness of doing justice always so he took no notice till something roused him to a swift turn a swifter question what's that chaprasi that was the unmistakable chink of fallen silver the unmistakable whirr of a running rupee the unmistakable buzzing ring of its settling to rest and there midway between a giving and a taking hand lay the rupee itself the queen's head uppermost hazoor explained the chaprasi glibly your slave was virtuously refusing he was sending this ill bred one away hat budhi hat but the sight of that head on the precious rupee which after many heartsearchings poor maimuna had determined to risk in this effort to gain justice from a budhi like herself whose enemies also had knavish tricks brought courage to the old heart and the old woman stood her ground gharibparwar she said quietly with her best salaam and in the old pathan house they had taught manners if nothing else little fatma the pen maker's daughter says that wictoria kaiser i hind is an old woman like me and so i have fixed my hopes on her there is my rupee it is all i have and i want my widow's portion and she got it it happened years ago but the story is worth telling to day when women can no longer sing god save the queen the lake of high hope a man stood watching a primrose dawn there was a cloud upon his face none on the wide expanse of light suffused sky beyond the dim distance of the world at his feet lay stretching far irregularly into the grey mistiness of morning a great sheet of water the dawn showed on it as in a mirror save where tall sedges and reeds sent still shining shadows over its level light unutterable peace lay upon all things they seemed still asleep though the new day had come bringing with it good and evil rest and strife and then suddenly there was a change the man turned swiftly at a light footstep behind him to see a woman and in an instant passion leapt up bringing with it joy and despair for the woman was another man's wife but something in her face made him open his arms and take her close to his clasp it seemed to him as if he had been waiting for this moment ever since he was born she was a little bit of a woman frail and fair who looked over weighted by her dark riding habit but both seemed lost in the man's hold as vibrating with tense emotion he stood silent their mingled figures forming a swaying shadow against that further light at last he said in tender exultation at long last she threw back her head then and looked him in the eyes hope and fear and joy and sorrow showing in her face i couldn't stand it at the last she almost sobbed when it came to going away and leaving you here alone with that awful risk for no one can say what mayn't come with cholera he her voice trembled over the small syllable started earlier i am to meet him by and by so i came round just to see you and now she buried her face again and the sobs shook her gently he tightened his hold i'm glad he replied in a hard voice it was bound to come sooner or later you couldn't go on for ever an angel from heaven couldn't go on standing it all but now his voice changed now you and i he broke off and raised his head to listen it was a wild weird cry that echoed and re echoed over the wide stretches of water that rose in one long continuous melodious wail from every reed bed every thicket of sedge every tuft of low lamarisk and bent rush for it was the dawn cry of the myriad wild fowl which haunted this low lying jheel of northern india and swift as thought with a thunderous whirr of wide wings the birds teal and mallard and widgeon white eye pochard and green shank purple heron and white rose in ones in twos in threes in flocks in companies in serried battalions the primrose dawn was half effaced the coming day was darkened by wheeling veering eddying flight and the peace vanished in the strife of wings by george what a shot cried the man excitedly even passion forgotten as a trail of whistling teal swooped past unconscious of them to settle on the still water then recognising unlooked for humanity veered at sharp angle to rise again into the troubled air but the woman clung closer to her the interruption was terrible the soaring birds brought home to her what she had done and before that knowledge compelling emotion stopped abruptly it is very foolish of me she murmured brokenly and very wrong though i don't know i don't know it was your danger and i was so tired besides it it need make no difference no difference he echoed in joyous incredulous exultation why of course it makes all the difference in the world little woman you and i can never go back again now we can never pretend again that we don't care no when this cholera camp is over and i have time we must think over what is to be done but it's final yes it's final my darling my darling his kisses rained on her face his heart encompassed her so they stood for a while oblivious of the wheeling veering eddying wings above them oblivious of all things save that they were lovers and that they knew it then she left him he would be wondering why she was so late but suleiman the arab pony would soon carry her over the sandy plain the man remained watching the slight figure on the bounding grey till it was lost in the azure silk of morning then he returned slowly to the jheel again lost in thought there was a good deal whereof to think for she was a mother by ill luck the mother of girls why had she worn those tiny presentments of their sweet baby faces in the double heart brooch which fastened her folded tie she had not thought of course but it had somehow come between him and his kisses after he had noticed it well it was unfortunate but that sort of thing had to be faced and he would face it after he had seen his cholera camp through for he was a doctor and the thought of what might lie before him was with him as a background to all others he had chosen a good place for the camp yonder among the low sandhills which were the highest point in all the desert plain and if that did not kill the germ they could move on meanwhile he drew a long breath and looked out over the water the primrose dawn had passed to amber the amber was beginning to flame the whirring wings had carried the birds to distant feeding grounds only a flock of egrets remained fishing solemnly in a distant shallow the huzoor is looking for god's birds said a courteous voice beside him they have gone likely to the lake of high hope for it nears the time of transit to a higher land the speaker was an old man seated so close to the water that his feet and legs were hidden by it he had a simple pleasant face which over thinness had refined almost to austerity the doctor took stock of him quietly his speech proclaimed him a down country man his lack of any garment save a strip of saffron cloth around his loins suggested asceticism but his smile was at once familiar and kindly manasa sarovara replied the englishman carelessly is that what you mean i am told the birds really do go there during the hot weather i wonder if it is true i should like to see it he spoke half to himself for he was somewhat of an ornothologist and the tale of the great west tibetan lake of refuge for god's dear birds that lake far from the haunts of men amid the eternal snow and ice into which so many streams flow out of which come none had caught his fancy the huzoor can go when he chooses remarked the old man placidly but he must leave many things behind him first the mem sahiba for instance the doctor felt himself flush up to the very roots of his hair and his first instinct was to fall upon the evident eavesdropper consideration natheless condemning this course he tried cool indifference you have been here some time i perceive he said calmly i have been all the time behind the shivala acquiesced the other with beautiful frankness as he pointed to a large black upright stone set on end by the water the huzoor was was too much occupied to observe this slave so that is a shivala is it interpolated the englishman hurriedly it doesn't look much like a temple we pilgrims call it so huzoor and we worship it then you are a pilgrim whither to the lake of high hope huzoor came the answer and there was a tinge of sadness in the tone i have been going thither these twenty years past but my feet are against me god made them crooked he drew them out of the water as he spoke and the doctor's professional eye recognised a rare deformity recognised also that they were unconceivably blistered and worn you will not get to manasa sarovara on those he said kindly they need rest not travel the old man shook his head and a trace of hurry crept into his voice i give them such rest as i can huzoor that is why i sat with them in heaven's healing water but i must get to manasa sarovara or my pilgrimage will be lost and it is not for my own soul see you then he smiled brilliantly and this slave will reach it huzoor shiv's angels tell me so shiv's angels queried the doctor the birds yonder huzoor replied the old man gravely pointing to the flock of fishing egrets some call them rice birds and others egrets but they come from shiv's paradise one can tell that by their plumes perhaps that is why the mems are so fond of wearing them a sudden memory of her face as he had first seen it beneath a snowy aigrette of such plumes assailed the doctor's mind but it brought a vague dissatisfaction herodias alba he muttered to himself giving the latin name of the bird more likely to have something to do with dancing away a man's head then a vague remorse at the harshness of his thought made him say curiously and why must i leave the mem behind if i want to reach the lake of high hope because she is a mother huzoor came the unexpected reply followed by deprecating explanation this slave has good eyes he saw the childs' faces on her breast once again the doctor felt that unaccustomed thrill along the roots of his hair what right had this old man to see everything and to preach at him a sudden antagonism leapt up in him against all rules all limitations well i don't mean to leave her behind i can tell you he said almost petulantly when a man has found paradise shiv's paradise is close to the lake of high hope interrupted the suave old voice d n shiv's paradise cried the doctor then he laughed it's no use brahman jee for i suppose you are a brahman i'm not going to be stopped by snow or ice look here his mood changed abruptly to quick masterful protest that would be to give up happiness now what makes you happy holiness i expect being a pilgrim high caste one of the elect give that all up brahman jee and and i'll think about it and if you'll come over there he pointed to the low sandhills as he spoke this evening i'll give you an ointment for those blistered feet of yours you'll never get to manasa sarovara otherwise you know i shall get there some time huzoor came the confident reply perhaps the old man came perhaps he did not the doctor was far too busy to care since before daylight failed he found himself face to face with the tightest corner of his life the promise of the primrose dawn passed before noon heavy rain clouds massed themselves into a purple pall dull lowering silent until with the close of day the courage of the coming storm rose in low mutterings and then at last the rain fell fell in torrents it found the regiment seeking safety from the scourge of cholera on the march and disorganised it utterly with baggage waggons bogged soldiers already discouraged by dread all drenched and disordered there was nothing to be done but keep cool and trust that chance might avert disaster since no man could hurry up tents that were miles behind there's another man in g company down sir said the hospital sergeant and the apothecary reports no more room in his ward there's room here replied the doctor setting his teeth orderly put a blanket in that corner and lift smith to it he's getting better he'll do all right so yet one more man found a cot and such comfort as skill and strength of purpose could give him while the thunder crashed overhead and the pitiless rain hammered at the taut tent roof like a drum one had to shout to make oneself heard lights i say lights i've been calling for them these ten minutes why the devil doesn't someone bring them i can't see to do anything the doctor's voice rang resonantly but the lights did not come the waggon with the petroleum tins was hopelessly bogged miles away and in the confusion no one had thought of lights thank god for the lightning muttered the doctor with unwonted piety as with awful blinding suddenness the whole hospital tent blazed into blue brilliance putting out the miserable glimmer of the oil lantern that had been raised from somewhere in that brief luminous second he could at least see his patients thirty of them or more it was not an encouraging sight the livid look on many faces might be discounted by the lightning but there was an ominous stillness in some that told its tale gone bring in another man from outside came the swift verdict and order after a moment's inspection with the oil lantern beg pardin' sir almost whined a hospital orderly but apothecary jones has sent to say he's took himself an' can't go on no more an' beggin' your pardin sir i'm feeling awful bad myself the doctor held up the lantern and its bull's eye showed a face as livid as any in the tent a face distorted by justifiable horror and fear go into the quarantine tent it's up by now and tell them to give you a stiff un of rum with chlorodyne in it you'll be better by and by i've no use for you here and he had no use for him that was true shaking hands and trembling nerves were only in the way in a tight corner like this so one by one men fell away leaving the one strong soul and body to wrestle with a perfect hell for the rain never ceased the thunder went on crashing the lightning was almost incessant thank god for that thank god for the inches of running water on the floor of the tent that swept away its unspeakable uncleanlinesses for the thunder's voice that drowned all other sounds for the blessed light which made it possible to work the very sweepers disappeared at last no one was left save that one strong soul and body and even he stood for a second dazed irresolute how can this slave help the protector of the poor came a courteous voice beside him and he turned to see a smile at once familiar and kindly how echoed the doctor stupidly then he recovered himself you can't you're a brahman high caste all that this slave has come to help the huzoor so that he may be able to reach manasa sarovara was the quiet insistent reply where shall he begin a sudden spasm almost of anger shot through the strong soul and body as it realised and recollected vaguely dimly as rudely roughly it gave no choice save the most menial work but instant obedience followed and the doctor dismissing all other thoughts plunged once more into the immediate present the rain pelted the thunder roared but every time that blue brilliance filled the tent it showed two men at work both doing their duty nobly a born nurse thought the doctor almost remorsefully as he saw the old man moving about swiftly and remembered those blistered and bleeding feet they must hurt you awfully he said at last god's healing water cools them huzoor replied the old man with a radiant smile i shall not be delayed in reaching the lake of high hope so the long night drew down to dawn once more and dawn brought peace again even to the cholera camp an hour and a half passed without a fresh case and the doctor realising that the crisis was over found time to notice the grey glimmer of light stealing through each crack and cranny of the tent he set the flap aside and looked out the primrose east was all barred with purple clouds the distant jheel lay in still shiny shadow but there was no concerted dawn cry of the wild birds and the flights of whirring wings were isolated errant the call has come to them huzoor said the suave old voice beside him they have gone to manasa sarovara leaving all things behind them the englishman turned abruptly almost with an oath and began to count the costs of the night thirty six dead bodies awaiting burial but no more no more with the mysterious inconsequence of cholera the scourge had come and gone seen in the first level rays of the sun the camp looked almost cheerful almost bright a couple of doctors had ridden out from headquarters there was no more to be done i'll go out for a bit and shake off the hell i've been in all night said the doctor to the chief apothecary who was recounting his past symptoms with suspicious accuracy so he went out and wandered round the jheel watching a flock of egrets herodias alba that still lingered in its level waters were they really shiv's angels or did they dance away men's brains the sun was already high when he returned to camp looking worn and tired the hospital orderly whom he had sent to bed with rum and chlorodyne was standing spruce and alert at the canteen feeling better eh green he said kindly as he passed then added all right i suppose no more cases or deaths no sir replied the orderly saluting somewhat shamefacedly leastways not to count there's a h'ole man as they found dead outside the camp about quarter of an hour agone but not being on the strength of the regiment 'e don't count five minutes afterwards the doctor his face still more tired and worn was looking down on the body of his helper it must have been one of those sudden cases in which collapse comes on from the very first for no one had seen the old man ill they had simply found him lying peacefully dead with his blistered deformed feet in a pool of water the doctor wrote a letter it was rather a wild letter about plumes and egrets and the difficulty of distinguishing herodias alba from the stork which brought babies for the strain of that night in hell and the subsequent fever brought on by wandering about the jheel land when he was outwearied had told even upon his body and soul so they sent him to the hills when he began to recover and being a keen sportsman he did not stop in the capuas of smart society but made straight for the solitudes seeking for something to slay for he felt a bit savage sometimes and ever though he did not acknowledge the fact his route brought him nearer and nearer to that high tibetan land where ice and snow reign eternal through garhwal and up by kidarnath where the new born ganges issues from a frost bound cave until one day he pitched his little six foot hunter's tent on the other side of the holy himalaya and looked down into the wide upland valleys of naki khorsum and up beyond them to the great white cone of kailasa the paradise of shiva a mere iceberg cutting the clear blue sky how cold how distant how utterly unsatisfactory he stood looking at it in the chill moonlight after his two servants were snoring round the juniper fire on their beds of juniper boughs looking and smoking and thinking he had thought much during his three months of solitary wandering and now the time was coming when thoughts must be translated into action for his leave was nearly up should he go backwards or forwards go on to manasa sarovara or set his face towards lower levels should hope of the mind take the place of hope of the body bah he was a fool he would be a sensible man and return that was his last thought as he rolled himself in his hunter's blanket and lay down to sleep but the dawn found him plodding on in front of his two coolies towards that compelling cone of snow he left the tent at the foot of the next ridge and that night the last thing he saw was orion's sword resting upon the summit of mount kailasa yes he would go on he would see if it were true that herodias alba disported its plumes on the waters of the lake of high hope during the latter part of his wanderings he had partly owing to the unsettled and hesitating state of his mind diverged from the pilgrim track but here on this last day he rejoined it and in more than one place the bones of someone who had fallen by the way showed amongst the flowers which carpeted every rent in the world's white shroud of snow showed like streaks of snow itself so bleached were they by long months of frost but the flowers what countless thousands of them low almost leafless hurrying in hot haste to blossom while they yet had time and yet how pure how cold how colourless had not this mountain side looked from afar almost as cold as kailasa which viewed from the height of the pass seemed barely more significant but every foot of descent made a difference and soon over the rocky ravine it rose stupendous its great glacier shiny cold inaccessible before long it would overtop the sky and reach high heaven no wonder men thought of paradise down and down through a mere cleft in the rocks that closed in shutting out all view then suddenly he gave a little gasp and stood still so that was the lake of the soul's hope manasa sarovara the pure beauty of it sank into him its rest and peace filled him with content a wilderness a perfect wilderness of bright hued flowers between the snow slopes and the lake whose blue waters gleamed like sapphires between the diamond icebergs that drifted hither and thither on its breeze kissed waves but not one sign of life no movement no noise save every now and again a far distant thunderous roar and a puff of distant white smoke upon some mountain side telling of a falling avalanche cradled in snow yet wreathed in flowers solemn secure unchangeable it was a marvellous sight he was glad he had come for it was a place where one could think really think so he stood and thought really for a while and then he took out his watch time was waning for he had to re climb the pass and rejoin his tent ere sundown still there was enough left for him to reach that jutting flower set promontory whence surely the best view of the whole would be obtained yes decidedly the best shiv's paradise rising from the water's edge showed from hence equal sided serene unassailable a pure pyramid of ice truly a sight never to be forgotten a sight well worth a pilgrimage and then some swift remembrance made him glance downwards and he saw before him the bleached skeleton of a man something in the attitude of it the feet hidden in the lake made him stoop curiously to see what its sapphire surface covered what was it he stood looking down into the rippling water that whispered and whispered to the flowers ceaselessly for some time then he turned and climbed the hill again but even if he had taken anything with him to manasa sarovara he left it behind him there beside the skeleton of a man with curiously deformed feet but the blisters had gone retaining fees it is not always on rocks and rapids that the cockle shell of human happiness meets with the direst shipwreck often in the quietest backwaters where no current is where not a ripple disturbs the still surface disaster so absolute so overwhelming comes that the very tragedy of it sinks out of sight also unrecognised unrecorded such a backwater was a little square of roof four pair back in a tall tenement house in lucknow where one blazing hot day in june a buxom woman with a yellow skinned baby hitched to her hip outside the voluminous veil of dirty crushed calico which for the present was mostly in folds about her feet was haranguing three other women who sat working as for dear life in the hard unyielding shadow of the high walls which were deemed necessary even here to shut out the possibility of prying eyes what you need honourable ladies finished mussumet jewuni decisively is a 'bannister' a 'bannister' echoed the eldest of the three listeners and what new fangled thing is that she did not slacken a second in her deft twirling of her distaff neither did the others despite their questioning eyes relax their swift business indeed as they sat in the shadows the three might have served as a model for the fates since khulasa khanum span ceaselessly aftaba khanum wound yarn on a circling bamboo frame and lateefa khanum snipped with a very large pair of scissors at the shirt she was making for being many years younger than the others her eyes were still fit for fine back stitching beautiful hazel eyes they were too large soft full of sunshine and shadow jewuni dismissed one mouthful of betel nut and began on another ere she replied a 'bannister' is a pleader who having been across the black water to london knows new tricks wherewith to confound the old ones 'tis the only chance for justice ladies i know of such an one and could bring him here to receive instruction and mayhap there would be no need for the honourable ladies to answer in court khulasa khanum's hands froze in horror she glanced anxiously towards lateefa talk not like that before the child woman she interrupted almost fiercely no strange man as thou knowest comes to this virtuous house and no woman goes out of it both statements were absolutely true these women distant relations yet bound to each other by the tie of a common poverty a common wrong had not set foot beyond that square of roof for years and no men save those whose interest it was to keep them poor had ever climbed the steep stair hole which showed like a cavernous shadow in the high back wall yet jewuni begum laughed she was a very different stamp of woman her oil beplastered hair narrowing her forehead beyond even nature's intention and the soap curls at her silver and gold tasselled ears were of a fashion which left little doubt as to her moral character but being a bottomless receptacle for the gossip of the whole town owing to her husband's position as a paid tout at the law courts the neighbourhood in general and even that virtuous roof in particular had left inquiry and condemnation alone for the present lo khanum she giggled that is true enough god knows yet what avails it for reputation none 'tis a rare joke and i meant not to tell it thee still 'tis too good to be lost in the mirza's reply to the last petition sent from this house for direct payment of the pension due to honourable ladies it is written my man saw it and there was laughter among the writers i will go bail that the petitioners being giddy young things given to wanton ways it is necessary for the honour of a princely family that they be held under restraint such money as is due being expended lavishly aye and more in securing the luxury due to gentlewomen of your estate here she herself went off into such chuckles that the yellow baby had to be shifted higher on her shaking side the three women ceased working and looked at each other helplessly while underneath their curiously fair skins a flush showed distinctly did they say that of us asked aftaba khanum at last in a faltering voice perhaps it was her occupation of winding hanks without tangle which made her always so keen to have all things clear and of me echoed khulasa faintly her old face had grown very grey her hands though they had ceased working were no longer frozen they trembled visibly only lateefa sat silent a swift yet sullen anger on her still young face jewuni giggled again there was no distinction of decency khanum but 'tis too bad and that is why i spoke of a 'bannister' to confound such old tricks with new ones however 'tis no business of mine only she paused in her conversation and going beside lateefa she lowered her voice there is no need for stitching shirts till shroud time comes there be other ways as i have told thee before of earning money aye enough even to pay a 'bannister's' fee and get the truth made known so if thou preferest to be as a hooded falcon seeing nothing of the sport in life sit and stitch if not come to me and claim freedom in all things when she and the yellow baby had gone silence fell on the desecrated little square of virtuous roof truly it was hard after a life time of patient propriety long years of self denial involving silence and seclusion even from scant justice to have all these virtues reft from them in order that wantonness and giddiness and youth might serve as an excuse for withholding their rights that these rights should be traversed was to their experience no new thing though to western ears it may seem inconceivable that even under british rule it is the easiest thing in the world to treat secluded women as these three had been treated briefly for the male head of the family as guardian to leave them to starve while he made merry over their poor pittances of pensions granted to them by government in consideration of their race or its good services no wonder then that khulasa sat helpless resorting for comfort to the little rosary she always carried that aftaba's tears ran silently down her withered cheeks or that lateefa's sullen anger gave a dangerous look to her still handsome face so dangerous that fear pierced aftaba's soft self pity at last making her ask anxiously what was it she said to thee privately lateefa naught worse surely the darkening of the handsome face was not all anger now lateefa rose with a bitter laugh nay she but spoke of 'fees' for justice as if we had aught to pay yet something must be done we have done too much already came khulasa's shaking voice if we had trusted in the lord instead of sending petitions there would have been no need for them to tell the lie if we had waited lo we had waited put in aftaba and petitions are no new thing our fathers made them they are not like 'bannisters' and strange men these there was no need for her to explain what these were to that virtuous roof for at the moment a tentative cough from the stair hole accompanied by the rhythmic squelching of water in a skin bag announced the daily visitation of old shamira the bhisti who had filled their earthen pots for them for years and years and in an instant veils were hastily drawn close faces turned to the wall bismillah came the orthodox greeting for old shamira knew all about the honourable ladies and in a way loved them though he had never once seen them in all the long years bismillah irruhman niruheem returned the virtuous ones decorously only lateefa standing in the corner felt that there was but half a truth in the words god might be clement in the next world but he was far from merciful in this yet it was not the fault of the world itself that was fair enough there was a displaced brick in the corner where she stood and profiting by the temporary blindness of her veiled companions she did what she had done several times on the sly during the past few weeks she took advantage of the brick hole and tip toe to gain a glimpse of that outside world it was the veriest glimpse indeed of purpling shadowy roofs huddled against a flare of sunset sky but the dust haze through which she saw it seemed a golden halo of transfiguration and in a second she had made her choice she would pay a retaining fee for bare justice to her own womanhood jewuni was right times had changed why should she waste her life clinging to old ways when new freedom was within reach yet there was a startled half frightened look both in the sunshine and shadow of her hazel eyes as she waited face towards the wall till the cool sound of pouring water have ceased she was free to resume her limited life limited indeed how strange those limitations seemed in the light of her new decision but those brief minutes of arrest due to old shamira's entry into the feminine cosmogony had curiously enough brought decision to the other two women for in truth jewuni's story jewuni's giggle at the joke had been the last straw to their patience the final goad rousing them to action of which each in her own way they had been dreaming for long they too felt that the time was past for temporising for trimming their sails to suit each other's opinions so khulasa khanum's pallid high featured face was more like that of one new dead than ever when shamira gone she returned to work and in truth she had in those few seconds died for ever to this world and its works delicate from her babyhood saintly from pure suffering joy had had small part even in her desire and her resistance to pain had been always half hearted for what was even the justice of man worth in comparison with the justice of god naturally enough then jewuni's tale of the sorry jest had been more a horror to her than to either of the others making her turn to the hidden meaning of her thwarted life for comfort her retaining fee for justice should be paid where there was no fear of a miscarriage and in the meantime while the tyranny of life lasted she must work work to the end for on her work practically those others lived in all the town no hands could spin a finer thread than old khulasa khanum's the very spinning jennies of bombay could not compete with her ceaseless industry and there still remained noble folk who clung to the spider's web muslin of the old times so her hands twirled faster more deftly the rest was with god aftaba khanum on the contrary had decided for the world not as lateefa had done for the world as it was in these latter days but for the world as it ought to be as it used to be she had a very different strain in her from those other two from khulasa in her spirituality lateefa in her emotionality aftaba even when things were at their worst smiled consoling herself and the roof generally with some unexpected and perhaps extravagant scrap of amusement a mouthful of pillau concocted out of nothing to season a dry bread dinner a ridiculous toy made out of rubbish whereat all laughed courtier born she loved even the old etiquettes by instinct while her keen wit could find a clue of an intrigue as deftly as her fingers could disentangle khulasa's cobwebs and of all three she kept in closer touch with a world with which she had not quarrelled despite its injustice towards her there was indeed a certain uncle chiragh who still came to see her and her only once or twice a year a blue beard dodderer with a twinkling eye and a still mellow voice who sometimes brought quails with him and spices so that aftaba might regale him with one of her best curries for she was a great cook so the spur of jewuni's retailed insult came as a challenge to aftaba's sense of propriety the world might be diseased by novelty but the foundations were sure she had been a fool all these years to acquiesce in impersonal petitions with purposeless stamps to them instead of some graceful tribute after the older approved method true she had once broached the subject to jewuni she had even gone so far as to bring out a certain faded brocaded bag which was her greatest treasure and produce therefrom a medal or two a dozen or more worn letters quaint old world informations to the reader that the bearer futteh or iman or hassan was such and such a worthy person a gold spangled record of thanks for service in the mutiny the intimation of one rissildar tez khan's death in action which latter had indeed been the cause of aftaba's loneliness even curious survival of friendly days gone never to return a few english words in sprawling irresponsible boyish handwriting to say that the self same tez khan knew the whereabouts of every living creature fit to shoot in the whole countryside but jewuni had scorned the suggestion of sending these to the bigwig with say a basket of aftaba's famous pumpkin preserve since alas oranges stuffed with rupees were out of the question indeed she had said succinctly keep them till the day of judgment the lord may look at them the law will not for see they are not even stamped and without stamps is no justice possible even then old aftaba had felt with dim obstinacy that it was not law or justice she sought it was favour favour such as the great had to give in a well ordered world and so she in her turn came back to the limitations of her life with a decision uncle chiragh had told her but a week or two before as luck would have it that the whole town was to be in an uproar the very next day over the unveiling of a statue of malika victoria the anniversary of a great day in the heroic annals of the defence of the residency for which by the way that gold spangled gratitude had been given had been chosen as fitting for the ceremonial the grounds were to be lit up fireworks let off and special messages sent to and from the queen herself while the statue would be covered with offerings could anything be more opportune for the decorous presentation of a retaining fee so next day while lateefa khanum stitched repenting not at all yet still with a flutter of her heart and khulasa khanum with an odd flutter at her heart also which kept the colour even from her lips worked and prayed aftaba used the privacy of a tiny kitchen for the preparation of other things than a scanty dinner of herbs it meant the loss of her only silver bangle sold on the sly through the market woman who came every morning it was quite the most valuable thing in the house yet there was but a farthing or two left by the time the pumpkin preserve covered with silver leaf lay in a tinselled rush basket with the precious brocaded bag on the top and the market woman bribed to return for it in the afternoon had received a generous douceur which would surely ensure its due delivery all this took time and was tiring to boot so it was nigh sunset when after a sleep which had taken her almost unawares in the little cook room aftaba came out again to the limited life on the roof as she did so the familiar tentative cough of shamira the bhisti on his rounds accompanied by the squelching of his water skin made her step back into the screening wall bismillah she said wondering not to hear the familiar greeting but old shamira was staring helplessly at something he had never seen before it was old khulasa khanum she must be dead he said simply to aftaba's horrified disbelief see she sits with face unveiled and she was dead her retaining fee had brought justice swiftly and lateefa aftaba when she realised the emptiness of the roof save for herself and the dead woman wondered if it was the sight of one who belonged to it slipping downstairs from its virtue that by its terrible confirmation of wantonness had sent khulasa to seek to a higher tribunal as for herself that night when the waiters had gone promising to return at dawn and she was left really alone for the first time she sat wondering what fate her preserved pumpkins would bring and then she did something she had never done in all her life before she too used the hole left by the displaced brick to gain a glimpse of the world which was doing honour to dead heroes and to the queen for whom they died as she did so the first rockets rose from the unseen residency to commemorate its brave defenders and set their stars of glory in high heaven up and up valiantly higher and higher full of the best intentions they went typical so far of the hands that sent them on their mission and then then old aftaba stepped down from her vain vantage and creeping back to where khulasa lay waiting the dawn put her head down beside hers and wept for the stars had fallen but the dead woman's retaining fee had reached the mercy seat his chance he sate biting his nails viciously it was not a habit of his but at the moment the tangle of his nineteen years of life had been too much for him and he sate before it helpless yet resentful he was trying to write a letter to his mother his widowed mother far away over the black water in england to tell her that he had been placed under arrest for cowardice since that was what it came to in the end and yet not to hurt her not to blame her whom every bit of his being blamed why had she brought him up a nincompoop why had she been so afraid of him poor little mother whose nerves had been shattered once and for all by her hero husband's death ere her child was born yet that father had been brave to recklessness the boy's head went down on his arm something like a sob quivered through the hot air for it was hot though the sun was but an hour old in the little grass thatched bungalow which boasted of but one room two verandahs and two corresponding slips of dark enclosed space one a bathroom the other full of saddles corn empty boxes briefly the factotum's go down the whole house being nothing but a square mushroom set down causelessly in a dusty plain and guarded by two whitewashed gate pillars one of which bore the legend on a black board ensign hector clive st pioneers a good name hector clive and yet the boy's head was down on his arm why had he been such a cursed fool a brain fever bird was hard at work in a far off sirus tree he could see it in his mind's eye green with its red head held high among the powder puff flowers as it gave its incessant cry with the regularity of a coppersmith's hammer for though he had been but one year in the country he knew all its birds and beasts and flowers aye and had a good smattering of its lingo also it was that partly which had made him what was it afraid or or cautious his brain was in such a whirl he could not tell which and he had no one to whom he could talk not a friend in the whole regiment for he was shy that was why he was living alone in this cursed shanty where the centipedes and snakes too sometimes but he was not afraid of them or of any animal thank heaven fell from the cloth ceiling and the sparrows poor devils after all they were only making their nests dropped straws over one's letters that one had made a blot like a tear mark or was it indeed he cursed again under his breath and a rigid obstinacy came to his face like his name it was a good enough face though curiously young even for his young age the great height of his forehead it is true took away from its breadth and the short sighted blink of the eyes set so close upon the high narrow nose prevented their piercing clearness from being seen on the lower part of his face hair had scarcely begun to show itself all was callow immature yet the square chin showed stiff and strong enough there should at least be no suspicion of tear marks so he took a fresh sheet and then the thought struck him he would write two letters one to the dear little mother who had devoted herself to him him only ever since he was born the other to the woman who had spoiled him and his life whose timidity had accentuated his birth legacy of fear it would do him good to have it out with himself and with fate not with her no never with her so this was what he wrote and left lying on the table when an orderly came to summon him to the colonel dear mother it has come at last i always knew it must come if you would make a soldier of me just because my father was one why didn't you think why didn't you know poor mother i'm sorry to write all this how could you dream i have felt more or less of a coward all my life when he was so brave and then you made me worse you know you did i wasn't allowed to risk things like the other boys did because i was your only one ah i don't blame you but it was rough on me i should have made an excellent parson i expect and yet i'll be damned this isn't really for your eyes mother darling if i can see what good i should have done if i had ordered that sepoy under arrest the men wouldn't have obeyed orders i saw murder in their eyes i've seen it for a long time and i haven't dared to say so haven't dared to warn those who should be warned for fear of being thought a coward isn't that cowardice in itself oh mother mother well it was very simple a sepoy was cheeky over these greased cartridges actually threatened to shoot me if i ordered him under arrest and i you see i know a lot of their lingo and i understand i was afraid to do what i ought to have done chanced it of course it doesn't read as bare as that in the adjutant's report but i am under arrest not that it matters it must have come sooner or later for i'm a coward that is what i am a coward the words still wet stared up into the baggy cloth ceiling and the sparrows dropped straws over them while ensign hector clive was being interviewed by his colonel he sate stolid acquiescing in every word of blame and yet he was obstinate i don't see sir what good it would have done he began drearily when the colonel stopped him with a high hand now i won't have a word of that sort mr clive he said severely there is enough of that silly talk amongst civilians and i won't have it amongst the officers of my regiment it is as good a regiment as any in india and i'll stake here feeling some lack of dignity in what he was about to say he stood up and the lad standing up also overtopped his senior by many inches something suggestive in his still lanky length seemed to strike the colonel i'll tell you what it is clive you live too much alone you're altogether too too why i don't believe you even had a cup of tea before you started there i was sure of it absolute suicide how can you expect in this climate and with a colonel's wigging before you really too foolish my wife shall give you one now she's in the verandah with the boy and and of course i can't promise but you you shall have your chance if if possible the lad for he was but that murmured something unintelligible perhaps to his dejected mind another chance seemed to be but another opportunity of disgracing himself how very shy he is thought the tall slim woman who gave a cup of tea into his reluctant hand and sent sonnie round to him with the toast and butter i must get you to give my small son a lesson mr clive she said smiling trying to make conversation he was telling me all sorts of dreadful things he has heard so he says from budlu his bearer and that he was frightened and i told him a soldier's son never could be frightened at anything isn't that true ensign hector clive turned deadly pale the child standing with the plate of toast and butter looked up at him confidently as children look always where they feel there is sympathy but you are flightened aren't you he asked there was an instant's silence then the answer came desperately true yes i am but then i'm a coward that's what i am a coward you might have heard a pin drop in the pause then something in the wise gentle face of the colonel's wife broke down the barriers ah you don't know he began and so with a rush it all came out the colonel's wife sate quite still she was accustomed to confidences and even when they did not come voluntarily she had the art of beguiling them the art also of comforting the confider and so when the lad's face had gone into his hands with his last words as he sate his elbows on his knees the picture of dejection she just rose gently and came over with soft step to where he was and she laid a soft hand on either of his lank long fingered ones and pulled them apart so standing smiled down upon him brilliantly confidently i don't believe it she said i don't believe a word of it you'll be brave oh so brave when your chance comes now my dear dear boy she looked at him as if he had been her son go away and forget all this nonsense and see come back at dinner time and tell me before dinner that you've obeyed orders and haven't even thought about it she stood and waved her hand at him as he rode away in the blare of sunlight her voice echoing through the hot dry air reached him faintly as he turned out of her garden into the dust of the world beyond till dinner time remember remember the memory of those words came back to her idly as she sate clasping her baby to her breast while sonnie wearied out with fear slept in her lap and her one disengaged hand busied itself in fanning a half delirious man who lay on a string bed set in the close darkness dinner time yes it must be about dinner time for through a chink in the door you could see the sun flaring to his death in the west what had happened she shuddered as she thought of it what had come first of all the horrors of that long hot may day she could not piece it together all that she knew was that someone had taken pity on the women and the children and that they were all huddled together in that one room waiting till darkness should give a chance of escape for the hut was built against an old ruin through which some underground passage gave upon ground not quite so sentry warded as the barrack square in front she could hear the familiar words of command the clank of arms as they changed guard and she shuddered again aye the women and children might be safe even if the almost hopeless stratagem failed but what of the man her husband the only one so far as she knew of all the officers of the regiment who had escaped the massacre on the parade ground how had he been saved she scarcely knew she remembered his running back like a hare yes he the bravest of men all bleeding and fainting to gasp some words of almost hopeless directions for her safety and then old iman khan yes it had been he faithful old servant why had she not remembered before for there he was his bald head bereft of its concealing turban keeping watch and ward at the door what a ruffian he looked so poor faithful iman khan hush a voice from outside a reply from the bald headed watcher within more questions more replies both growing in urgency in appeal then a pause and retreating footsteps what is it iman khan she questioned dully as the old man stole over to her and laid his forehead in the dust what this slave has feared has waited for all the hours he whispered whimperingly they know huzoor he pointed to the bed or at least they have suspicion that a man is here and they must search they will search or kill i have sent them to await the huzoor's decision she stood up still clasping her babe the boy slipping half asleep to the ground and looked round at those other women those other children who had lost their all and hers lay here they must come she said in a muffled voice then she bent over her husband will she whispered bringing him back from confused half restful dreams the sepoys say they must search or or kill them all we will hide you if we can if we can was it possible she wondered feeling dead dead at heart as the door opened wide letting in the sunlight and showing a group of tense womanhood a bed whereon huddled up asleep or awake lay the children deftly disposed to hide all betraying contours huzoor salaam said the tall subahdar drawing himself up to attention and the search party of four followed suit how long that minute seemed how interminable the sunlight ah would no one shut out the light and why did sonnie move his hand huzoor salaam oh god in heaven were they going was the door closing was the blessed darkness coming it was utter darkness as her strength giving way she fell on her knees beside the bed burying her face upon her children her husband will will she whispered a faint sigh came from the watching women so fate had been kind to her her only one who had seen her husband shot down before her very eyes rose slowly and taking her baby from the bed moved away rocking it in her arms almost fiercely so in the grim intensity of those first seconds the sound of further parley at the door escaped them then in the ensuing pause old iman khan's bald head was in the dust once more his voice scarce audible seemed to fill the room huzoor they have seen he must go forth or they will kill all the words half heard seemed to rouse the wounded man to his manhood he raised himself in bed he staggered to his feet so stood swaying unsteady yet still a man all right i'll go let me out quick quick but someone stood between him and the door it was ensign hector clive his face was pale as death his hands twitched nervously but in the semi darkness his eyes blazed his chin looked square and set no sir he said quietly this is my chance look here i ran and hid in the passage way when the others died like men i couldn't help it perhaps if they had had the chance i had but that's nothing nothing i heard i understand their lingo they don't know you're here sir only a man let me be a man for once it is my chance his eyes sought the colonel's wife in bitter appeal swift as thought she answered it her hand was on her husband's shoulder to hold him back for she saw in a flash what others might not see a martyrdom of life soul warring with frail flesh for this boy let him go will she whispered hoarsely as he says it is his chance there was a faint stir amongst the listeners the colonel shook himself free from his wife's detaining hand the code of conventional honour was his in all its maddening lack of comprehension stand back please and you mr clive obey orders i i he reeled and would have fallen but for the bed against which he sank his wife was on her knees beside him let him go will it is his chance give it him for god's sake there was no answer unconsciousness had come to bring the silence which gives consent and she stood up again stepped to the lad and laid her lips on his forehead thank you dear in the name of all these thanks for a brave deed the blood surged up to his face a boyish look of sheer triumph transfigured it as he paused for an instant to throw off his coat and tighten his waistband i shall have my chance too he cried exultantly for i was always a good runner at school aye a good runner indeed with the wild whoop of a schoolboy at play he was across the barrack square untouched once over that low wall in front and he would be in cover he rose to the leap lightly and for an instant he showed in all the pathetic beauty of immature strength all the promise of what might lie hidden in the future against the red flare of the sunlit sky against the glorious farewell which is true herald of the rising of another day then he threw his arms skywards and fell shot through the heart he had had his chance the flatterer for gain prem lal census enumerator raised to that fleeting dignity by reason of his being a middle fail student as those who have at least gone up for the middle school examination style themselves in india paused in his ineffectual attempt to write with a fine steel nib on the fluttering blue paper held without any backing in his left hand and all unconsciously gave the offending pen that sidelong blot scattering flick which the native reed requires when it will not drive properly then he coughed a deprecating cough and covered the previous act natural enough in one whose ancestors being of the clerkly caste had spent long centuries in acquiring and transmitting it by displaying his western culture in another way now for the next 'adult' or 'adulteress' in this house he said pompously in polyglot the grammatical correctness of his genders passed unchallenged by his half curious half awe stricken audience the blue paper ruled scheduled classified contained an unknown world to that patriarchal party assembled in the sleepy sunshine which streamed down on the roof set far above the city far above western civilisation under the sleepy sunshiny sky so it might well hold stranger things to its environment than untrustworthy feminines there is the grandfather's father chiragh shah huzoor replied a man of about thirty who standing midway between the real householder and his grandsons had assumed the responsibility of spokesmanship in virtue of his possibly combining old wisdom and new culture he used the honorific title huzoor not to prem lal whom he gauged scornfully to be a mere schoolboy and a hindoo idolator to boot but to the blue paper which represented the alien rulers who were numbering the people for reasons best known to themselves a stir came from the door chink behind which the females of the family were decorously hiding their indignant anxiety yea let the old man go forth shrilled a voice to which none in that household ever said nay he is past his time let them take his brains if they will and leave virtuous women alone who are we to be registered as common evil walkers even prem lal grew humble instantly nay mother he said apologetically in unconscious oblivion of his own previous classification the sirkar suggests no impropriety we seek but to know such trivials as age sex if idiot cripple spinster adult or adult let chiragh shah go forth to him interrupted the hidden oracle with opportune decision lo his midday opium is still in his brain let it bring peace to him and the eater thereof the chink widened obediently disclosing a fluttering and scattering of dim draperies so roused evidently from a doze in the inner darkness a very old man shuffled out into the sunshine then stopped blinking at it as if verily he found himself in some new and unfamiliar world the sirkar hath sent for thee grandad bawled the appointed spokesman in his ear they need but the words were enough the blank dazed look passed into a sudden alacrity which took years from the old body as it sat it a trembling with eagerness the sirkar he echoed it is long since i chiragh shah long since he relapsed as suddenly into dreams his voice failed as if following the suit of memory but he supplied the lack of both by a smile which spoke volumes for it was the smile of a sycophant as unblushingly false as the teeth which it displayed teeth which were square dicelike blocks of ivory unvarying in size strung together en a bold gold wire and hung heaven knows how to his toothless gums sit down meean jee said the census enumerator politely for the heart whole artificiality of the smile admitted of no breach of manners we seek but honourable names and ages so they brought the old man a quaint red lacquered stool which had once carried a certain dignity in its spindled back rail by reason of its having come into the family with some far dead and gone bride chiragh shah's own mayhap and there he sate still with that look of urbane smiling alacrity rejuvenating his wrinkled face there was a hint beneath the semi transparency of his frayed white muslin robe cut in a bygone fashion of very worn very old brocade fitting closely to the very thin very old body and the embroidered cap set back from his high narrow forehead showed a glint here and there of frayed old worn gold thread his name is chiragh shah yawned the spokesman adding in a bawl how old art thou dada the sirkar is asking there was a little pause and wintry though the sun was its shine seemed to filter straight through all things denying a visible shadow even to the blue paper how old came the urbane voice speaking with a long lapsed precision of polish that is as god wills and my lord chooses prem lal glanced doubtfully at the schedules they did not provide for such politeness so he appealed mutely to the spokesman who replied by roundabout assertion he was of knowledgeable years when the city fell wast thou not dada the explanatory shout brought keen intelligence to the hearer aye it was from the palace bastion i watched the english half the city watched them that th of september here once more voice and memory lapsed awhile but prem lal's history was at least equal to the more recent event of that memorable date so his pen grew glib in ciphering taking knowledgeable age as ten he commenced rapidly with deduction of years from present epoch his face darkened he has the appearance of more age than thirty five he began dubiously when the suave old voice picked up the lost thread of recollection lake sahib came to our court two days after and the king being blind saw not that the english face was no more merciful than the french face which had been driven away so there were rejoicings he means the day which began the hundred years of tyranny suggested the spokesman and prem lal's pen had already substituted for when the voice of her who had to be obeyed came sternly from the chink put him down as a hundred boy it said scornfully meat is tough when the sacrifice is past its prime anyhow so what does it matter the next question presented no difficulty no one in that house could be aught but a descendant of the prophet so the answer syyed sprang to every lip with chill almost scornful pride profession or trade continued prem lal mechanically gold thread embroiderer i suppose like the rest of you it was a natural supposition seeing that the high bred in bred household had for years past since in fact courts were abolished in delhi taken to this the trade of so many ousted officials huzoor no replied the spokesman with a yawn for the proceedings were becoming uninteresting to him he is before that he does nothing he never did anything gentleman at large hesitated on prem lal's pen there an ephemeral conscientiousness born of his ephemeral dignity made him appeal to the old man himself chiragh shah smiled courteously his hands trembled themselves tip to tip my profession he echoed surely i am chaplaoo of inheritance and choice he added alertly chaplaoo that was clear enough to prem lal in the vernacular but how was it to be translated for the blue paper which must be written in english as an exposition of learning that might lead to further employment being prepared for such emergencies by a pocket dictionary he looked the word up a proceeding which revived interest in the audience notably behind the chink whence the magisterial voice was heard remarking that it was no wonder the sirkar wanted brains if it was so crassly ignorant as not to know what chaplaoo meant this flurried prem lal into premature decision chaplaoo he quoted under his breath a fawner ha i see one who keepers the fawn forester huntsman am i not right he translated with a preparative flick of the steel pen the even ivory smile was clouded by an expression too blank for resentment the sirkar mistakes this slave kept no animals prem lal dived hurriedly into further equivalents parasite backbiter one who bites backs ah i see bug etc this slave as he has said kept no kind of animals whatever repeated chiragh shah with a suave unconscious dignity which appeased even the rising storm of virtuous indignation behind the chink he was if the sirkar prefers the title chapar qunatya by inheritance and choice the rolling arabic word had a soothing sound and a hush fell with the sunshine even on prem lal's search after a common factor between east and west toad eater eater of toads he began with doubt in the suggestion lick spittle one who licks the spittle eater of toads licker of spittle shrilled the voice of the chink dost come here defiling an honourable house and i who purvey its food with such vile calumny i peace mother soothed a softer voice such things do no harm save to the speaker what you spit at the sky falls on your own face aye assented a ruder voice and is he not a kyasth clerk lie he must or his belly will burst the word lie gave the agitated enumerator a fresh clue and the pages of the dictionary fluttered as if in a full gale lie liar slanderer there was no connection in his tone but the suggestion being at least plausible to his audience the question was referred loudly to old chiragh shah who was beginning to nod with combined sunshine and opium drams lie he asked with a return of that swift alacrity surely i lied always yea from the beginning to the end he used the high sounding arabic word for liar and so sent prem lal a fluttering once more ere he had lit on the correct gutteral old chiragh shah's set smile had changed into a real one the slack muscles of his neck stiffened he flung out his right hand airily hush said the two smallest boys on the roof in sudden interest dada is going to talk he was lies he began and there was tone in the old voice and wherefore not if it is a real lie and not a bungle but i never was a bungler i know my profession too well even at the last yea at the very end they had to come to me for artifice for subterfuge it was the last lie to count as a real lie he paused one of the boys had crept round to him and now laid a compelling hand of entreaty on the old man tell us of it dada the spokesman looked at the enumerator as if for orders it may elucidate the meanings muttered the middle fail to himself so in the stillness of that sunshiny roof set so far above the workaday world they sate listening yea it was the last lie that was worth the telling yet i was past my prime like the court itself for none save those who saw knew the heart burnings the bitterness of those last years king but in name the very court officials drifting away to other allegiance and lake sahib had been so full of promise on that first september day when the frenchman was driven away because forsooth he had made the blind shah alum a prisoner in his own palace there was a pause in the thin old cadences and a flitting shadow fell on the sun saturate listeners from a wheeling kite overhead and what was bahadur shah but a prisoner too what matter the huzoors gave him bread after their fashion and he was unfaithful to the salt of it that was not well one must be loyal even to a lie so after the mad midsummer dream of recovered kingship in the palace such a mad dream we who dreamed it knew at the time that we were dreaming came that second september day when the english returned to delhi we did not watch them then we were hiding in the tombs humayon's tomb without the wall it was the night after hudson sahib bahadur had wiled away the king by fair promises aya the huzoor knew the trick of those well but the princes were still hiding and many a better man too my son for one he was wounded to the death ah i knew it though the brave lad he was the son of mine old age steadied his breath and smiled when i spoke to him but there was little leisure for words with treachery to right and treachery to left and none to trust fairly for the world had changed even then and there were but one or two of my kind left and i was out of favour too old for the new court too old for new pleasures and the young prince lo how he used to laugh at my worn flatteries had many pleasures so many of them that he took some of them from other folks' lives thus he had foes aye but friends too for he came nearer to kingliness than his brothers and my son loved him so when the danger came and i knew by chance of the plot to kill the prince as he slept and gain the reward set on him by the english i had no choice yet i dare trust no one in the skulking crowd which crept about the shadows of the old tomb in those days it was every one for himself and the prince had scant following at best and he lay drunk with wine and women out of bravado partly to the skulkers in one of the half secret upper rooms but i knew which and i remember it so well the grey spear point of the distant kut showed through its open arch and below in a far nook of the crypt where there was a secret swinging panel in the red sandstone wall known only to the old my son lay dying he steadied his breath as i stooped over him and whispered that he would soon be fighting for his prince again 'soon my son' i answered waiting as he smiled for i knew the silence was at hand silence from all things save the breathing that would only steady into death we my servant and i lifted him easily he was but a lad though he would have grown to greater stature than the prince his head lay so contentedly on my shoulder as i went backward up the stair telling those who stood aside to let us pass that he was better and craved the fresher air of the roof 'better aye he is better or soon will be old fool' said one with a laugh then clattered noisily after his companions so noisily that the echo of the winding staircase sent their scornful mirth back to me 'he will be dead like someone he followed by morning' before morning if i did not fail thought i silently as searching the shadows we sought the prince's hidden room there was a youth ever with the prince a baby faced frightened womanly thing yet faithful as far as in him lay him i caught by the throat 'they would kill thee too' i said 'better take the chance of life if fate be kind ere dawn discovers the deceit he will be fit to fly' so after my servant and i wailing at our lack of wisdom had carried the prince down face covered as one to whom worse sickness had come suddenly i crept to the upper room again it was growing late but the grey spear head of the kut still showed beyond the open arch as i covered the lad's face lest for all his gay dress the murderers might see too much 'dream thou art fighting for the prince sonling' i said knowing he was past even the steadying of his breath for an answer but the smile had lingered on his face then i covered my face also and bidding the baby faced one escape to the crypt as soon as it was possible sate as a servant might have sate at the turning of the ways from the stair head would those who were to come be familiar or strange i wondered the latter most likely since chiragh shah the chaplaoo had long since passed from court life almost from remembrance they were strange as they challenged me i drew the cloth from my face without fear 'the prince's room' they cried dagger point at my breast but that could not be there must be no suspicion only certainty only soothed certainty 'i have been waiting to show it to my lords' i answered 'lo he sleeps sound yea he sleeps sound his face toward the kut' so with smooth words i led them in the dark the memory of the darkness seemed to fall as darkness itself on the old brain and chiragh shah sate silent in the sunshine for a few seconds when he spoke again it was as if years had passed it was the last lie that was worth the telling he said almost triumphantly and a good lie too came the shrill voice from behind the door chink see you boy call the old man by his right name in your paper or may god's curse light on you for ever thus adjured prem lal who throughout the whole tale had been fluttering his dictionary from one synonym to another suggested sycophant that was he explained one who flatters and lies for personal profit profit echoed the voice small profit dada gained was not the prince killed with his brothers next day by hudson sahib so there was no one left even to reward the old man save god suggested prem lal piously trying to escape somehow from the dilemma and there is gain and gain admitted the spokesman combining new and old east and west hush said one of the two small boys again dada is going to talk he may know so once more the old voice rose in unconscious apology for the difficulty of condensing what etomologists call his life history into a census paper yea it was good and hard yet not so hard as the first that never left me despite the long years it seemed indeed as if it had not for something of childlike complaint came into the old voice it was my first day at court mother had cut my father's khim khab robe crimson with gold flowering to fit me despite her tears her eyes were heavy with them when she kissed me but i had no fear for all i was so young i knew the women's bread depended on my tongue though it was my heritage also to be chaplaoo and the king was pleased mother had tied my turban so tall and he laughed at that it was out in the garden he under the gilt canopy the nobles round and beyond the flowers and birds fluttering among the roses and i was standing beside the king and he was laughing for i knew my part then the fluttering came closer closer and lo a bird settled on my wrist it was gul afrog i had left it with my sister but it had followed me for we loved each other so on my wrist it sate joyful and salaamed as i had taught it drooping its pretty wings then the king cried 'how now whose pretty bird is this' and someone laid a warning hand upon my shoulder but i knew before what i must say if i was to stand in father's place i knew i knew 'it is yours my king' so i said kneeling at his feet 'it is yours it is yours' and gul afrog had been with me since it fell out of the bulbul nest in the rose tree then they brought a golden cage the old man sate staring out into the sunshine in silence and only the littlest of the two boys wept softly we will call him 'flatterer for gain' said prem lal in desperate decision and perhaps the description came as near to old chiragh shah's profession as was possible in a census schedule a maiden's prayer that is over thanks to kali ma sighed ramabhai fanning herself vigorously as the last man shambled a trifle sheepishly from the inner apartment she was a stoutish bengali lady with red betel stained lips and smooth bandeaux of shiny black hair good looking good natured at the moment distinctly excited as she went on garrulously muniya down with the curtain there is no further use for it now that crew has gone and to think that the master will have to give each one of them five rupees and for what forsooth for the first seeing of such a bride as not one of them ever saw before lo shibi marriage monger here she turned accusingly on one of the women who were busy unveiling themselves chattering the while with shrill voices hast no mind at all thou mightst have found newer words for thy description of my daughter 'beautiful as a full moon symmetrical as a cart wheel graceful as a young goose' what are these for perfection and thou didst use the same last week for luchi devi's girl who is pock marked and blind of an eye but there 'what's a fowl to one who has swallowed a sheep' parbutti here she transferred her attentions to a young girl who was seated on a cushion resting her face in her henna dyed hands as if she felt dazed or tired an thou hast a grain of sense have a care of that nose ring thy paternal auntie lent for the occasion or there will be flies in the pease porridge there always is in that family yea it is well over and thank the gods the priest found good omen in the morning watches so i have not to dine the creatures fish curry and kid pillau is too much to pile on the getting of a trousseau yet one must have meats at a wedding feast if one in sakta and the bridegroom's folk are strict as for clothes i tell you sisters that 'boycotts' is well enough to play with every day but when it comes to weddings and tinsel 'tis a different matter kali ma what a price for kulabatoon parbutti an thou canst not remember that thou hast on thee four hundred rupees worth of benares khim kob go put on the old manchester thank heaven' boycotts' is not so old yet but one has stores left to come and go upon yea yea a wedding is a great strain on a mother and then there is the parting with my daughter too my sweeting my little lump of delight here ramabhai discreetly dissolved into regulation tears mingled with sharp sobs and little outcries it came easily for she was really devoted to parbutti the little bride who in truth looked distractingly pretty all swathed in scarlet gold flowered silk gauze and hung with jewels galore her grave open eyed face looked perhaps a trifle stupid and obstinate but there could be no question of its beauty mother she said seriously there is a smell of smoke the tall one in the black coat smelt of it and it is defilement had we not better pacify the gods hark to her exclaimed ramabhai drying her facile tears triumphantly saw you ever such a saint he who gets my parbutti is certain of salvation parbutti sate silent she did not even blush though that is allowed to a bengali bride but for all her outward calm she was inwardly quivering all over and small wonder if she was after long years spent not like an english girl in ignorance and innocence of matrimony but in matter of fact expectation of it that one great event in woman's life was close at hand it had been delayed almost beyond propriety by the difficulty of finding a high caste husband for her father though a kulin brahman was sufficiently westernised not to hold with the caste habit of marrying a daughter to what may be called a professional husband that is to a kulin who already possesses a score or two of wives a suitable student had however been found at last and the feminine portion of the household had plunged hysterically into all the suggestive ceremonials of a high class bengali marriage even the widows let their blighted fancies dwell on kisses and blisses so feeling vicariously the sensuous pleasures of bridedom vied with happier women in drugging the girl with sweets and scents and secret whisperings of secret delights the whole atmosphere was enervating depraving but parbutti took all the gigglings and titterings gravely as her right for this was the consummation of her hopes ever since as a child of five she had been taught to worship the gods to pray for an amorous husband and curse any woman who might try to win love from her look how the little marionette scowls over it the women had tittered as they watched her a bit of a naked baby going through the formula of the brata as it is called truly no co wife will dare to enter her house and certainly her energy was prodigious mata mata ma keep my co wife far shiv shiv shiv grant she may not live pot pot pot boil her hard and hot broom broom broom sweep her from the room mud mud mud moist thee with her blood bell bell bell ring her soul to hell and so on through every common and uncommon object on god's earth and beneath it the childish body had swayed to the rhythm of the chant the childish voice had risen clear in denunciation the childish soul had given its consent to every wish for parbutti was nothing if not serious the very cantrips of the sakta cult to which her parents and some fifty millions of other bengalis belonged were to her so many indispensable realities she as an unmarried girl ate her plateful of sacrificial meat contentedly though her mother refused it she sate wide eyed solemn acquiescent when after long fasting the whole family waited in the dead of the night till the auspicious moment for sacrifice arrived and in the silence the only sound was an occasional piteous half wondering bleat of the miserable victim a pet goat mayhap she did not wink an eye when the consecrated scimitar curved downwards a jet of red red bubbling blood spurted into the dim light and a sort of sob from the dying and the living alike told that atonement was made that sort of thing did not make her or any of the other women quiver yet they were affectionate emotional kind hearted without shedding of blood is no remission of sin is a pauline text but it was theirs also graven by age long iteration in their limited minds and lives was the dogma that the blood is the life thereof there was but one sacrament the sacrament of blood marriage was secondary but cognate to it of course that was because it was the gate to birth and death through which none pass without the great sacrifice so they clothed the bride in scarlet and smeared her forehead with vermilion it was this stability of inner thought which enabled the women to be so untiring in their variants of its outward application all the bathings and anointings and soothsayings had this unchangeable dogma as foundation so the round of ritual went on the drums throbbed in unending rhythm the conches blared in deafening yells the whole house was full of the rustlings and bustlings of womenfolk it must surely have been a wedding which made babu kishub chander sen write the ponderous dictum man is a noun in the objective case governed by the active verb woman parbutti's father being a sensible man removed himself as much as possible from the ebullient atmosphere perhaps it was as well since he was a light in the nationalist party and the ceremonials of a sakta wedding do not go well with talk of political rights and wrongs of education and equality and exotic tyranny even parbutti's solemnity was not quite proof against the silly suggestiveness the almost indecent jokes and tricks the hysterical enhancing of emotions with which she was surrounded she felt it a relief when the guests having retired for some sleep she was free to perform her daily devotion at the shrine downstairs it was a quaint place this shrine dedicated to mai kali in her terrific form in other words to our lady of pain the woman ever in travail of mind and body the ewig weiblichkeit which is never satisfied it formed on the river side of the house a sort of low basement private in so far that a flight of steep stone steps led down to it from the lowest storey of the house public in that it opened on to some bathing steps but few people came thither except on certain festivals so parbutti still in her wedding finery stole down to it confidently she liked the small dim arched chamber where you could only see mai kali as a blotch of crimson in her dark niche and as you crept down the stairs behind that niche and looked through the crisscross iron bars that filled up the arch she showed nothing but a black shadow against the brilliance beyond parbutti used often to stand for an instant or two on the cornerwise landing of the stairs to look before passing up everything showed black but the low square of the outside doorway and even the pigeons when they flew across it seemed flitting shadows on the light to day she was in a hurry so she squatted down promptly at a respectful distance from the image and began to smear the floor from a goglet of red paint she had brought with her and as she did so she chanted om om kali ma ruler thou of blackest night dark dark not a star in thy heaven kali ma thou who lovest the flesh of man by this blood i pray thee ban aliens in hindustan kill them kali ma drink their blood and eat their flesh thou shalt have it fresh and fresh lo devour it lick thy lips flesh in lumps and blood in sips stain thyself with sacred red make them lifeless dead dead dead blessed kali ma ho o m 'phut the last two words were spoken with relish not only because they were supposed to be the most potent part of the charm but because they lent themselves to dramatic effect ho om being given soft and low phut explosively the result being suggestive of an angry tom cat but the rest of the doggerel came slackly for parbutti was not much interested in it it was not her curse at all but one she had promised her schoolboy brother govinda to say every evening for many reasons chiefly it is to be feared because someone else at present nameless was a class fellow of the said govinda's but everyone knew that if there was one compelling prayer on earth it was that of a maiden bride even mai kali could not resist it and the petition was a fair one who wanted aliens in hindustani not she why their presence made your menkind do unspeakable things so that life became wearisome with pacifying the gods imagine not being able to kiss voices close at hand made her leap to her feet and gain the staircase like a frightened hare then of course being a girl she paused to peep through the grating surely it was govinda then she need not have run away no he had a tall lad with him parbutti's heart beat to suffocation was it possible could it be was it well what she had been taught to consider her prayer her pilgrimage her paradise that is her duty and her pleasure combined stay there was another lad short and yet another middle sized this was disconcerting but perhaps if she listened a little she might find out so she stood still as a mouse all ears praying in her inmost heart it might be the tall one though they spoke in bengali they used such a plentitude of english words that it was difficult for her to understand fully what they said it was not all their fault as it arose largely from the fact that the ideas they wished to express being purely western had no eastern equivalents parbutti however had been accustomed to this sort of talk as she had been a great favourite of her father's and till the last year or so had often sate on his knee as he entertained his friends so she listened patiently to paeans about liberty equality and fraternity mingled with darkling threats threats which must destroy all three by depriving some brother of the liberty of life or at best of an arm or a leg for they were only silly schoolboys who but for an alien ideal of education would have been learning as their father had learnt unquestioning unqualified obedience at a guru's feet learning it probably with tears tied up in a sack with a revengeful tom cat or with a heavy brick poised on the back of the neck for livelong hours such being the approved punishments for the faintest disobedience small wonder then if the organism accustomed to this immemorial control runs a bit wild when it finds itself absolutely free to do and think as it likes these particular boys were very angry apparently because some one of their number had been forced to obey something or someone it was tyranny the mother land and their religion was outraged they were all bengali brahmans so kali worshippers by birth and of the sakta cult possibly of the left handed or secret form of that cult anyhow they talked big of force being the one ruling principle by which men could rule of the true saktas' or tantriks' contempt for public opinion of their determination to show the world that the tantras had been given by the gods in order to destroy the oppressors of men so jai anarchism jai kali jai bhairavi jai banda materam it was a sad farrago of nonsense western individualism dished up skilfully by professional agitators in a garb of eastern mysticism but they talked it complacently while parbutti still as a mouse told herself it must be the tall one he had such a nice voice her hopes gained confidence when he lingered behind with govinda after the others departed and began speaking in a lower voice could he be talking about her ever and always that came as the uppermost thought then consideration told her this was not possible no respectable bridegroom could talk of his bride to another not even if he also were a kulin and a brother what was it then about which they were so mysterious when there was nobody nigh here a twinge of compunction shot through her at least nobody they could know about at last her ears becoming accustomed to the strain she caught one sentence my father was mai kali's priest here so by degrees gathered that there was some secret receptacle somewhere and that the tall youth wished to hide something the something appeared to be in what parbutti had supposed to be a hooded cage such as students often carry about with their pet avitovats or fighting quails inside but this one contained a square box which the boy removed with great care and then before parbutti had grasped what he was doing he was round at the back of the carven image kneeling with his back towards her and fumbling at the gilt wooden drapery about mai kali's waist govinda meanwhile keeping a look out at the door how close he was if she put out a hand she could touch him she thrilled all over at the thought too close at any rate for her to move besides she must see what happened ye gods the drapery slid up mai kali was hollow if aught happens to me said the nice voice solemnly i leave this in thy charge oh govinda ram kulin thou art the only other living soul who knows of it and see thou use it as it should be used a cocoanut full for a bomb it requires no fuse the concussion is sufficient if the hand is bold the box deposited the panel slid back again and the tall lad rising from his knees stepped to the front again as he did so parbutti caught a glimpse of his face it was beautiful as the young bala krishna and the whole soul and body of her went out to him her hand stole through the bars to touch the air in which he had stood the happy air which had touched him so absorbed was she in her joy that she did not realise what was going on until the sound of their voices brought her back to reality then she recognised that they were repeating the vow of secrecy which is imposed on all initiates to the tantrik cult i swear by the eternal relentless and living power i worship never to divulge the secret but to bury it deeply in silence and ever preserve it inviolate and inviolable i will conceal it as the water in a cocoanut is concealed i will be a kaula internally a saiva externally and a vaishnava when talking at public meetings then they branched off into that of the new secret political society which underlies the old religious mysteries and parbutti listened with growing fear for this was sheer straightforward cursing of informers and lukewarm supporters and spies and and if they should go on to her if he should curse her the long stillness had told on her nerves she felt as if she must scream must do something to prevent the dreadful sequence going on and on and cursed be they who listen and the voices were checked by a passionate cry curse me not curse me not i swear i parbutti swear to keep faith then terrified at everything even her own temerity she turned and fled there was little leisure allowed her for thought in the women's apartment that night for each one vied with the other in devising cantrips most of them undescribable to secure for her a truly uxorious husband but one thing beat through her brain would he could he if it were he be angry with her surely not she had sworn and she would keep her oath yes she would keep it faithfully so the day dawned and another tumult of rejoicing rose around her in view of the delay in her betrothals it had been arranged to crowd in the ceremonials as closely as possible so as to expedite the actual marriage and everybody was running about conches were blowing women were giggling and laughing as the professional guests of the male sex cracked doubtful jests while they awaited the arrival of the bridegroom and then came a sudden hush something must have happened what was it parbutti sitting apart swathed in her wedding scarlet was too dazed to notice the pause at first until low and whimpering an unmistakable woman's wail rose amid the garlands and tinsels the paper flowers the swinging lanterns she started to her feet was someone dead in a way the news that had come was worse than death that was an act of god to be accepted with what resignation could be mustered but this what they had arrested a bridegroom on his wedding day and govinda too the son of the house what those boys they could not be guilty it was only the tyranny of the hated police they could not be mixed up with anarchists so said some of the men but others held their peace and looked sinister while all the women wept and wailed and called on mai kali to avenge the sacrilege only parbutti sate very still very silent she knew something that the others did not know but the knowledge only increased her blind resentment only aggravated her blind despair he had been filched from her if it was he she was too dulled by disappointment at first to do more than realise her loss and the thought of her oath of fealty did not come to her at all until after three months' needless delay in trying the conspiracy case against some forty students in the college a delay due entirely to the hair splitting efforts of the counsel for the defence govinda settled it for himself by dying in prison of autumnal fever his had never been a good life he had almost died of it the year before he might have died of it at home but the loss of a son even when he is not the only one is a grievous loss to a hindu household and it brought enhanced and almost insensate anger to every member of it except to parbutti who went about her household duties calmly almost stupidly then came the final blow the bridegroom was it he she wondered dully shot himself with a revolver smuggled in to him by a woman a young and pretty woman full of patriotism and poetry a woman brought up on western lines who was almost worshipped by the nationalist party of unrest parbutti heard the tale still calm to outward appearance she heard women's voices full of curiosity tell of the deed of patriotism as it was called she heard them wonder what the woman agitator was really like and say that kali ma would surely ere long rise up in her power and smite the m'llechas hip and thigh and then they looked at her and shook their heads neither maid wife nor widow it would be more difficult than ever to find fresh betrothals for her whereupon ramabhai wept as she had wept before with sharp sobs and little outcries and once more parbutti said nothing though she was quivering all over it would be impossible to define her feelings they were such an admixture of hatred and love of fear and jealousy and despair and through it all came the question was it he while as a background sheer physical disappointment stretched every fibre of her mind and body almost to breaking joint so it went on until one day someone spoke to her almost as if she had been a widow and bade her do something almost menial she did it without a word it was noon time and the house was deserted those who were in it being asleep she sate for a while in the sunshine of the courtyard her hands on her knees doing nothing then suddenly she rose and slipped into the room which ramabhai used as a wardrobe when she emerged from it she was swathed in the scarlet and gold benares khim kob that had cost four hundred rupees and her arms her neck her feet were hung with golden ornaments they tinkled as she made her way down the steep stone stairs to kali's shrine dark and still and small it lay with a faint scent of incense about it for the previous day had been a festival and many folk had been to worship there but kali mai kali would never have better worshipping than parbutti meant to give her how the idea had come to the girl's mind who can say but dimly out of her confused thoughts had grown the conviction that something must be done she was the only one now who knew the secret but it was useless in her hands she could not go out and throw bombs as he doubtless would have thrown them had he lived so giving the great goddess the blood for which she craved yes he had meant to do it for were not the aliens accursed had they not killed him she mixed everything up hopelessly mai kali and the sacrament of blood her own loss and the public good she felt angry and weary and disappointed she felt that she ought to do something that she must get someone stronger than she was on her side to do what she was helpless to do so confused obstinate she stepped behind the image slid back the panel and took out the box then producing a cocoanut shell from the folds of her sare she filled it carefully methodically and put back the box carefully methodically this done she went to the front of the image smeared the floor once more with blood red and began her maiden's prayer the prayer that is infallible om om kali ma dark dark not a star in my heaven kali ma this time her voice was high and hard for had not mai kali to be compelled yea even by the greatest of sacrifices thou shalt have it fresh and fresh blood to drink and lumps of flesh higher and higher grew the voice it did not falter at all not even when at the final hoom phut the girl raising her hand on high dashed the cocoanut she held upon the ground boldly there was a faint flash an instant explosion a grinding noise as the house rocked to its foundation then steadied into quiescence but parbutti had kept her promise to mai kali and to him for the goddess might have satisfied her craving for blood her desire for flesh amid the welter of broken stones and twisted grids of shattered wood carving and torn benares khim kob of jewels rent apart and splintered bones that was all remaining of her shrine her image and her worshipper whether she will keep her part of the bargain is another matter but the maiden's prayer has been said the greatest of sacrifices has been made silver speech and golden silence i silver speech it is not only the interest of india now the most considerable part of the british empire but the credit and honour of the british nation itself will be decided by this division we are to decide by this judgment whether the crimes of individuals are to be turned into public guilt and national ignominy or whether this nation will convert the very offences which have thrown a transient shade upon its government into something that will reflect a permanent lustre upon the honour justice and humanity of the kingdom my lords there is yet another consideration equal to those other two great interests i have stated those of our empire of our national character something that if possible comes more home to the hearts and feelings of every englishman i mean the interests of our constitution itself which is deeply involved in this case in the audience a young man fair of face blue of eye looked up suddenly then muttered under his breath hard cheek what the deuce has he got to do with the british constitution do be quiet tom blushed the girl who sat next him in a whisper they'll hear you tom relapsed into bored silence and the stream of words went on but the crimes we charge against him are not lapses defects errors of common human frailty which as we know and feel we can allow for there are no crimes that have not arisen from passions which it is criminal to harbour no offences that have not their root in avarice rapacity pride insolence ferocity treachery cruelty malignity of temper in short in nothing that does not argue a total extinction of all moral principle that does not manifest an inveterate blackness of heart dyed ingrain with malice vitiated corrupted gangrened to the very core confound his billingsgate murmured tom gordon softly what good does it do anybody h'sh came the warning feminine whisper his accent is really very good tom shifted uneasily and once again the strenuous eager voice struggling bravely against the harshness of the english language was the only sound held in the white walls of the mission school at ilmpur a little punjab town set in a waste of sand the hot sunshine slanted across it in broad golden rays from the upper windows to lay broad yellow squares on the cool whitewash through the doors set open to the air on all sides the same hot yellow sunshine slanted in on the upturned faces of the students all bent with elation in their looks on the prize english speaker who was declaiming his set speech out of burke's famous impeachment of warren hastings declaiming it before as the local paper put it mr commissioner gordon and his good lady mr tom gordon a fine young man worthy of his great father who has lately entered india from eton in quest of police post the beautiful miss gordon and many others of european renown including natives of high official positions who have honoured the reverends freemantle and smith with attendance at their mission school prizegiving they sat in a semicircle on the dais a quaint company mr commissioner gordon with a painstakingly pious expression on his grizzly red bearded face inwardly rehearsing the speech he would have to make in his turn his good lady nervously eyeing the gilt books which she would have to give away spread out on the table before her it was covered with a royal red cloth and on it stood a packed posy of jasmine blossoms and marigolds the odour of the crushed blossoms mingled with the confused scent of cocoanut oil roses and curry powder which is inseparable from every indian assembly on one side of the commissioner sat the reverend freemantle a gentleman with a beard grown white in the service of education mild placid benevolent his face beamed out over his students they were all doing well and gunpat rai was simply excelling himself by showing complete mastery over both vowels and consonants indeed in the whole semicircle of eager teachers and approvers upon the platform there was not to be seen a dissentient expression and one zenana worker positively wept tears of joy because it was through her dreary daily drudgery amongst fetid alleys and sunless back courts that the prize pupil had originally come to the mission school otherwise he might have remained as his father had remained all his life proprietor of an odd little shop right away from all other shops where they sold matches and oil flour and earthenware dishes string and pipe bowls everything in fact which might suddenly be wanted in the big high tenement houses that elbowed and shouldered the little dark lane the law is the security of the people of england it is the security of the people of india gunpat rai's voice overtaxed almost broke over the climax of burke's rhodomontade but the tumultuous undisciplined applause which followed covered the fact and he sat down feeling dazed confused it was the first time he had ever spoken in public and he had found that he had not been afraid that in itself was disturbing he had not felt afraid meanwhile mr commissioner gordon's loud voice was bombarding the wall with fitful explosions of words which reverberated amidst an echo of hesitating stutters gives me great pleasure unalloyed pleasure to er er er to to see indian youth er er er taking their place with with er er er here a glance at his son who after the manner of sons when their fathers are speaking was burying his face in his hands seemed to supply the lacking phrase with the youth of england good heavens groaned tom gordon aside plaintively i say nell how long do you think the guv'nor will be on his legs for i'll slope out and have a smoke s st tom reproved his sister severely you can't and you've got to play in the cricket match you know tom groaned again but less plaintively and so the speechifying went on the burden of all being the incalculable advantage of a good sound english education in every walk of life did they but choose every student present at any rate students of the stamp of gunpat rai might rise to higher things so with a final and formal hand shake to the lad who had so distinguished himself the company trooped out into the sunshine and the mission school lay empty only in the place where gunpat rai had sat ere rising to speak a tiny packet wrapped in silver leaf betrayed its presence by shining like a star it was the talisman which his little fifteen year old wife had given him that morning ere he started with tears and laughter because it was only the first half chewed half sucked piece of dough cake his firstborn had ever had it had dropped from his nerveless hand when in a dire funk he had stood up in answer to the call of his name it did not however shine long for an impudent sparrow soon discovered that it was but dough made silvern and promptly carried it off meanwhile the cricket match was in full swing tom gordon captaining one side and the reverend mr freemantle who still cherished an old blue cap he had worn in his oxford days the other youth however had to be allowed for so the last comer from eton found himself to his great delight at the head of ten smaller boys jolly little chaps with bright eyes and boundless obediences while the big students including gunpat rai who was cock at cricket as in english ranged themselves under their master they won the toss and tom gordon as he suppled his hands with the ball told himself the bowling must be good and good it was especially in style the tall young figure in white flannels close clipped about the lean flanks with the light blue belt reminded one of a flying mercury as it poised in delivery every woman's eye was on it in admiration as for the swift balls it sent they were a revelation to these indian boys who had never seen real cricket they crumpled up before them like agitated spiders when they came off the wicket and when they came on it they looked helplessly at the umpire to see if they were really out the reverend mr freemantle made a good stand the memory of many a past day coming back to give half forgotten skill to his bat his sheer delight in his youthful adversary's prowess making him bold still the score stood ominously at one figure when gunpat rai took his place tom gordon hitched up his belt and looked i should say leg before he muttered but they're so thin they hardly count and then he let drive now whether the ball chose to hit gunpat rai's bat or gunpat rai's bat chose to hit the ball is immaterial away it went beyond the boundary and gunpat rai's long legs scored four a sharp hissing roar of delight rose from the assembled school and tom gordon frowned faintly but he was far too good humoured to withstand what followed heartened up by his absolutely unlooked for success gunpat rai who though his legs were thin was a powerful enough young fellow did everything and more than everything that could be expected of him he gambolled out and slogged wildly he pirouetted like a teetotum and nearly killed his wicket keep and finally let drive at his partner's wicket demolishing all three stumps out cried the umpire ruefully but with commendable impartiality and when tom gordon had sufficiently recovered from his laughter to assert that no one but the stumps had suffered another hissing roar of applause rose from the school all things however must come to an end and a skying block of gunpat rai's was finally caught by tom gordon as it appeared to be descending on his mother's lap but the score stood at thirty six and as the batsman walked past him proudly yet sheepishly the eton boy shook him by the hand by george you know he said you'd be another ranji with practice i never saw such an innings played never gunpat rai flushed up under his dark skin and gave back the grip with all the curious lissome strength of an indian hand in which the sinews seem made of iron the bones of velvet after that it seemed of little count that tom gordon who began the next innings should by a judicious foresight and the obedience of his small boys combined carry out his last bat as last man with a score of seventy two you are too good for us gordon laughed the rev mr freemantle we must deport him from the station or request him not to play again mustn't we boys but the hissing roar which followed was of dissent not assent and when it had died away gunpat rai as head of the school spoke up to his own surprise again fluently cricket he said is a noble game we learn everything noble from england so are we pleased to acquire proficiency at the hands of mr tom gordon esquire the soft dark eyes looked almost appealingly at the blue ones all right said their owner curtly i'll come down and coach you a bit if you like and he did ii golden silence why on earth can't you learn to hold your tongue gunpat said tom gordon roughly i thought you had more sense than to mix yourself up with those arya somajh agitators you'll be getting yourself into trouble some day the years had passed since the famous innings making of the bowler an assistant district superintendent of police of the batsman a pleader in the high court practically the balance of progress was all in favour of the latter coming from the house of a miserable merchant whose monthly earnings barely touched a living wage of the poorest description he had risen far beyond his birthright whereas tom gordon on his pay of two hundred a month with poor promotion before him had if anything fallen from his but discontent sat in the dark eyes and cheerful acquiescence in the blue ones perhaps the owner of the latter was a better appraiser of his own worth for he knew he was not clever knew that though he was jolly good at this he was not jolly good at that not so gunpat rai clever at school the cleverness of imitation of memory and gifted with a fluency of words beyond even that of most of his class he had spent the first years of his young manhood in waiting for an appointment which never came how could it come when every school in india turns out dozens of applicants as capable as he for every government post from cape comorin to holy himalaya yet resentment at this failure of the impossible ate into his soul so he had turned pleader had drifted into the editing of a native newspaper a copy of which lay on tom gordon's office table as he looked with kindly contempt at the man who sat opposite him for though gunpat rai had not turned out a second ranji the memory of the old days when he had coached the ilmpur school still lingered with the eton boy and he had shaken hands as frankly as ever when gunpat rai had called to welcome him to his new district i'll tell you what it is gunpat continued tom gordon you fellows don't know what anybody wants but yourselves now take this district it's a very fair sample he turned over the leaves of the last census report which lay on his table rapidly hum m m here we are jahilabad population odd jat cultivators of the soil banyas presumably moneylenders literacy let's take the average for all india if you like it tells enormously against my argument but it can stand it now think at fifty three per thousand we have twenty nine let's say men who can scrawl their names and spell out a line or two in their own vernacular how many of these are put out of court by the moneylenders more than half i'll wager there you are you educated men a negligible minority taking india as a whole so why don't you speak for yourselves not for the country at large because you don't really mean anything you don't know what you want yourselves tom gordon paused in this unusual eloquence and with a laugh turned to the handsome little fellow of six whom gunpat rai had shown off with pride as his eldest son jolly little chap said the assistant superintendent irrelevantly i suppose he's married gunpat rai flushed up under his dark skin as he had done five years before at the cricket match the women he began oh i know interrupted the young englishman 'stri acchar' and all that but i say gunpat how the deuce are you going to govern india if you can't even settle your womenkind no my dear fellow i haven't the faintest sympathy with you you sail pretty near sedition in this copy here he laid his hand on the blurred blotched broadsheet which called itself the star of hope but by george if you jib it the least bit more i shall have to run you in so don't be a fool you're a good sort gunpat and i shall never forget that innings of yours never if you would only have stuck to it instead of 'seeking a post in white clothing' you might have been he paused unable to say what and gunpat rai feeling a like inability the conversation ended uncomfortably and so it came to pass that not many more days afterwards tom gordon sat once more in that curious atmosphere of cocoanut oil and curry powder which is inseparable from indian crowds listening to gunpat rai's voice but he sat disguised in one of the front benches of the crowded hall so that he had to look far back more than once to see that his constables were all in evidence for a notable agitator on tour had stopped at the little town and this was a meeting which must be reported upon since here was no audience composed of peacefully seditious bengali clerks and irresponsible students but of stalwart jats discontented over some new but as yet untried scheme of irrigation now irrigation stands closer to the heart of a jat that does wife and children what was the sirkar to deny the land its drink the other speakers had been innocuous their very vehemence had passed by the slumbering passions of the long bearded jats who listened to them with ill concealed yawns but with gunpat rai it was different at the first word tom gordon felt that he was in the presence of a born orator and yet and yet surely the words were vaguely familiar in their import if not in their sound the crimes we charge against this alien government of india came the liquid indian voice are not lapses defects errors of common frailty which we brethren as we know them in ourselves can allow for they are no crimes that have not arisen from evil passions passions which it is criminal to harbour an iron mailed stick held by a burly farmer fell with a clang as its owner shifted it to his right hand no offences that have not their root in avarice rapacity pride insolence ferocity treachery cruelty malignity of temper each epithet seemed punctuated by a growing stir amongst the audience in short in nothing that does not argue a total extinction of all moral principle that does not manifest an inveterate blackness of heart tom gordon had it now the billingsgate he had confounded years ago of course burke's billingsgate he had flung off his disguise and leapt to the dais in a second oh hold your jaw do there's a decent chap don't go spouting other folks' abuse he cried but gunpat rai was helpless before the sudden need for decision dyed ingrain with malice vitiated he went on mechanically the young assistant superintendent of police gave a sharp glance behind him what he saw there was not reassuring oh do shut up tell them the meeting's over or there'll be mischief corrupted gangrened constables came the order keenly clear the room for heaven's sake gunpat don't get yourself into trouble they were the last words tom gordon spoke his hand slipped from gunpat rai's shoulder as he was struck full on the bare head from behind by an iron bound staff which crashed into his skull even then the tyranny of words held gunpat rai though the suddenness of the shock dislocated his sequence dyed ingrain corrupted to the very core then he stood staring at what lay before him and a great silence a golden silence from words came to him at last he only broke it once when he was on trial the court was full of his friends and on the dais sat englishmen so the conditions were nearly the same as they had been years ago when the hot sunshine had slanted from the tipper windows at ilmpur to lay broad squares on the cool whitewash i learnt it at school he said dully and then he began but the crimes we charge against you hush h said the judge gravely we know what you learnt at school but that did not lessen the sentence the footsteps of a dog she passed smiling softly though a vague trouble seemed to clutch at her heart she had found him asleep so often of late and if the driver slept the oxen might well pause in their task of drawing water and so the fields which needed it so much be deprived for yet another day of their life giving draught they were not however pausing now at any rate their slow circling brought her sleeping husband to sarsuti's eyes and carried him away again wheeling round by the well from whose depths a stream of water splashed drowsily into a wooden trough and then hurried away a little ribbed ribbon of light out of the shade of the great banyan tree into the sun saturated soil beyond where the young millet was sprouting how cool it was after her hot walk from the village no wonder he slept she sat herself down beside the runnel of water where a jasmine bush threw wild whips of leaf and blossom over the damp earth there was no need to wake him yet the bullocks would not pause now that she was there to make them do their work that was her task in life to make them do their work she sighed and yet she smiled again as the slow circling oxen brought her husband prema almost to her feet once more how handsome he was his bare head lying on the turban he had pressed into the service of a pillow and his slender limbs how ingeniously he had curved them on the forked seat so as to gain a comfortable resting place trust prema to make himself and everyone else in the world comfortable a sudden leap of her heart sent the blood to dye her dark face still darker as she thought of the softness the warmth the colour he had brought into her life how long had they been married ten years a whole ten years and there was never a child yet it was getting time no no not yet not yet she need not look that in the face yet she rose suddenly as the wheeling oxen brought him to her once more and staying them with one swift word bent over the sleeping man prem she said prema i am here his arms were round her in an instant his lips on hers for here out in the shadow amongst the sunshine they were alone sarsuti wife he murmured drowsily then with a laugh shook his long length and stood beside her his arm still about her waist tall as he was she was almost as tall a straight upstanding jatni woman with eyebrows like a broad bar across her face but as her dark eyes met his in passionate adoration something in the sight of his exceeding beauty smote her to the heart the thought that there was none to inherit it the knowledge that if it passed it would leave nothing behind it it is a thought which has driven many an indian woman to take another woman by the hand and lead her home to be a hand maiden to the lord it drove sarsuti after long weeks nay months of thought almost to speech prem she faltered hiding her face on his breast i have been thinking thou needst a son and but she could get no further partly because the words seemed to choke her partly because prema turning her face to his with his soft supple hand stopped her mouth with kisses what was the use what was the use she asked herself fiercely thinking of such things when she loved him so some morning aye some summer morning after a summer's night she would rather make the dream compeller send her to sleep once and for all to sleep and dreams of prema and his love then he could marry again and there would be children to light up the old house a son to light the funeral pyre but now no not yet the sunshine filtering through the broad leaves dappled them with light and shade the oxen resting stood head down nosing at the damp earth the water ceasing to splash ran silently more and more slowly on its way and all around them a yellow glare of heat hemmed them in breathlessly yet here at the well the jasmine grew green a big datura lily rejoicing in the shade threw out its wide white blossoms and looking down to the mirror like pool of water into which the long unending circle of deftly arranged earthen pots and ropes dipped you could see the tufts of maidenhair fern which came god knows whence they were like love in the heart heaven sent thou wilt call at the lala jee's this evening sarsuti said prema with a faint note of half shamed uneasiness in his voice as his midday meal of milk and hearth cakes over she prepared to go back he deals more justly with thee than with me may he be accursed and may the footsteps of a dog s'st prema she interrupted the lala jee is no worse than his kind and we have asked so much lately yes she thought as she trudged homewards they had asked much for prema had a lavish hand yet she would of course have him keep up his position as head man of the village the position that had been hers by right as the only child of her father prema her cousin had gained it through his marriage to her by special favour of the sirkar in memory of good service done in the mutiny time by the old man he had been a better husbandman than prema and money had gone fast these few years since he died though she had tried to keep things as they had been still who could grudge prema the handsomest yoke of oxen in the country side the fleetest mare and those mad experiments of his with new ploughs new seeds that the huzoors spoke about it was well to keep to the soft side of the masters no doubt yet it should be done discreetly and when was prema ever discreet she almost laughed even while she stooped to let the water from an overflooded plot run into the next by removing the clod which her husband had forgotten thinking of his indiscreetness of the gifts he showered on her when he had money in his pocket to pay for them sometimes when he had not of course the lala jee would listen to reason and lend more on the coming crop who could deny prem anything but the lala was curiously obdurate he was an old man who had backed the luck of the village for three generations and never had a dispute with his creditors see you daughter he said prem for all he is head man and thy husband is but man and there is none to come after him her face darkened with a hot blush again the land will be there she replied haughtily aye but who will own it strangers they say from far away i have no dealings with strangers there will be my share she protested aye but how wilt thou fare with strangers also thou childless widow he asked her hot anger flamed up wait thou and see meanwhile since thou art afraid take this she tore off the solid gold bangle she wore 'tis worth fifty rupees at the veriest pawnshop give me forty nay replied the bunnya with spirit 'tis worth a good seventy five though thy man i'll warrant me paid a hundred so seventy five thou shalt have but look you daughter or if thou willest it mother keep prem in leash or a surety the footsteps of a dog will show on his ashes she looked at him startled curious how the phrase born of a belief that one can read the reward of the dead from the marks which show on his funeral pyre should crop up first from prem regarding the lala jee next from the lala jee concerning prem was there any truth in it she wondered she had the money that was one comfort and prema would be pleased then when the biluch mare foaled and they sold it as a yearling for the three hundred rupees prem thought it would fetch she would tell him how she had pawned his gift meanwhile a brass bracelet to be had at the shop for a rupee would serve to deceive his eyes but not the sharp ones of veru the young widow who was the only other inhabitant of the wide courtyard with its slips of arcaded rooms round about it and great stacks of millet stalks and huge bee hive stores of grain her eyes were on it from the moment sarsuti sitting down above her on the little raised mud dais began to spin thou needst not stare so girl broke in sarsuti at last yes i have pawned it he needed money and he is more to me than aught else beside more than thou husbandless can dream child veru she was indeed but little more than a child this virgin widow of sarsuti's half brother who had been born and died in his father's old age held her head lower over her wheel and said nothing her widow's shroud seemed to swallow her up yet in that jat household she was kindly enough treated for sarsuti's strong arms loved work and she had a great pity in her great soft heart for all unloved things here was no question of shaven head or daily fasting veru simply led a cloistered life and did what share her strength allowed of the daily work of late that had not been much she had complained of fatigue and had sat all day spinning feverishly as if to make up for her failure in other ways for she was a sensitive little thing ready to cry at a word of blame so the evening passed by prema was not to be back from the well till late not indeed until the moon set for the young millet had been neglected somewhat and even he was roused to the necessity for action water it must have or there would be no crop thus as the sun set sarsuti cooked the supper reserving the best dough cakes the choicest morsels of the pickled carrots against her husband's return and then being weary lay down so as to freshen herself up to receive him as he should be received the night was hot there was a restlessness in it which found its way into her mind and she lay awake for some time thinking of what the lala jee had said yes it was time it was growing time for so many things yes she must harden her heart and be wise the footsteps of the here she fell asleep when she woke there was pitch darkness the moon had set what had happened had prema returned and full of kindliness as ever seen she was tired and so refrained from waking her she put out her hand and touched his bed but he was not there how late he was and where was veru veru who should have been watching for him veru lazy child art asleep her question came back to her unanswered veru also was not in the wide courtyard where were they the very conjunction of her thought regarding them woke in her a sudden swift pang of jealousy where were they a minute later holding an oil cresset in her hand as a guard against snakes she was passing swiftly through the deserted village on her way to the well prema might have fallen asleep he might be asleep still the night was so dark she held the lamp high above her head so as to throw its light before her on the narrow edge of a pathway between the flooded fields it was so still she could hear the faint sob made by some deadly thing slipping from her coming into the water over which a wandering firefly would flash revealing an inky glimmer between the rising shoots of corn ahead that massed shadow was the banyan tree the fireflies were thick there thick as cressets at a bridal feast if prema slept yes if he slept to be awakened by a kiss underneath the arching branches of the banyan tree it was dark indeed but the silence of it told her that the oxen anyhow were at rest and prema as she held the light forward something on the ground at her feet caught her eye jasmine jasmine twined into a wreath for whose head not hers prema she called prem there was no answer but he was there for all that half resting on the forked seat as if he had flung himself upon it when weary weary and content his head thrown back upon his arm his whole body lax with sleep and with content she had seen him look thus so often prem she whispered prem and touched him on the bosom then a hideous shriek of terror and horror startled the sleeping oxen into forward movement as from the folds of his clothes like some evil thought there slipped a snake swift curved disappearing into the darkness prem prem speak to me oh prem speak as she flung herself upon him the forward movement of the oxen forced her to her knees so heeding it not at all one hand holding the light close to his face as she strove vainly to rouse him she was dragged along the accustomed round until the beasts recognising the unaccustomed strain paused once more prem say thou art not dead say only that prem she moaned her voice seemed to reach him on the far edge of the great blank for his eyelids quivered then for one moment he looked at her and there was appeal in his eyes wife veru my it was scarcely a whisper but she heard it and with a cry of joy she caught him in her strong arms laid him on the ground and tearing his cloth aside sought for the wound finding it her lips were on it in a second ah could kisses draw the poison surely her frantic love must avail but no his eyelids closed there was no sound only a little quiver that she felt through her lips then his beauty lay still beneath them after a time she drew herself away from him and laid his head upon her lap so she sat dazed thinking of that jasmine wreath in the dust and of that half heard whisper wife veru my my what and there is none to come after him said the village worthies when the fire of prema's burning had died down to smouldering embers and the oldest man of his clan in the village had performed the rites which should have been the duty of a son and then they shook their heads wisely thinking that men of prem singh's kind ran an ill risk in the next world without a son to perform the funeral obsequies especially nowadays when the law prevented a dutiful wife from ensuring her husband's safety and salvation by burning herself on his funeral pyre yea it was an ill world indeed in which the fostered virtue of a woman you had cared for and cossetted might not avail to save the man she loved from the pains of purgatory and then they drifted away full of surmise and deep desire concerning the headship of the village mai sarsuti could not hold it as a widow though she could hold the land and there were no relations none so the coast was clear for many claims sarsuti meanwhile had not clamoured as many an indian widow does even nowadays to be allowed to sacrifice herself for her husband's salvation she had scarcely wept she had on the contrary spoken sternly to veru bidding her keep her foolish tears until all things had been done in due order to keep away the evil spirits and ensure peace to the departed then after all the ceremonies were completed and prem's beauty lay swathed awaiting sunset for its burning she had sat on one side of his low bier while veru sat on the other and the wail had risen piercingly naked he came naked he has gone this empty dwelling house belongs neither to you nor to me there had been a menace in her voice high pitched clear almost impassive while veru's had been broken by sobs so now that frail weakling was asleep wearied out by her woe while sarsuti sat where the bier had been still in all the glory of her wifely raiment still with the vermilion stain upon her forehead still wearing round her neck the blessed marriage cord with which he had so often toyed for she had point blank refused to allow it to be broken time enough for the widow's shroud she had said to day she was still prem's wife he had scarce had time to die so she sat quite still looking at the place where he had lain thinking of those last words had she really heard them was it possible the thing that had leapt to her mind deep down in her heart she knew vaguely that the feet of her idol had been of clay that with prem all things were possible poor wandering feet which might yet have kept to the straight path if oh prem prem had it been her fault or was she wronging him then suddenly that recurring phrase recurred to her once more the footstep of a dog the footstep of a dog was it past midnight had another day begun the day of judgment surely then she could see yea she could prove it was not true the moon was just sinking as close wrapped in her veil she crept down to the edge of the nullah where the burning ground lay a gruesome place haunted by the spirits of the departed not to be ventured near after dark but sarsuti had forgotten all the village lore she had forgotten everything save that deadly doubt yonder it must be on the point close to the water for still an almost mist like vapour lingered there she sped past the faintly lighted patches on the hard baked soil which told of other burnings murmuring a prayer for the peace of dead souls and so found herself beside that little pile of dear ashes a breeze from the coming dawn stirred them sending a grey flake or two to meet her prem she whispered then as she stooped to look the whisper passed to a cry oh prema prema she lay there face down her hands grovelling in the still warm embers on which there showed unmistakably the footstep of a dog and the moon sank so there was darkness for a while then in the far east the horizon lightened bringing a grey mystery to the wide expanse of the level world and behind the greyness came a primrose dawn and the sun rising serene and bright sent a shaft of light to touch her as she lay then she rose and dusting the dear ashes from her almost blistered hands she crept back to the wide courtyard where veru still slept worn out by sorrow she stood watching her asleep wondering at her own blindness then she touched her on the bosom wake she cried in a loud voice wake oh veru and speak the truth the girl started up and the eyes of the two women met the village was bitterly disappointed but of course there was nothing to be done but wait and see if the child was a son for mai sarsuti had stolen a march on them she had gone straight to the burra sahib straight to the head district official and told him of her hopes what is more she had petitioned for trustees to work the land seeing that she and her sister in law were poor widows and she especially unfit for work so three of the village elders had been convened to see to the land and render account to the sahib who would be sure to keep an eye on them seeing that mai sarsuti was an upstanding straightforward jatni just the kind to whom the sahib logue gave consideration and after all she and hers deserved it for they came of a long line of virtuous loyal people so sarsuti with vera lived in the seclusion which befitted her recent loss though according to custom she still wore a wife's dress but she grew haggard as the months went by small wonder said the village matrons when they returned from their occasional visits seeing that she awaited a fatherless child then one morning veru looking very worn and frightened and ill came to tell the elders that a son had been born to sarsuti perhaps it was as well they thought since otherwise there might be disputes about the headship now there could be none and as there would be a very long minority under the care of the sahibs prem's son would come in to free land and money laid up in the bank a rich headman was always a prop to the village so their wives went to congratulate the new made mother she was looking haggard still and scarcely seemed to rejoice in her great gift but that perhaps might come by and bye but it did not sometimes she would take the baby and look at it long and earnestly then she would give it back to veru whose arms were seldom empty of prem's child and return to the work of the house or sit watching them gravely from her spinning wheel her large dark eyes full of wistful pain so the months sped by and still sarsuti wore a wife's dress and smeared vermilion on her forehead and the mangala sutram still unbroken held the wife's medal round her throat it would be time she answered proudly to the shocked village women to think of breaking it when prem should have been dead a year and the child be able to suck cow's milk she prepared for the anniversary by purchasing a maw's feeding bottle and an eagerness grew to her face as she watched little prem take it and roll over contentedly to sleep like the fat good natured little lump of a healthy child as he was but veru wept still maw had supplanted motherhood when the night came round again on which sarsuti had heard that faint whisper from her dying husband the child slept as a child should and veru once more worn out by tears slept also but as on that night a year ago sarsuti sat on the place where prem's bier had lain and thought her dark eyes full of a great resolve suddenly she rose tall straight upstanding and passed to where the child lay she stooped and kissed it kissed it for the first time then throwing her arms skywards murmured to high heaven lo i have saved him i his wife and so catching up a small bundle which she had prepared passed into the darkness of the night they found her charred body at dawn face downwards where the footsteps of a dog had shown upon prem's ashes she had saturated her clothes with paraffin and set fire to herself deliberately lo how she loved him said the village elders behind their outward and decorous disapproval see you she is decked as a bride with all her jewels now with a son in his house and suttee on his pyre there is no fear but what prem hath found freedom ay assented the lala jee the footstep of a dog will not be seen on his ashes the finding of private flanigan we were quartered up in the hills making a military road when private flanigan was lost it was to be a big road cutting clean into the heart of the himalayas so various detachments were set to work upon its long length ours was the last but one and we were lucky in getting by far the best pitch on the whole line it would be difficult indeed to exaggerate its beauty and as summer came on the advantages of shade shelter which it afforded made us feel blessed above our fellows it was a green oasis about half a mile long by some quarter broad of fine emerald sward not to be beaten by any english lawn and it was irregularly fringed by the most magnificent deodar cedars i have ever seen when we arrived in early autumn these were wreathed with virginia creeper already russet which as winter advanced flamed like fire among the dark spines now in spring the trees were hung to their very tops with a rambling white rose faintly double faintly yet penetratingly scented which festooned the whole forest making it look as if it were garlanded for some festival and turning the oval greensward into a veritable stadium fit for the sport of a king for an amphitheatre of blue hills rose behind the forest with here and there a peak of eternal snow it was simply a ripping place and when on saturday evenings the detachment further south and the detachment further north used to come over to play football the fellows were always full of envy our men there were but two officers with each detachment were little ghurkas but they played an uncommonly good game thanks partly to the fact that my captain was an old rugby man and gave his countenance to practice but our chief asset was private flanigan of the small party of sappers and miners who acted as overseers on the works he was not perhaps a shining example to the men in other ways but so far as football went he was the best possible coach the result was that despite their small size our ghurkas could hold their own with the detachment of tommies further south they never actually won a match but they made a stubborn fight and accepted honourable defeat good humouredly treating their adversaries right royally at the canteen afterwards in the manner of ghurkas when they get chummy with british regiments it was a quaint sight to see them hob nobbing together at the further end of the stadium where there was a duck pond sort of lake half filled with sacred lotus blossoming white and pink a wood slab little temple dedicated to kali stood beside this lake with steps leading down to the water but nobody seemed to notice its presence and the very brahman in charge used to come and watch the games with interest perhaps he thought it sufficiently savage to please the terrific goddess who sat enshrined in a little dark hole where nothing was to be seen of her but crimson arms and hands one of them apparently holding a football it certainly was bloodthirsty enough one day when the detachment further north came down to try their luck they were the biggest tallest lankiest lot of sikhs i ever saw but perhaps because they had such long shins they simply knuckled under before a rush of our little beggars it was almost pitiable to see them the more so because they were furious and would not accept consolation even at the hands of private flanigan who with unblushing kindness of heart took all the credit to himself in the curious dialect he used as a means of communication with his pupils for being a manchester irishman his english had to contend with a town accent a lancashire accent and an irish accent while his hindustani was of the lowest type to be picked up in a barrack square 'taint your kussoor fault sonnies at all at all be jabers nahin no don'tcher fret dil khoosh heart happy kape yer 'air on dekko you soors beg pardon gintlemen it was a mistake entoirely you 'aven't a nadmi man like tim flanigan to purwarish karo nourish you so in his garbled language he went on to boast of what he had done for the little gherkins as he was wont to call them making them indeed rhyme to jerkins and firkins in a football song he had composed for private flanigan was great at singing also at clog dancing in fact he was good at anything and everything he chose to take in hand thoroughly but that was not much for a more idle able devil may care fellow did not exist he was however a general favourite and i noticed that even my regulationarily correct captain dealt leniently with his not infrequent lapses from good behaviour flanigan was in tremendous form at a sing song held the night of the football match and literally brought down the house with his clog accompaniment to a patter song in which he parodied the feelings of victor and vanquished even the priest of kali who as usual viewed the performance from a distance was reported to have observed that the energetic and active goddess herself could not have danced with greater vigour upon the prostrate body of shiv jee as for the sikhs they positively bellowed with delight although private flanigan had not paltered with such obvious rhymes as kicks and licks in fact the whole audience was so happy and hilarious that we hoped the slight difference of the afternoon was forgotten but we were mistaken about midnight sunt singh havildar began to attribute jye kush naick's flat nose to a provision of the all wise creator in view of football squashes and assert magniloquently that god never made an ugly sikh whereat strife arose and kukries and bichwas might have drawn blood had not my captain shown discreet firmness and sent an exactly equal number of sikhs and gurkhas to the guard room it was very shortly after this incident that private flanigan found himself there also as usual for patronising the canteen too liberally but this time he was profusely indignant and assured me on his bible oath as a rule he professed roman catholicism that it was a gross case of mistaken diagnosis he had not been drunk still less disorderly when the sergeant put him under arrest he was merely giving a realistic and spirited representation of last year's all england match as it had appeared to him and this he was doing solely for the benefit of his pupils the little gherkins shirkin' lurkin' little gherkins who had basely failed to speak up for him when he was comatose from fatigue that was about the last time i ever spoke to poor flanigan for about a week after he was mysteriously lost i say mysteriously because though all sorts of theories were put forward to explain his disappearance none of them were entirely satisfactory i myself inclined to the explanation that being according to the ghurkas' testimony a little bit on at the time he lost his life in a sudden spate of the river caused by the melting of the snows in the higher hills it was a very sudden spate and caught the working party as they were clearing the southern end of a deep cutting a tunnel indeed for twenty yards or so which lay just at the end of our section the sikhs however who were working at the northern end escaped the flood altogether and rather jeered at our men who had to scramble for dear life some regaining the camp and others spending the night in the open so each party thinking flanigan must be with the other he was not missed till next morning when it was too late to find his body we dragged the river pools to no purpose then as the spate had ruined half our work gave up the search and duly reported his death at headquarters with the prospect of the advancing hot weather before us when we must knock off there was not much time for amusement and we were kept pretty close at it but a himalaya spring in the uplands was a perpetual temptation to me and i used to start off at dawn time for a long tramp on the higher murgs or alps taking my gun with me in case i came across an old cock minawul pheasant there was a perfect mosaic of flowers beneath one's feet forget menots pansies white anemones yellow gillyflowers scarlet potentilla and half a hundred others whose names i did not know you could not set your foot down without crushing some beautiful thing you felt that you were ramping through a veritable garden then it was marvellous to see the snow peaks flush red with sunrise while the shadow of night the shadow of the earth itself still lay immovable in the valleys and you had to bend close over the mosaic to distinguish one flower from another even the cock minawul despite their dazzling metallic lustre looked shadowy and dark as they rose rose swiftly to flash out suddenly into copper and green and silvery goldeny blue as they met the higher sunlight one morning thinking i had hit a splendid specimen of these rocketting fireworks and being anxious to secure such a perfectly plumaged bird i followed one over keenly the result being that i lost my way and found myself under a blazing hot sun still seeking for my particular valley at long last i caught a glimpse of deodar trees below me and began to descend confidently but half way down a certain strangeness of contour made me pull up and question my judgment no it was not our valley it was too narrow too small besides there was no lakelet in it indeed there seemed no way out of it it lay like an extinct crater absolutely shut in by the high hills tucked away right away no by jove there were people or things in it i could see a steady white spot of something on the greensward and a sort of dancing circle of black specks were they men or animals i was too short sighted to distinguish so i started downwards again impelled by curiosity and a vague feeling that i knew what was coming to find a point of vantage whence i could see clearly i don't think i was in the least surprised at what i did see i am sure my inner consciousness was aware of it before i was the dazzling white speck was private flanigan he was standing in a dignified attitude in the very middle of the field naked as the day he was born save for a waistcloth and the biggest pair of boots i ever saw at his feet lay a football and in his right hand was a glass of something to drink which between his sips he used to beckon on his adversaries i crept further till i could hear his voice come on sonnies come on boys it came persuasively idder 'h'ow i won't 'urt much not to spake of kooch nay come on i says then as his invitation was reluctantly accepted he lunged out a wild kick an awful howl followed and yet another lanky sikh retired rapidly rubbing his shin whereat private flanigan laughed and took another sip triumphantly bahoot utcha the rollicking tones were a trifle thick now you're learning i tell yer yer 'ardening like a hegg in 'ot water and you'll soon get useter it you won't remember it when yer sees the leather a sailing through the uprights no yer won't no more nor a woman for joy as a man is born into the wurrld hello ye divvle ye would would ye this was to an enterprising youth who thought to take advantage of a prolonged drink to sniggle the ball i lay and laughed i couldn't help it flanigan wasn't a big man but he was brawny and the sikhs twice his height had such temptingly long shins i watched the lesson of how to defend the globe until after several replenishings of the glass he held private flanigan's dignity became portentous and his lunge a little wide evidently however he was not too far gone to recognise the fact for suddenly he sat down still guarding the ball with his wide spread legs and called for a pipe a pillow and a punkah all three were instantly forthcoming and as i cautiously re climbed the hill i saw private flanigan enjoying his ease in the centre of an admiring circle of pupils as i made my way home i puzzled over what i had best do of course it was easy to report to my captain but by so doing i should get a lot of men into trouble over what was in reality a huge joke anyhow before i did so report i determined to find out whether private flanigan had absconded himself or had been stolen so the next evening having carefully taken the bearings of our valley in miniature the day before i went over after work hours when i came on the level at the bottom i found that quite a large wood slab shed had been erected at one end of the little bit of greensward as i crossed towards it the familiar sound of really good clog dancing met my ears accompanying a rollicking baritone voice that was singing the refrain of a patter song kick an' 'ammer away at their shins silly old dribblers as cole' cream their skins barkin' lurkin' shirkin' gherkins give 'em a crush and a rush for their sins yoicks hey forward the sicki wins a perfect bellow of applause was following as i opened the slab door and walked in there was a regular stage at the end of the shed and on it stood tim flanigan bowing his acknowledgments to an audience of squatting sikhs with much dignity a flimsy muslin overcoat partially hid his massive muscles and he was garlanded with flowers like a prize ox at a show he did not notice me at first and began a speech in true music hall style his hand on his heart my kyind patrons an' you gintlemen of the press it is with the hutmost diffidence that i roise to drink me own 'elth you gintlemen bein' by birth and descent tay totallers which is better by a long chalk than being answered for by godfathers an' godmothers at your baptism gintlemen i have but a few wurrds to say so i will not detain you since i come 'ere i mean since the woise decrays of a koindly providence brought me to the wilderness i 'ave endeavoured to do my dooty by you an' i done it gintlemen you are a credit to me there ain't a 'ole skin amongst the lot of your shins gintlemen it is a thing to be proud of it makes the tear come to my watery heyes an' sends the life blood to the tip of my nose i tell you gintlemen that if any of thim officer chaps were to step in this moment here his eye caught mine the change was instantaneous and he brought himself up to the salute smartly beg pardon sir he went on without the least sign of embarrassment havin' bin h'absent without leave sir this fortnight past through being kidnapped outrageous i 'as to report myself i mustered up what gravity i could for his attitude of respectful and disciplined attention was excruciatingly funny in contrast with his costume or rather the lack of it private flanigan i said have done with tomfoolery how the devil do you come here i didn't come sir he replied volubly i was brought s'help me moses i was kidnapped outrageous as i said by them sickies same as seethin' it in its mother's milk i was entirely sir sure the bla'gards won't deny it here havildar sunt singh who understood english broke in rapidly in hindustani he speaks truth huzoor he did not come of himself he was brought hither when he was without consciousness from drink i suppose i asked severely havildar sunt singh paused a moment huzoor he said at last solemnly in a world of illusion it is difficult to reach truth but one thing is certain by the blessing of god he was extremely without consciousness was it not so brothers he continued appealing to two naicks and another havildar who were also standing to attention their corroborative be shakks rang out smartly like a rifle shot that is all very well i continued sternly addressing the culprit in chief if they kidnapped you they'll have to answer for it but that is no excuse for you stopping here you can't pretend you're a prisoner you know i glanced round as i spoke and flanigan's eyes followed mine there was a bed in one corner a chair a washhandstand an assortment of europe tins a box of cigars in a rough set of shelves while on one side of the stage stood a table elaborately laid for dinner with a tablenapkin folded into the form of a peacock there was a pause then candour came to private flanigan's aid almost pathetic candour well it weren't exactly uncomfortable you see sir he said with a deprecating smile and i had to admit the justice of his plea it was more comfortable than being packed like a herring in a barrel in a bell tent i had moreover thought the matter out and had come to the conclusion that the less said about it the better so i gave private flanigan the option of taking the pledge and returning to duty making the best excuse he could for his absence or being sent for officially he chose the former to the great delight of the sikhs who as he had said were teetotallers to a man and who naturally did not want to get into trouble over the business next morning private flanigan reported himself to my captain he was bare foot travel stained weary and he had the most cock and bull story i ever heard of how he had spent the last ten days if there had been any liquor shop within two hundred miles i wouldn't believe him said my captain in an injured tone but there isn't and no man is such a fool as to stop out in this wild country for nothing so the tale passed muster had i known however of the richness of the culprit's imagination i doubt whether i should have given him such a field for it for the story of the loss of private flanigan became a recognised entertainment even for the gherkins and night after night he gave a different version of it to delighted admirers i ventured once to remonstrate with him and hint that capture by cannibals was hardly correct but his unconsciousness was supreme s'elp me moses sir he said you don' know wot i bin through they'd have eat me sure enuff if i 'adn't happen to 'ave my big boots on a fortnight afterwards we finished the work but before we left our jolly little camp we had a football saturday the sikhs came down in force and licked the little ghurkas all to smithereens they must a 'ad some un to teach 'em 'ow to charge sir said private flanigan sorrowfully to the captain the captain looked at me and i looked at the captain but i said nothing for flanigan had been as sober as a judge since i found him rex et imp i rex will get on all right said muriel alexander pettishly you know quite well horace that so long as he has old bisvas he wants nothing else look at him now he is quite happy and the old man would die rather than let any harm happen to the child horace alexander frowned slightly as he looked through the wide set door of his office room to the verandah beyond it was a very neat natty office room severely correct and western in its pigeon holes its files its elegant upholstered chair at the further side of the writing table ready for the confidential visitor no guns defiled it no tennis bats no half used box of cigars no general litter of unofficial male humanity such as most indian office rooms in the past have permitted was to be seen within the precincts sacred to duty for horace alexander was that curious product of modern times a clever and advanced man bent upon progress who stickles for the commonplace conventional etiquette in all things so he stirred uneasily at the sight he saw beyond his office doors dropped his eye glasses and put them on again petulantly yet it was rather a pretty sight a red haired fuzzy headed child of four or five small but strong and sturdy seated with the utmost dignity oh a red velvet cushion his broad freckled face wearing an expression of conscious majesty part of which was doubtless due to the insecurity of a gilt paper band which was perched on his goldy red curls before him in an attitude of prayerful adoration squatted a very very old man at his full height he must still have been tall and the bent shoulders were broad broad enough to show up the line of war medals on the breast of his orderly's coat they gave the new scarlet cloth a certain personal cachet and toned down its official garishness come here rex called horace alexander and the child rose at once though high spirited and a bit of an imp he was a reasonable obedient little chap enough obedient because he was reasonable what's that you've got on your head queried his father irritably it's my c'wown replied rex cheerfully bisvas cut it out for me and he's goin' to put b'wown paper to make it 'weal stiff c'wowns onghter be stiff 'weal stiff oughtn't they an' he's going to put things on it like the pictures in the papers an' then i shall be a 'weal king shan't i no my boy said his father sharply crowns don't make kings remember that always there was charles the first then he paused recognising he was out of the child's depth and the cult of the weaker brother was not often forgotten by horace alexander it was the secret of his popularity but how he managed to reconcile it with his passion for progress remained rather a mystery to some people and what were you doing he continued i wasn't doin' nothin' except be king replied the child but bisvas was doin' 'durshan' what is a 'durshan' daddy 'weally the childish forehead was all puckered beneath its crown and rex's father for all he was entitled to linguistic letters after his name hesitated sight he began ur appearance ur aspect but rex shook his head in disapproval bisvas says it's just for all the same as seein' god didn't you bisvas the liquid urdu to which the little fellow's voice turned echoed through the sunshine to where the tall old trooper risen to his full height stood smiling huzoor so it is without doubt the sight of a king is even as the sight of a god it is a revelation of the most high good lord muttered horace alexander under his breath yet with an amused smile the child will grow up a feudal serf combined with a feudal lord if we don't take care muriel he is too much with old bisvas you'd better take him with you or or not go his wife did not even frown her position was too assured in the household for her to be even alarmed of course i must go i must wear my new frocks besides you forget i'm president of the veiled women's guild and they are going to present a casket and there isn't room in the hotel for rex i was lucky to get one for myself this morning besides it would be bad for him of course when you were going with tents and all that it was different but now that you've been told to stop really horace it is most annoying what can it mean there is nothing wrong in the district is there horace alexander's eyeglass dropped again it generally did when he was asked for a personal opinion not from any lack of decision in the man himself but from that habit of relying on collective as against individual thought which distinguishes so many clever men nowadays as if the mediocre mass could ever outvalue superior sense i cannot conceive that anything serious can be wrong he began then paused almost pathetically before the certainty that his district was admittedly the best managed in the province however he continued virtuously remembering that the communication which stopped his going to the big durbar was strictly confidential that is neither here nor there i have my orders so that ends it and he glanced out to the verandah where the durshan had re commenced i suppose rex had better remain if you think it safe i shall be very busy his wife laughed and stooping over his chair kissed the top of his head it was a trifle bald you dear old stupid she said kindly you've nothing to do with it i wouldn't leave him if it wasn't for old bisvas you and i horace have grown out of what shall i call it feudal relations but we can understand them you don't suppose i leave the boy in your charge do you no my dear man you're not up to it but bisvas bisvas was your grandfather's servant when he was a boy and he swears rex is the living image of 'jullunder jullunder baba' whom i verily believe he mixes up with alexander the great it doesn't do the child any harm though it makes him a bit autocratic now he'll grow out of being king at school and really it is a pretty sight to see him with his bodyguard of those marvellous old dodderers bisvas rakes up from the bazaar i've seen them replied her husband gloomily i'd have sent them about their business if they hadn't been old pensioners and in uniform muriel laughed again such uniforms but they are magnificent to the child and he's magnificent to them it's all right horace he is as pleased as punch because i've allowed him as he can't go to delhi to have a sham coronation here my dear protested her husband but at that moment an old fashioned buggy with a flea bitten arab in the shafts drew up and mrs alexander discreetly withdrew before an official visitor ere five minutes were over the new comer rose from the upholstered chair went to the four doors of the office room looked round for possible eavesdroppers closed them then sate down again for john carruthers the superintendent of police was of the old school he suspected everybody in his heart of hearts horace alexander loathed him or rather his methods but he had to admit that he was an excellent police officer short and stout he looked as if he had a trace of native blood in him anyhow none understood the ways of indian wickednesses better than he this is serious he said briefly i always told you sir you would have to face it some time then he paused i wonder if anyone realises the relief it will be to our force when the whole show goes off well as it will do but there's always that off chance and here is one i don't believe it said horace alexander stubbornly it is unthinkable inconceivable john carruthers raised his shaggy eyebrows nothing sir is inconceivable in india there's a lot of lees in four thousand years of civilisation so long as it's stagnant well and good but if you stir 'em up however you don't agree and this he touched the confidential communication has got to be seen to yes it has got to be seen to wrong or right echoed the younger man firmly outside the sunshine shone in sultry drowsy peace but within the closed office room the air seemed vibrant as the two mutually responsible for so much in their world looked into each other's eyes in perfect unanimity so it is often in india nowadays something has to be done and old and new must combine to the doing of it hullo what's up asked the superintendent of police when having offered to drive his official superior down to the city they stepped into the verandah and then he smiled the youngster seems to be enjoying himself eh under the sirus trees on the opposite side of the drive were drawn up five old men headed by bisvas who stood next something that was more like a monkey than a man for bhim singh even when he had been the most swaggering havildar in a ghurka regiment had never been tall and was now almost incredibly shrunken and old but his eyes still looked out sharp and bright from his wizened face and his military salute shot out smartly at the sight of the masters it is all old bisvas' fault excused rex's father giving a disturbed look at his son and heir who with the gilt paper circlet still on his fuzzy head was apparently drilling the ancient warriors i've told my wife that it's a mistake but you see bisvas looked after my grandfather when they were kids together and so and so interrupted john carruthers with a chuckle you have the most valuable asset in the world if i were you i would encourage it good lord man he forgot etiquette for the moment that sort of thing is the safety of of everything so the two men drove off to the office to confer secretly with other good men and true and the child with the gold circlet on his fuzzy hair stood in the half shade half shine of the sirus trees and dressed his army autocratically and the old warriors there was bisvas who had fought at sobraon and bhim singh who had fought everywhere indiscriminately for sheer love of fighting and old iman the hair of whose body still stood on end as he told tales of how he had waged war for the sirkar against his own brothers in mutiny time and pir khan yusufzai who still talked of nikalseyn sahib as if he were not dead and last but not least most ancient of all a nameless fossil of humanity called by the others baba father who bewailed the fact that he had not been at both sieges of bhurtpore these all obeyed the child's orders and nodded and winked and swore that he was the living spit and image of gineral jullunder jullunder sahib bahadur who had led them to victory again and again the smallest cavalry officer in jan kampani's army but the bravest and the best loved ii three days had passed and once again the two men sate facing each other in the tidy conventional office room the confidential box was open and papers littered the table but the hint of possible trouble remained still a mere hint and yet said john carruthers thoughtfully i don't like it i told you about that temple incident quite a trivial affair but in my experience and that is pretty wide sir that sort of thing always means something but the fact is i haven't time his bright eyes grew restless to unearth anything horace alexander smiled because my dear fellow there is nothing to unearth i told you so from the beginning i am pretty well up in my own district carruthers that you may be sir but pure anarchism isn't a thing of districts it's what do they call it a zeit geist how many fools do you suppose are in your towns and villages sir well everyone of them is a danger if there is a good agitator within hearing anyhow i am so far dissatisfied that i am going to propose to you a plan he got up as he had done before closed every door after a good look round for eavesdroppers and finally paused before little rex who was sitting in a corner of the room playing with a pen and paper and some red and black ink which his father had given him his mother having gone off to the big show which was to take place next day the little fellow had been tearful and needed consolation now however he appeared quite absorbed in his occupation what are you doing rex asked john carruthers the child held up a round of white paper with cabalistic signs on it i'm makin' a medal to give to my army he said with importance and 'wex' is to be in 'wed and so's 'imp' then 'et' will be black don't you see the men laughed and settled themselves over the railway map which john carruthers spread out on the table you see said the police officer in a low voice the royal train focusses anxiety according to these hints he pointed to the confidential papers and i can't help a feeling that they are right i've got a sort of second sight in these ways perhaps because i was born and brought up in the country and i believe there is something in it i'd ferret it out if i'd time but i haven't so why run risks the royal train is timed to run the sixty odd miles through your district on the direct line between three and five am to morrow morning just before dawn now why should it why shouldn't it do the eighty odd miles of the loop line but that would bring it right here right in the very heart interrupted horace alexander that wouldn't matter provided nobody knew came the quick reply and nobody need know except of course the railway bosses just look at it on the map points changed at barawal junction then straight away past us to the northern branch and so back a bit only a bit to the main line again it wouldn't delay them half an hour if that horace alexander's finger traced out the line on the map but the direct line is guarded he began inadequately persisted john carruthers at least to my mind now by taking this new loop you are safe it only needs a telegram for the trains haven't begun yet to run at night and it will be 'line clear' all through the usual pilot engine of course so no one need know horace alexander nodded no poor devils he assented a bit irrelevantly and dozens of them would have rejoiced to do 'durshan' the child in the corner of the room looked up at the familiar word and listened but the men were too much immersed to notice him well it may be wise said horace alexander at last i don't agree with you carruthers of course the whole thing's a mare's nest but as you say it won't disarrange anything the royal train will be up to time for early tea at sonabad and there all is safe so if you'll drive me down to the telegraph office i'll send the cipher myself h'm said john carruthers thoughtfully i wouldn't cipher don't trust 'em a bit the clerks in my office know 'em i'm sure try french it's safer horace alexander laughed a superior laugh mine don't not the real confidential one why i don't suppose you do that's a different matter replied the police officer drily however it's for you to decide yes said the district officer firmly well goodnight rex i shan't be back child till breakfast to morrow where are you going daddy asked the boy i'm going to do durshan replied his father carelessly the child rose and came towards the table with shining eyes the medal in his hand daddy he said i should like to do 'durshan' too mayn't i his father shook his head and smiled impossible rex you can't ride forty miles over the desert along a railway as i shall can you you wouldn't like to do what daddy's got to do to night i can tell you young man wait a while your turn'll come he was busy locking the confidential box but i meant here daddy persisted the child here echoed his father carelessly oh here yes you and old bisvas can amuse yourselves with doing durshan as much as you like now good night and and be sure to say your prayers rex he stooped down to kiss the child and as he did so rex imp in red with the et in black caught his eye rex imp he muttered not a bad name for you though you're a good little chap on the whole and he went off feeling virtuous whatever his own beliefs or rather lack of belief might be no one could say that he was forcing it prematurely on the weaker brother perhaps however the thought that his little son's lips which had never to his knowledge been soiled by a lie had begged dear god to take care of his daddy was unconsciously a help to the man during the anxious night for it was anxious to be responsible meant much to both those men and this sudden change of plan though it certainly removed risk threw a still heavier burden of care on the shoulders of those two who had suggested it therefore when just as the primrose dawn of another day had begun to dissipate the shadows of the night the royal train safe and sound steamed into the station at sonabad horace alexander and john carruthers looked at each other as they stood on the platform and positively laughed that nightmare's over said the latter i always said it was a mare's nest replied the former well we needn't quarrel about it now i've handed over charge to evesham and you to coleridge and that's all and i shall be glad to have a cup of tea i've been too busy to eat for the last few days half an hour afterwards they were in horace alexander's motor going full speed along the grand trunk road we shall be back by breakfast time said john carruthers whose thoughts ran upon food but horace as he steered his way past the long lines of lumbering wains laden with corn which still in india cling to the roads despite railways was jubilant over his district i told you it was all right he said finally but you and your sort carruthers can't see that we are in a new age we are out of the past that doesn't look like it interrupted john carruthers pointing to a group in the verandah for at that moment the car swept easily into the gateway of horace alexander's house the latter frowned for rex's army was awaiting them drawn up to stiff military salute while in front of them his small broad face full of smiles was rex himself holding a box in his hand we got it daddy he shouted we got it all 'wight and the men 'wan away and baba jee emptied it because he was the older est and it's all quite 'wight good god cried john carruthers leaping out of the car his eyes almost out of his head it's an infernal machine i i i 've seen 'em before i i horace alexander turned pale as ashes put it down rex gently gently but but old bisvas salaamed down to the ground the presence need not fear the child did not touch it of course till the poisonous thing had been emptied of its venom but how began horace alexander helplessly john carruthers however had his wits about him and said in a low voice look here sir this had better be kept dark for the present anyhow old iman who understood a little english nodded approvingly without doubt it is a concealed word he said suavely and so i told bisvas therefore none know of it save those here present so we had to do often in mutiny time when news meant much and gineral jullunder jullunder sahib bahadur would say the police officer cut the old man's reminiscence short you have done well risildar jee he said curtly but the praise brought an unwonted flush to the withered cheek we'd better hear the story in camera sir so the five old warriors filed into the office room the doors were shut and rex sate on his father's knee while john carruthers carefully examined the infernal machine which had been laid on the table paris he said laconically one of the latest sort what did i tell you sir anarchy isn't a thing of districts go on bisvas replied horace alexander evasively as i was saying huzoor when the huzoor left to do durshan last night jullunder baba came to me and said 'bisvas get ready to go and do durshan likewise my father said i might ' and you did daddy didn't you broke in the little lad's voice confidently his father hesitated then remembering his uncomprehending words nodded and held the child closer so i knowing that the word of jullunder baba is even as the word of a king unbreakable said 'but whither my lord' and he said 'that will i show thee do thou as thou art bid slave' now the night as the huzoor knows was dark and i grow old so i bethought me of help lest evil should befall therefore i said 'lo it is not meet to go without the army' so these came willingly for see you protector of the poor we are all old and the durshan is even as the sight of a god it heals sin therefore in the darkness we set off and i wrapped the chota sahib in blankets and took the trick lamp and a ternus of hot milk also john carruthers looked up he means electric and thermos said horace alexander with an odd sort of cackle in his voice something seemed to have risen in his throat and prevented his speaking clearly we carried the chota sahib by turns seeing there might have been serpents in the way continued the old man and made for the railway since that was all the direction jullunder baba would give then iman remembering the old tomb the huzoor will remember it also since there was a case about it in his court and the huzoor broke in iman decided virtuously that being the tomb of a saint it should stand and the railway move remembering it went on old bisvas he said 'it would give shelter to the child' so thither we went and there the chota sahib having remembered he had not said his prayers as he had promised the huzoor said them he knelt huzoor on that slab lest the floor should be damp yes assented the child's father as the old man paused once again there was that lump in his throat he saw as in a vision the old mahomedan tomb rearing its half ruined dome so close to the railway the white faced child praying god to bless everyone he loved those dark faces standing round reverently lo continued old bisvas gently i think the saint down below must have heard iman says he did for what followed was of no man's making we were all drowsing in the tomb 'tis a good five miles from the huzoor's bungalow to the railway for all it goes so near to the city when baba jee he hath the ears of a mouse still said 'hist' so i looked out and there were men five or six of them on the line then it came to me what the ill begotten hounds had been doing in bengal and a sort of fury seized on me so i crept back jullunder baba was asleep among the blankets on the tomb slab but i whispered the others and they unbuckled their swords and made ready the faces of the four old warriors who standing two on one side two on the other of the speaker had watched his every word were a study exultation pride absolute satisfaction showed in every line of them and the lean old fingers gripped their sword hilts once more then baba jee gave the word he was 'senior orfficer' and and huzoor they ran away even john carruthers' chuckle had a suspicion of a sob in it and then oh hero he said what then huzoor i looked out over the desert and far far away on the straight line i saw light and there was a faint rumble in the air it was a train mayhap the chota sahib had been right mayhap it was the train of majesty so i turned on the 'trick lamp' and there it was on the line that thing it had a string to it that lay on the rail and and huzoor my memory fails me there was the child and there was the train i had to decide then i cried to iman 'quick the chota sahib run far with him far far' so when that was done i up with my sword and i smote the string that lay on the rail he paused then went on so that was done also and iman brought the child back and the train sped past and we all stood in a row and did durshan though i know not if it was durshan or not since mayhap it was not the royal train after all the old eyes looked almost wistfully at those two men in office but the child's were on his father's confidently but it was the royal train wasn't it daddy said the child's voice and horace alexander's answered huskily perhaps it was rex anyhow you and the others did durshan of that i am sure content settled to those two faces the old and the young and the ancient warrior went on then there was nothing to do huzoor save to come home and bring the poisonous thing with us i was for sending the chota sahib on in iman's care and carrying the thing myself but jullunder baba would not go without it so bhim and the father took the devil's box apart lest it should kill everyone and with bhim's kukri they prized it open a faint sigh came from the europeans and spilt the witches' brew in the sand that is all huzoor your slaves did what they could the men ran away so fast it was not possible for us aged ones to pursue them but broke in the most aged they were dressed like the huzoors in trousers and my sword was bloody so i must have hit someone and so was mine said each of the ancient warriors in turn horace alexander cleared his throat really he began i scarcely know how to thank daddy said rex's eager voice i know i'm goin' to give each of 'em my army medal with 'wex and imp in 'wed and et in black on it an' they'll be orful pleased won't you army huzoor the old arms were stiff in salute and then the oldest voice struck up quaveringly lo sahiban it is enough for us that we have done durshan ere death it brings contentment even though both sieges of bhurtpore is denied to some of us as led by rex they marched out to the verandah the two officials looked at one another but they said nothing for a minute then john carruthers burst out damn the cipher i told you it wasn't safe look here sir we must keep this quiet for the time horace alexander nodded there arose a man this was one of the many stories which nathaniel james craddock told me in the cab of his engine while we used to go up and down that ribbon of red brick metalling edged with steel which was slowly laying itself out over a wide sandy desert some of these were tragic some comic some betwixt and between but most of them were worth the re telling especially as told by him but the discursiveness of his method does not lend itself to print so they all suffer in the process even though as i write i seem to hear the steady grind of the engine to feel the fine fretting of a sand storm on my cheek and see the clear blue eyes looking at me with a keenness which always came as a surprise out of that bleared dissipated face it was 'arter i 'ad that peep o' the noo jerusalem sir at the bottom o' the king's well 'as i come upon pore old 'oneyman i was a bit on the loose you see sir them sort o' peeps wakes up the spiritooal nater o' a man an' it's heads i win tails you lose if 'e takes to prayers or to drink i tuk to the latter here he gave a slight cough and added gently more nor usual an' so i come across 'oneyman 'e'd 'ad a peep o' hell sir for 'e'd seen 'is wife's dead body lyin' where he'd left 'er safe an' sound waitin' for 'er baby to be born in doo time there was always a biblical twang about craddock's recitations which gave them a mournfully dignified tone 'e 'ad friends in 'igh places sir an' one o' them w'en he come through 'is brain fever made 'im conservancy inspector down bandelkhand way it wasn't the place for 'im they was wot they call suckties sir down there though there was precious little o' the babe an' sucklin' about their methods but contrariwise battle an' murder an' sudden death they was for ever killin' goats an' kids an' smearin' ole mother kali with blood never knew such chaps for paintin' the town red so the khush boo sahib as they call him in their topsy turvey way since it weren't perfoom but real stinks down by them temple steps couldn't never forget the sights he see in mutiny time when 'e was in 'is cups 'e'd sit an' cry about it for 'e was a little bit of a man sir the smallest man as ever i see an' all wrinkled like an' wizened just for all the world the same as the monkeys as used to come down in crowds on feast days an' leg it with the orferings folk used to bring to ole mother kali that's 'ow 'oneyman come on reduction as the sayin' is tho' pore chap them as look on 'is face might a seen that 'e wasn't for long not even if they'd made 'im guv'ner general in council for what with savin' your presence sir a galloping consumption both o' drink an' lungs 'e was wearin' away like snowdrifts in summer here craddock paused to whistle a familiar tune beg pardin sir but it comes home to me so for he was awful fond of 'is wife well whether it was 'is name 'oneyman you know sir being the god o' monkeys or whether it was 'is nater he was uncommon kind to the bunder logue used to say they was the only christians in the place 'cos they wouldn't 'ave no meat offered to hidols sir an' it's true as gospel sir they wouldn't you should a' seen them waitin' in the trees and hover the arches an' crocketty things on the temples while three or four smug brahmins was going the rounds with a party o' country folk full up o' sugar candies an' parched rice an' platters o' curds to leave at each 'oly spot it was a rare sight for you see the monkeys were 'oly too an' the priests dursn't even 'eave a brick at 'em they 'ad just to lump it when the beasts 'oofed away with all the best things afore their very eyes an' 'oneyman used to amoose himself of an evening by sittin' on the steps an' larfin' fit to split i told 'im it weren't perlite but there it ain't no use talkin' to a man as has seen 'is wife lyin' dead then one day an ole buck monkey 'oofed it with a bag of rupees an' dropped it as 'e was climbin' a tree above 'oneyman's 'ead and 'oneyman being in no state to know 'is own 'and much less wot it 'eld gathered some of 'em up an' swore 'e'd keep 'em that's 'ow it was so 'e got the sack though anyone as had eyes might a seen it was the weddin' garment o' a shroud he was wantin' pore chap i was runnin' ballast then on a bit o' new line that was cuttin' its way through jungle land yard by yard an' inch by inch it give one a sorter shock sir every day as i come up with my trucks to find the engine goin' so much further an' yet to get 'eld up at last by the same ole blocking o' trees an' creepers an' butterflies an' all that seemed as though there wasn't nothin' else before one and as if it wasn't no use trying to get through with it but they give me good wage specially after they tuk to runnin' o' nights too so i was able to put my hand into my breeches pocket when 'oneyman said 'you don't 'appen to 'ave a five rupee about you do'ee craddock for i ain't got a feather to fly with' then my stoker tuk sick an' i managed ter get 'oneyman as local demon it didn't 'urt no one you see sir for i done both works without turnin' more 'airs than 'ad to turn with two shirts one dryin' the other an' it give 'oneyman time to die respectable an' quiet like at the back o' the lamp room in the junction where i 'ad my diggings not that it was much of a 'quiet and secluded 'ome for an invalid' sir specially after orders come to push on the work as much as may be before his honner the guv'ner or some such bigwig i disremember which come on tower still 'e got a sight better an' i used to tote 'im about as stoker up an' down the line an' many a time as 'e see me 'angin' out my shirt to dry 'e'd say pitiful like 'it had ought ter be mine but i'd do as much for nathaniel james craddock if i could' and he done it sir in the end for i should a' lost my billet but for 'im this is 'ow it 'appened the monkeys weren't no better after 'oneyman left but rather the worse they was more christian like than ever an' wouldn't 'ave no bowings down in the house of rumnings it got so bad as the suckties couldn't stand 'em no more but it was some leeches as a down country man brought as done the trick at last i don't mean proper blood leeches sir but them whited sepulcre the other way round fruits as is marocky leather outside an' my golly in well the 'ead bottlewasher brahman 'im as they called the gossoon though w'y i can't say since the only gossoon i ever 'eard tell on was a hirish gentleman in the colleen bawn was dead on leeches 'e was a real blood leech 'imself if you like but though 'e kep 'is eye on them all the time 'e was palavering away about mai kali an' shiv jee the ole buck monkey was too much for 'im an' 'e 'ad nothin' but the marocky leather trimmings as come floatin' down peaceful like on 'is bald 'ead and big stummick as he stud dancin' with rage while bunder jee was eatin' the my golly that as i said done the trick there was a gold printed letter come from mai kali ter say she was lonesome away in the jungles without 'er hunooman or some such rot then 'is honner the bigwig was coming an' so on an' so on it ain't 'ard to do that sort o' thing sir w'en you don't have no ten commandments an' everyone is so accustomed to lying that it don't strike 'em as odd how they done it i don't know all i know is that one moonlick night i saw the signal against me as i was running through to the junction with sand i'd bin far to fetch and i didn't like it i'd bin away two days without 'oneyman and bein' a bit lonesome i'd perraps had a drop too much or perraps it was the moonlick night as done it here craddock's voice took on a hushed tone it wasn't like the noo jerusalem sir or them yaller bottles in the chimist's shop as i used to think was 'eaven when i was learning my dooty to my neighbour there wasn't nothin' glittery about it nothin' to make you think of the far away it was there right down beside you on the engine cold an' clear taking the colour out of every mortal thing till there weren't no difference a'twixt earth an' sky till the pin point of the pole star wasn't no brighter than than the safety valve for i keeps 'em bright you see sir here he laid his hand affectionately on the throttle so i wasn't that pleased at 'aving to 'old up specially as i was a bit late and 'ad to get through the junction afore tha bigwig's train was due for 'e was comin' that night 'wot's up' i sings out to the station master with an oath 'e laughed 'two truck load caged monkeys zoological specimens rate attendant priests in charge consigned to mai kali we'll hitch 'em on behind in no time superintendent's orders' well sir it was no use swearin' so they was 'itched up and i went on full steam givin' them brahmins a bit o' a swing wot with the 'eavy sand in front an' the cages behind the junction was all lit up an' decorated for the bigwig flags a flying an' red baize all along the platform 'e was to dine there and the refreshment room looked a a reg'lar spread i call it an' there was the superintendent waitin' in 'is best uniform craddock paused as if to emphasise further remarks 'e was a real bone silly man there ain't no other word for 'im sir bone silly down to the last drop o' marrow i dunno if it was the sight o' 'im or the drink i 'ad on board but i forgot to choke 'er down in time an' we went over the points at a rattlin' pace the sand being 'eavy took 'em steady but the zoological consignment being light didn't it ran off the rail lurched into a shed upset and before you cud say 'knife' there was a matter of two 'undred or more o' the specimens let loose in that there junction he paused again and shook his head sorrowfully it ain't no use tryin' to describe it sir all you got to do is say ''ell an' tommy' and leave it alone 'craddock' shrieks the superintendent as i stud laughin' fit to split as i see limber legs at their old games 'make that brute give up my helmet or i'll i'll ' then 'e got speechless save for bad words sir you never see such a huproar red baize tore to strips festooning the roof 'god bless our bigwig' flutterin' in bits like a paperchase down the platforms an' the mail train due in 'arf an hour 'you you brought 'em 'ere you scoundrel' shrieks the superintendent 'take 'em away again or i'll i'll ' an' again he refrained even from good words sir but 'e was bone silly not as anyone cud do anything leastways not till 'oneyman step out of the lamp room in 'is pyjamas lookin' more dead nor alive but there was somethin' in his hair sir as made me feel as a man had arose in israel for all he was so small 'you leave it to me' he says confident like then he turns to the bone silly superintendent as stood dumbfounded staring at 'im as if 'e were lazarus noo raised 'there's five an' twenty minutes yet sir' he says 'afore his honner's train's doo on my honner as josiah 'oneyman i'll 'ave 'em safe out by then only i won't 'ave no one a interfering everyone's got to obey my horders and mine honly' the bone silly one hadn't a word to say there was somethin' so awful majestic about the little man in 'is pyjamas pore chap lordy sir you should 'ave 'eard him next with they suckti brahmins as was rubbing their bruises an' calling on mai kali for assistance 'she ain't in it sonnies nor the chaps as you bamboozle neither' he said said he 'it's you as 'ave to make a offerin' yourselves this time so it'll make a 'ole in your pockets as well as your stummicks my boys an' it's no use your saying you ain't got no rupees your credit's good enough for that' an' here he waved 'is 'and sir to the row o' sweetmeat sellers' booths and stalls as was sot just outside the iron railings you seen 'em sir you know 'ow they looks at night harf a dozen trays piled up full o' treacle stuff an' greese with a hoil butti flaring an' smoking on the top of a pile o' their beastly toffee an' dribbling through it to give the dead flies a stickin' to it a flavour yes you've seen the 'met aiy yen shee yen' here he gave an excellent rendering of the sweetmeat sellers' cry an' so've i an' 'ad to eat it too w'en i was 'ard put to it well 'e got the lot in brass platters an' all an' then began the rummiest go you ever see w'en i was a boy sir in quires an' places w'ere they sing parson use ter make us run through the service so as to get the amens right up to time it's 'arder nor runnin' a mail train though you wouldn't believe it sir well they suckti brahmans 'ad to do the 'ole caboodle same as if ole mother kali was sitting like a spider with 'er eight red legs an' harms on the top of each sand truck for you see sir they was standin' fair an' square on the lines engine's steam up et cetera it was a rare sight the monkeys was fine an' pleased with the red baize an' the flags an' the motters but the moment they 'eard them brahmans begin to chant they cock their tails an' listen an' the ole buck monkey 'e clomb crafty along the girders so's to be ready to drop down so soon's he could but 'oneyman 'ad 'is views an' wasn't goin' to be give away prematoor so 'e kep a suckti gennoflexing by each platter o' toffee until every truck 'ad its altar then 'e clumb up to the engine an' beckon me to foller i was standin' with one fut on the step when he shouted to the suckties 'hands off' i give you my word sir it weren't 'arf a minute before them trucks was covered as black as flies with them monkeys grabbing an' yelling an' searchin' out for met aiy en sher een like all possessed for they were main hungry 'avin' bin shut up all the arternoon so there was our chanst an' i was just leapin' in to put on steam w'en that bone silly ass of a superintendent says says 'e 'you 'aven't got the baton' an' sure 'nuff i 'adn't for it was a single line you see sir an' we 'ad to run a mile or two through a signal station afore branchin' off of course i didn't ought to 'ave noticed 'is remark but took the chance but there it is i was a bit on an' i'd laughed fit to split my sides let alone my 'ead so i putt down my fut agin an' made to go fetch it when the engine she gave a screech an' started full speed whether 'oneyman thought i was aboard or whether he thought 'e 'ad no time to lose i never knew for after that 'twas no laughin' matter i can tell you but there wasn't much time for as i run down the platform to 'urry up the baton i see some o' the platters nigh empty already an' they monkeys looking as if they were makin' ready to 'oof it so when the screech come i turn back but i was too late she 'ad ten mile an hour on her afore i lep upon the back buffer seeing there wasn't no other way o' getting along an' then sir craddock drew his hand over his mouth thoughtfully what come next sobered me in a jiffy talk o' the ride to khiva it wasn't in it to the ride i 'ad on the back buffer o' those sand trucks thirty forty fifty mile an hour trundlin' along a consignment of a devils from the nethermost 'ell it was 'arf fright with them sir an' 'arf fury as we scud past the signal station full speed i see the babu fall on 'is face an' cry 'dohai dohai' as if 'twere the day o' judgment an' then sir i begun to think o' that blockin' o' trees an' creepers an' butterflies as was sure to crop up somewhere closer or furder and to wonder if 'oneyman knew w'en to put on the brake for 'e was only a stoker an' not one at that lordy sir we must a bin a queer sight rushin' through the moonlick night with the engine flarin' fit to bust a full cargo of devils from 'ell dancin' an' whoopin' an' 'owlin' like all possessed an' nathanial james craddock astride the hoff buffer i tell you sir if any one 'ad said 'whip be'ind' i'd a got down but i didn't want to leave pore old 'oneyman off my own bat so there we were but the little fireflies didn't seem to care i see 'em from the buffer as we flew past eddyin' up an' down an' round an' round just twinklin' among the trees like the stars up aloft just as unreasonable like an' careless as if there wasn't nothin' to worry about in this world and there ain't sir since all flesh is grass as the man said to the vegetarian and then we come to the beginning of the end o' the line but there weren't no slackenin' down o' steam so i prepare to jump an' jump i did when i come to myself the moonlick was as peaceful as the grave the engine 'ad cooled down an' there weren't no sign o' life anywhere only a 'eap of wreckage i found pore old 'oneyman lying dead chucked clean out o' the cab 'e 'adn't no mark on 'im an' somehow it seemed to me as if 'e 'ad died natural afore we run slap bang into the blockin' o' trees for 'e knew enuff about stokin' sir to turn off steam i wouldn't a took 'im on if 'e 'adn't but there weren't a sign o' them monkeys sir an' wot's more there's never bin one seen in that there jungle since here craddock rose yawned and passed over to the cranks and handles and valves the next instant an ear piercing whistle rang through the dust laden air seeming to set it a quiver that's to rouse old meditations sir he said cheerfully but it won't do it 'e's petrified to 'is place an' i shall 'ave to lift 'im out o' the way as per usual from afar i could see like a speck upon the receding ribbon of rail an immovable figure on the permanent way dry goods mr blooker sir said the head clerk severely no one whose chest measurement is under thirty two inches has any right to beat time to 'rule britannia' even when it is played by a german band in the street a small man whose desk stood nearest the office window against which a city fog lay like yellow cotton wool blushed apologised incoherently and returned to fair general averages the other clerks tittered since this was a recurring criticism for though alexander blooker's chest measurement made active patriotism impossible the heart within it was full of that sentiment this was unmistakable when he boomed forth solid songs of the past such as the death of nelson and the soldier's tear in his big solid bass voice the more modern ditties about beggars and gurls and kids and khaki being he assured his club unsuitable to his organ and alexander blooker was very proud of his organ never never never will be slaves quite unconsciously his dutiful pen punctuated each quaver and semi quaver though in his heart of hearts he knew that he himself had been a slave all his life first to an old aunt who had lately died full of self satisfaction because she left him fifty pounds out of the money she had saved from the earnings he had brought home to her all his working life and secondly to the head clerk mr mossop such a kind good blooker please chanted the office boy showing round the glass screen it was the voice of fate wondering vaguely whether this unusual call to the innermost holy of holies our firm presaged dismissal possibly for punctuating patriotism he went meekly and he returned as he went to sit down solidly once more to fair general averages the other clerks waited for a remark but none came so the pens scraped and scraped until time was up then when the office was empty save for himself and alexander mr mossop the head clerk went over to the latter's desk we can finish that for you mr blooker he said you have much to do thank you sir came the solemn reply i am much obliged to you sir but i would rather complete it myself sir before going to then decorum gave way mr mossop sir he continued wildly am i on my 'ed or on my 'eels i can't believe it and it is all your doing sir i feel sure 'our firm' wouldn't never have done it if you hadn't spoken for me and and i don't know whether i am on my 'ed or my 'eels as a rule alexander blooker struggled successfully with the accent of cockaigne but in times of stress and especially when using certain set phrases he adhered to it as if he felt it added forcefulness of expression there was a suspicion of a tear in his pale blue eye and mr mossop felt inclined to brace him up by telling him the truth namely that our firm contemplated in the near future closing the distant depot to the charge of which he had been appointed briefly it did not pay germany had got at the markets in the way that germany has when competition is old fashioned but alexander blooker's face came up from the ledger over which it had bent itself for a moment with an expression on it that startled mr mossop out of contemptuous compassion i am going to run this job on my own sir he began eagerly i'm going to work it on imperial lines h'm we are not at the debating club mr blooker interrupted the head clerk but alexander was beyond recall his voice took on the blatant tone of the public speaker shrinkage in trade follows shortage in piece goods and our piece goods is short germany's ain't i don't say that 'our firm' is as bad as most but there's a cool quarter yard out of the forty for rubbage border and all that besides mind you some of 'em goes as far as three quarters a cool three quarters and why not if you tike a hinch why not tike a hell this was apparently quite conclusive for the head clerk hastily changed the subject to the necessary preparations but two days could be allowed as the distant depot lay up a river that was only navigable for six months in the year and four of these were already overpast it was rather a rush but the present occupant of the post had unexpectedly accepted the agency of a liquor shop and the half yearly market must not find our firm without a representative so the first mail it was a journey of six or seven weeks must be the one if any money was wanted thank you sir replied alexander blooker the fifty pounds of my own that my aunt left me will do for the present by and by perhaps he looked mysterious but he said no more to anyone unless he whispered something to the glass case illustrating cotton manufactures in the imperial institute which had always had an especial fascination for him despite his hurry he was looking at the peculiarly broad borders of a pile of piece goods and muttering under his breath if you tike a hinch you may as well tike a hell when a man of gold lace and buttons found him after closing time and hustled him by corridors of imperial pickle bottle into the sahara of exhibition road within two months he was to use his own expression taking down the shutters in a very different desert for the distant depot lay at the back o' beyont whereabouts in the world circle matters nothing briefly it was one of those advancing tentacles of civilisation boasting the mission house the dry goods store or two and the whisky shop which carry between them civilisation to the aboriginal beyond it lay desolation except for a single telegraph wire which spanned the void towards the west instead of following the tortuous curves of the river now sinking into sandbanks which after a long course south eastward eventually found itself at the same goal the sea board there was no town to speak of only a cluster of leaf huts besides the mission house and chapel the two stores and the liquor shop and these were so close clustered that to alexander blooker when he rose to look out over his new world on the morning after his arrival it seemed as if the bell which was being rung from the chapel was a general invitation to pray and buy and drink but it was a pretty little place a real oasis in the surrounding desert of sands and almost bewilderingly green amidst thickets of banana trees a tall fat man showed in the verandah of the opposition guten morgen mien freund he called with superb indifference i gif you welcome that was doubtless franz braun the german rival and alexander blooker hated him at sight but he kept his dignity the same to you sir he replied stiffly i trust trade is good it is goot for me remarked franz braun with an air for which alexander blooker could have kicked him that being impossible owing to their relative sizes the little man relieved his bellicose feelings by beginning on 'twas in trafalgar bay it still had for him the charm of novelty to be able to beat time when and where he chose mein gott shouted franz braun excitedly over the way wass fur eine stimme wunderbar it was the voice that did it but for it the armed neutrality of the past between the rival firms might have remained in the future as it was an hour afterwards alexander blooker was politely but steadily refusing to sing a second to the wacht am rhein although franz braun who had an equally good high tenor after the fashion of tall burly men wept on his shoulder and called him bruderlein you must to the pastor house this evening sighed the big creature at last fraulein anna who is to the pastor schmidt daughter will make you sing she is my verlobte i will to her be married but she will make you sing nevertheless neither her yellow hair nor her blue eyes beguiled alexander blooker from his fixed determination but they sang together for half the night and the memory of fraulein anna's soaring soprana as the notes of oh for the wings of a dove floated into the hot air was with him as despite the lateness of the hour he set all in readiness for the morrow since on the next day's doings much depended for it was the yearly market day on which all the native traders from far and near came to buy goods alexander blooker in fact had hurried his doongah up the sinking river so as to reach the distant depot in time for it his last task was the undoing of one of the small bales which throughout their journey had been the objects of his special care it you tike a' hinch you may as well tike the h'ell he murmured as he cut the packing threads by the dim light for he had refused to use the made in germany lamp of his predecessor then with a sigh of satisfaction he held up the top one of the hard pressed pile of printed cotton handkerchiefs that ought to fetch 'em he said admiringly certainly it might have fetched anything and everything to use heraldic terms the field of the kerchief was gules argent and azure arranged in saltire otherwise a union jack an escutcheon of pretence bore the queen's head regardant while quarterly en surtout were on the first gules three lions passant or for england on the second or a lion rampant within a double tressure flory counter flory gules for scotland on the third azure a harp or stringed argent for ireland on the fourth well why the fourth field should have been charged with specimens from a pack of cards alexander blooker did not know it was a blot on the scutcheon no doubt but two days had not sufficed for the printing of a special design and this was the best he had been able to find besides in a measure it was true there was no blinking the fact that even british civilisation was apt to bring gambling and drinking with it the next day the whole place was full up with native traders and natives generally the first sight of them made alexander blooker wonder why they were so eager for piece goods considering how little of them they wore but then he had hardly realised that beyond that northerly desert lay a huge tract of densely populated almost unknown land trade was brisk over the way at franz braun's store the cheap german muslins guaranteed full length and packed in convenient carriageable size went off like smoke and it was not until the best lots had gone off that a trader thought it worth while to give a perfunctory glance at alexander blooker's consignments then his eye fell instantly on the heraldic handkerchiefs sell how much he asked alexander blooker shook his head they are not for sale sir he replied loftily they are a gift an imperial gift from her gracious majesty the queen of england everyone as buys forty yards of english stuff has one of them given in free gratis and for nothin' him as buys two has three and so on much the same as parcel post rates it took two interpreters to bring home this admixture of patriotism and progressive bribery to the limited brains of purchasers but when it did find its way into their understanding the effect was marvellous before the sun set alexander blooker had to conceal his last bale of handkerchiefs against the year which must elapse before he could get a new supply so mein freund said franz braun with a good natured laugh it is well but it is not trade it will be trade replied little alexander stoutly i am going to work this job on imperial lines it grew to be a joke in this distant depot as it had been in the city office where the yellow fog lay on the windows like cotton wool but here mr blooker had liberty to beat time to anything he chose and it was surprising how the natives took to him he must have spent a good deal of his fifty pounds on the purchase of medicines for his morning dispensary soon out rivalled pastor schmidt's who in truth was growing a bit old for the work he had lost his wife of late years his daughter was betrothed to franz braun who had a promise of a post elsewhere and the hearts of all three held hope of change in the near future which hindered much enthusiasm in the present not that there had ever been much of it in their lives even the old missionary had gone on his way coolly if conscientiously alexander blooker on the contrary was always at fever heat he managed to transfer some of his ardour even through the lengthy mail to our firm so that when the river route reopened a double consignment of dry goods took advantage of the water the last penny too of the fifty pounds had gone through mr mossop's agency in handkerchiefs of brand new design more heraldic more patriotic than ever and guiltless of cards perhaps alexander blooker felt that so far as he was concerned british civilisation was bringing no evil in its train and it was not it was surprising indeed to see how the distant depot had improved in tone franz braun who deprived by the difficulty of carriage of sufficient lager beer to satisfy him had taken to over much whisky instead now greatly to the delight of his verlobte satisfied his thirst on home made ginger pop brewed by a recipe of alexander's aunt while the old pastor gave in with smiling acquiescence to the appropriation by alexander blooker of what might be called parochial work in fact there was some talk of building another shanty as a parish hall for the little man was distinctly churchy and liked things in order a temperance league and a band of hope had combined with an enlarged liver made the liquor store keeper take leave home and alexander having offered to run the business until another man could come out was now conducting it with a curious mixture of conscience and commerce so the eve of the next yearly market came round and alexander in a fervour of imperialism actually climbed up the telegraph post which stood in one corner of his compound and nailed a pocket handkerchief to it flag wise so called franz braun from over the way half jocularly half vexedly the patrol will at you haf damages when he returns for that single wire which sped seawards from north to south was patrolled at intervals by a staff of engineers from the former he has paid his last visit for the cool season said alexander knowingly so there it can stay if it likes for the next four months at any rate i wish that to me came the same certainty of liking growled franz braun but you see the herr papa ails and the verlobte wishes him to the homeland to take and i would also go if i could a vague alarm showed on alexander blooker's face and leave me here alone i'm glad you can't the idea however stuck in his brain supposing he were left alone what would he do after he had arranged everything to his liking for the morrow this idea of perfect solitude kept him from sleep and he strolled out with a pipe to quiet his nerves in the desert what would he do if he were left alone a curious elation mixed with his natural dread he walked and walked scarcely thinking out the question only feeling it in that big heart of his he had instinctively followed the telegraph line himself so as to be sure of not losing his way but now he started at the sight of a solitary figure before him visible in the moonlight advancing to him and keeping the same bee line swiftly yet stumblingly with a pause as for a few seconds' rest at each post it was someone who was ill or very very tired a woman a native woman he could hear her voice now in her pauses always the same words mumbled mechanically over and over again save me queen of the handkerchief save me he knew enough of the language now to understand so much and he waited watching her curiously across the last gap she stumbled towards him gave one surprised look at him and with a vague effort at the same words as if he had been a telegraph post sank down in a dead faint she was quite a slip of a girl and after a time she came to herself but she was so exhausted that it was past grey dawn when alexander blooker managed to get her back to the telegraph post in the corner of his compound and to this she clung pertinaciously much to his annoyance for he wanted to get her out of the way and find who she was and what she wanted before the native traders began to turn up his remonstrances however were in vain her only reply was a murmured incoherent repetition of her first appeal save me queen of the handkerchiefs and every time she said it alexander blooker experienced a patriotic thrill down his back he felt that she must at all costs be saved but from what the dawn grew from grey to gold gott in himmel laughed franz braun coming down very early because of something he had forgotten mein alexander mit a madchen ach fie stop your silly jaw and find out what she is wanting cried alexander blooker fiercely or help me to get her into the shanty before the traders come mein bruderlein replied franz braun solemnly when you have so long as me been in savage places you will not to redress women's wrongs learn alexander blooker swelled visibly that sentiment is made in germany sir she has appealed to that he pointed to the flag pocket handkerchief on the telegraph post which was waving in the breeze of dawn and by george she shall have protection there was nothing more to be said not even when some of the traders coming on the scene recognised the girl as the daughter of a powerful chief in the northern land who would be certain to give trouble were she harboured by the distant depot it would be better to send her back in their charge how she had found her way so far was a mystery she must have followed the telegraph posts day by day have slept in their shadow night by night some vague confused sense of the poetry of this night after night sleeping all unconsciously as it were under the flag of england day after day following the course of light to freedom rose in alexander's throat and half choked him she shall stay he said let her father come to fetch her if he is in the right he shall have her my dear sir quavered old pastor schmidt he will not time for explanation give i was in a to be compared position once i will not be so again i will take my daughter ling away i will go there is no good in staying to be massacred when pension has become due it was all to no purpose alexander blooker stood firm the utmost he would do was to write a conciliatory letter for the traders to give on their return to the girl's father saying that his daughter had been handed over to the charge of a suitable matron and that he might have her again if adequate explanations were tendered to her gracious britannic majesty's representative at the distant depot and here the great temptation of his life came to alexander blooker he would have loved to sign himself consul cmg no one would be the wiser but the sense of duty was strong within him and he refrained this being so pastor schmidt incontinently determined not to brave the certainty as he deemed it of coming trouble his society in the west was prepared for his possible return the details of how the work could be carried on by a native deacon during the six months before a new pastor could arrive were all settled nothing but a half conscious feeling that to retire would be to sign his warrant of dismissal from what had been to him his life had kept him hitherto from decision now the river was falling fast they must take their chance of escape while they could get it and franz braun after two days of moody helping to pack his verlobte's belongings he came to say not without a certain tremble in his voice bruderlein i also go so far anyhow my firm said so much a month ago to night thou wilt be alone there was not much time for alexander blooker to realise his position until as the cool of the night came on he stood by the last little landing stage on the river watching the noah's ark boat as it punted its way slowly through the network of sandbanks behind him as he stood flared the red glories of the setting sun in front of him the long stretches of sand the winding gleams of the shrinking river were fast losing each other in the purple blue shadows of coming night from the lessening speck of the boat as it drifted downwards on the current came half regretful half joyful farewells the native congregation assembled in full force sent after it wailing outcries but alexander blooker was silent save for one brief good bye fraulein anna good bye pastor schmidt good bye franz braun the sliding shadow of the boat had disappeared into the oncoming night for his short sighted eyes long before the still savage congregation lost it but he stood staring on where it had been long after they had gone home contentedly then he turned suddenly the red had almost faded from the sky only low down on the horizon lay a band of what ruskin held to be the highest light pure vermilion and against it he could see the telegraph post with a black speck that must be the pocket handkerchief of england flying at its peak he drew a long breath for the first time in his life alexander blooker felt that he was not a slave six months after the first doongah of the season punted and sailed up the river again the distant depot was deserted but there was no sign of disorder in it the english flag still flew from the telegraph post the pastor's house which alexander blooker had been implored to occupy and keep in order looked save for the dust which always gathered from the desert as if he must have been there but a few days before the garden was ablaze with flowers the clusters of native huts had disappeared and in their place neat streets of low wattle and dab dwellings converged outwards from quite an imposing edifice with church hall marked on it conspicuously the liquor shop had disappeared franz braun's dry goods store was closed and the british one removed to a portion of the central building the little mission chapel also was utterly changed the seats removed to make room for clean matting on which the native congregation could squat everything western or of western symbolism swept away and in their place ingeniously adapted to their present purpose were things held sacred by the natives here an english school had evidently had its quarters for copybooks headed in a neat hand if you take an inch you may as well take an ell were found there also a few chapters of the new testament written out in the same handwriting the tiny cemetery behind the chapel surrounded on three sides by banana thickets remained unaltered save that just under the east window three of the heraldic pocket handkerchiefs were pegged to the ground in an oblong what had happened the yearly market day brought vague inconsistent rumours from the mouths of many merchants nothing was known for certain the lord of handkerchiefs had remained of course it was said that the chief had come for his daughter nothing had happened only the handkerchief lord had as they might see built palaces he was a great chief the people simply would not live without him when he died so at least they had said as they came through the villages beyond the desert on their way north how long ago ah not long they were afraid see you of the new gentlemen they preferred to begin afresh elsewhere that would doubtless be his grave at the back of the chapel he was a great loss to the country no one gave handkerchiefs away as he did so the distant depot had to go on its way without further details only the traces of alexander blooker's short rule remained and the new inhabitants who soon gathered to fill the trim walls and dab houses benefited by them one day however when almost a year had gone by the new pastor found that the oblong of handkerchiefs in the cemetery instead of being worn and faded by sun and rain was apparently brand new someone must have renewed it in the night and on the top of it written out in wobbly round hand was the last copy alexander blooker had set if you take an inch you may as well take an ell from which the distant depot inferred that it was his death day the regeneration of daisy bell it is quite out of the question said the adjutant severely major primmer has formerly complained and the co has desired me to to to see that the nuisance is abated so far regimental discipline kept the adjutant's risible muscles under control then he smiled for he was more human than adjutants are wont to be in orderly room and upon my soul youngster he went on picking up a letter which lay beside him it is a bit hard on primmer i can imagine his disgust h'm h'm 'have to report' ah here 'as usual i woke with the entry of my body servant bringing my early tea as usual also i lay for a few moments to collect my thoughts but when i turned to pour out the beverage' good old primmer 'my disgust was great to find lieutenant graham's so called tame monkey i may interpolate that it is a specimen of the presbytis schistaceus a bold and predatory tribe and not the presbytis entellus a much milder race' good old primmer again he's nothing if not exact 'in full possession of my tea table the brute had consumed all the toast save one crust which i regret to say it threw at me when i attempted remonstrance' we both laughed can't you see major primmer vc sitting up in bed with his eye glasses on in a mortal funk i began trying to brazen it out but official decorum had resumed its sway over the adjutant and he read on 'it then proceeded with an accuracy which i cannot believe to be entirely self taught' h'm graham that is serious remember he is your superior officer 'to imitate closely my method of pouring out tea this is peculiar as i invariably put the milk in first my efforts at checking the lawless brute were again quite unavailing and resulted only in the deliberate emptying of the scalding hot tea over my nether garments' why couldn't he say his pyjamas i groaned captiously for i recognised that things had gone a bit too far i had had no idea jennie had such a fund of humour but once more official decorum failed to respond 'this i may add it did again and again until the teapot was exhausted it then pouched the whole contents of the sugar basin drank the milk and smeared its head with the butter the latter action appeared to arouse reminiscence it repaired to my dressing table brushed its hair with my brushes used my pommade hongroise and then proceeding to the wash hand stand nefariously laid hold of my tooth brush this however was too much i rose at the same moment my body servant providently appeared with my hot water and the brute jabbering at me in unseemly fashion made for the window which i always keep open winter and summer i have already requested lieutenant graham to remove this savage animal and now have no option ' the adjutant laid down the letter it's hard on primmer he said with almost superhuman solemnity the tooth brush incident was he resumed speech after a brief pause and he is a good sort is old primmer i was perfectly aware of the fact only the week before when we were out in the jungle he had dosed me with quinine and taken my temperature every two hours during an attack of fever and ague so jennie the monkey must give way but what the deuce was i to do with her i did not want to have to shoot her give her to tootsie suggested the adjutant sympathetically i heard her say not long ago she would give anything for a monkey it was a brilliant idea miss d'aguilar familiarly known as tootsie performed the arduous duties of spinster to our little frontier station so that afternoon before going on duty i rode round by the forest so called i presume because there was not a bit of vegetation larger than a caper bush between it and the beluchistan hills i found the young lady and her mother a frankly black and tan lady who looked as if she would have been more comfortable with a veil to roll round her fat person engaged after their wont in entertaining some of the junior subalterns at tea as i entered tootsie a sparkling brunette with gloriously startling titian brown hair due to cunning applications of henna dye there were traces of it on mamma's hands was in a high pitched staccato voice recounting with arch gaiety her impressions of calcutta whence she had but lately returned yes i do declare the men are just sillies why do not believe me but i asked a young fellow in a europe shop to bring me flesh coloured stockings and he brought me tan was he not a silly boy the pause which inevitably followed this anecdote seemed a fitting opportunity for somewhat sentimentally offering jennie had i offered a bomb the effect could not have been more disastrous miss grew crimson mamma purple and plethoric wondered how any gentleman could keep such a nasty brute still less offer it as a fit companion to an innocent young girl evidently jennie had again got herself disliked how the junior sub told me succinctly as we rode home you see tootsie dyes her hair and henna's a bit of a lengthy business they don't mind me i'm only a boy but she has to have it plastered over her head for hours so she has a big hat with a false bun and fringe for these occasions and jennie got hold of it somehow last week i happened to be there and by george i chevied the beast half over cantonments before she would give it up she's a regular devil i sighed evidently the culprit must be shot she had no friends as i came up to the guardroom however i heard a song being lilted out by a tenor voice into the hot dusty air the refrain of london sounded odd here in the desert on the confines of civilisation dy'sy dy'sy give me yer answer dew i'm half cry'sy all for the love o' yew yes sir reported the sergeant it's dy'sy sure enough he's in agin more often in nor out what for i asked a trifle regretfully for the man nicknamed by his comrades dy'sy from his habit of perpetually warbling that aggravating ditty was rather a favourite of mine he was a perfectly reckless rolling stone a bad shilling of about five and thirty who from the way he had when not on his guard of assimilating drill must have been through it several times but over his past he drew a veil and indeed his present was sufficient for character he had come out with a draft in the cold weather and already his evil influence with the recruits was notorious yet i liked the fellow he was a first class light weight bruiser out and away the best in the regiment i had taken lessons of his and his devil may care defiance had been attractive same as before sir replied the sergeant shindy in number three 'tain't no manner o' use shiftin' 'is room he'd purwurt a sunday school solid truth in every word yet the light blue eyes which met mine had a twinkle in them that softened my heart if you are such a cursed fool i said as sternly as i could you'll come to grief his face took on sublime innocence beg pardin sir but it ralely ain't fair w'en a party is trying to do 'is dooty to 'is parsters an' marsters them young chaps was makin' fun hover your monkey usin' the major's py jammas has a slopper an' i only tole 'm it was kind o' disrespekful like as she meant it hall in k'yindness an' bid 'm hold their jaw that's how the tin dishes got hinjured for he added with great dignity i won't 'ave no slanderin' o' dumb animals as can't speak up for thesselves a gleam of hope shot through me you're fond of animals are you i asked for once candid confidence came to him well i don' know sir he replied but 'twas the loss o' a dorg as fust set me wrong he gave a glance towards the sergeant who was discreetly retiring and then went on i was but a young chap just gone twenty and the dorg was a bull tarrier sir as good as they make 'm s'yme n'yme as your monkey sir jennie we was chums then i got a gel one o' the yaller haired kind sir an' i was a fool about her as young chaps is apt ter be well sir i 'adn't bin just steddy no real 'arm you know but sort o' light like but i settles down an' begins ter screw against gettin' married the yaller haired gel was livin' with me sir so as to save time like but we was sure to get married in church an' go hoff emigrating so soon as i'd got the 'oof an' jennie was to go too for she an' me was chums well sir there was a big black chap coster he was i licked him more nor once for 'angin' round but there females are built that way so it 'appened when i come 'ome one hevening that i found 'er gone an' the 'oof too an' jennie he drew his hand slowly over his mouth jennie had died game sir she 'ad a bit of the big black brute's corduroys betwixt 'er teeth but 'e'd bashed 'er 'ead open with 'is boot there was silence then he went on with a reckless laugh 'tweren't the gel sir there's plenty o' them ter be got yaller hair an' all but jennie an' me had been chums five minutes later the monkey had changed masters to oblige me and save jennie from being shot dy'sy bell had promised to take care of her i'u'd rather 'ave no money sir he said when he appeared to fetch her away and i offered him something towards her keep 'twould only go to the canteen and if i get into trouble oo'd look after 'er 'er i may mention had just bitten his finger through to the bone an action which he dismissed with the remark that females was built that way three days later as i rode past number three barrack i saw jennie cracking nuts on a brand new perch dy'sy it now appeared was quite a smart carpenter and had made it himself in the workshop three days after that again the perch was embellished by a brass chain and dy'sy admitted shamefacedly that he had once been in a foundry so time passed on until it occurred to me that dy'sy had ceased to come into prominence before me as company officer and i questioned the sergeant concerning him the official did not move a muscle number three's has quiet has a orphin asylum now sir as i lies in my bunk i don't 'ear no whisper but it was bedlam broke loose the fust night after jennie come sir i lay low seeing as there never was no use in tryin' to get at the bottom o' that sort o' row in the dark sir an' next morning 'arf the room complained of 'avin' a hunbaptised brute put to bed with 'em the monkey slep' with dy'sy sir so i spoke to 'im an' told 'im i c'u'dn't 'ave no more complaints an' he replied quite civil like as there sh'u'dn't be none an' there wasn't but 'arf the men 'ad black eyes that week sir though 'ow they came by 'm they didn't say i did not enquire it was sufficient for me that number three barrack was rapidly becoming regenerate as i passed one day i heard a voice say now boys i won't 'ave no cuss words they ain't fit for a lydy to hear you don't go so often to the canteen as you used to bell i said to him one day when i found him sitting alone in the verandah nursing jennie who jibbered at me ain't got the money sir he replied cheerfully neringis and sich like is a horful price in this gordforsaken spot an' jennie's been a bit ailin' won't eat nothing else well you'll be getting your stripes soon i expect if you go on as you are doing i remarked he flushed up i 'opes so sir he said modestly jennie 'u'd set store by a striped sleeve females being built that way my prophecy proved correct dy'sy was made a corporal and before long in the border campaign which the cold weather brought us found himself a sergeant and so eventually in charge of a telegraph station on the top of one of the passes to our rear it was an important post to keep open since on the integrity of the wire through a mile or so of singularly difficult country hung the certainty of speedy relief should any kind of disaster overtake our little force which was intimidating the tribes in the valleys beyond and disaster did overtake it chiefly by reason of a terrific snowstorm which swept over it early in february a snowstorm which paralysed progress and made all thoughts turn to the probability of that mile of telegraph wire remaining intact no supplies could of course be sent up so the men in the station must either starve or return if indeed they had not been overwhelmed already the latter seemed the most likely since though the through wire remained open not a signal came from the station an avalanche most likely said the adjutant the station was built i always said in the wrong place what luck the wire isn't damaged as yet it won't be long before it is i'm afraid it was however still going strong when four men one badly frost bitten made their way into camp they had started five they said by sergeant bell's orders after they had with difficulty extricated themselves from the ruins of the house which had been completely smashed up by a tremendous avalanche it was impossible dy'sy had said to keep the post and six men also so he had given them what supplies he could spare the store was luckily uninjured and bidden them take their best chance of safety at once as for his it seemed but slender as i felt when a fortnight later we managed to cut our way through the drifts that lay round the hollow where the station had stood across this hollow the through wire still stretched and quite recently someone had evidently been at work upon it for tools lay on fresh frosted snow but all was still as the dead quiet as the grave we found dy'sy lying on his face in the store many feet below the snow surface the steps cut down to it were worn with the passing of his feet but he did not move when we bent over him something however cuddled close in his arms woke and jibbered at us angrily it was jennie dressed for warmth in every rag of blanketing available she was as fat as a pig and the charcoal embers in the tin can hung round her neck were not yet quite cold but dy'sy was skin and bone yet the irish doctor as he bent hastily to examine him said cheerfully annyhow his love for the baste may have saved his life she's kept his heart warm whatever and she had six weeks afterwards i sat beside him in hospital he showed thin and gaunt still in his grey flannel dressing gown and two fingers were missing on his left hand well i said so they've given you the dsm and a special pension if you want to go he smiled brilliantly don't want to sir jennie she likes the h'army females is built that way and as for t'other 'twas really jennie done it i couldn't take her through the snow she'd 'a' died for sure an' i couldn't leave her so there wasn't no choice a song without words it was in the club that the telegram came and as i sat watching my partner make pie of one of the best bridge hands ever ruined i read it over once or twice and finally when our adversaries had run out handed it over to the culprit as a means of turning my wrath to another subject transferred he commented calmly h'm we shall have to get beveridge to join our game instead my self pity flew for a moment to poor beveridge and i wondered what sort of a temper he had still it isn't a bad place though rather out of the way splendid buck shooting only of course this isn't the time and a very decent house here he giggled well decent isn't perhaps the word to use is it and by jove i'm sorry for you there will be a devil of a mess to set right i expect and anyhow it isn't pleasant to step into another fellow's shoes after that sort of thing i acquiesced that sort of thing was briefly the suicide of a fellow civil servant whom i had known vaguely as the most brilliant man in my year a tall handsome light hearted fellow full of life full of everything apparently likely to make him go up instead of which he had gone down steadily so steadily that at last even a government which prides itself on ignoring breaches of social law had been driven into first banishing him to the charge of a solitary jungle district where there was no world to be scandalised and then with warning him that he must either pull up or send in his papers he chose the latter course decisively sending in his checks to another tribunal he wasn't a bad sort when he first came out continued my partner had in fact distinct glimmerings of sense and to the last he wasn't so to speak a bad officer but the wine and the women well there you are and make the best of it this last might have been meant for the nice hand which he displayed we had cut for partners again with the only result of shifting the deal i took it that way anyhow and said no more there was in fact nothing to be said so when i got home i told the bearer of my transfer and sitting down wrote an effusively cheerful letter to my wife who was in the hills with the babies enlarging on the manifold advantages of my transfer and making much of the fact that though it brought no extra pay it was in a measure promotion then i smoked a pipe feeling virtuous for those two estimable creatures my bearer and my wife invariably do my duty for me in fact i am the happiest man in existence i have told my wife so a hundred times and she believes it firmly the faculty by the way which good women have of believing things that ought to be true is occasionally appalling but is always immensely convenient to their husbands i always wrote her cheerful letters and in return i used to get delightful daily budgets giving me all the wonderful ways and works of the chicks and imploring me to let her know regularly what the cook gave me for dinner and if i ate it also if i were morally sure that the water was boiling for my tea every afternoon as if i was not she would infallibly hand the babies over to hirelings and come down to her ill used hubby such delightful tender womanly budgets were her replies that i swear and declare that had i been asked to read them aloud a lump in my throat would have interfered with my elocution yet i swear and declare also that i would far rather the kettle were not boiling than that any one i cared for should fuss over it and a charcoal brazier on a hot verandah on a sweltering august day but then as my wife is always telling me i have no real sense of duty i wrote her therefore as cheerfully as i could telling her which was true that solitude would be better than bad bridge also that it really was a move nearer to her since in case of emergency i could cut across country by dhoolie to the foot of the hills finally i enlarged on the fact that my successor would take over our house as it stood until her return so that she need not fuss about moving anything as i should do well in my new house which was to remain as it was until my predecessor's unfortunate affairs had gone through the administrator general's office a business as a rule of months i even mentioned the existence of a bechstein grand piano with a hint that if i could get rid of our cottage i might buy it when the sale came on an additional craftiness since my wife loves to think i am allowed to have my own way in everything it makes her more certain that we have won the dunmow flitch of bacon which we undoubtedly have having done my best to set her wifely anxiety at rest i advanced fifty rupees to my bearer in consequence of which we started next day for my new district bag and baggage though the most part of the journey was by train the bearer insisted on buckling a big sword he had picked up somewhere round his capacious middle it decidedly had an effect on the railway coolies about three am we turned out at a roadside station where thanks to that fifty rupees a dak gharri was waiting to convey me the remaining twenty miles i was very sleepy and as i tumbled into my new conveyance i got a vague impression of a howling wilderness of sand tufted with tiger grass desolate utterly so falling asleep again and not waking until in the darkness i tumbled out this time into a large empty room with a tiny camp bed set in its midst i carried on as it were the impression of desert surrounding me but not for long the next day would i suspected be a trifle trying since my unfortunate predecessor's methods of business would scarcely be conducive to a mechanical taking over charge of his office so i was soon asleep without even realising that probably i was sleeping where he had lain dead but a day or two before when i opened my eyes next morning i felt a curious content and surprise the room was bare in the extreme the camp bed on which i lay a deck chair the cover of a travelling chest of drawers doing duty as a wardrobe the top of a travelling bath doing ditto as a table a bit of looking glass hung above it by a string these were its furniture the furniture of the light hearted boy who had come out in the same year as i had with an odd guilty remorse i remembered that i had long since exchanged these simple satisfactions of youth for more luxurious methods an unpaid bill of maple's indeed flashed to my mind as looking round the walls which were hung with full sized photographs and copies of the great masters i realised that my predecessor had spent his spare cash in a different fashion to what i had very different indeed my remorse vanished in contempt as opening one of the drawers a very strong scent of sandal wood made itself perceptible and in one corner i saw a trumpery piece of native jewellery a certain anger took possession of me then as i looked up into the eyes of the sistine madonna which hung in a conspicuous place and i felt virtuous in realising that after all it was a natural refinement and pure love of order and beauty which lay at the bottom of our civilised cult of comfortableness so thinking i passed out on to the verandah still with last night's impression on me that i was in a howling desert what i saw therefore gave me a shock for here was a garden such as i had never seen neither english nor indian yet reminiscent of both in its wide sweeps of well kept lawns its dense thickets of flowering shrubs both at this break in the rainy season looking their best it took me a moment however to realise what it was which gave this garden its curious distinction from other gardens there was no path in it though where i stood must once have been the front door since a huge pillared porch jutted beyond the verandah the grass swept right up to the very house it had a curious untrodden look a huge leaved waxen flowered beaumontia almost covered the porch with its cold white scentless blossoms and between the pillars eucharis lilies rose above a marvellous mass of maidenhair the delicate greenery the chill whiteness made me think involuntarily of the newly dead and had i had on my hat i felt as if i should have removed it as it was i stepped with a slight shiver beyond the porch into the sunlight the chilliness was gone in a moment though the cloistered air remained due to the great tamarind trees which on all sides shut out the world shut in the flowers the birds too i never saw so many a golden oriole was challenging the sun with its full throated call from the bronze rain shoots of the huge banyan tree which filled up one corner and there were at least a dozen ruby throated humming birds among the hibiscus flowers those strangely mutable flowers white in the dawn which blush into a crimson death before sunset the banyan tree promising a well in its shade and the well promising the possibility of a gardener whom i could question for i was beset by curiosity i strolled over to it and found what i wanted a very old wizened man pretending to weed an offensive patch of yellow african marigolds which was carefully hidden away behind a henna hedge yes he replied with the tearless regret one often hears in native voices the dead huzoor had been very fond of his garden in a way here the regret became personal and aggrieved he had never sent for european seeds so of course it had been impossible even for the most skilful of malas to make it into a real garden but if the new huzoor would employ this slave who had many certificates here the usual bundle was drawn out from some mysterious hiding place mysterious because he was more than half naked he would make proper paths and rippin' beds and set them ablaze with floccus and soot ullians and gerabians and he was beginning to reel off a seedsman's catalogue when i pulled him up by pointing to the marigolds he pursed up his lips in pious horror oh no there would be no more gooljafari or genda grown in that garden they had been for the other folk who of course would no longer the mixture of cunning question and scandalised propriety on the old humbug's face made me mentally resolve that he should no longer either in fact before my wife and the bairns came down i must have the whole place cleared and fumigated but the garden no it must not be touched i had my breakfast in a huge dark central room which was absolutely bare save for a ricketty table and two chairs there were not even any photographs on the walls it was so dark that they could not have been seen they found the huzoor lying there at the door said my bearer calmly after apologising profusely for an oversight in the matter of marmalade which he trusted might be forgotten and not reported to the memsahib he had been dead a long time for he had paid off all the servants and sent away the other people and the children on the evening before saying he was going on a journey his bearer waited for him at the station with his baggage only he never came nor his horse either it was the office which found him when it came for signature of papers next day and there was nothing disturbed only the huzoor lying where they could see him easily from the front door and the horse comfortable in its stall with plenty of grass he was always thoughtful to the poor was the sahib and never gave trouble to others at least so his servants say but what can they know poor mean creatures who do not even know when a kettle boils i let him talk for somehow i did not wish to think in much the same mood i went doggedly through my day's work in taking over charge and reducing chaos to order or rather conventional order for through all the disgraceful neglect of ordinary routine ran the unmistakable thread of one man's control and of a strong man at that even in its favouritism its flagrant derelictions from the ordinary conception of a magistrate's duty as i got into my dogcart to come home an orderly came forward with a doubtful air carrying a small bag such as natives use as a purse it was the custom he began but by this time i felt that i must return to a right judgment of things so i purposely lost my temper and let it be known that all old customs were to be abolished it was only the pennies for the children on fridays stuttered the orderly the huzoor used always to give them i drove off thinking that perhaps my predecessor might have been wise in choosing a higher tribunal my bearer however who as usual stood in the verandah to receive my hat had no doubts in the totality of his blame he was full of virtuous activities order in some measure had been restored certain screens of grass which had been removed against a time when the mem might find them useful in the poultry yard and the outhouses having been finally cleared by the aid of the police of various pensioners and idle folk who wept profusely had been duly distributed among the servants he himself having taken one with a women's enclosure which would be the cause of great comfort i bid him take what he liked and for the first time went into the drawing room where he said my tea awaited me i shall never forget my first look at that room with its five straight undraped windows set in a row round one slightly curved wall the others bare save for the shadows which were fast creeping to obliterate even the bareness the windows were mere oblongs of dim light stretching up into the lofty roof and that shadow looming in one shadowy corner across a vast expanse of shadowy matting must be the bechstein piano i made a move towards it and stumbled against my own tea table a highly ornate sham oriental carved thing which the bearer by my wife's orders carried about with him religiously and at the same time the bearer himself entered with the reading lamp without which so i am told i cannot exist i gave up the bechstein therefore for a time and had caviare sandwiches with my tea instead i do not know why my wife would have said because the water was not boiling but i did not enjoy my tea the pity of all things in this incomprehensible world struck me with a vague anger i sat wondering if after all a higher tribunal good heavens what was that someone was playing on the bechstein i did not turn i sat staring at those five solemn oblongs of the glimmering windows showing lighter and lighter as the shadows deepened in the big bare room it was walther's song out of tannhauser the song of divine love the bearer said i was asleep when he came to tell me it was time to dress for dinner perhaps i was for sound sleep brings perfect peace and rest and that had come to me with the music which had come out of the windows i have a dim recollection that the khansaman apologised because the soup was not clear and that the bearer explained that a wire mattress had not arrived owing to the breaking down of a bullock cart but i know that i sat up till all hours of the night in the dark hoping to hear the bechstein again but it was silent as the grave perhaps at dusk i might hear it once more i raced off to the office early in order to be home in time and was almost glad of a few flagrant derelictions of duty cropping up to keep my moral nature from too much sympathy yet even so as i drove home i put my hand in my pocket and drew out a handful of coppers for a group of children i passed on the road i could not help it when i remembered a certain paper i had sent up to the administrator general that day showing the way in which a certain sinner had spent his last pay tea is ready in the drawing room said the bearer and even in my preoccupation i thought there was something odd in his voice but a look into the big bare room was sufficient i shouldn't have known it women have such a way of altering the whole character of a house by a yellow silk bow she had taken the little camp bed and made a couch out of it with cushions and phulkarees the five fateful windows like the five senses looking out on the garden of the soul were tucked and festooned and through one of them came the familiar sound of a pair of bellows and then a still more familiar exclamation there that's really boiling at last the next instant my wife was in my arms tearful tender triumphant cheerful letters were all very well but she knew so she had just left the babies in charge of some super excellent creature and run away down to see i was really comfortable and after all she said nodding her head as she poured out the tea it is as well i did come for really there seems to be nothing in the house except the bechstein i looked over to it dully and noticed that it was now ornamented by my photograph in a filigree frame yes i said i hope i kept some of the regret out of my voice only the bechstein and as we sat and talked of the children and our own happiness and the seeds we were going to sow in the garden the five windows grew lighter as the shadows deepened but the spirit of the room was silent segregation i've got the plague sir upon my sam i 'ave i'll show yer the spot sir same as they 'ad in w'en the tower o' london was burnt down an' sir christopher wren built st paul's so 'elp me gawd the speaker was a plausible loafer of the usual type he was dressed in white or what had once been white raiment a gilt button or two hung round the coat mute testimony to its having once belonged to a man who did some work of some kind for the government he was not a eurasian that you could see by the line of white on his forehead above the tan as he stood apologetically in the court room holding his helmet before him with both hands as if he meant to offer it up as a bribe it was certainly the most valuable thing about him for it had a wadded quilted cover and looked what the rest of him did not respectable the plague echoed the magistrate i am the magistrate nonsense man you're drunk that's what's the matter with you inspector remove that man put him into the lock up if he gives trouble the inspector approached but the loafer stood his ground not without quiet dignity the dignity that comes to some people in the first stage of intoxication excuse of me sir he said but i ain't going to make myself a noosance to nobody that's w'y i came 'ere that's w'y i spent my last bloomin' hart hanner eight annas in takin' a ticca ghari hired carriage to the 'orspitals every one of 'em so as there might be no infections bless your 'art i don't want to do no 'arm to anyone i wants to be seggergated that's all afore i does any the magistrate smiled faintly there was something likeable in the man's face so you've been to the hospitals have you what did the doctors say same as you sir he replied cheerfully as i was drunk but if i am job charnock that's me sir never got real on afore with one glass o' harrack an' beastly bad stuff it was too smelt like a dead dorg an' tasted like a tannery perhaps the name job charnock awoke memories of the founder of calcutta who before his fortunes were made must have been more or less of a friendless wanderer in an eastern land perhaps it was because the magistrate was waiting for a file to be brought from the record office but the spirit of cross examination entered into him one glass of arrak is that all you've had the loafer paused an expression of the utmost candour came to his face all i've 'ad to day sir s'elp me 'cos i 'adn't a pice more left ter buy a bit o' food with only the hart hanner i spent christian like on a ticca ghari ter try an' get seggergated afore it was too late an' they said i was drunk the mournful cadence of his voice was irresistible chaprassi take that man to the serai and tell the darogah to give him some breakfast i'll pay for it now you go quietly my man and sleep it off you'll have got rid of the plague by morning the file had come in from the record office i was immersed in the endless hopeless attempt to drag truth from the bottom of the well in a land suit so i thought no more of job charnock until i met the civil surgeon at tennis in the evening yes he replied to my query segregation was on his rounds again this morning you're new but he is a regular institution here he gets the funks on board generally about a month after a bout and comes to every one of us in turn to be segregated i think he is a bit looney on the plague has a real phoby about it he'll get it i expect some day from sheer fright but there's none about at present the something likeable in the man's face however returned to memory with the obvious fact that he had appeared chiefly concerned to do no 'arm to anyone so the next morning having ten minutes to spare on my way from the city i called in at the serai it was like all other serais a dreary cloistered square deserted absolutely between five am until eight pm that is to say the hours during which travellers are on the road now close on nine o'clock only the muck of last night's bivouac remained a sweeper with a broom and a basket was busy removing some of the more salient rubbishes otherwise all was still as the grave but seated on a rush stool in one of the little octagonal turret rooms which built on either side of the gateway are reserved for european wayfarers i found job charnock he had evidently paid a visit to the well for he looked cleaner and was distinctly sober but he was more voluble than ever i give 'arf the breakfast you stood me away to the sweeper sir he said an' 'e brought me some omum water as cured me in a jiffy that's all i was wantin' sir an' none o' them doctors could spare me 'arf a pint it seems strange don't it sir and ter think the 'arm as i might do going about with the plague spot under my harm as it's all writ truthful in that book by mr 'arrison hainsworth esquire 'ave you read it sir he asked blandly i assured him i had told him he was a fool advised him to go north to the new railway to find work gave him five rupees to find his way there it was indiscreet and quite contrary to the rules of the charity organisation society but as i have said something in the man's face appealed to me thereafter he passed from my memory under the usual pressure of work and worry which is the lot of an indian official it was in the middle of the hot weather when the civil surgeon rushed into me at my office with a telegram in his hand will you arrange with spiller for my work he said excitedly i must be off at once read that you see i gave the assistant surgeon at the bimariwallah dispensary a few days' leave off my own bat and there's only a dresser in charge so there will be the devil of a row if anything goes wrong the telegram read as follows outbreaks of much plague amongst european gentlemen here please arrange for supplies of sufficient brandy but there are no europeans at bimariwallah i began i know that broke in the doctor and of course brandy isn't the right treatment but that's just where it is the fool of a dresser doesn't know english doesn't know anything so i'm bound to go well if you'll curb your impatience for two hours till i've finished this case i'll motor you so far down the trunk road and dak you on i have an executive municipal council to morrow morning at raipur and it's all on the way there had been a shower of rain an advance scout of the coming monsoon to spy out the dryness of the land so our spin of thirty miles down the road was pleasant enough though the great wains of corn and straw that still defy the network of railways which has immeshed india had possession of a large portion of the highway but to my mind there is always something satisfactory in finding that no amount of preliminary hooting changes the path of the slow moving wheels and that in the end even a siddeley wolsey car must either hold up until comprehension comes to the carter who moves as slowly as the wheels or else pass by on a side walking it seems to presage safety to give assurance that india will not after all run off the rails the buggy and horse were waiting at the cross roads and it only needed a detour of three miles to drop the doctor at the very door of the dispensary feeling some curiosity as to what was really the matter i withstood his prayer to be set down and allowed to make his way on foot i was glad i did for the first glimpse i had of the dispensary compound assured me that something very unusual was taking place to begin with a long low reed shed such as is used in cholera epidemics had been hastily run up on the opposite side of the road and in it were to be seen patients lying in their beds or out of them posts each carrying a yellow streamer were set up every ten yards around the compound itself and at each gate stood a village watchman complete with speared staff and bells as we drove up the dresser pallid of face but full of a vast importance rushed out from a small hut which had been erected inside many many thanks to supreme almighty he ejaculated then added with distinct complacency you will find all things necessarily in order sir segregationalism is being much carried out patient having passed through p neumonic deliriums is now comatic and in articulo mortis i followed the doctor who looked as well he might completely bewildered the dispensary was cleared out saucers of disinfectants positively littered the ground white sheets saturated with the same hung at every door the smell of them stank in the nostrils and as i followed a dank disagreeable wet flap from one of them on my cheek made me shiver but the sight which met my eyes in the central room set me literally shaking with laughter it was so inexpressibly comic propped high on pillows his face placid composed lay job charnock snoring contentedly while an empty brandy bottle beside him on the bed showed one cause at least of his somnolence there he lay peaceful as a baby while the doctor frowning at my inopportune laughter turned angrily to the dresser you cursed fool the man's drunk what the deuce do you mean by being such an ass then the comic side of the situation took him also and he joined me in my merriment by jove he chortled segregation has done it this time there was no use attempting to awaken him for the moment so the doctor turned on the dresser again how had it come about how had he allowed himself to be so imposed upon it was quite simple even when clothed in the babu's best middel fail english segregation had come had seen had conquered he had declared himself sick of the plague and defied the dresser to deny it he had thereupon taken possession of the dispensary ordered the erection of the temporary sheds by enforced labour cleared out the patients used up all the disinfectants and had then but not till then taken to his bed and drunk all the brandy so cometic symptoms supervening and supplies of brandy exhausting the dresser had appealed through authentic sources for aid of the almighty anyway by jove said the doctor as he noted all the arrangements i couldn't have done it better myself he has even he pointed to a row of men evidently of the semi savage sansiya race who were squatting in front of the village accountant's house set them to killing rats and in truth each of these hardy hunters bore a bamboo on which were strung the dead bodies of many rodents young and old undoubtedly job charnock had a genius for organisation and with a mournful prescience of what would be the answer i asked the nearest sansi what he was to get for his rats it was half the government rate but the broad grin on the man's face showed him satisfied yes job charnock had the gift of the empire builder look here i said to the doctor that man hasn't committed an indictable offence he diagnosed his complaint as plague that is not indictable he went to your department for advice and got confirmation of his suspicions that was not his fault and all he's done since then is what ought to have been done under the circumstances except the brandy expostulated the doctor brandy is not in the dietary for plague and he's drunk up the year's supply that amounts to stealing pardon me you can have the dresser up for misuse of supplies if you like i said stoutly but every drop of that brandy was drunk out of one of your blessed measuring glasses i pointed to the inverted crystal cone with cabalistic signs on it which lay beside the bottle he couldn't have taken more than an ounce at a time and that to a man of his habits is strictly a medicinal dose and for that your dresser is responsible no send him in to me when he sobers i'll settle him up i did so to the best of my ability but there was no question that job charnock was as the doctor had said a bit looney at times especially when he had any drink on board though no one could have called him a habitual drunkard still there was little use in getting him employment he always drifted out of it again then for a while he would disappear only to return after a few months with his usual i don't want to do no 'arm to anyone i wants to be seggergated for i've got the plague so 'elp me gawd i 'ave he was always then at the last point of destitution more than once even the hart banner for the ticca ghari was not his and he would come skulking into the office almost starving and barefoot for he looked on me as a friend in need and indeed i used sometimes to wonder if hunger were not as much responsible for the recurrence of his delusion as drink then i was transferred to rajputana and apparently left job charnock behind me until one hot weather morning when in order to catch a train i was galloping across a short cut of the wild bar land which lay between the railway and the out of the way place where i was stationed it is a strange desert this bar land of wild caper bushes stunted jund trees and hard resilient limestone soil baked by the sun to whiteness a horse's hoofs resounds over it for miles but a man if he left visible path might without the aid of the sun lose his way in it almost any moment even i had to glance at the whereabouts of that luminary when a few moment's abstraction caused me to divert my eye from the faint traces of previous passages which was all there was of path as i did so my eye was caught by something curious in the gnarled branches of a jund tree some fifty yards further away it looked like a red cross instinctively i rode towards it it was a red cross two strips of red turkey cotton had been carefully tied crosswise between the branches what did it mean and why had that shallow trench a mere scraping on the hard soil been traced between that tree and the next and yes that was another red cross in its branches also i rode on only to find that here again the trench trended at right angles towards a further tree where yet another red cross showed the grey green leafless triangle of caper bushes all set with tiny coral bud flowers had so far prevented my seeing anything within the traced square but now i came upon a definite opening across it however from bush to bush stretched a pair of men's braces and pinned to this was a bit of paper on which something was written in what looked suspiciously like blood i jumped off my horse and bent to look at it though written in large characters it was barely decipherable and seemed to have been drawn with difficulty by a pointed stick this much i could read trespussers will be persecuted no thoroughfare case of plague within s'elp me gawd segregation by all that was holy i tied my horse to the inarched root of a jund tree set aside the braces and made my way through the bushes it was quite a comfortable secluded spot the grey green set with scarlet brocade of the caper bushes formed a curtain round it the floor of it was hard and white as marble but in the middle of the little open space there was as one sees so often in this bar land a tiny hillock of sand that had been whirled thither and left by the wild dust storms which sweep over the rajputana desert and on this sand job charnock lay his face turned up to the sky he cannot have been dead long for his body was untouched by wild birds or beasts but he was quite dead perhaps though the sleeves of his turkey red shirt the rest of it having evidently gone to the making of crosses which were hung on sticks set in the sand at his head and his feet might so far have frightened away the animals they might have been put there for the purpose on the other hand they might have been meant as a last danger signal not to prevent harm being done to him but to prevent him from 'arming anybody his bare body showed terribly emaciated but his face was calm it almost had a smile upon it had he really died of the plague or in coming it might be to see me had he lost his way as a stranger might well do in the pathless bar and fallen a victim to starvation and had the recurrence of hunger brought on his curious hallucination once more who could say plague was very prevalent it might be one it might be the other i stood looking at the peaceful face for a minute or two then i made up my mind he should have his wish no one this time should interfere with his desire to do no 'arm to nobody so covering the body for the time with the doubled blanket i always use as a saddle cloth i rode off to the nearest village some six miles off and returned with two men pickaxes and shovels it took some time to dig a grave in that hard white soil but when the coolies had done patting down the dry dust and limestone nodules into the long mound of earth which is the outward sign that a human body lies beneath i lingered to peg one of the red crosses over it so he found segregation at last there was no more fear of his doing any harm to anyone slave of the court i sate in the sunshine of delhi as it blazed down upon the trellised tombs of a dead dynasty i was very tired as police officers are apt to be when crowned heads travel in india but my particular monarch was away from my jurisdiction laying foundation stones elsewhere so i had an off four and twenty hours not knowing delhi as it should be known i utilised my holiday for slow solitary silent sight seeing in the course of which i had driven out to the kutb minar had bidden the carriage return to await me by humayon's tomb so with lunch in my pocket had set out systematically to reconstruct old india out of the crowding ruins it is a fascinating occupation but one provocative of dreams and as i rested idly smoking in the shade of a gnarled jhund tree i was more than half asleep around me lay the graves of kings who had once ruled in the flesh i had been trying as it were to live their lives to see with their eyes and the conclusion had been forced in upon me that though the monarchy had changed and my particular crowned head was certainly not to pattern of the old indian autocrat the country and the people had altered but little for instance the pageant through the city streets of a few days past with the brazen sunlight setting silks and satins aflame with vivid colours and painting every shadow dark with the purple gloom of night was as it were of all time the faces of the crowd through which it cleft its way were in type in character permanent i closed my eyes to visualize how the dapper viceroy would have looked had he been scattering golden pistachios silver almonds and enamelled rose leaves amongst the lieges instead of sitting his horse purposefully like an ill fitting statue and inwardly rehearsing the detail of up to date benefits he had to proclaim at the end of his ride were they i wondered more satisfactory than the older largesse when i opened my eyes i saw a naked old man squatted forlornly among the latticed graves he held a flat basket a gardener's basket between his knees it contained only one compact posy of closely crushed flowers the gul this and gul that beloved of natives but i saw that a similar bunch had been laid on several of the tombs the man however was palpably not a gardener no one of indian experience who on real hot weather evenings had wandered round his back premises could have hesitated as to vocation either as chef or scullion the figure belonged to the cook room there was that in its very nakedness save for a tight wound waist cloth that in the very polish of the close shaved head which was quaintly reminiscent of full starched raiment and high piled turban now i always speak to a native when i get him alone it is a useful habit for a police officer so i said casually on what tomb friend are you going to put that bunch the old figure turned profuse of course in salaam it showed a wrinkled toothless face overlaid with the smiles and subtlety of centuries of service but its reply was dazed forlorn this slave of the court it mumbled seeks for a tomb that was but is not god send some miscreant hath not taken the marble slab thereof for his idolatrous curry stone lo i can find it nowhere and the inscription thereof is lost is lost a world of angry apprehension crept into the tired blear old eyes the tired old hand shook visibly what inscription i asked idly my inscription protector of the poor came the tired old voice yea whatever this slave of the court said the writer abd un nubbi copied it i sate up more alert vaguely reminiscent of something i had seen lately what was it about i queried this time curiously about the heaven nestled kings the slave of the court served came the reply less wearily and as if some stored memory cylinder had been set going by keywords the voice went on gaining strength this old slave of the court does not feel any shame in serving the kings and the nobles this old slave of the court mahmud supplicates god that the name of the heaven nestled emperor humayon and the heaven nestled emperor akbar may be perpetuated for all time lo may they have been given the robe of paradise this old slave of the court honoured by the earth cherished emperor jahangir was told 'you have grown old serve in the tomb of the heaven nestled one at delhi' humbly says mahmud old slave of the court he has come nigh to ninety years he has come nigh his end he has passed his life in luxury and ease through the kindness of kings oh mahmud no desire is left unfulfilled of giving and taking buying and selling bargainings in the bazaar all is done with now lo in this seat of delhi the rulers and the landholders the elders and the neighbours should entrust this tomb and shrine of which the total amount of expenses including all necessary articles and allowances was tankas to those who are my heirs and who deserve to possess it as it was built with my honestly earned money the long drawn out quaintly ungrammatical persian phrases ceased in a melancholy refrain but it has gone huzoor someone has taken away my tombstone i knew now what he was talking about knew why that faint message of memory had come to me i had seen this inscription or something like it in the delhi museum on a square slab of white marble which the catalogue said had been found amongst some ruins not far from where we were sitting i looked at the old man though he himself was well on in years the impossibility of his words made me pass over major points to cavil at minor ones my tombstone i echoed i suppose you mean this king's cook was a forbear of yours you come of a servant family i expect ah prince of personalities i gave him the full title of the highest domestic office with intent it had a marvellous effect his bowed back straightened itself he seemed to sit resplendent in gold laced coat and badge wound turban the huzoor speaks truth he said with perfectly blatant dignity since the beginning of time my people have served kings and sahibs the last was a palpable concession to the alien and i could not help smiling but the old man despite his toothless wrinkled wagging head was no subject for smiles he sate there transfigured his face shiny an apotheosis of what folk nowadays call servility you felt it in the warm scented sunshine an atmosphere of dutiful devotion that brought a kindly interest to my heart it hasn't been taken as a curry stone i said gravely it is quite safe i saw it yesterday in the wonder house and then i remembered that my crowned head had paused over it to look and smile yes prince of personalities i went on there it is a marble slab with an inscription so i went on to tell him what had occurred he sate and listened gravely reverently and when i had finished he rose i knew he would and salaamed down to the ground this poor preparer of plates is proud still to serve majesty may the earth cherish the wise king long may heaven nestle him when the time comes for soul to separate from body as i looked into the blazing sunshine at the old naked bald headed figure i swear it seemed to me clothed upon with all the liveries of all those centuries of service lo he went on let the tombstone remain in the wonder house where it hath been honoured by the eye glances of kings and as for the noble huzoor who hath relieved this poor slave of the court's mind concerning curry stones he paused took up the remaining posy from his basket and held it out to me between deferential palms it is all i have huzoor but it is sweet he said simply and i have asked so many before and none could tell me in sudden impulse i took it i'll tell you what i'll do prince of personalities i said half in jest i'll stop at the wonder house on my way home and put it on the tombstone will that satisfy you once again he salaamed to the ground the gratitude of this old slave of the court will go with the huzoor all his days i left him salaaming still among the graves as i drove back i regretted not having lingered to pick his brains concerning those centuries of his ancestors' service good stories must have been handed down as heirlooms one curious as i was of the past might have heard much of interest but holiday was over my crowned head had returned making me responsible in addition fate was unkind my major domo on whose care during those strenuous days when meals were oft deferred i was entirely dependent fell sick and had to go to hospital not however before he had in kindly indian fashion found me a substitute everyone who has been in india knows the type of professional cook room substitute they are to be seen sometimes in old dak bungalows survivals still of the patronage of other days when such posts were the recognised superannuation pensions for civilians' servants and this substitute of mine i call them scapegoats as a rule since all the subsequent sins of omission or commission in the back purlieus are invariably laid to their charge differed in no way from the type he was rather more aggressive in starch than most he had the biggest of white turbans and the forward bow of his arched back was a little more accentuated than usual by folds on folds of white bandaging until he looked as if he were wearing an extra sized new whited motor tyre round his waist but his scanty beard was purple black and his eyes were brightened to youth with beautiful rims of antimony altogether he looked his part to perfection and for a wonder performed it also my table servant admitted at once that he was a master artificer and i personally confessed that never had i had such appetising dinners most of these substitutes have old world dishes at their fingers' ends dishes with strange names which philology can trace back to french and portuguese origin but this old man might have come from a parisian restaurant this slave belongs to a family of cooks he said calmly when i questioned him as to where he had learnt to make petits timbales de foie gras a la belle eugenie therefore the wisdom of all the ages is at his disposal when a slave's mind is set on serving his master nothing is impossible and nothing seemed to be my inspector general was a gourmet he breakfasted with me in camp one morning and after that it is surprising how often his meal times tallied with mine so in the course of a few days the fame of my cook became noised abroad especially when the crowned head started on a shooting tour and had to leave his french chef behind him the latter not feeling equal to camp fires then the substitute came to the fore and once or twice when i had the honour of dining at the royal table i noticed dishes which i could have sworn my man had prepared knowing the curious bond of brotherhood which exists in india between one cook room and another i knew this was quite possible we had some hard marching and at the end of a week i noticed that my substitute was palpably older the surma had worn off his eyes there was a fringe of grey beard above the purple black yet still he looked magnificently starched as he stood behind my chair on the frequent occasions when the suite messed with royalty then we arrived at a hill rajah ship where there had been some trouble during a long minority between palace women and a council of regency neither being oversatisfied with the resident but our royal visit was to inaugurate a new regime under a new young rajah and great were to be the rejoicings amongst other things a state dinner in the palace we were a bit late coming in from a shoot after black partridge and i had a good many preparations to make as i was in police charge so that it was almost dark ere i returned to my tent to dress for dinner to my surprise i found the substitute immaculate one inside he was immaculate as ever but he looked old and frail and worn still it needed one of those sudden enlargements of personality which are so puzzling to make the shadows of the tent bring what the light of day had denied to me recognition of the old man i had met amongst the latticed tombs of kings the man who had lost his tombstone you old scoundrel i said why didn't you tell me before who you were he salaamed a trifle furtively as he replied it is nothing to the master who his servant is so that the servant be faithful and i am that my gratitude is bound to the huzoor for ever and ever so i came to ask what tasters have been appointed for the earth cherished one this evening tasters i echoed what the deuce do you mean tasters then it flashed upon me that he was alluding to the old tasters for poison and i looked at him curiously in the semi darkness he seemed to have shrunken to be inconceivably old and frail so i went on more kindly there's no need for them nowadays old man they belong to the past the king god bless him is safe from that sort of thing thank heaven i was throwing off my shooting togs vigorously and the answer came out of the corner of the tent as it were vaguely so said firdoos makani the sainted babar in paradise yet he had to live a full month on lily leaves and the heaven nestled one the emperor humayon was also look here old chap i said divided between haste and the desire to tap these old stories you shall tell me all that to morrow at present i must be off to the palace to see all is right then i laughed other days other manners ah descendant of mahmud the king's cook we have to look after bombs not poisons nowadays the answer came faintly to me the wickedness of men's hearts is ever the same huzoor i do not think i ever saw a prettier entertainment the long eyed lazy looking young rajah must have had the blood of past sybarites in his veins for he had enhanced oriental splendour with western refinement to perfection having seen by a glance that all my detectives were in their places knowing also the infinite precautions which had been secretly taken on all sides and feeling fairly secure of the young ruler's personal loyalty i felt i might enjoy myself and i did the champagne was iced to perfection the illuminations glimmered softly away into the gloom of the lake a band of native musicians beautifully trained discoursed plaintive love songs on native instruments deftly entuned to almost western modulations the dinner was super excellent a combination of eastern and western delicacies and there was not one single hitch in the arrangements except for a slight contretemps due apparently to short sightedness on the part of my venerable scapegoat he collided with the state servant who was handing a special tray of curried koftahs to the crowned head with the result that the crowned head did not even get a taste of it but the accident only raised a moment's laugh the debris was cleared away in a twinkling and i caught sight of the offender's scared protesting face as he was hustled away from further mischief after dinner we had a really excellent pantomime in dumb show by native actors so it was past midnight ere i returned to my tent i found my chief inspector a man i could really trust a man whose wide experience was of infinite use to me standing outside a report huzoor he said briefly and i passed into the office he looked all round carefully closed the screens and then began in a low voice huzoor when your honour's servant upset the state servant and his dish i was close by there was a look on your honour's servant's face i did not understand they scrambled instantly for the koftahs scrambled hastily to pick them up but i got one huzoor i gave it to a dog and huzoor the dog is dead i could scarcely speak dead ye gods then i remembered that the dog would be needful evidence and said at once where is the body bring it here but if there had been a conspiracy to poison the conspirators had been too quick for us the corpus delicti was not where it had been left neither was the substitute to be found the other servants reported that overcome with shame at his unpardonable offence in depriving an earth cherished one of his victuals he had retired into the wilderness whence he never returned my inspector general used to bewail the petits timbales de foie gras a la belle eugenie but i have never ceased to wonder and every time i go to delhi i go to the wonder house and lay a posy on the tombstone of mahmud the old slave of the court the gratitude was to be for ever and ever so there is time for more yet footnotes footnote ganesh is the indian god of wisdom he is always portrayed with the head of an elephant footnote old woman

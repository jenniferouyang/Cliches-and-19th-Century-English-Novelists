beginning both are lost in thee no trace of them in thy eternal realm my words are lamemy tongue a stony tract slow wings my souland wide is the expanse confused my thoughtsthis thy best praise in ecstasy i see thee face to face abul faiz poetlaureate at the court of akbar the bird of the morning only knoweth the worth of the book of the rose for not every one who readeth the page understandeth the meaninghafiz preface the fiction which resembles truth is better than the truth which is dissevered from the imagination said the persian poet nizami in the year it remains true however today so i give no excuse for this book it is not one which will appeal to the man in the street nevertheless i make the attempt to give the character and the times of the prince of dreamers with a glad heart it is as well that the twentieth century of the west should know something of the sixteenth century in the east so many of my dramatis personae once lived in the flesh and spoke many of the words imputed to them in the following pages that it will be shorter to designate those who are purely imaginary puppets to begin with mirza ibrahim and khodadad for obvious reasons it is always safer in historical novels to draw the outandout villains with imagination the death of the latter however together with the curious privileges of the tarkhans are part of the truth which is stranger than fiction for atma devi i have also no warranty indian history does not concern itself with womenkind but dear auntie rosebodys memoirs have supplied me with my sketch of the beneficent ladies while of course the story of mihrunnissa who in long afteryears did under the name of nurjahan become prince salims wife and as such did undoubtedly add to the honour and glory of his reign as jahangir is purely historical even to the chance meeting in the paradise bazaar footnote memoirs of gulbadan begum payandar khan the wayfarer is so far possible that the heir to the throne of sinde who bore that name suddenly lost his senses in consequence of some direful tragedy disappeared into the desert and was no more heard of the crediting of him with hypnotic powers is offered as an explanation of many marvels which are constantly cropping up in indian story and legend it has been suggested to me that for those to whom the word mogul is mixed up with tobacconists shops and packs of cards a brief outline of the dynasty called by that name might be advisable it was founded then by one babar poet knighterrant perfect lover who is without doubt the most charming figure in all history he sacrificed his life in for his son humayon that most unfortunate of kingly adventurers from whose opiumsoddened hands the thirteenyearold boy akbar took an uncertain sceptre in him the glory of the moguls culminated after him three more kings were worthy of the title great and then by slow degrees the dynasty dwindled down to one bahadur shah a feeble old man who after defying us at delhi died miserably in exile akbar was cotemporary of queen elizabeth and his rightful place is among the great company of dreamersshakespeare raphael drake galileo michelangelo cervantes and half a hundred otherswho in the sixteenth century arose and god alone knows why or whence to place the whole world spiritual and temporal under the sway of imagination for the time i have chosen as my period in akbars life that time of glorious peace before the abandonment of the city of victory fatehpur sikri which he had built to commemorate the birth of his son the reason for this abandonment is unknown though scarcity of water was certainly one of the factors in it one thing is clear the step must have meant much to akbar must have involved the giving up of many cherished dreams and it is equally clear that his whole policy changed from the day he left what was the embodiment of his own personal pride his own personal outlook on the future evidently he felt himself faced by some necessity for supreme choice and having made it he kept to the course he had chosen undeviatingly i have presumed to find this necessity in the bitter disappointment caused to him by his sons this at any rate is history and with a man of akbars temperament it is impossible to overestimate the effect of knowing that his natural heirs were unworthy incapable indeed of carrying on his dream of empire whether the diamond which plays its part in these pages is the one now called the kohinur or whether it was the stone afterward known as the great mogul or whether it was yet a third one who can say the history of oriental gems is often too mysterious even for fiction but there is a legend that akbar possessed such a lucky stone and it is certain that william leedes remained to cut gems in the imperial court when his companions john newbery and ralph fitch left it finally if competent critics feel inclined to cavil at the extraordinary aloofness of akbar from his surroundings i can only bid them remember that he was literally centuries ahead of his time and assert that in this very aloofness lies the only claim of any soul to be remembered above its fellows the two friends whom he chose to be friendsout of the millions of men he governedfittingly go down with him through those centuries a trio akbar the dreamer birbal the doubter abulfazl the doer who between them made of the great mogul a king of kings a prince of dreams a prince of dreams chapter i what know ye of the wearer ye who know the dress right well tis the letterwriter only can the letters purport tell saadi hush the king listens the sudden sonorous voice of the courtusher echoed over the crowd and there was instant silence the multitude sank seated on the ground where it had been standing and so disclosed to view the rosered palaces of fatehpur sikri the city of victory rising from the roseset gardens where the silvery fountains sprang from the rosered earth into the deep blue of the sky akbar the king showed also seated on a low marble cushioncovered pedestal beneath a group of palms he was a man between the forties and the fifties with no trace of the passing years in form or feature save in the transverse lines of thought upon his forehead for the rest his handsome aquiline face with its dreamy yet fireful eyes and firm mouth held just the promise of contradiction which is often the attribute of genius so as he sate listening a woman sang she stood tall supple looking in the intensity of her crimsonscarlet dress like a pomegranate blossom almost like a bloodstain amongst the white robes of her fellow musicians the face of one of these fine careworn stood out clearcut as a cameo against the glowing colour of her drapery and the arched bow of his rebeck swayed rhythmic ally as the high fretful notes followed the trilling turns of her voice gladness is gain because annoy has fled sadness is pain because some joy is dead light wins its halo from the gloom of night night spins its shadow at the loom of light the twain are one the one is twain naught lives alone in joy or pain except the king akbar the king is one birth sends us death and flings us back to earth earth lends us breath and brings us fresh to birth love gives delight hush the king wearies once again the sonorous voice of the courtusher following a faint uplift of the kings finger brought instant obedience the singer was silent the crowd remained expectant while the hot afternoon sun blazed down on all things save the king sheltered by the royal baldequin he raised his keen yet dreamy eyes and looked out almost wistfully to the far blue horizon of india which from this rocky red ridge whereon he had built his city of victory showed distant unreal a mere shadow on the inconceivable depth of the blue beyond jalaluddin mahomed akbar great mogul emperor of india defender of the faith head of kingdoms spiritual and temporal aye he thought he was all that so far as the shadow went but in the light what of the light beyond wherein someonesomethingsate enthroned kingofkings lordoflords what was he there he rose suddenly and the crowd rising also swept back from his path tumultuously as the waters of the red sea swept back from the staff of moses to leave him free unfettered there was no lack of power about him anyhow he stepped forward centring his world with the swing of an athletea swing which made the bearers of the royal baldequin jostle almost to a trot in their efforts to keep the sacred personality duly shaded and then he paused to look thoughtfully into a pool that was fretted into ceaseless rippling laughter by the fine misty spray which was all that fell back from the clear strong skyward leap of the water in the central fountain was that typical of all mens efforts he wondered a skyward leap impelled by individual strength and then dispersion when he diedand death came early to his racewhat then he stood absorbed while the crowd closed in behind the courtiers who circled round him at a respectful distance beyond them the fun of the fair commenced bursts of laughter a hum of highpitched voices the tinkling of wirestringed fiddles the occasional blare of a conch with every now and again the insistent throbbing of a hand drum and a trilling song may the gods pity us dreamers who dream of their godhead and over all the hot yellow sunshine of an april afternoon in northern india the king is in his mood again remarked one of the courtiers vexedly he was man singh the rajput generalissimo son of the rajah bhagwan singh who had been akbars first hindoo adherent who was still his close friend and soon to be his relative by marriage the speaker was in the prime of life and the damascened armour seen beneath a flimsy white muslin overcoat seemed to match his proud arrogance of bearing the courtier to whom he spoke was of a very different mould small slender dark with the face of a mime full of the possibilities of tears and laughter but full also of a supreme intelligence which held all other things in absolute thrall he gave a quick glance of comprehension toward his master then shrugged his shoulders lightly he sighs for new worlds to conquer mirzarajah he replied with a faint emphasis on the curious conglomerate title which was one of the kings quaint imaginative efforts after cohesion in his court of mixed hindus and mahommedans you rajput soldiers are too swift even for akbars dreams with bengal pacified guzerat gagged berhampur squashed and the deccan disturbances decadent his majesty ismayhapbusy in contriving a new machine to turn swords into wedding presents he gave an almost sinister little bow at this allusion to the coming political marriage of the heirapparent prince salim to man singhs cousin a match which set the adverse factions in the court by the ears man singh laid his hand on his swordhilt and frowned if birbal could speak without jesting twere well he said significantly those bigoted foolshe nodded toward a group of longbearded mahommedan preachersmay howl about heretics if they choose but we rajputs know not how to take this mixed marriage either for in gods truth the prince is not as the king but an illdoing lout of a ladso akbar has no time for moods he needs skill birbal gave another of his comprehending glances toward his master another of his habitual slight shrugs of the shoulder perchance he wearies of skill the doubt will come to all of us at times sir soldier whether aught avails to check the feeblest worm fate sends to cross the path but ask abulfazl there he stands closer in council to akbar than i there was a slight suspicion of jealousy in his tone as he turned toward a burly broadfaced cleanshaven man whose expression of sound common sense almost overlaid the high intellectuality of his face what ails the king he answered and as he spoke his light brown eyes scarce darker than his olive skin were on akbar with all the affection of a mother who glories because her son has outgrown her own stature can you not see that he fears death death echoed man singh hotly since when there was no fear of death in akbar when he my father and ieach guarding the others headrode down that cactus lane at sarsa when the spear points were thick as the thornsnor when at ahmedabad he sounded the reveille to awaken his sleeping foesthough they outnumbered him by four to onebecause it was not regal to take them unawaresnor when abulfazl laughed a fat chuckling laugh which suited his broad open face lo i shall have come to thee stalwart and true when i run short of incidents for my poor history of this glorious reign yet none knows the most excellents reckless bravery better than i but tis to his dream he fears death man singhhis dream of personal empire that is bound up with this thirststricken town founded for the heir of his body and this fear of the force of fate comes upon him at the nauroz always since both father and grandfather died ere they were fifty and prince salim footnote new year curse the young cub broke in the rajput angrily what of him now only the old tale replied shaikh abulfazl gravely drunk oh let the young folk be interrupted birbal bitterly as he passed on tis god gives us our sons not we who make them mayhap some of us might have found better heirs through the town crier abulfazl looked after him pityingly it wrings him too with lalla his son ever in the princes pocket such things are tragedies and i thank heaven that my father if abulfazl has time for gratitude to his creatorbroke in a voice polished to the keenest acerbitycan he not find a better subject for it than mere man even though the man be his father abulfazl turned in perfect goodhumour on his bitterest enemy the rival historian budaoni who as opponentinchief of all reforms still wore a beard while his green shawl and turban showed him an orthodox mahommedan not so mullasahib retorted the shaikh carelessly i will leave the remark as a shiah sin for you to chronicle in your sumi fashion footnote two opposing sects of mahommedans footnote two opposing sects of mahommedans so saying he also passed on to stand beside the king and as birbal had already done strive to rouse him from his dreams my liege he said the deputation from the english queen for an instant akbar looked at him resentfully then the despotic finger raised itself and abulfazl fell back to join birbal in failure from behind in the circle of the courtiers came an airy laugh will you not try oh most learned to rouse him with religion since politics and art have been given conge or shall i as pleasure fling myself into the breach said an overdressed noble with a handsome evillooking face as he bowed ornately to the group of longbearded mahommedan doctors who held themselves together in contemptuous condemnation of all things where god sends meditation mirza ibrahim he may haply send penitence also replied their leader the makhdumulmulk for that we men of god wait with what patience that we can i would we could rouse him murmured birbal standing apart the generalissimo said true he has need of all his skilland yours shaikhjee mine has he ever replied abulfazl simply and it was true no lover was more absorbed by his mistress than he by akbar and akbars fortunes he was obsessed by them so as they stood those two faithful friends and counsellors of the one man whom they held dearest upon earthyet in a way unfaithful distrustful of each other because of unconfessed jealousythere came to them close at hand throbbing through the hot yellow sunshine that seemed to throb back in rhythm the sound of an hourglass drum and a high trilling voice may the gods pity us dreamers who dream of their godhead it is atma muttered birbal to himself what seeks the madwoman now and he strode back to where on the outskirts of the circle of courtiers some disturbance was evidently going on let her pass in an she will he called to the ushers angrily when will men learn that fair words fight women better than foul ones i will dismiss her bards of a feather flock together sneered budaoni alluding to birbals own minstrel birth abulfazl who was close behind his enemy turned on him courteously mayhap he and my brother faiz hindu and unorthodox poetslaureate being disappointed of a worthy colleague from your sect mullajee are seeking oneamongst women there was a laugh and budaoni turned aside scowling with a murmured may god roast him it was his favourite wish for the unorthodox meanwhile a red dress showed through the bevy of protesting ushers and the next moment a group of three persons was standing before birbal one the woman who had sung the other the rebeck player whose fine careworn face had shown cameolike against her glowing colour the third an old man almost hidden by his big drum the woman was past her first youth but she was still extraordinarily handsome and her dark eyes full of some hidden thought looked defiantly into birbals i am the kings bardthe kings champion she said in a low rapid voice i have come to sing to him birbal bowed with a halfdisdainful sweep of both hands those who know atma devi as the daughterthe daughter onlyof her dead father may disclaim her right of succession birbal does nothing soso unnecessary akbar has no need of your pedigrees today madam the king listens to no onenot even to your servant let the lady pass out again ushers for an instant atma hesitated then her eyes sought the rebeck players and birbals followed hers instinctively there was nothing unusual in the musicians thin face save its excessive pallor in that he looked as if he had been dead for days for the rest he was clean shaven to his very scalp and wore no headdress nor much of dress below that either birbals swift downward glance paused in a moment at something attached to a skein of greasy black silk which the man wore talisman fashion about his throat what was it a stone of some sort roughly smoothed to a square and of a dull green uneven texture like growing grass no it was like leaveslike the rose leaves in a garden and those faintly red specks were the roses yes it was a rose garden how the perfume of it assailed the senses making one forgetforgetforget oh rose of roses is thy scent of god speak rose disclose the secret foolish clod who knows discloses not whats sent of god the quaint old triplet seemed afloat in the air and atmas voice to come from beyond something that was eternally unchanged inevitable has the seedling no need of the root does the flower not nurture the fruit she chanted her eyes still upon the rebeck player birbal looked at her caught in the great worldwisdom which poets see sometimes in the simplest words she says truth he murmured to himself she says truth then with a light laugh he turned to abulfazl shall we let her pass at least she can do no harm nor any good broke in man singh hotly and it will but strengthen her madness what a woman to claim a charans placeto give her body to the swordher honour to the dust for the kings psha bid her go back to her spinning wheel footnote the charan bard and champion is a hereditary office held very sacred by the rajputs abulfazl smiled largely lo even rajput manhood lives in the woman for nine long monthsnone can escape from the dark life before birth yea let her pass in birbalshe can do no harm nor good persisted man singh stoutly birbals shoulders moved once more i would not swear he answered airily since akbar is not of the common herd go then good mad soul and sing thy pedigrees and youhe paused pointing at the quaint green stone what call you that musician the rebeck player paused also keeping his eyes downward submissively they call it smagdarite excellence it comes from sinde sinned or no sin echoed birbal gaily the devil is in it but tis a good name pass on smagdarite stayhere the old man halfhidden by his drum essayed to followwhom have we here old deena the drumbanger in what vile stew of satanstown didst spend the night villain thus apostrophised deenas comically wicked leering old face hid itself completely in a salaam behind the drum and came up again puckered with pure mischief that is a question for the virtuous lord chamberlain mirza ibrahim he replied demurely the sally was greeted with a boisterous laugh and mirza ibrahimwhose fine clothes dispersed a perfect atmosphere of muskscowled fiercely for satanstown as ultimate exile of all the bad characters of the city was in his charge and report had it that he pursued his duty of inspection with more than usual assiduity sit thou here then by smagdarite continued birbal recovering from his laugh and drum from a distance lest thou be utterly damned for deserting honourable company hark she begins atma had by this time sunk to the ground beside the king her flimsy scarlet skirts curved about her like overblown poppy petals her dark eyes full of fire were fixed on the unconscious figure so close beside her and under the slow circling of her lissome forefinger the little drum held in her left hand was beginning to give out an indescribably mysterious sound like the first faint sobbing of air before an organ pipe breaks into a note from the distance almost unheard came the muffled throbbing of old deenas drum and the thin thread of the rebeck light yet insistent like a summer gnat both kept to the same stern delicacy of rhythm the singers voice high and clear rose on it almost aggressively hark and hist to the list of the kings who have died in their pride to the wide wide world mirunkhan lo he dreamt he was king but he died in his pride to the wide wide world so his son suliman dreamt the dreamings of kings till he died in his pride to the wide wide world so the dream was jehans and he dreamt he was king till he died in his pride to the wide wide world the rhythmic background broke with the singing voice into troubled triplets and the kings slack hands gripped in on themselves was he listening now the tale of the kings who have died in their pride is many and many beside but the dream is the same so it came the pliant forefingers whirling gave out a continuous boom like distant thunder amongst hills deenas drum throbbed a reveille the rebeck thrilled like a cicala to kuman and he dreamt he was king in the wide wide world enough the word came swiftly as akbar turned with a frown the end woman the end there was a pause then from the very dust of his feet rose her reply there is none to the dreaming of kings there is noneto the dreamingof kings he echoed slowly and his eyes scanned her face curiously as he raised her from the ground who art thou woman he asked suddenly then as suddenly dropped the hands he held and said coldly give her gold for her song but once more a fresh feeling came to make him add nay not goldlet her choose her own rewardwhat wouldst thou sister his face grown soft as a womans looked sympathetically into hers she stood before him abashed by the quick tie that seemed to have sprung up between them unable to realise the chance that was hers quick step cried man singh brutally see you not the mostgracious waits what shall it be gold fallals dressesthe things for which women sell their souls she turned on him like a queen the women who nurture such heroes as rajah man singh mayhap so sell them but i here her recognition of opportunity swept trivialities before it she drew herself up to her full height and faced both king and court her voice ringing like a clarion i claim my fathers office she cried listen o kingofkings he gave you faithful service when you came to take the crown of india what to him was hindu or mahommedan he was the kings herald akbar was the king his eldest sonmy brotherdied to save the honour of the rajput chief he served before you came and little heerason of his old age begot for you died ere his baby tongue had ceased to trip in challenging the worldfor you lo i have kissed the words to steadiness upon his childish lips when father grew impatient why was i not the son hid in this dustlike body lies the spirit of my race is it my fault that in the dark months of my mothers womb fate made me woman as she made you man give me my fathers office o my king and if my tongue forgets one word of all my fathers lore or if i fail in guarding the kings honour treat me as woman thenbut not till then the dying fall of her words left the court amazed almost affronted here was a claim indeed a claim foreign to the whole conservative fabric of eastern societywhich heaven knows had already suffered shock enough at the kings reforming hands but akbar took no heed of the looks around him he was deep in that problem of sex which was one of the many to claim his quick interest at all times the spirit of thy race is in thee sure enough o sister he said slowly manhood is in the woman as womanhood is in the mando i not know the latter to my cost so take thy gift thou art the kings charan from this day but hearken if thou failest in thy task i treat thee not as womanbut as man he turned away dismissing her with an autocratic wave from sight even from thought ushers he went on raising his voice in command sound the advance i go and my lord chamberlain bid the travelling englishmen attend me in the diwanikhas abul your arm i would speak with you about this queenthis woman who has stretched her hand out over the seas to meet mine he gave a quick joyous laugh and stretched out his ownthe true eastern hand small fine but with a grip as of wrought iron in its slender flexible fingers by god and his prophets i seem to feel it herea womans hand close clasped to mine a fanfaronade of trumpets shawms and drums drowned his words as with a waving of plumes a blinding glitter of gold and jewels the royal cortege of akbar the magnificent swept on its way one moment cried birbal to man singh who awaited him impatiently i must find smagdarite first but both the rebeck player and atma devi had gone only old deena remained drumming softly a fitting accompaniment to the murmurs which rose around him as the immediate entourage of the king disappeared yet one more insult to islam muttered the makhdumulmulk spitting fiercely ere he spoke and to honest men asserted a jealous old turk who was suspicioned of having drowned more than one young wife on the sly for what is woman but ultimate deceit and guile what echoed one whose calling could best be described as courtpandar why a means for mans making money withal though the kings virtue steals many a penny out of my pocket i tell you he is no kingand no man would either spend his moneys on duty instead of pleasure ghiass beg the lord high treasurer laughed uneasily the money goes nevertheless todar mull as finance minister is for ever cutting down state revenues and the kings private charities to say nothing of the civil list for five thousand women within the palace walls at whom he never looks put in mirza ibrahim sarcastically five thousand and one my friend laughed a man with a sinister face since there will be a pension now for atma devi kings charan unless mirza ibrahim prefers to provide for her himself i caught a lewd eye appraising her many charms the lord chamberlain frowned i was but following the lead of khodadad khan who hath the quickest sight of any in india for a pretty woman kings pensioners belong to the king replied khodadad of the sinister face and i meddle not with majesty so majesty meddles not with me remarked ghiass beg and leaves me my quail curry and my saffron pillau it is welcome to starve an it likes on one meal of peaseporridge a day footnote favourite supper dishes on account of their supposed qualities and as he rolled off goodnatured hospitable he felt in the heart which lay beneath his fat stomach a pang of regret that the king in so many ways a prince of good fellows the best shot the best rider the best polo player the best allround man and sportsman in his kingdom should be so marvellously out of touch with his court but the princes his sons were thank heaven different chapter ii for the lord our god most high he hath smote for us a pathway to the ends of all the earth and some we got by purchase and some we had by trade and some we found by courtesy of pike and carronade kipling elizabeth by the grace of god etc to the most invincible and most mightie prince lord yelabdim echebar king of cambaya invincible emperoretc the great affection which our subjects have to visit the most distant places of the world not without good will and intention to introduce the trade of all nations whatsoever they can by which meanes the mutual and friendly traffeque of marchandise on both sides may come is the cause that the bearer of this letter john newbery joyntly with those that be in his company with a curteous and honest boldnesse doe repaire to the borders and countreys of your empire we doubt not but that your imperial maiestie through your royal grace will fauvurably and friendly accept him and that you would doe it the rather for our sake to make us greatly beholden of to your maiestie wee should more earnestly and with more wordes require it if wee did think it needful but by the singular report that is of your imperial maiesties humanitie in these uttermost parts of the world we are greatly eased of that burden and therefore wee use the fewer and lesse words onely we request that because they are our subjects they may be honestly intreated and received and that in respect of the hard journey which they have taken to places so far distant it would please your maiestie with some libertie and securitie of voiage to gratifie it with such privileges as to you shall seeme good which curtesie if your imperiall maiestie shal to our subjects at our request performe wee according to our royall honour will recompence the same with as many deserts as we can and herewith we bid your imperiall maiestie to farewell footnote copy of real letter the polished persian periods of the translationthe original of which drawn from its brocaded bag lay before the kingfell mellifluously from abulfazls practised lips the final cadence of the farewell holding in it a certain sense of finality some of the audience yawned surfeited with the magnificences the festivities of this new years day both minds and bodies were attuned to sleep in the present not to dreams of the future outside the wide rosered arches of the hall of audience a rosered sunset was flaring in the west over the wide plain of india the growing shadows were obliterating the familiar life of millions on millions of men so there was silence a second as it were of breathing space then suddenly a gong struck echoing through the arches and over the purpling plain beyond them in rolling reverberations one of the three englishmen who stood in worn doublets and hose awaiting the reply to their queens letter shivered slightly it sounded to him like the knell of some doom whose theirs or the kings who with face suddenly alert rose and standing looked down the central aisle the assemblage rose also more or less alertly and all eyes followed the kings so cleaving the hot evening air which seemed the more heated by reason of the fierce blare of many colours the dazzling glitter of gems which came with that sudden uprising the sound of boys voices singing a wild wavering chant was heard then far away down the pathway of persian carpeting two tiny babyish figures showed heading a procession of lighted tapers boy and girl they were naked save for the wreaths of roses with which they were bound together and for the filmy gossamer veil spangled with diamond dewdrops which just reaching their foreheads in front trailed behind them on the floor the first footsteps of the following choristers almost touched it as they advanced slowly twelve of them in single file each bearing a massive golden candlestick containing a flaring camphor candle the smoke of these drifted backward lit up by the white light to fantastic curves and rested like a pall over the procession the englishman who had shivered crossed himself devoutly as he stepped back to let it pass he felt as if some corpse lay there lifted high above the world shrouded by that trailing fume of light and now the wailing chant of the dismissal of daydiscordant to english earssteadied to something vaguely reminiscent of the kyrie in palestrinas mass of pope marcellus as the procession formed itself into a semicircle about the throne the two tiny figures girl and boy tight handclasped solemn wideeyed standing together at the kings very feet come night our day is done keep thou the sun safe in the west lulled on thy breast for day is done our light its course has run the west has won lo gods behest is manifest our course is run his might and right are one plaint have we none come darkness blest give us thy rest our day is done the words fell lingeringly and with the last each chorister bent toward his taper and softly blew it out the tiny children drew the gossamer veil over their faces and bending to kiss each other turned still solemn wondering wideeyed to head the retreating procession which passed silently and in shadow whence it came was it merely the swift extinction of those twelve brilliant tapers symbolising the hoursoflight which brought a sudden sense of darkness to all the pomp and magnificence or was it only because outside the rosered arches the suns last rim was just disappearing beneath the western horizon or on that memorable evening when the english grip first closed upon india did some shadow of future fate fall to intensify the solemnity of the dismissal of day it may well have been so read that portion again came akbars resonant voice in the pause which ensued which says with more wordes we should require it if there was pride in his tone there was arrogance in most of the faces around him their owners had already prejudged the case and were ready with denial on akbars however was only the quick curiosity with which he met all new things and a not unkindly personal interest for the three adventurers whose bold blue eyes gave back his curiosity unabashed and whose worn doublets shabby and travelstained appealed directly to one who like akbar was desertborn and hardly bred we are greatly eased of that burden and therefore wee use the fewer and lesse words the phrase seemed to satisfy and akbar held up his despotic forefinger your names he said briefly adding to the clerkly figures who sate in their appointed places on the floor at the extremities of the small semicircle centred on the throne the equally despotic word write john newbery merchant replied the tallest of the three who was also unmistakably the leading spirit as he spoke he made an obeisance which showed him not absolutely unversed in eastern etiquettes your home put in akbar quickly there was a halfdefiance in the answer aleppo my purpose is trade something in the face however belied the latter profession for it showed the restless energy of the born wanderer to whom gain of gold is as nothing to gain of experience and of power is there then not trade enough in the west came the swift question trade and to spare mayhap your majesty replied john newbery but not enough for englishmen we live by trade a faint stir of distaste rose from amongst the nobles and man singh muttered under his breath a rajput lives by his swordwould i had it in some wames i wot of and you continued the king turning to the next adventurer he was shorter broader and had an open face matched by his bluff frank manner i am one ralph fitch by name may it please your majesty citizen and trader of london town the answer passed the muster of akbars mind and he repeated the same question to the third traveller older by some years than his companions his whole appearance suggested a more courtly breeding than theirs may it please your majesty he said dropping on one knee if indeed that be the proper form of addressing the mighty jelabdim echebar emperor of cambay i am one william leedes a jeweller native of england educated at ghent and rotterdam i have cut gems for royaltyhis eyes fixed themselves on the almost rough translucence of a huge diamond which akbar wore ever in his turban as a fastening to the royal herons plume and then he paused to draw something from his breastlike this my liege he held out betwixt finger and thumb a small rosecut diamond even in the growing dusk of the audience hall it showed its hundred pinpoints of light welded into one bright flash and a low guttural wah of admiration ran through the immediate circle round the throne akbar took the stone between finger and thumb also and as he looked his eyes clouded instantly with dreams a hundred suns where there is but one he said absently tis like a manysided life then he held the jewel out toward birbal the young princes abulfazl budaoni and others of the inner court who were craning over to see it tis better cut he went on than the little one padre rudolfo showed us where did you learn the art at the fountainhead my liege replied william leedes of old louis de bergueins son at ghent and you could cut such gems here given the stones tis diamond cut diamond in all things interrupted akbar with a sudden smile then he turned to john newbery and what do you bring us in exchange he asked gold and all that gold brings with it was the ready reply akbar shook his head we have gold and to spare already pursebearer set forth the immortal money that they may see we lack it not in the brief pause during which an old courtier stiff with age and brocade fumbled in a netted bag and set out a row of coins on an embroidered kerchief akbar sate silent fingering the vellum of the queens letter absorbed in thought all is prepared most excellent petitioned the pursebearer read out the legends o diwan in obedience to the order abulfazl stepping forward raised the first huge disc which contained a hundred pounds worth of pure gold and read aloud from about the plain stamped semblance of a rose these words i am a golden coin may golden be my use so from the obverse where it encircled a lily came this couplet golden it is to help the seeker after truth the englishmen looked at one another their coin of the realm despite its stamp defender of the faith held no such sermons so from the next largest disc worth just one half the shenser came these words i am a garment of hope may hope be high and from the obverse god in his pleasure gives without measure may it please your most excellent majesty interrupted john newbery readily we ask but this that following the divine example your majesty at your pleasure may grant our request without measure akbar glanced round his court tentatively first toward his sons the eldest salim a big handsome lad who looked years older than his ageeighteenwas asleep prince murad the next tall lanky cadaverous sate sulky indifferent the youngest danyal a mere boy of some twelve years was carelessly munching sweetmeats the kings glance shifted with a sigh to birbals face wanderers are always beggars quoted the latter warningly has akbars purse no penny left as alms came the instant answer if this slaves opinion be asked as keeper of the most excellents regalia spoke up ghiass beg boldly i must protest against the jeweller akbars sudden laugh seemed almost an outrage on that decorous assemblage sure akbars crown can spare a gem or two what dost thou say o abulfazl as he spoke he sought the wideopen tolerant farseeing eyes of the man on whom more than on all the others he was dependent for the capable grip on possibilities which changed dreams into realities the eyes narrowed themselves for the moment their gaze concentrated on that somewhat forlornlooking group of three awaiting the verdict they come most excellent he said slowly by their own showing from a nation of traders tis your majestys axioma true onethat where trade flourishes justice must lie seeing that the greater principle of mind is needed for the control over the lesser principle of gold yet ere your majesty decides it were well that these traders be made acquainted with your majestys law which while yielding due profit to the dealer denies to him greed of unearned gain the law demands fair frank dealing from both parties to every contract of sale he turned to the trio adding courteously doubtless it is also the law of your land and of your queen since the fame of the justice of both has echoed here to the east the three wanderers looked at each other dubiously and ralph fitch muttered under his breath ours is caveat emptor and it works well then john newbery pulled himself together and made bold answer we need no such law for england while she trades free trades fair and by that just fame of our country and of our queen we engage to do naught unbecoming of either and to abide by my laws put in akbar sharply and to abide by such laws echoed john newbery adding to himself so long as they may last there was a pause once more akbars handthat true eastern hand looseknit doublejointed small yet with sinews of ironfingered the queens letter at all times his mind went forth joyfully to any new thing expectant he scarcely knew of what and this vellum warming under his fingertouch seemed to grow responsive it was like a womans hand aye it was a womans hand stretched out as a queens to him as king stretched out across the sea that dim mysterious sea which he had seen once long years before of which he had so often dreamt since seeing himself standing with the ebbing tide at his feet and calling across the receding waters calling for what for replyalways for the reply that never came write he said suddenly write who injures them injures me akbar the emperor they have safe conduct so long as they remain in my realms john newbery gave almost a laugh of relief his part was played the rest lay with providenceand commerce england had gained a foothold in india let her see to it that she kept it aye and more than kept it there is yet one more petition said abulfazl hastily as the king made as if he would rise the envoy from sinde waits to bring the accession offering of the new ruler to the feet of acceptance akbar sank back amongst his cushions resignedly the province of sinde was a perpetual thorn in his side sooner or later he felt it must be delivered from the tyranny of its hereditary rulers but a tarkhan was a tarkhan that is someone whom even a king would hesitate to touch someone hedged round by strange privileges and high honours still annexation must come in the sequence of civilisation so what mattered it if bazi committed suicide in a fit of drunkenness if payandar jan his sonpoor wayfarer in life by name indeedhad gone mad and disappeared in the great desert or whether jani beg or any other of the illdoing royal house of tarkhans had seized the reins of government it was a farce from beginning to end his sympathies lay if anywhere with the wanderer who had sought escape so men said from hereditary iniquity in the wilderness from what if rumour spoke true from terrors almost too horrible to be told so he sate indifferent while the envoy a slight man with flowing black hair and beard and curious dull eyes read out from a goldleaf besprinkled paper that bazi had taken the baggage of immortality from the lodging of life that payandar having poured the dust of his brain into the sieve of perplexity and so removed the known into the unknown jani beg placed his unworthiness on the steps of the throne of virtue he did not even look up when the reading ceased and birbal advanced to perform his duty of taking the missive in its brocaded bag and handing it to the throne but a quick exclamation roused him what is it he asked for birbal stood staring at the envoy nothing most excellent was the hasty reply but the speaker still stared at the envoys throat was itor was it nota smagdarite of which birbal had caught a glimpse beneath brocaded muslin his curiosity prevailed i wait sire he added suavely for the virtuous name of this accredited of kings the envoys hand went up to his throat he bowed gravely sufurdar khan of the kingly house he replied for the life of him birbal could not resist another low swift question and of the talisman he wears the dull dark eyes held the alert ones a common stone called smagdarite if it pleases the favouredofkings this dustbornatominabeamoflight resigns it ye gods a rosegarden indeed birbals bodily eyes saw the slender dark hand holding out the lustreless green stone but his mind was lost in colour beauty perfume roseleaves twined themselves into his brain they sought his heart their scent bewildered his soul and faint and far off he seemed to hear a singing voice who would have musk of roses must not touch the rose its scent is secret only heaven knows how the sweet essence of a spirit grows what now came akbars full imperious voice must the king wait while birbal dreams the rose garden disappeared for birbal taking it thrust it hastily into his bosom and then advanced toward the king with the brocaded bag it is accepted said the latter impatiently signing away the offering the audience ends birbal your arm i lack air this place is stifling the englishmen awaiting the lord chamberlain to conduct them to suitable lodging looked round the fastemptying hallofaudience with the sort of stupefaction which follows on accomplishment if we lose grip said john newbery suddenly twill be the fault of metal mettle echoed william leedes almost sadly there is mettle here and to spare already god knows yet must it go since it is not of english making ralph fitch looked at him dubiously we be christian men comrade and these but pagans moreover our commerce john newbery gave a loud laugh the pike and carronade for my choice my masters but cheer up friend we will do the cutting of india whilst william leedes facets yonder pigeons egg echebar wore in his turban the jeweller looked up quickly lo i could not an i would there is something of steady radiance in it that would defy my tools so they followed their guide catching a glimpse as they passed through the courtyards of two figures standing under the great arch of victory and looking out over the purpling indian plain it was akbars favourite evening resort and tonight he had his favourite companion birbal it was growing chill already under the massive masonry of the palaces but it was still warm out in the open where the blistering sun had scorched all day long into the very heart of indiathat dreaming heart hidden away under the wide arid levels under the calm content of its multitudinous peoples the little dancing lights of the long line of booths and shops which edged the whole twenty miles from fatehpur sikri to agra had already begun to glitter the stars were lower in the sky and only in the west venus hung resplendent a haze of heat and dust from the lingering steps of homing cattle lay in quaint streaks still faintly tinted with gold over the distant country and hung whiter more obscure and mingled with the smoke of the city about the base of that mighty mountain of wide measured steps which recedes up and upward climbing the low ridge of rocks until it finds pause in the vast platform whenceas springs no other in the wide worldthe tall arch of victory thrusts itself skyward exultantly hafiz quoted the king suddenly no one knows the secret why dost ask what happens in the wheel of time but we do ask it birbal how many years is it since we two have sought the roseessence of truth and found nothing but the scentless leaves and yet tis here i feel it i know ithe touched his forehead lightly strange to hunger so after what is hidden in me myself birbal shook his head what is self my master purusha gazes upon the dancer prakriti but by and by his eyes will tire of her disguises and then interrupted akbar eagerly what then when the object is gone what of the subject answer me that thou cold kapilian nay birbal i cannot believe it so it strikes a chill to my very marrow tis warmer beneath the shelter of allpervading atman holding both mind and matter in tenacious grip yet even that is cold to my hot life he turned slightly and let his eyes follow the inlaid marble lettering of the legend which he himself had ordered to be set round his great arch of victory said jesus on whom be peace the world is a bridge pass over it but build no house there who hopes for an hour hopes for eternity spend the hour in devotion the rest is unknown aye but a bridge to what he murmured could i but know what lies before mebefore this land his eyes embraced the darkening plain and questioned vainly the reddening flush behind the departed sun we hopethat is allhope for an hourhope for eternityan eternity for ourselves and for our children those farseeing eyes turned to rest lovingly on the red towers of fatehpur sikri no i will never give it up birbalit is my city of dreamsthe heritage of those who shall come after methe birthplace and the deathplace of the holder of an empire that is deathless water lo what is water man says padre rudolfo the jesuit doth not live by bread alone neither does he live by water natheless sire put in birbal drily it hath a trick of being the birthplace of most things and the last report of the engineers is unfavourable there is not even a dampness at three hundred feet then we must make an aqueduct from the riverthe ganges an thou wilteven from holy himalya answered the king gaily akbar is not to be let or hindered by aught save deathand even sohe glanced with his winning affectionate almost womanish smile at the man beside himthou dost not forget the promise that whoever of us finds freedom first shall come backwith news i have not forgotten master replied birbal yet who should want my poor ghostif i have one akbars face lit up with curiosity almost with credulousness a ghost by my faith birbalwhich only god himself knows since i sway like any weathercocka ghost is what we need someone to tell us fairly squarely then he smiled didst see one but now when thou stoodst staring at the sinde envoy like a fretted porcupine birbal paused he had almost forgotten the incident nay i saw no ghost he said slowly and his hand sought his bosom as he spoke then his face paled for he could feel nothing there the garden of roses had gone chapter iii oh fathers who have sung i sing with womans lips yet shall your sword hold honour for the king till my blood drips to cover failure with red blazoning of set defiance deathfultriumphing ohe the king challenge i bring ohe the king the king the huge silver hilted crosshandled sword she had been holdingits point skywardsmote the stone at her feet as the wild chant ended and the clang of the tempered steel rang out over the roof as atma devi turning to the north the south the east the west repeated her challenge she had put on her fathers silvered coat of mail and her long black hair bound with a silver fillet about the brows made her look like some valkyrie of the west ready to avenge the slain a waterbright ripple of laughter came from the door opening on to the small square of roof and atma turned toward it fiercely to see a pink and yellow lollipop of a woman respectability in the shape of a thick white burka veil flung at her feet leaning against the door lintel and watching her amusedly footnote the ordinary outsideveil with eyeholes in it her fierce frown faded yamin she said slowly what dost thou here siyah yamin pampered darling of the town sank down like a snake coiling itself amid circling billows of soft scented satin and jingling fringes of silver and pearls she was a small woman extraordinarily graceful extraordinarily beautiful with a tiny oval innocentlooking face on which neither pleasure no pain left any mark whatever from the crown of her head to the sole of her feet she looked and was prepared at all points for her trade a dainty piece of confectionery ready to satisfy any sensual appetite here she echoed and the one word showed her a passedmistress in polished elocution didst fancy i would stay in satanstown because his majesty the monk chose to lump me with other loose livers and exile us beyond his citys walls not i here the waterbright laugh rang out derisively lo many things have happened since siyala played with atmawhat a bully thou wast in those days to poor little me and thou lookst it now thou sister of the veilfor did we not drink milk together out of one vessel and under one veil see you before i drifted to the templeand so hitherward yea leaning on thy sword sowhy thou lookst beautiful could but some of my men see you peace woman said atma sternly the tall crosshilted sword held point downward formed a support for her elbow as she rested her head on her hand and gazed thoughtfully at siyah yamin thou hast not changed much siyala she said more softly come that is more like laughed the little lady those were merry old days a pity thou didst not come with me to the temple atma better anyhow than widowhood ere womanhood began peace child repeated atma sternly what canst thou know of that high fate which makes of womanhood something beyond itselfbut i waste words wherefore hast thou come siyah yamin pouted her pretended sulkiness because from my roof yonderlo how well we have kept the secret that thou didst not know the companionofthecourt was thy next neighbourit hath been such fun atma beguiling the beadles whom his monkey majesty have a care siyah yamin interrupted atma hotlythe king siyah yamin coiled herself to closer laughing curves the king she echoed oh yea atma and the kingthe king and atma the woman hidden within the swordbearer shrank back and paled well what of atma and the king naught naught laughed the little lady but i have heard of thy success today what is there that siyah yamin does not hear so when i saw thee from my roof up yonder with the old mans armour and the swordfrown not sweet sister it becomes thee mightilyi just caught up my veil and ran downstairs for we have many entrances see you and this tenement of yours is one of them to offer thee congratulationssince if the king cast even the wink of an eye on a woman that is something and they say he raised thee by the hands the hot blood surged into atmas face and if he did what then she asked siyah yamin rose and yawning took up her veil touching comes before tasting she replied airily even with kings and so having offered my gratulations on good luckfarewell atma stood frowning at her thou playest a dangerous game siyala if the king discovers that thouthe darling of the townhast set his rule at naught siyah yamin burst into a perfect cascade of laughter fie on thee atma and me a married woman veiled secluded a perfect cupola of chastity wrapped in her white burka all one could see of the devilry within was two eyes brimming over with malignant mischief married gasped atma what man has dared aye he is brave assented the courtesan and i love himas much as i love most and he is the bestlooking of them allis jamaluddin syed jamaluddin of barha echoed atma incredulously the veiled head nodded yea he is syed and set on his religion so i said the creed and he gave me one of the eight marriagesi forget which these mahommedan ceremonials are not aweinspiring like the seven steps and the sacrificial fire lo even with no man but a dagger that gave me shivers thou wilt come and see me atma it is pleasant up there we have joined four roofs ask for the persian bibi from khorasan and if needful give the passwordkingstown rage not virtuous beloved tis better anyhow to live under akbar than under satan so with a tinkling of silver and pearl fringes she passed upward atma stood for a while lost in thought then rousing herself in quick impatience put aside the sword in its appointed corner removed her hauberk laid it on the ground in front of the sword and on it set the two lamps which all night long kept watch and ward over the weapon placed between them the deathdagger of her race and so her newcome evening task finished went toward the parapet of the roof and leaning her arms on it looked out over the fastfading horizon of india in her dark eyes still lay some of the unrest the resentment which since her fathers death had made the townsfolk call her mad for those words with which the king had gifted to her the charanship ill treat thee not as woman but as man had curiously enough brought home to her all the limitations of that womanhood how little she could doexcept diefor the kings honour still the roof was no longer voiceless the challenge had rung out from it once more obliterating the sad echoes of that last dying effort of the old man she looked round as if listening for that feeble whisper no it had gone she was the charan now and the edge of the deathdagger was keen enough for womans flesh she might yet join the great and noble company of the selfimmolated her heart stirred in her at the thought of their deeds enshrined in old bardic verses that had been handed down from father to son from generation to generation they were in her keeping now at any rate and she must not forget them so halfkneeling by the low parapet her chin resting upon her crossed arms she said them over to herself rough rude almost unintelligible yet still instinct with fire with courage with defiance she lingered lovingly over one that tale of how the young tenyearold heera when his father was treacherously slain and his master falsely accused of high treason to his suzerain was sent forth by his mother to seek his fathers body in the wilds and having found it to take the deathdagger from the bleeding corpse and so all travelstained and weary his young face blistered with tears to appear before the hasty tribunal and give the champions cry it is a lie i heera i i take the lie ye brightones see me die avenge the lie and thus by his death force upon the conspirators a full inquiry so she knelt dreaming her chin upon her hand while the glow of the set sun faded from the sky yet with all her dreaming she was very woman and in every fibre of her being she still felt the touch of the kings hands upon hers such hungry hands dimly in her sexless soul she recognised that quality in them what did they want not womanhood certainly but who wanted that no one motherhood was one thing and widowhood was another but sexual womanhood was nescience with a sigh she rose to fetch her dharmshastra and read her nightly portion from its pages choosing it at random so many slokas this way or that way from the one on which her eye fell first yet despite this superstitious selection she was learned beyond the learning of most women beyond even that of many learned men for her father had taught her as he taught his sonsall save the sacred text that privilege of brahmanhood the limitation however left atma smiling since her widowhood outweighed for her the repetition of many gayatris by it she gained a privilege greater than her brothers by its very virginity she became their ancestress the ancestress of all her race that voluntary yielding up of sex brought her eternal motherhood because through her renunciation those heroes had found life everlasting her barren breastssucked of no childs lipshad nurtured themnurtured them all shivjee rajindar half a hundred others were all her children aye it was her hands which had sent little heera into the wilderness to do his duty his childish face full of tears of courage was herswas hers there was no death nothing but unending life that cannot slay that is not slain so to her as she sate reading the sacred book came spirits innumerable until in the vast multitude of men her own womanhood was lost a low knock came to the door holding the light by which she had been reading in her hand she rose and went toward it who enters she asked and started at the reply it is i birbal open my sister i come from the king he stood within the threshold unfolding the shawl with which he was enveloped and disclosing his keen face lit by a satirical smile a good password by all thats holy he said airily nay frown not sister i am of thy tribe true she replied gravely my father spoke often of maheshwar raoshe gave birbals tribal name with intentand said that could he but learn not to jest the faint laugh the little shrug of the shoulders came unfailing as ever were the world less amusing sister he said birbal might have more chance he passed lightly to the parapet and sate on it dangling his legs padre rudolfo the jesuit hath it he continued that i am the fool who saith there is no god but birbal propounds no such proposition he hath an open mind his very errand here this night my sister showsshall we say credulity i come sister for thy rebeck player i need him wherefore asked atma quickly birbals mouth quivered cynically shall i say the king desires him sister nay i will not lie i want him because of a talisman stone he wears around his neck he called it smagdarite i wish to see it again a stone echoed atma surprised what stone he wears no talisman for sure birbals feet came down the roof in sudden excitement he wears none better and better tell me where he lives sister i would see for myself come quick the night goes on and it is time the kings charan was abed he looked at her in frank mockery and she flushed slowly if it be not for harm she began he is but a poor player harm he echoed impatiently if what i think prove true it is not likely birbal would harm one possessed ofsmagdarite out with it sister i have tramped from well to water and water to well these two hours seeking the sinde envoy but it comes ever from each clue that he has gonedisappeared beyond the city so i bethought me of smagdarite and thee come where lives he i will take my lord thither she said evasively nay tis no trouble he liveshe lives here in this very house she raised the light above her head and passed down the stairs it was a manystoried tenement house that circled round a central stair and then broke away from it and wandered in labyrinthine passages to return once more to the same flight of steps or was it another and she was purposely deluding him on and on they went through the dark silence going down and down he is in the cellars she said pausing at a corner to show with her lamp a flight of smaller steeper steps he is so poor he cannot pay have a care the steps are broken they stood before a small low door at which atma knocked there was no answer wayfarer she cried softly o wayfarer footnote this is a fair translation of the name payandar still no answer i have a key she said and drew one from her bosom birbal followed the light into the dark room in that hot climate a cellar is no bad place wherein to live and this one struck pleasantly cool deliciously scented as by a thousand roses in blossom birbal was conscious of a sudden elation he was on the track assuredly the next instant he was standing beside a string bed on which lay wrapped in a white sheet the figure of the rebeck player the clear fine profile turned upward almost as if he lay dead and he did not stir when atma touched him on the shoulder she gave a vexed sigh it is the dreamcompeller she said he takes it at times and lies like a log and then but birbal eager in his quest had drawn the sheet aside and now started back with a swift exclamation for on the drugged mans breast was no talisman but upturned as his there lay the most beautiful face surely in the whole wide world it was that of a girl apparently not yet in her teens yet still close on womanhood perfect delicate pure like some scented lily her breath coming and going regularly exhaled the perfume of a thousand flowers tis zarifahis daughter explained atma softly she is a cripple utterly naught shows of her scarcely save her face but when her eyes are open one forgets she gathered the sheet together so as to hide all that should be hidden only that perfect face remained asleep upon the wayfarers breast does he give the dreamstuff to her also asked birbal feeling his voice unsteady poet artist to his fingertips the sight before him stirred him in every fibre bringing with it a sense of halfremembered dreams she shook her head he sends her to sleep first with flower essences she is like a deer for scenta rose makes her unconscious and then they sleep and sleep and sleep slumber seemed in the air they stood beside the low string bed silent almost drowsy atma roused herself with an effort he promised he would not but they must have been given money today she said regretfully there is no use waiting my lordthey will sleep for hoursperhaps days days he echoed interrogatively she passed her hand over her forehead again it seems as if it were days then when he goes out i carry zarifa up to my roof she is so light there is nothing of her but the face yet she sings like a bird birbals hand went out to the lamp atma held and turned its light full on her face you are but halfawake yourself sister he said gravely and it is all hours of the night see i will wait until i note your light pass on the uppermost stair lest danger lurk for you in the dark he waited for her to lock the door then standing in the dark archway watched her twinkling light circle the stairs then disappear circle again higher up and disappear until he judged from the failure of the twinkle to return that she had reached her roof and as he watched his mind was busy who was this man and did he really possess the art which some deemed magic but which he keen rational thinker found to be inextricably mixed up with the whole problem of life what was it that all the great ones of the earth had possessed what gave them their power their influence what was it for instance which made his own clearseeing eyes fall at times before those dreams in akbars what was it what his whole life was one ceaseless questioning and finding no answer he jested at the very question itself what was reality not surely the deathlike profile he had just seen the deathlike form with that flowerface upon its breast he was turning to go when a burst of halfsober laughter rose close beside him and a voice answered tipsily tssh dhari thou art not safe yet in siyah yamins paradise so lurch not fool lest the watch seize thee take my arm lo i am steady a sound as of confused tumbling against the wall belied the assertion every atom of blood in birbals body seemed to leap to his hands in anger for he recognised the voice it was that of his only son his spendthrift son lallathe son of so much promise so many regrets and the other was his boon companion dharianother bad son of a good fathertodar mull the man whose financial skill had saved the empire from the oppression of bribery where then was the third of this precious trio of young rakes where was the heir apparent prince salim not far off that he would warrant slipping off his shoes he followed up the stairs keeping at a respectful distance to be beyond reach of the lurches yet close enough to hear the password given at the closed door not far he judged from atmas square of roof allowing a decent interval he knocked again and briefly saying kingstown found himself admitted to an inner scantilylit staircase which however showed a brilliant light at its end a minute more and he stood looking with a curious amusement at siyah yamins paradise the jade had taste here on the highest roof in all the city she had set a terraced garden open only to the stars the little coloured lights edging the rose beds and the tiny splashing fountains scarcely sent their diffused radiance higher than his knee it did not reach the edge of the trellised walls and above that was night cool quiet night a liveried servant salaamed to him profusely then returned to his solitary game of cards a white persian cat rose hunched up its back and clawed viciously on the persian carpets laid along the paths then yawned showing its needle like teeth from a confused heap of silks and satins under an awning came loud snores but at the farther end of the far roof there was wakefulness for a halftipsy whollydiscordant voice made itself heard singing a song why am i drunken fools because i sup the wine of love from out the bosoms cup and the soft scented tresses of dark hair trip up my fuddled feet because my winestained mouth has found her lips too close for kisses so their nectar drips to brain and heart and body in slow sips of passion sweet his royal highness the heir apparent murmured birbal cynically as looking halfmechanically to the sit of his turban he went forward time was when lovebut never winehad tempted him also this however was flagrant disobedience of the kings orders and he must see to it siyah yamin was the towns darling but even she had her limits and must confine herself to them he smiled sardonically thinking of the torrent of words he was about to face since she likely would be the only one with her wits about her and he was right as he set aside the silken curtains which hid the interior of her painted pavilion from sight he found the place halffull of drowsy girls and sodden revellers but she raising herself from her cushions on her elbow greeted him instantly with shrill jest the king himself oh the honour nay tis not the king but the kings counsellor sir i would rise she continued pointing and making a graceful wriggle of apparent effort but that my treasure my lover my husband lies deaddrunk at my feet birbal gave a quick glance at the prostrate figure among the cushions yea she continued her baby face at strange variance with her words which came clipped hard and fast with defiance from her softparted lips tis syed jamaluddin of barha sure enough a good soldier to the king though at this present somewhat overcome with love for poor me and liquor as indeed is the prince of proprieties yonder ah most revered oh most excellent of heirs apparents rouse thee to greet this select emissary of a fateful father prince salim a big heavy looking lad stared stupidly at the newcomer his cup arrested at his lips whatsh devil he coming here for he muttered fiercely thats what i wanter know whatsh a devil then his ferocity subsided amid a titter from siyah yamin heed him not birbal prince of jesters slaves bring a cushion sit thee down so beside mewe be the only two sober ones cupbearer the cup and bring the snow from holy himalya to cleanse it for see you most brahman birbal siyah yamin is fast mahommedan since she married laillahailullaho madam said birbal interrupting her mocking creed impatiently if you would play your part as the wife of a syed of barha siyah yamin gave a little shriek of dismay my veil here women my veil lo i was forgetting a truce to jesting madam said birbal sternly time will show if what thou sayest be true meanwhile he glanced round hastily taking in the company so meean khodadad hide not thyself behind the prince as ever god if i could kill thee twere better for us all khodadad on whose face sate enthroned all the evil which in the younger revellers showed as yet fleetingly roused himself to laugh insultingly what kill a tarkhan lo brahman even thy caste in that case would not save thee from the hangmans noose none can punish me fool i am khodadadgod given god given echoed birbal passionately that brings one balmno man need shrink calling thee son and as for thou lallago accursed by thy father whatsh all this murmured prince salim rising unsteadily whatsh all this fush my prince said birbal restraining his voice to respect this is no place for youno place for the heir to indiano place for one who will be king when his great father prince salim dashed his cup down with a curse let be a shay i tell you i am king here am i not king and the shadow of god am i not a shay he looked round on his company triumphantly but birbal utterly exasperated bowed no my prince he replied politely thou art drunk boy and the substance of a fool siyah yamins tinkling laughter led the chorus of mirth in which for the time even birbals anger passed chapter iv beauty is no bond maiden lot it holds the veil which hides it from all earthly lovers but to holyhearted noblesouled unveils and all its loveliness discovers there was another and very different tinkle of soft laughter a rustle of silks and satins which in their stirring gave out multiscented perfumes of orange and rose musk and ambergris for auntie rosebody was in full swing of one of her recitals and all the harem knew that they were as good as cornelianwater for raising the spirits not that spirits required raising on this day of days on which the accession of the most auspicious the most excellent the kingofkings was commemorated pleasurable excitement simmered through the whole womens apartments for weeks past preparations for the feast had been going on and today would bring full fruition to all their labours dressed in their best the harem waited for the ceremonials to begin ha la la went on aunt rosebody enjoying her own tale of past glories that was a feasting for sure a mystic palace and three houses one of dominion one of good fortune one of pleasure so my brother jahanbanijinat ashyanion whom be peacechose pleasure and he took three plates full of gold coins there is no need to count said he let each lady take a fistful so we scattered them in the empty tank and the guests scrambled for them then the king my brother seeing this said to our dearest ladyhere the little speakers little hands fluttered faintly as if in blessingon whom be gods uttermost peace for ever if you permit why not let the water in at first dearest lady out of the gentleness of her heart said no but afterward she climbed out and sate on the top steps ha la la la it was like the day of resurrection when the water came everyone tumbled about and got so excited but the king called no harm done come out and eat aniseed candy so to end my story everyone came out everyone ate candy and none got cold bismillah the little lady hitched her veil straightit had fallen from her abundant gray hair during her vivacious gesticulationsand beamed round on the audience seated about her on cushions bismillah echoed their laughing voices to look at aunt rosebody was enough for laughter despite her years nothing damped the keen enjoyment of life which was hers by right of descent her nephew akbar had it at times also but the cares of life crept in at others not so with aunt rosebody even her recent pilgrimage to mekka had not aged her though salima begum her daughter looked years older and her daughter the little mother of plumpness had come out of the five years journeying quite thin but one thing disturbed auntie rosebodys equanimity and that was the misdeeds of her darling grandnephew the heir apparent these she would weep over scold over and finally condone so the smiles died from her puckered face as lady hamida begum the boys grandmother swept into the arcade her face pale with proud vexation say not so sisterinlaw exclaimed the little lady tears in her voice already say not he hath been drunk again oh my life what is to be done lady hamida

moaned aunt rosebody why cannot my nephew let folk go to the devil discreetly and none be the wiser save providence oh my life what is to be done pray for him suggested salima begum nervously yes pray for him assented an older salima who being related in crossroad fashion to half the harem had lost all individuality prayers whimpered the little lady wrathfully have i not already given up my pilgrimage to the scapegrace and if that avails not what are prayers how was it know you hamida the tale is not for virtuous ears replied the lady hamida icily it is sufficient that my grandson has once more been brought home in a state unbecoming the heir to my son traaa said an elderly woman dryly as she looked up from the tarikh or numerical hemstitch she was laboriously composing in a corner then she took a pinch of scented snuff and removed her spectacles for rakiya begum as the political wife of akbars boyhood was titular head of the mahommedan harem as the mother of the heirapparent was head of the hindu with due deference she went on composedly it is in the blood his greatgrandfather aunt rosebody caught her up fiercely but never clowndrunk like this boy when my father of blessed memory was drunk he was as the archangel gabrielof the most entertainingthe most exhilaratingand he gave it up does he not say in his blessed book of memoirs being now thirtynine and having vowed to abandon wine in my fortieth year i therefore drank to excess what would you more and his recantation gentlemen of the army those who sit down to the feast of life must end by drinking the cup of death it stirs one like the day of resurrection but this boytis all his hindu mothers fault and his grandfather took opium continued rakiya relentlessly lady hamida looked up with chill dignity let the earth of the grave cover the dead daughterinlaw what my husband did is known to me better than to you rakiya begum put the spectacles on her pinched nose once more i offer excuse she replied ceremoniously i was but going to remark that both blessed saints despite these habits were good enough kings it is the unprecedented abstemiousness of the present lord of the universe who looks neither at wine nor women which throws the princes indiscretions into relief her words brought solace after all who could expect a boy of eighteen to be akbarwho in truth scarcely slept or ate and this brought the remembrance that if salim was sickas he invariably was after a drinking boutthe pile of good dishes which the beneficent ladies had been preparing these many days back against this feast might as well not have been made the thought was depressing i wonder sighed aunt rosebody what dearest lady would have advised a hush fell over the company it seemed as though the sweet wise presence of a dead woman filled the room a dead woman who even in life had earned for herself that title who lives under it still in the pages of her nieces memoirs she would have counselled patience as ever answered the lady haimda lo eldersisterrose such tangled skeins can be but disentangled by time i remember when my marriage she broke off and was silent eldersisterrose might know the story might even remember for her memoirs the very words of the pitiful little tale of girlish refusal overborne but these others no sufficient for them the fact that the unwelcome marriage had made her mother to the kingofkings it must not spoil the day anyhow summed up aunt rosebody at last decisively drying her eyes and by and by perhaps when his mother hath done giving the boy hindu medicinesin truth though i admit my nephew is right in deeming the idolaters fellow mortals their drugs are detestablewe may have a chance with a cooling sherbet such as my fatheron whom be peaceever loved after a carouse meanwhile is everything ready for the weighing all things replied lady hamida proudly my son shall lack for nothing then the poor will at least benefit god be praised said rakiya begum tartly as she rose though this weighing of the sacred personality is a heathenish custom unsanctioned by our holy book but what with his majestys divine faith what with the shaving of beards the keeping of dogs and mixed marriages a pious musulmani such as i had best take off her spectacles lest she see too much she took them off with a flourish and a loud sobhanullah which echoed militantly through the wide arcaded room then she prepared to put on her burka veil for trumpets were sounding outside that it was time for the beneficent ladies to take up their secluded coign of vantage in order to see the coming show there is no need for alloverdresses suggested lady hamida gently my son hath arranged seclusion in a new fashion i offer excuse replied rakiya with a sniff but my honourable veiling is of the old fashion with that she led the way in her ghostly goggleeyed wrapper such tinkling of jewels such perfume from stirred scentsodden silks such hurried needless mufflings with diaphanous veilings such final eagerness of outlook when they could peep through the latticing see the throne almost within touch of them andcurving from it in a vast semicircle of which it was the centresee the packed rows on rows of nobles glittering with jewels awaiting the coming of the king so entrancing was the sight that the due and stately greeting of the rival women who trooped to their places from the hindu harem lacked something of lengthy dignity and there was a general sigh of content as every eye settled down to a peephole look chattered even silent salima yonder is sher afkan new back from the deccan war a goodly man and betrothed they say to ghiass beg the treasurers daughtera little witch for beauty they call her queen of womenmihrunnissaand she not twelve years old see ammajan whispered little umm kulsum the mother of plumpness that is budaoni beside the makhdumo god of the prophet may the holy ones blessing rest on me yonder is faiz the poetoh fie he hath his dog with himthe unclean beast giggled another aye abulfazl his brother will likely come with the king they say his stomach grows bigger every day trying to swallow what his majesty will not eat rakiya begum gave a cackling laugh stomach or no stomach he is the wonder of the age he hath approved this concealed ones verses mine also bridled aunt rosebody he hath asked and used my memory in his history but wherefore delays the king the show is like a peacocks tail without an eye and he away it was an apt simile the almost inconceivable magnificence of the scene made the eye wander the acres on acres of gorgeous pavilion flashing with silvergilt columns glowing with silken khorasan carpetings filled to the roofing with tier on tier of grandees of the empire ablaze with jewels multicoloured as a flowerful parterreall this needed centralising seemed incoherent without a figure on the throne the very curve of waiting elephantsa solid wall of gold trappings encrusted with gems which stretched on and on beyond the pavilion on either side like some huge bowseemed as if it might have gone over the horizon but for the tightpacked bowstring of the populace blocking the distant view from sight with myriads of eager watching eyes suddenly a great blare of sound at lastat last the royal nakarah at last and see sweeping round ahead of a scintillating knot of horsemen banners lancesone man the king the king a low moaning surge of sound came from the packed humanity for an instant the next it was lost in the wild shrieking bellow which seemed to crack the skies as two thousand elephants threw up their trunks headhigh and let loose their leviathan throats an imperial salute indeed one that never grows stale and the thrill of it paled akbars cheek as with the shining sun standard of the rajputs on one hand the glorious green banner of islam on the other he rode forward to take the throne which he had wrung alike from hindus and mahommedans of what was he thinking as grave courteous he returned the obeisances of all he was thinking with a passion of regret in his heart of a lad of eighteen found drunk in siyah yamins paradise and now seated on the throne his figure clad in simple white muslinwith the milky sheen of a rope of pearls and the dull white gleam of the diamond he always wore in his turbanits only ornamentseemed to centre the magificence in curious contrast the kingmay he live for everlooks well enough commented rakiya begum charily concealing her pride but why doth he not wear a gold coat like his fathers these innovations will surely lead him to hell sobhanullah assented salima nervously they were such simple straightforward beneficent ladies with their high features high courage high sense of duty of family of tradition all swathed and hidden away in scentsodden silks and satins they formed as it were a masked battery of pure benevolence behind the throne unseen but felt for akbar gave a glance round to where he knew his mother must be sitting ere facing his empire for a second or two in silence he rose and stepped forward to the great silvergilt steelyard which stood in front of the dais a blare of nakarahs sounded the advance and aunt rosebody from her peephole said in an agonised whisper god send everything be ready even the mystic palace o khanzada gulbadan khanum was not more prepared replied lady hamida eunuchs take out the gold then as the slaves staggered forth under their burden she sate clasping little umm kulsums hand murmuring softly he did not weigh so heavyonce she was back in memory to the terrified travail of long years ago in the wilderness when as a queen flying from her enemies she had first wept at the rough looks of the hastily summoned village midwife then hugged her for very joy when the boybaby was put into her young arms the mother of plumpness nestled closer to her in the sheer sympathy which she had and to spare for all comers her round bright eyes indeed had already sought and found the posy of violets which the king wore halfhidden by the rope of pearls around his neck she grew them in her garden so that the most excellent might ever wear the flower he loved so well that his grandfather babar had loved so well also akbar meanwhile seated in the scales awaited the great platter of gold and a sigh of relief rose from behind the lattice as the steelyard recovering from the impact oscillated then settled to fair equipoise the gold anyhow was of the right weight give it to the poor said the king and the taut bowstring of the populace gave out a surging thrill the ornaments next whispered aunt rosebody feverishly and held her breath as with due decorum the second huge tray was hefted to the scale what had happened was there a faint unevenness in the swing would there be the least deficiency ere the question rising in ten thousand minds could be formulated fairly it was settled by one small hand which flashed through the latticing and a scarceheard chink told that a little gold bracelet had fallen just where it should fall akbar holding to the gilded chains as the balance steadied to level rest did not smile he only threw back at the lattice one allcomprehending remark of superhuman gravity thanks most reverend aunt gulbadan begum fell from her peephole with a little shriek of outrage and the remaining ten weighings and the distribution of chicken and sheep and goats one of each for each year of the most auspicious reign had all been set aside for the poor ere she had recovered her composure now is there peace as the squirrel said when he had pulled the sting out of the wasp she remarked hurriedly fanning herself with the plaited edge of her tinselset veil but twas like the day of resurrection this being her favourite standard for a disconcerting event who flings finds as he flings remarked rakiya begum with much acerbity and if women learn mens tricks they must expect scandal tis the fault of illregulated youth illregulated burst out aunt rosebody in instant wrath my fatheron whom be peaceloved to see his girlsbut there no quarreling on this great day here come the elephants they came heading the review close on two thousand of them three abreast moving like a wall only their slow shifting pads showing beneath their fringed wararmour and as each trio passed up went the snaky trunks and from between curved tusks a bellowing trumpet shrieked out not today gujmuktar called the king appeasingly as one mighty beast paused and the wise monster passed on shaking its huge head as if to rid himself of an unwelcome burden for gujmuktar was akbars favourite mount and objected strongly to a strange driver then came the camels all scarlet and gold with swinging tassels their riders bent almost double in sitting the long stilted stride then the horses neighing prancing curvetting led by gorgeous grooms waving long yakstails next the hounds lean hungrylooking pacing beside their keepers followed by the hawks quaintly hooded and leashed their bells jingling looking like stuffed birds so still were they upon the falconers wrists finallyquaintest sight of all to the three englishmen who seated beside padre rudolfo the jesuit watched the scene with wide eyesthe hunting leopards their catlike faces shifting and peering their doglike limbs sinewy and sinuous their long slender tails swaying at the tip with rhythmical feline regularity samand the kings voice echoed softly through the hot air there was a spotted painted flash in the sunlight as a leash was slipped and a great creature was purring at akbars feet like a huge cat and rubbing its back against the throne the kings hand went down to it and its head continued the rubbing with still louder purrs lo it is not meet remarked rakiya begum with dissatisfaction the most auspicious is no better than a mahout or a hunter he cannot help the beasts loving him spoke up little umm kulsum hotly i offer excuse snapped the head of the harem he need not love them in return come ladies all is over save the soldiery and they are of no interest to virtuous women she gathered up her flock austerely the lady hamida and auntie rosebody lingering to discuss prince salims absence from the assemblage he was not there i looked even in the backmost row declared the little lady in a flutter what thinkest thou hamida can he be in prison more likely sick in his mothers hands replied hamida coldly she was not with us either and didst see they were feeding prince danyal with sweeties all the time trash ejaculated aunt rosebody vehemently what can they do but drink with sugar in their mouth from morn till eve if they would but give the lad over to me here she gave a little shriek of relief for there as she entered the arcaded reception room was the scapegrace seated sulkily among cushions thouthou evil one she began in shrill tones which yet suggested endless excuses so thou hast been overtaken again and in a public place why canst thou not be as thy greatgrandfather was in his cupsbut that is not edifying for the young ah salim salim how came it about sweetheart twas the meddler birbalmay god scorch him growled salim sulkily he came after his cubelse khodadad had stuffed the guards full of gold khodadad lo tarkhan though he be he should die for high treason and where was itwhat thou wilt not say go umm kulsum and thou also khadijago to the threading the beads thou shalt tell me boy whisper itwhat siyah yamins and thou newbetrothed oh had but thy father settled thee with a true bride of my race she would have keptor killed thee she gave a little shriek what jamaluddinthe scorpion saith he hath married herthe piece shame shame then she suddenly put her head on one side and regarded her grandnephew distastefully lo salim thou growest too fat wine and women will kill thee and tis well that birbalmind you i say naught for him or against him though he hath made me laugh often enough he shall laugh on the wrong side ere long cried salim savagely aye he shall learn not to jest at me the lively little face grew keen at thee what said he come sweetheart let me hear i will decide if there be wit in it wit echoed the prince angrily no wit but insult for which he shall pay look you when the hindu infidel interfered with sermons i bid him silence am i not king said i as i shall be and the shadowofgod no says he with that cursed bow of his thou art drunk boy and the substance of a fool aunt rosebody attempted gravity then her laughter brimmed over and the whole room giggled in response including the beadthreading girls oh my life the little lady was beginning when one of the women guards entered hurriedly crying the king honourable ladies the king he was amongst them almost before the circle of fond relatives about the young prince had time to rise so hiding him from view for an instant akbar stood to make his courtly greeting then seeing his mothers pale face light up he flung his turban with its royal herons plume asidehis shoes he had already left at the doorand so passing quickly to hamidas side took both her hands and raised them to his head mother i thank theefor all her fingers even in his strong grip lingered there lovingly as if she felt the childs curls still then she said with a quiver in her voice it was nothing sonthe good wishes were more weighty than the gold he gave her hands a little squeeze ere he released them than the jewels mayhaphere he turned with a mischievous smile to aunt rosebody who stood divided between joy at seeing him and dread lest he should see salim for them i have to thank my aunt how dost know it was i she challenged furiously he looked at her with immense gravity first he said twas the smallest hand in india next no other woman could shy so straight when one has played ball polo god knows what in ones youth calumnies calumnies interrupted aunt rosebody her face puckering with amusement the most excellents remark was truly scandalous the word was unfortunate it roused memories there be worse scandals than that to the kings honour this day he said his face clouding know then beneficent ladies that the son i have forgivenhow many times sure it comes nigh to the padres seventy times sevenhas been found drunk again in a common stew and he is coward too he hath not dared to face his father he paused his anger turning to ice for prince salimto do him justice no cowardtook heart of grace and rose above the shelter of the womenfolk who seeing themselves no longer needed stood back leaving the father and son face to face they were a great contrast both tall and strong but the one all curves and softness the other lean sinewy i was ill began the prince sullenly when akbar interrupted him with a contemptuous laugh ill hast not even a body for drunkenness go thy way boy if thou wilt i have other strings to my bow my son appealed lady hamida who knowing the kings temper knew that once lost it might carry much with it the boy has come to us and what does he here amongst virtuous women madam and how came they to admit him asked akbar sternly did i son and nephew even in the hottest hours of youth inure them to such insult go boy go with jamaluddin the exile and his paramour i have other sons a blank horror settled down on the beneficent ladies never had things come to such a pitch before and some of the younger women sobbed audibly only little auntie rosebody with the courage of despair stood looking first at the father then at the son regret anger irritation showing in her small puckered face oh my life oh nephew jalaluddin mahomed akbar she cried at last look at himoh look at him he is a fattailed sheep and thou art a hunting leopard how can he race with thee give him time nephew give him time something in salims sheepish attitude appealed to the kings sense of humour a suspicion of a smile showed about his mouth at his age madam he began sternly the memory of his strenuous youth rushing in upon him why at eighteen dissatisfied with his agents of empire he had dismissed them and taken the whole conduct of affairs upon his own shoulders at eighteen he had begun to dream at eighteen his mind was busy with the problem of how to unite a conquered india how to efface from it all memory of coercion and make it look to him and his not as to ephemeral conquerors but as gods viceregents the upholders of justice mercy toleration and freedom at eighteen suddenly he flung his right hand out in a hopeless gesture of finality what use were dreams even the dreaming of a king if they were only to last for one poor mortal life there is no end to the dreaming of kings bah the woman had lied there was an end an end to all things but the worst of his passion was over he turned yet once more to his son and forgave him yet once again chapter v the worldrevealing cup of the king jamsheed counselled the king in his pleasures and in his need firdusi the prince salim despite all efforts of his friends accepted his fathers reprimand in dutiful fashion truly akbarmay he be accursedhath a very devil of persuasion in him for those he lovesthe scribes hand paused in its swift swooping over the persian curves and he looked up for an instant with all the evil of his handsome face concentrated into an expression of bitterest antagonism then he turned his head listening ere he went on with his newsletter so far little has been gained yet the poison works the prince grown older than his brotherswho are themselves coming on for rebellionresents this leading as of a young colt and will ere long assert himself already he is fit for intrigue by and by it may be for murder and akbar once goneby what means god knowssalim will be our tool thus the dead today brings forth another today and so we more especially this motespeckinthelight dalil of the kingly house tarkhan who waits in unmerited exile for his lords service expectant of his lords recall hope knowing that all gods strength dwells not in one mans body meanwhile the kings action in this matter hath stirred up the whole city ere noon jamaluddin left accompanied by a goodly gathering of his clan all incensed at the sentence of exile passed on their captain he hath gone to his relatives of barha and will doubtless rouse them to resistance but the jade siyah yamin hath done more for our cause than any since i have but now returned from seeing her leavetaking for the baggage hath elected to follow her lawful spouse truly tis said a torn ear clamours for more earring half the town were at the heels of her palanquin wherein she sate veiled like any cupola of chastity but full of an evil tongue truly it was a sight to set pumpkins asinking and millstones afloating since none knew what to make of it with the light men gathering up the flowers she flung and the light women praising her in jest for her fidelity but it hath done our cause good service and the king may repent him of his virtue ere long thus remaineth matters at this present whilst i dalil knowing that straight fingers hold naught crook mine in the service of the head of my house mirza jani beg looking for reward this goes by the hand of sufardar envoy whom i await this day past but in the act of writing the words who comes not the scribe paused again this time there was no doubt of a sound presaging interruption and the writer thrusting the papers under a fold of his embroidered shawl took up a lute which lay beside him and leaning back amongst the scented cushions began to strum a love song and sing in a high tenor voice oh love i am caught in the snare of the scented net of her hair oh love i am stricken dead with hunger for her and with drouth her foot is upon my head would my kisses were on her mouth a merchant selling essence of rose by my lords orders said an obsequious dwarf extravagantly dressed one of the smartest deformities in fact to be found in the service of the young nobility of the court his cunning face full of almost malignant comprehension had been overlaid with servile admiration as he had waited for the song to end let him enter came the yawning reply and yahed close the doors on us the lamp flickers in the evening wind the song went on lazily oh love i am held by the power of her bare brown bosomflower oh love i am lost in the mesh in the very thought of a sip at the nectar of soft warm flesh and the touch of her lip then the door closed and he turned swiftly on the figure which had entered so at last i have been awaiting thee these fourandtwenty hours and wherefore was there no due notice of arrival lo my liver dissolved when the archheretic abul spoke at the kings audience of an envoy from sinde for aught i knew jani beg might have failed to secure the crown it was a relief to see thy facebut how came all this sufardar he spoke as one having authority but the supposed merchant answered sulkily as he unwound his closedraped shawl so disclosing in truth the slender spareness and the high pallid features of the envoy from sinde if thou canst tell me how it came about oh dalil tarkhan of the house of kings he said thou knowest more than i the companion of thy youth since i know naught a blank as of death lies behind me from the time we encamped at noon yesterday five miles beyond the city the whilom scribe looked cynically at the dull opiumdrugged eyes a blank he echoed how much of the dreamcompeller goes to make that for thee now a days oh sufar those dulled eyes lit up with sudden fire no more i swear to god than the noonday pellet of twelve years agone thou knowest the old tuglak tombs about biggayas serai the tents were late and it was hot so i slept in one of them curse thee sleep where thou willst interrupted his companion impatiently but give me the packet i must answer it if answer be required he held out his hand scented manicured beringed like any modern ladys the envoys face showed uneasiness if thou wouldst listen thou wouldst learn he said vexedly i slept and dreamed then i woke but it was to today not to yesterday but thou wast at the audiencefor i saw thee aye and i wondered what birbal the heretic pig had to say to thee as he kept the king waiting the envoy shook his head slowly it is a blank and hearken mirza sahib the packet hath gone gone echoed the other again his face paling at the thought of akbars everswift punishment for treason thou hast lost the letter and this tale of forgetfulness the envoy from sinde leant forward and laid one warning finger slender almost emaciated on his companions wellkept hand tis no tale but a mystery the packet was ever in my girdle cloth and left not my side day nor night none knew of it and i remember nothing of my sleep except my dream he shivered and looked round apprehensively it was a dream of nigh thirteen years agoofof a rosegarden mirza dalil oh thou mayst laugh but i curse the day that ever i took a part in that damned work of thine it comes between me and my prayers mirza dalil laughed airily it comes not between me and mine but then i am tarkhan there must be nine deadly sins ere even earthly punishment be thought of and i am but at my seventh or stay is it eighth truly i know not and it matters not but this tale of thinewhat says thy retinue the envoys face fell they say i woke as ever and gave the orders for the audience but i remember naught save turn thy forgetfulness toward rosegardens opiumeater interrupted the man he called dalil sternly have i not ever told thee thou wert but as a beast to give up the heavenly dreams of hemp for the clogging sleep of the poppy thou wert drunk that is allor hast been since so remembrance is left with the drug as for the packetthou hast lostor sold it lucky for me no names come from sinde and none here know me save as khodadadkhodadad the gift of god the companion of princes the chamberlain of pleasures to the heirapparent khodadad adventurer made tarkhan on the battlefield by the kings brother the rebel of kabul because being above myself with hemp i saved his life made tarkhan thou prophet of god and i a tarkhan by birth still he continued checking himself in his reckless mirth thou art in luck but mark me if by this loss suspicion comesaye even a suspicion that khodadad is of the kingly house younger brother aye even though he be a bastard of the fool payandar who went mad over the rosegarden thy life is not worth much go therefore here is thy packet he drew out the paper he had written set the seal he wore on his first finger to it folded it neatly then continued with an evil smile mind i say naught in it against thee thou mightest lose the letter if i did but i will see thou comest not with messages again lo that will i not muttered the envoy wrapping his shawl round him as before this very sight of thee recalls the rosegardeni seem to hear her piteous cries khodadad lay back amongst his cushions and laughed thou art far gone in opium sufardar he said chuckling ere long thou wilt see the devil clutching thee for sure gods prophet man hadst heard as many maidens screechings as i he was silent but smiling evidently in pursuit of memory and when the envoy had gone he lay back among those scented cushions and allowed himself a certain latitude of remembrance at fiveandthirty there were few experiences of which he had no cognizance but it needed many experiences to leave a mark on a tarkhan as he lounged lazily the soft night air fanning his perfumed hair his smooth yellow skin oily with unguents every atom of his body and soul surcharged with sensuality there yet came to him an uprush of almost wild pride in his race in the honours the privileges which distinguished it even from the common herd of princedom a barlas tarkhan barlas the brave master of seven distinctions in procession or audience free of every part of a kings palace by night and day aye and more having the right to drink with the king so that when the royal cup was handed from the right the tarkhans cup was handed from the left and still more with the right to set his seal to all royal orders above the kings seal unpunishable toountil the uttermost and then if mirza dalils face grew gray as he thought of that uttermost assize it was not altogether in fear since there are some things pertaining to race which bring with them an almost passionate acquiescence even in terror and this thought of the final verdict of his peers to be carried out by those peers with many ceremonials had in it an element of pride besides here in a far country away from those peers there was small danger of the silent session being held so he looked out over the vast shadows of the town wondering vaguely how he should fill up the night with iniquities he would have an excellent companionwhich was half the battlesince he had been asked to sup with mirza ibrahim the lord chamberlain there would be business first no doubt due to the heirapparents childish knuckling under since some new intrigue must be set on foot to weaken akbars authority but once that was over ibrahim might be counted on to make the hours hum so he clapped his hands for the tiremen and fresh dressing and shaving and scenting then after due dallying with cosmetics and dyes set offthe very pink of fashionin his gilded litter in which he lay lazily fanned with a peacocks feather fan by a tiny boy who sate at his feet dressed in a girls tinselset garments his hair braided on his forehead in the virginal plaits as he was borne through the silent streets with running torches beside the ambling porters a host of pipebearers toothpick holders keepers of aphrodisaical pills and general panderers trotting behind him he was eastern vice personified soft perfumed relentless so he disappeared into the palace and the starlit world was quit of him for a time for the night was spangled beyond belief spangled with myriads of stars not white as in northern climes but holding in their shine faint hints of rose and green and blue and amber against the clear obscure the terraced town showed like some vast fort turreted battlemented from which one by one the twinkling lights disappeared as the hours of the night wore on until at last only a few lay sparsely about its feet circling the outcast colony of satanstown where by akbars orders vice dwelt and turned darkness into day above all was shadow save for one light high up on the palace whose outline struck firm against the velvet of the sky it shone from akbars balcony akbar who after his usual habit watched while his subjects slept tonight however something more than mere meditation absorbed him as he sate girt about the middle of his loose white woollen garment like some franciscan monk his face dark aquiline not so much ascetic as strenuous was bent on william leedes the english jeweller as he weighed in his balance the great uncut diamond from the kings turban the gold and gemmed setting from which it had been removed lay on the floor and the irregularly ovoid stone itself gave out flickering brightnesses as it oscillated gently under the light of the seven branched golden cressetstand in the alcove beneath this stand backed partly by the tendrilinlaid curves of agate and chalcedony lapislazuli and cornelian upon the marble wall and partly by the pearl embroidered yellow satin cushions amongst which the king reclined was a beautifully embossed silver clepsydre or water clock in which the floating bowl was fashioned in enamel like a sacred lotus and beside this stood the marvellous censer a triumph of goldsmiths and jewellers art from which day and night arose the scented smoke which akbar loved beyond through the arches of the balcony lay the night velvety dark five hundred and sixty carats murmured william leedes to himself the largest known diamond in this worldand of a most elegant water but he looked up his face full of denial it would mayhap lose half its weight in the cutting great king he said sharply andgod knows in his grace but we might cut out the kings luck thereby he looked as if for support to the two men who stood behind him they were rajah birbal and shaik abulfazl the latter seeing his master frown interrupted the jeweller in hasty excuse i but told him most exalted that the populace hold the stone a talisman and sure at all times the luck of the most excellent has been stupendous still we of the enlightened give praise where praise is due and not to stocks and stones birbal shrugged his shoulders say rather shaikjee he remarked urbanely that the wise see an eternal cause even in stocks and stones the eyes of those two counsellors of the king were on each other in rivalry but the king himself bent forward to touch the diamond with one pliant finger and a faint fear showed in his face then he leant back once more luck is of god he said and this stone he paused beset by recollections of the years he had worn itever since as a boy of three he had made his way safely through the great snowland the stone sire put in william leedes firmly is as god made it tis well to remember that he was looking at the king and the kings eyes were on his for the time the whole of the rest of the world was empty for them both aye but what of that he wishes it to be what of that sir jeweller came the swift answer therein lies kingcraft to see what his will needsand give it william leedes bowed silently and there was a pause then bluntly suddenly he said yet great king would i rather have naught to do with the cutting thereof in an instant akbars eyes flashed fire thou hast not slave tis i who order it birbal to thy charge the arrangements the room next diswunt the painters in the court of labour is vacant see it prepared double the guards if necessaryto thee i leavethe kings luck a faint smile came to his face but birbal and abulfazl looked at each other and finally the latter spoke this dustlike one he said tentatively and yet with firmness presumes not to offer wisdom to its fount but to the minds of the most exalteds devoted slaves it seems as if to the populace there might be danger in royalty appearing without the talisman to which all have looked as security for the kings success in all ways therefore if majesty will ordain the cutting of the eastern gem in western fashion let it at least condescend to wear in its placeuntil the gem returna veritable mountain of light doubtless a substitute pooroo the false jewel maker who can deceive all but a diamond itself hath the cast of the kings luck made when the most exalted changed the setting thereof let him fashion a double to deceive deceive came akbars voice with a note of affectionate reproach in it deceive whom fate or the people lo abulfazl to what end since if the tale be not true that luck lies in the stone what need to regard it and if it be true how shall the false gem hoodwink god he raised himself as he spoke holding the diamond in his palm as an orb luck he said dreamily thou art mine tonight and tomorrow is fates go he gave the eastern wave of dismissal and sank back amongst his cushions sank back with more than usual lassitude for the day had left him weary it was no small thing to one of his temperament to quarrel with his son his heir it was a still greater thing to forgive him causelessly therein lay the sting the causelessness of the forgiveness the lack of any security against a recurrence of the offence so as he thought of this with a rush came back the memory of many a similar scene and his fingers clasped in upon themselves as the disappointment ate into his very soul surely he had a right to expect more of fatehe who had waited so long so patiently for an heirsince in those long years of waiting the very thought of mere sonship had been forgotten in the heirship yes even now love seemed too trivial to count against empire yet it was love which had prompted forgiveness love of whatwhat of himself surelythe love which claimed to live in his sonto live on shall i bid the reader of wisdom to the wise resume his task came birbals voice noting the kings weariness he had lingered behind the others the king started then looked round cheerfully not tonight friend i have food for thought and if i lack moreit waits below he said and leaning forward rested his arm on the marble balustrade of the balcony so pointed downward into the void darkness of the night through it like a little line of light fading into nothingness ran the signal string attached to the quaint contrivance by which the king could secure when the mood seized him the presence of an opponent for some midnight argument one touch at the cord and through the darkness the disputant waiting below would by an ingenious system of counterpoise rise in a domed dhooli to the level of the balcony akbar laid his finger on the tense string then once more looked back suddenly into birbals face ah friend he said bitterly could we but sound the great darkness as i can sound this little night certain that my need will bring some sage or fool or knave to keep jalaluddin mahomed akbar defender of the faith from wearying for sleep but from the great depths there comes no answer the mystery is unfathomablemans reason wanders bewildered in the streets of the city of god his voice sank in silence then yet once again he roused himself farewell friend for the nightthe night that will bring tomorrowye gods how will it be when the night of death closes inon one of us birbal sank to his knees and touched his masters feet with his forehead he had no other answer so silently he passed through the great wadded curtains of gold tissue which separated the alcove from the rest of the room leaving the king alone lost in thought the problem of a future life had pressed on him all his days and yet he told himself as he sate thinking the fact had not interfered with his enjoyment of the present one verily he had drunk of the cup of life to the dregs his vitality had spared neither himself nor his world the memory of man is curiously creative out of the welter of remembrance it chooses this and that in obedience to no law but arbitrarily whimsically it passes by unseen the peaks of past passion and makes mountains of the merest molehill of caprice so as akbar looked back over his life he found many a triviality standing out as clear as untouched by time as many a tragedy many a palpable turning point in his career the first snow he ever saw the sight came back to him as if he had seen it yesterday though fiveandforty years had passed since that perilous journey from kandahar to kabul in charge of his fosternurse anagah dear anagah how he had loved her more in a way than he had loved his absent stately mother but he had vague recollections of that quaint meeting with the latter after three long years of separation when his father as a joke had brought hima little ladling of sixinto a great circle of unveiled women and bidden him to choose a mother for himself he had chosen right but the very recollection of his choice had gone all he remembered was quick clasping arms and a kisssurely the sweetest kiss of his life the sweetest no that even after fiveandtwenty years the horror the despair of it seemed to overwhelm him again had been the last passionfraught kiss he had given toto a murdererto adham adham his foster brotherhis playmate adham whom he loved whom he trusted oh god the tragedy of it why did such things come into this little trivial life yet it was inevitable if adham were to come to him now as he had done that day reckless defiant presuming on his position boasting of the foul murder of an old man whom he conceived to be his enemy the same swift justice must follow the beads of sweat started to akbars brow as he remembered the sudden grip of his own strong young arms the relentless forcing backward to the parapets edge and thenbefore the final flingthat kiss and thereinafter silence no not silencetears anagahdear anagahs tears she had died of a broken heart because of her sons deathdied without one word of forgiveness for the doer of justice yet he did not regret the deed though he had always even as a boy been tender of life i will fight a whole enemy i will not slay a wounded one the very words of his refusal when his tutor had bidden him whet his maiden sword on the rebel hemu came back to him and led him on to remembrance of the day when this feeling for the sanctity of life had risen in him not toward man only but toward all creatures that was a later memory and the scene reproduced itself before his minds eye complete in every detail the long laborious encircling of game drawing to its closethe opposing ends of the great arc of thousands upon thousands of men who for two days had been sweeping across the country driving all wild things before them were narrowing closing inand he the man called king was watching luxuriously posted his court about him for his first shot and then then close beside him a chinkara fawn looking at him with great soft dim eyes startled but not afraid his majesty was seized suddenly with an extraordinary access of rage such as none had ever seen the like in him before and the battue was given up nor has he since so pursued game but prefers to go out alone and spend hours in arduous chase that is how his quick almost despairing remorse regret pity anger with himself had appeared to the outside multitude to him it had been a crisis in his life one of the few things which had left an indelible mark on his mind aye few things for love had not touched him as for instance it had touched his grandfather tonight at midnight after three long years i met maham again babar had set that down in his memoirs afteraccording to aunt rosebodys talehe had run out on foot from the palace on hearing of the near approach of the long expected caravan from kabul and met his dearest dear six miles out along the road even his fathers more passionate love for the fourteen year old hamida seen when humayon was five and thirty had not been his if it had been perhaps his sons might have been different and so in an instant overwhelmingly akbar was back in the old dreary disappointment the old defiance of fate following fast on its heels the boy would do well enough even if some things passed even if ideals had to go what then the dynasty would remain he and his and the city of victory he had built with such high hopes should endure for ever even if churlish nature denied them a cup of cold water for ever for ever with the words came back the old puzzle oh if he could only see only know he sate staring fixedly abstractedly at the clear translucence of the diamond which he still held in the palm of his left hand while his right rested on the marble balustrade close to the summoning string which dived into the depths below so after a while he seemed to sleep for his muscles relaxed and the right hand slipped to hang over into the darkness whence a faint sound as of metal on metal rose waveringly followed almost immediately by the monotonous burr of a rope passing over pulleys it did not rouse the king though it sent birbal who was lingering beyond the wadded curtain to peer through it stealthily curious to see what antagonist in argument the king had summoned beyond the arched openings of the balcony the domed roof of the swinging dhooli rose into sight and a moment afterward its occupant laid a thin hand on the balustrade steadying himself to arrest despite the highpeaked white woollen cap the white woollen robe of a sufi ecstatic which the figure wore birbals recognition of the face was instant complete smagdarite he exclaimed the newcomer held his finger to his lip but his eyes were on the king hush he whispered see he dreams the diamond hath found him and he knows himself something in the mans tone sent a thrill through his hearer and his eyes followed the lead given them swiftly akbar did not move he leant amongst the cushions gazing at the diamond but seeing it not for the veil had fallen from the unknown and lay hiding the known what doest thou meanmountebank whispered birbal in return his own voice sounding strange to his ears as he stepped closer bending over the king he doth but doze wake my liege wake the others fine fingers were on his wrist gripping it hard at thy peril though mayhap thou couldst not wake him if thou wouldst lo birbal philosopher learned beyond most seest thou not that the man sleeps indeed hast thou not heard hast thou not read of the death in life whereby the soul set free wanders at will not in time but in eternity so wanders akbar now he is not herehe is in the future birbal paled despite his disbelief who art thou man of many faces he gasped and how earnest thou here he summoned me replied the sufi solemnly wherefore god knows as for me i am the wayfarer of life what i have learned i have learned and thishe pointed to the dreaming figurei know that if my lord desires to hear the future he has but to ask this sleeping soul the self which lurks ever behind these trivial selves of ours will tell him for an instant birbal hesitated beset by curiosity as he was something in him cried aloud not to know for agnostic at heart doubter to the very core he knew already knew that all his masters dreams were but dreams that like all other things in heaven and earth they must pass then came the thought that the forewarned are forearmed and he knelt at that masters feet great king he whispered tell us what is seen there was no answer and on the silence the sufis voice rose quiet but compelling oh selfbehindtheself speak what of the future is jalaluddin mahomed akbar there as king there was no pause the reply rang immediate resonant he is not there and yet his work remains to run a glittering warp among the woof see how the westering sun turns all to goldgilt that is pinchbeck of all baser metals the land is thick with little crooked lines but akbars roads were measured straight to give an evening rest to tired travellers he is not there but iwho lived in himi linger still in justice mercy truth sons of his soul are these sons of his love not of his mortal bodyoh salim salim the pause was eloquent of sudden personal distress the clear dreaming eyes clouded and there was silence then hurriedly disconnectedly the voice took up its tale what was the thought which racked me to the soul something i have forgotten utterly so once more came silence while those two watchers waited hush whispered the wayfarer signing back the fresh questioning which trembled on birbals lips he speaks again the kings head had drooped as if to deeper sleep for his voice lost its resonance and seemed to come from very far away and they tooin the years they shall forget their dream of empire shall die as mine and so we twain soulwelded into soul shall pass shall live forgetting unforgotten the dreaming of a king can never die and all their faults shall fall from them ah god the cry of little children the wail of murdered women in my palace wallsdo ye not hear them aliens lo i swear such were not raised while akbar reigned as king yet even this shall pass to peace to restto greater easemore goldmore luxury oh subjects of akbar arouse ye wake life is not comfort there is that beyond which india always sought for which she seeks this is no land of golden sunsettingit is the land of coming dawn of light in which to search for truth unceasingly what do they say arousing me from sleep they wait me in the house of argument ah well i go though it avails us not india is akbars to the end of timelike him it knows not and it fain would know the secret of its birth and of its death what are the words thou soughtest for in the yearsakbar his son i see them not i only see the self that knows that sees that hears the everlasting truth behind lifes lie the rest i have forgotten the voice sank in silence the head to deeper sleep and the left hand slacking its grip dropped nerveless on the knee so that the shining orb it had held rolled from it like a giant dewdrop until it found a resting place at akbars feet birbal with a little cry caught at the kings luck take it back oh master take it back he whispered laying it once more softly in the kings empty palm hold fast to thyself lo the whole world equals not jalaluddin mahomed akbar then in a perfect passion of resentment he turned to the wayfarer but in those few seconds the latters hold upon the balustrade had been withdrawn the counterpoise had reasserted itself and birbal peering out over the balcony could see the dome of the dhooli disappearing in its downward course of darkness to slip through the wadded curtain and make his way to the swinging station at the foot of the wall was but the work of a minute or so yet he was too late the newly arrived sufi from ispahan the yawning attendants declared had had his interview and gonenone knew whither the east was all flushed with roseleaf clouds when akbar awoke and smiled to find birbal wrapped in his shawl watching him with curious doubtful eyes would the king remember that was the question lo friend he said affectionately so may i wake in paradise after a dreamless sleep and find thee there chapter vi the current of a deed will work its way through the wide world and cannot be resisted twas seasonably donethe seed is sown and in due time will bear the fruit of discord kalidasa the wide mosque lay empty save for a group of longbearded doctors of the law who lingering after service was over discussed as ever the unfailing topic of the kings innovations such purposeless innovations too leading to nothing to absolute nescience for what else was all this talk of freedom of equality of universal brotherhood were not kings kings and nobles nobles since the very beginning these reverend seigneurs surcharged with pride of race the pride of the conqueror fiercely fanatical in faith felt resentfully that in religion in manners in morals akbar their king stood absolutely aloof from them yet they in their turn stood as absolutely aloof from the real heart of india which beat placidly in the simple lives of the husbandmen toiling in the ample fields which seen through the great arch of victory receded into a dim blue distance that lost itself in a dim blue sky so each the conqueror the conquered went on his way while a man dreamt of blending the two into one yes it is true murmured budaoni the historian regretfully from his earliest childhood his majesty hath collected everything in all religions that is worth remembering with a talent of selection peculiar to him and a spirit of inquiry opposed to every principle of our faith sobhanullah assented the makhdumulmulk who had been the highest religious authority in the land until the king with one sweep of his pen had made himself the head of the church a direful offence to the orthodox who refused assent to akbars reasoning that since there was but one law the law of god there could be but one authority therefore the intervention of a priesthood between the people and gods viceregent on earth was unnecessary impolitic an old man whitebearded highfeatured murmured to himself yet is he king indeed then fell hurriedly to the telling of his beads but ghiass beg the lord high treasurera stout goodhumoured looking man whose fat paunch stood evidence for his love of good livingshook his head and sighed it cometh of abstinence see you he mourned when the stomach is empty wind rises to the head and were it not for that damned sense of duty which leaveth the king neither by day nor by night akbar would give up food and sleep altogether so far hath he wandered from the sure pivot of life that the very question of dinner ariseth not in his mind he eats but once a day and leaveth off unsatisfied nor is there even any fixed hour for this food sure tis the life of a very dog so he keep it and his dogs and his uncircumcised friends to himself muttered a sourvisaged elder i quarrel not with his starvations belike they may bring the heirapparent to his rights sooner and that would be a glad day for islam the old man with the white beard who was telling his beads murmured once more under his breath yet is he king indeed and went on with his prayers still more hurriedly lo mullah jee yawned another sourvisaged one prince salim will be in the idolaters toils ere then with a rajput to wife there is small hope for a ruler of the faith in the hot sunshine where they sate whispering like sleepy snakes ready yet too lazy to strike a leisurely groan ran round the whole assembly that the first wifepractically the only real wifeof the heirapparent should be a hindu was simply an outrage it was bad enough that the king himself should have taken the rajput daughters and sisters of his conquered foes into his harem in orderheaven save the markto cement friendship between the races but he at least had been first married in orthodox fashion to a daughter of islam could he not do even so much for his son ghiass beg heaved another fat sigh and his face took on obstinacy true he assented and tis not that as fair a bride could not be found in the house of the lord high treasurer interrupted a sneering voice it came from mirza ibrahim who at that moment followed at a little distance by a posse of courtiers and others came from the cloisters full upon the halfdrowsy group of malcontents god forbid gasped the horrified high treasurer weakly in his heart of hearts he had been thinkingand not for the first timeof his little daughter mihrunnissa as a future empress of india but this was an outrage on decorum an indignity he began to splutter remonstrance prayers are over up with the carpet interrupted the mirza irreverently whereupon the makhdum interfered with pompous frowns and craved to know what my lord high chamberlain meant by the unseemly remark nothing most holy replied the latter cheerfully save that if the pious deliberations of the wise are ended the ignorant have a point of law which they would fain lay before authority is it not so oh sahiban he turned as he spoke to a little knot of curiously distinctivelooking men who having separated themselves from the remainder of his following stood together in the full blaze of sunlight they were singularly alike small finedrawn with watchful eyes and a little stoop forward of the head reminding one irresistibly of a bird of prey in truth the syeds of barha were wild hawks indeed and today still travelstained with their quick march from their eyrie of a fortress far in the distant plains they were ready to swoop fiercely on any cause of offence for they were redhot with anger at the exile of that illdoing scion of their house jamaluddin not that they defended his choice of a wifeit was one which sooner or later might necessitate a sack and the nearest riverbut if siyah yamin was the lads wife what right had even the great mogul to interfere they assented with a scowl but khodadad he who called himself by another name when he wrote to sinde smiled urbanely he was evidently prepared to play the indispensable eastern part of applauder and general backerup even so most holy he replied effusively a point of law which can only be settled by gods most chosen judge before whom even these lineal descendants of our great prophet bow humbly footnote the syeds as lineal descendants of mahommed the speech was full of malicious intent purposely provocative and succeeded in its purpose then let them go to the king began the makhdum acrimoniously when ibrahim cut him short concealing a yawn as he sought a comfortable place for himself where his feet could be in sunshine his head in shadow who hath usurped the judges seat nay most holy it is only timeservers and idolaters who yield such function to akbar we faithful ones and true had best keep silence in a public place put in budaoni eyeing the other with a glassy stare he himself might take his own part in discontent but being by virtue of his voice precentor in the court mosque he did not choose to encourage ibrahim whose evil life was notorious the latter smiled and skilfully drew another redherring of provocation across the path public he echoed with a leer of malice sure there is no more private place than the court mosque since the king started his divine faith hast heard most holy what the idolatrous pig birbal jested last friday when the king for a marvel put in an appearance at prayersthat he came not in order to listen to what you preached as of god but to hush the slanders you borrowed of the devil the makhdum spat solemnly the senior canon let loose a thundering god roast him which echoed and reechoed through the wide arches except remarked budaoni with a sneer when his majesty reads prayers himself then he comes to stutter this allusion to the day not so far past when akbar assuming the headship hadwhether from nervousness or emotion history sayeth notbroken down in repeating the kutba composed for the occasion by faiz the poetlaureate produced snorts and smiles of assent yes yea assented the sourvisaged elder fiercely he stuttered indeedmayhap because the words were by faiz the dog poetmay god rot him for defiling his holy place the old man with the white beard looked up suddenly yet sirs was there ought wrong with the words he asked so stretched out his lean old hand and his wavering old voice rang out through the sunshine lo from almighty god i take my kingship before his throne i bow and take my judgeship take strength from strength and wisdom from his wiseness right from the right and justice from his justice praising the king i praise god near and far great is his power allahu akbar the echoes died away and there was silence then ibrahim indulging in a yawn of contempt for the digression his words had caused said patronisingly the question we ask is not of kutbas it is of a marriage most enlightenedone but budaonis virulence was incorrigible his majesty hath propounded not a few such problems to this poor court already he remarked caustically doth he perchance propound another this further allusion to the hot dispute between the king and the doctors concerning the legality of the formers political marriages with rajput princesses would have met with equal favour but for ibrahims quick frown to him as chamberlain the kings present austerities and general asceticism were a continual grievance thy wits must wander budaoni he interrupted sharply or thou wouldst know the very name woman is at a discount at court mayhap the translation into civilised language of the hindu scriptures proves too much for thee the historian scowled for his task of translating religious books from the sanskrit into persian for the kings benefit was utterly abhorrent to his orthodoxy and small wonder he replied hotly these useless absurdities confound the eighteen worlds such injunctions such prohibitions a whole page against the eating of turnips may god forgive the enforced spoiling of orthodox pen ink and paper over such puerilities it was the syeds turn to shift impatiently good sir historian said one handling his sword as it lay on his knee we come not hither to discuss literature but to ask an opinion hath the king right to exile a man for the marrying of a woman what man and what woman asked the makhdum portentously on that hangs law hath the man already four wives the king hath nigher to forty interrupted the incorrigible budaoni peace preacher reproved the great man wagging his head cloud not perspicacity with allusions and the woman is she virgin widow or duly divorced there was a general sort of chuckle from the hawksbrood none of them i faith said the head of the clan at last tis siyah yamin whom all know but she hath said the creed and the lad hath married her by legal marriage how else asked the spokesman hotly we of barha descended of the true prophetmay his name be exalteddeal not with customs borrowed of the idolater then are they true wed and none can dissolve the tie save the husband himself by traa interrupted ibrahim impatiently that is for them to settle between them these gentlemen desire to know by what right the king forbids this virtuous young man to bring his screened and lawful woman into the town such cupolas of chastity are beyond the power even of majesty is it not so most learned doctors a little stir shifted through the assemblage it sate up literally metaphorically keen for ground of offence against any of the kings decisions of a truth pronounced the makhdum pompously he hath no right by all the laws of islam a screened and lawful woman belongs only to her owner so in the sunshine the enmity of the old against the new rose hot as the sunshine itself and conspiracy sprang into being it was a good halfhour ere mirza ibrahim summed up the situation in these words we meet again then in the hall of public audience today and demand revision of the sentence as being contrary to the revealed word and if the king khodadad broke in on him with a sudden laughnay my idolatrous quarry will be birbal god and his prophet how i loathe the dog he paused seeing the unwisdom of his confidences for the syeds of barha rose to stand packed fingering their swords gods truth said their leader turning insolently to the speaker keep thy carrion to thyself tarkhan we of barha mix not in court cabalswe be not buzzardcocks to whom the smell of death brings but gluttony no if the king rescind not his order we fling our allegiance at his feet we and our goodly following so escaping free of false law to our strongholds there to defend ourselves against tyranny but for quarry stab whom thou willst tarkhan but reckon not on our knives khodadad deprecating a scowl at his indiscretion from mirza ibrahim smiled lightly quarry for my craft is all i ask though god knows his world would be better without the hindu pig who see you comes yonder defiling the sanctuary and hatching new plots against our pockets with the accurst khattri todar mull the finance minister it was a deft distraction for the constant cuttingdown of perquisites and fees in akbars efforts to ameliorate the condition of the poor was a continual source of irritation to the upper classes but the syeds of barha were large landowners and they knew on which side their bread was buttered so they salaamed respectfully to the two statesmen as they passed at a distance arm in arm and the oldest of the little group said sharply hindu or no he hath his grip on the collector of taxes so good luck go with himaye and with the king too in such matters save for this about jamaluddin we find no fault in him neither see i fault in him came a sudden voice loud yet wavering it came from the whitehaired old man who had been telling his beads and who now stood his thin bent figure outlined against the distant blue of india that showed through the arch of victory neither see i fault he repeated his tone breaking in his vehemence god give him ever what he prays fora tranquil mind an open brow a just intent a right principle a wide capacity a firm foot a high spirit a lofty soul a right place a shining countenance and a smiling lip of such are kings indeed they looked at the old man in haughty scorn as stumblingly his old eyes halfblind with tears he passed through the archway so down the steps to disappear as it were in the heart of india widespread remote indefinite but budaoni murmured under his breath lo the glamour of the king is upon him god knows one can scarce live in sight of him and not feel the very soul of one go out toward what lies beyond even i myself he paused and was silent knowing that through all his diatribes all his wanton misreadings of akbars character ran admiration meanwhile todar mull had in passing given a quick glance in return for the salutation which had come from the syeds of barha that bodeswhat he had asked of birbal who had shrugged his shoulders and given a still keener glance at the group in the sunshine since khodadad is in itmischief mirza ibrahim ever equals immorality and the syedani wist not they were herebodewith jamaluddin and his chaste spouse in exilemarriage as for the learned of the law they contribute mahommed is his prophet the whole doubtless forming conspiracywhat else is there in the court with this accursed peace of akbars giving time for the cooking of cabals would to god he broke off his mind besieged in a rush with the fierce regret which had been his ever since but a few hours before he had heard the words of selfrenunciation fall unconsciously from his masters lips butfate willingthere should be no more such talk he birbal would force on war he would make akbar as unconsciously play his part in commonsense grasping kingship yea he continued urbanely were it not that the poor thriving are content thanks to todar mulls wise ruling the kattris face yellow of tint fleshy of contour seemed to take on bone and muscle and his oiliness of manner roughened into swift decision aye he returned they grow more content poor souls but tis the king who starts me on the trail i go even now to discuss a new idea of his with abulfazl whose head truly hath no peer for detail yea put in birbal but the kings diwan is even now using it in showing the details of the kings work to the englishmen while the portuguese priests scowl at the intrusion of new claimants to commerce lo i grow weary of these strangers why should akbar make their way smooth todar mull his inherited aptitude for the problems of money showing in the eyes which were keen even for fractions in a mans character looked at birbal doubtfully wherefore not he asked lo i have had speech with these new men and there is that of freetrading unfettered by aught save gold or the lack of it in them which compels approval for see you in the end gold is the essence of all things i tell thee were it not for piety i myself would bow down to it and worship with a hallowed be thy name birbals mimetic face became preternaturally grave but there was a twinkle in his eye twould nothe bowed courteouslybe so bulky a divinity as todar mulls present pantheon which if rumour says sooth already runs to cartloads the financier flushed this allusion to his habit of carrying waggonsfull of household gods about with him when on tour brought a quick reproach jest not at the gods o brahminborn he said birbals whole expression changed not at the allembracing one for sure but for the little brass godlings todar mull edged away nervously let belet be rajah sahib each for his own belief and the almightys curse lodge on the hindmost so it be not me now go i to the statistic makers for see you without figures man is lost in this world they parted company and birbal looked after the retreating finance minister with a frown what was the use of it all was it not better far to eat to drink knowing that tomorrow one must die so his thoughts turned as they always did to the present to the one portion of time which even fate could not filch from a living man the advent of the syedan of barha meant doubtless appeal to the king an appeal to which the king must not of course listen as to that abulfazl must be seen and at once he found him in the royal storehouses his yellowbrown eyes clear with pride as he pointed out the system on which they were worked to the three englishmen who stood centring with the curious halfcontemptuous gaze of another world the leisured bustle in the wide courtyards his majesty explained abulfazl grandiloquently having acquainted himself with the theory and practice of every manufacture is thus able to distinguish between good and bad work so the intrinsic value of each article being settled by the state in reference to a certain fixed standard neither worthy labour nor true art can fall into discredit ralph fitch looked queerly at the carts unlading and lading at the groups of experts settling true values at the artificers waiting patiently for the verdict certain if their work were up to the standard of immediate sale and what of the merchants he asked sharply where does their profit their profit is settled also interrupted the diwan with simple pride and they are content his voice took on sternness as he added they have indeed no choice since all articles unstamped by the testing houses are liable to confiscation and the possessors thereof to fine cheer thee up ralph laughed john newbery into his companions appalled face as they moved on to a new court and thank heaven we be not thus tied by the apron strings though by our lady this king echebar has a trick o keeping cables taut which would make me almost wish to enter his service would he but command some adventure to the poles william leedes looked up quickly nay he said before god i would rather quit this land and leave itas it is he paused for john newberys attention had passed as his roving eyes settled themselves surprised yet approvingly on the long lines of light which followed the rows on rows of steel lance heads swords and matchlocks lining the walls of the vast armoury into which they entered it was full to the brim with every conceivable instrument of war many of them strange to western eyes but abulfazl gave no time for inspection with the brief explanation the mostexcellent is yonder at work he passed through one of the wide arches fitted with massive doors which were now set open to the sunlight and joined a group of men who stood in the courtyard beyond a sharp report followed by the whistling ping of a bullet as it struck a target outlined on the farther wall cut the hot air keenly and akbar who had been kneeling for better aim stood up rubbing his shoulder he was dressed in a white overall not unsmirched with grease and his grizzled hair showed free of covering it hits hard enough behind anyhow sir smith he said goodhumouredly to a swarthy halfnaked workman who looked down the still smoking barrel of the newly tried gun with a doubtful air nay tis not the grooving that idea holds good it is something in the chamber bring it this evening to the palace and we will see to it hast aught else for trial the next instant after one careless salute to the newcomers he was deep in the mechanism of a complicated gun and his face lit up as he looked see you he went onapparently as much for himself as for those others who left behind by his imaginings stood patient halfcomprehendingif this moving wheel duly loaded could fit the one barrel what need for more the twin cannon fired by one match which we made last year works well but this will be betterif it can be compassed and then suddenly as his hands fingered ratchet wheel and eccentric bolt and socket with sure practical touch his eyes grew full of dreams lo we work in the dark he murmured since none know why the bullet curves and so the worst may do as well nay better than the best twas an old matchlock snatched from a sleepy sentry which gave me empire he paused back in thought to that false dawn before the trenches at chitore when going his rounds after his wont alone and in darkness he had seen upon the ramparts of the besieged town the figure of his foe also going his rounds but by the light of lanterns it had been a long shot but in the dawn chitore was his and he was emperor of india yet once again almost overmastering regret came over him for the past horrors of that sunbright dawn the awful onslaught of saffronrobed heroes doomed to desperate death which he had seen against the rolling clouds of dense white smoke that rose from the very bowels of the earth where in dark caves the rajput women were burningselfimmolated then as he stood there fingering the outcome of his uncontrollable desire for success all his victories seemed to slip from him for the moment he rememberedas nearly two thousand years before him another great king of india had rememberednothing but his regret at the moment he also could have inscribed an edict for all time setting forth his sorrow for the hundreds of thousands of gods creatures needlessly slain but the next instant the mood passed and he turned with almost insolent regality to the english adventurers yet tell your queen sir travellers he said that akbar holds the best gun to be the best key to empire john newbery looked at ralph fitch who bowed his answer most excellent we will give the message without fail as they passed on birbal paused a moment beside abulfazl to whisper in his ear the barha hawks are in hast news of them the diwan nodded the king sees them at audience today to consider birbal interrupted with a bitter laugh before god abul he said with his habitual shrug of the shoulders when the mostexcellent thinks of himself as head of the church and defender of the faith he is too excellent for this world better sure a little injustice than that the king should back on himself it is not time for weakness what does he say the lawmaker cannot break the law replied the diwan softly and in his voice there was a touch both of irritation and of pride so in the sunshine the eyes of those two followed the king who dreamt such strange new dreams of duty and responsibility toward his subjects chapter vii what makes a monarch not his throne his crown but man to work his will to tremble at his frown saadi the city was astir sleepily astir in the blind tortuous alleys where the hot may sun struggled in vain to shine shut out on every side by the high tenement houses hiving swarms of men women and children rumour spread like mushroom spawn in the dark spread aimlessly idly sending its filaments at random here there everywhere ready at a moments notice to shoot up into some fantastic mushroom growth even in agra itself connected with fatehpur sikri by that twentymilelong ribbon of shopedged road the talk was all of what was about to happen in akbars city of victory the king had accepted the appeal of jamaluddin syed concerning his marriage and had appointed the next friday audience for the hearing of proof concerning the same so much was certain but would he really go back on his own order could a king possibly own himself in the wrong if he did what became of his claim to divine guidance and how could folk in the future live content on his judgment had a body ever heard of the learnedinthelaw eating their own words no they stuck to them in that way lay safety confidence authority and what was this still more vague rumour concerning the kings luck the diamond which had of a surety been his talisman these many years was it really to be given to the foreigner to hack and hew this was a question which disturbed more than the populace which brought anxiety to the most highly cultured mind in fatehpur sikri if it be true said the right reverend vicar of christ father ricci head of the portuguese mission in goa who had come up to agra on one of his periodical visits to the little colony of christians to whom akbar gave patronage and protection if indeed this diamond whose worth is the ransom of a world be given into these englishmens hands it is time we bestirred ourselves son rudolfo and thou must press the king yet once again for some speedy answer on his politics padre rudolfo the jesuit who for long years had lived at court hoping against hope for the kings definite conversion to christianity spending himself body and soul in good works good example sighed uneasily sure my father the grace of god must work in the endand akbar is so close to the kingdom in tolerance alone father ricci interrupted him sharply it is anathema he tolerates all faiths all things even these new englishmen who at best are heretics one at least is good catholic interrupted padre rudolfo mildly he was at the mass in the palace chapel this morning the superior of his order frowned see you then that he remains within the influence of holy church these englishmen must gain no foothold here as for the king i will write from goa threatening your removalfor surely he hath great regard for you as you for him yet i say to you that despite his good qualities his justice his forgiveness until seventy times seven akbar is a stumbling block in our way prince salim might serve our purpose betterour purpose which is christs he added hastily as if to rectify any possible confusion of meaning yet the meaning was confused for the world holds few stories more strangely complex than the tale of the jesuits struggle between greed of gold and greed of souls which for close on a century found arena in the court of the great moguls tragic it is at times at others comic yet pathetic throughout in the certainty that greed of gold must eventually prevail against the greed of souls padre rudolfo sighed again long living within reach of akbars atmosphere had made him in his turn tolerant and there was always hope hope that his prayers his penances his sleepless nights might at last count for righteousness in the kings long record of hesitation and yet in his heart of hearts rudolfo acquaviva knew that there was no hope was conscious even of a vague content that there was none for in the fathers house were there not many mansions and what was man that he should dictate to god what gave the right of entry to them so from the highest to the lowest the passing days brought a sense of strain to atma devi however in her secluded sunsaturated roof the general unrest did not penetrate to add to the dull distress of her own disturbed mind for the joy which had come to her from even the halfjesting recognition of her hereditary claim had passed before the slow assurance that as woman she was helpless to support her role of champion before the certainty which grew with the passing days that the king had no need of her she had discarded her poppypetal red petticoat for the white robe of the charan and with the silver hauberk fitting loosely to her tall slenderness her long hair unbound circled with a silver fillet would stand for hours her hands clasped over the silverhilted sword looking out over the low parapet wall across the blue distance that limited vision of hers held all her world for the years had obliterated memory of the faroff central indian home whence she had been brought while still almost an infant by her father but one or two scenes of that childish life which had been passed beyond her present outlook remained with her clear yet dreamlike the most distinct of these being her surpassing affection for siyala who was now siyah yamin as she thought of this a dull vague wonder possessed her as to what purpose fate could have had in making their two lives so dissimilarthe one sexless by virtue of her widowhood the other sexual beyond even womanhood atmas was a limited mind her soul groped blindly in the dark yet found what it sought and held fast to it so she waited as patiently as she could hoping for some means of vindicating her claim to the charans place forgetting not one jot or tittle of the many ceremonials of her race even if nothing else came of the kings grace save the permission to challenge the world on his behalf from her secluded silence that in itself was gain in one heart surely his honour would be held sacred utterly she had a quaint companion in her solitude the rebeck players child zarifa for on the morning after atma had taken birbal to see the musician asleep with the young girls flowerface upon his bosom he had appeared in atma devis roof bearing the light burden of the crippled child in his arms and begged asylum for her during the space of an hour while he went on an errand but days had passed without his return so the child had stayed on helpless utterly sustaining life apparently by a mere sup of milk a mouthful or two of fruit and sleeping away all the hours of fierce daylight at dawn and at dusk the soul hidden in the racked deformed body seemed to be set free from its bonds and the child would lie with wideopen soft lustrous eyes smiling and singing to herself and atma devi as she sate listening would feel peace and content steal over her restlessness so that as often as not as the shadows crept over the roof and the daylight died the rising moon would find both the child and the woman asleep zarifa in the dark shelter of the slip of a roomwhence she seldom stirred since the light seemed to scourge heratma crouching in the corner beside the little lamp which burned ever before the deathdagger of her race birbal coming at dawn in search once more of the rebeck player roused atma from such a sleep and entering whileafter unbarring the door at his password from the kingshe stood rubbing her eyes was met by such a strong perfume of roses that he turned quickly on her so he is here he cried then looked curiously at her at the little slip of room within i suppose he added passing to its entrance but atma barred the way it is the child my lord she said quickly the musician left her with me when he went away and she is so timid the very face of a strange man is like a strong light upon herit scorches and shrivels birbal laughed shortly he was of the world and knew its evil ways so does love he replied mockingly nay i find no fault with thee widow but call him outi would see him atma flushed darkly my lord cannot see him he is not here nor the child neither am i not even to have sight of her pretty face to attest truth asked birbal the woman met his jeering smile with a peremptory gesture let my lord sit silent yonder on the parapet she said in a voice of command and from the darkness he shall hear so closing the door behind her she called softly sing to me my bird and stood listening birbal idly kicking his heels as he sate looked over the wall down the sheer drop of a hundred feet or more which ended in the red rock just below him brimming up to the very wall lay the tank which akbar had lately made as a reservoir for the lower part of the town halfhidden in morning mist it reflected the morning sky here and there as the vapour parting left its surface clear and behind the rising mist did it reflect nothing but the shifting gray curves above it or did the cool depths of rock below have their chance to shine mirrored on the water bah who could tell the little roof lay still in the first sunlight a few pigeons wheeling about overhead sent shifting shadows to chase each other on the purple bricks of wall and floor and in the topmost branch of the peepul tree whose roots throve beside the tank below a whitethroat was singing its little limited song so suddenly there rose on the cool air of dawn another limited little voice rose leaves wither away so fast is the suns kiss cold is the summer past whither away like shallops at sea with torn pink sails and never a mast whither away so fast sun kisses are warm and the summers last but the shadows are calling us dim and vast so we set our sails like shallops at sea and drift away without rudder or mast to the dark that will last for eternity birbal artist to his finger tips shivered slightly atma standing her hands clasped over the old silverhilted sword gave a soft sigh to both of them the creeping step of the dark that will last for eternity seemed to invade the present claiming all things all things save love that essence of the rose of life only the dust of the roseleaf remains to the heart of the seller of perfumes the mystical meaning of the sufi saying came home for once to birbal as usual he resented the intrusion and stood up ready to go prepared to jest farewell then widow god send thee a lover if thou hast not one since even charanship to kings is not sufficient for a woman now wert thou but man thou mightst be true it was as if the dam of the lake below had suddenly given way letting loose a flood over the land and he raised his arm in unconscious selfdefence as like a tornado atma swept upon him flourishing the sword lo maheshwar rao brahmin bhatbandi she cried giving him all his racial titles have a care what thou sayest yea since the longdead day when shivjee created us from the sweatdrops of his godly brow and jealous parvati his wifewomanhood incarnateexiled us from paradise because we sang his praises overloudever since then we charans have been true whether god makes us man or woman dost deny it then by the long discipleship of thy upstart raceformed by parvati to sing her trivial worthto mine i do command thee to remember that i am champion to the king dost hear maheshwar rao does akbar need aught stands his honour firm lo if thou speakest not i die the swords point clattered on the brick roof she snatched the death dagger of her race from its altar and stood ready to strike nay sister replied birbal coolly for the very heat of her harangue had given him time for calm there is no need to dieyet here in a flash a sudden thought came to him and he settled himself back on the parapet with a faint laugh set a thief to catch a thief a woman to catch a woman the intensity on this ones face might be useful to him having long since constituted himself the eyes and ears as it were of akbars empire he had countless emissaries endless spies everywhere but he had not yet employed a woman it could do no harm to try one where all the cunning of man had failed sit thee down sister he said after a moments thought and i will tell thee wherein thou canst serve the kings need thou knowest siyah yamin what hath the king need of her asked atma incredulously birbal laughed shortly nay no one hath need of her so she must die the face opposite his paled wherefore she asked briefly because she may be the undoing of empire he replied hearken so thou mayest understand siyah yamin she echoed in a puzzled voice when he had told her of the syeds appeal and the certainty that the courtesan would swear to having read the kalma and thus prove the legality of her marriage nay she cannot swear not if a bowstring find her throat first retorted birbal viciously naught else will stop a womans tongue especially if marriage be the subject therefore she must be found andandlost again she is in the city that we know where no one can compass if thou couldst find out there is no need said atma slowly sheshe will not swear birbal was on his feet with a laugh a woman will swear anything for one she loves or hates and siyah yamin hates the king whether she love jamaluddin is another matter so fare thee well atma devi championess of kings lo i have given thee thy charan chance as for the rebeck playeri shall find him yet after birbal left atma sate thinking there was something which she remembered about siyala which little siyala the darling of the gods must remember also or would she pretend to forget it if she did then she atma must speak must protest if needs be die to witness to it then if she died it would be death to siyah yamin who was siyala sister of the veil atma roused herself and stood listening a faint sound of slumbering breath drawn evenly met her ear as she paused at the door of the slip of a room where zarifa lay hidden the child was asleep and could be left for an hour or two at any rate hastily discarding her charans dress she put on the poppypetalled red skirt and veil of the mad singer so catching up her hourglass drum passed into the street her cry may the gods pity us dreamers who dream of their godhead echoing out into the closed courtyards as she hurried down the narrow alley list that is atma back again yawned a woman sleepily sitting down to the millwheel beside the piled basket of wheat which was to serve for the family breakfast i deemed she had been dead these days past but i will get her to tell me my fortune what she told gobind sahais wife hath come true she hath twin sons and praise be to the gods her husband is not suspicious the last item of information was evidently more racy than the first and the womens voices gossiped over it rising above the hum of the mill wheel atma meanwhile had made her way straight to the bazaar here and there a figure huddled in a white shawl showed wandering outward waterpot in hand a seller of milk or two a woman bearing a heaped basket of greenstuff passed inward but for the most part the cavernous shops stood closed or empty for it was yet early hours a woman blew loudly at a pile of dried leaves under a toasting pan the little spark left in the charcoal below showed red then white amid the gray ashes and with a roaring crackle the flame leapt upward a man guiltless of all clothing save a rag pared his nails solemnly into the gutter but in the house where atma entered all was silent a medley of musical instruments lay piled on the floor and in a corner his head resting on his drum snored deena the drumbanger atma passed over to him swiftly and woke him by a touch the old man started to his feet with commendable activity then was on the ground again in profuse salaam now am i saved from sin mistress most chaste he began vociferously lo since i ceased drumming to the deeds of dead kings i have been a lost soul utterly i have damned myself by giving time to profligate steps i have sung lewd songs but what will ye a drum ever keeps bad company being in sooth naught but the devil of a noise that groweth worse instead of better by being whacked peace fool said atma sternly i have need of thee where hast been of late deena sate down and began drumming softly with one finger an insistent devilish sort of drumming that seemed created to conceal something then he winked a wicked old eye hallallallala he said gaily so old deena is best gossipmaker to the town truly he hears much for see you there is something that brings confidence to scandal in the continuous burring of a drum it seems to cover all so folk speak free and an old ear listens what dost desire to know mistress most chaste hast heard ought of siyah yamin asked atma readily deena chuckled other folks ask that my lord birbal to wit hollah the whole town is agog to know news of god knows whatsiyah yamin the kings luck what of the kings luck interrupted atma devi with a frown only that he hath given it away as a present to the queen from over the black water of whom the new infidels talk replied deena with a yawn for he had had a night of it at the lord high chamberlains the frown deepened it is a lie she said peremptorily the king is no fool his luck is with him ever but seetake up thy drum and follow today i will sing of dead kings and listen for the sake of a living one so i need thy banging deena rose with alacrity and my drum needs thee mistress tis an evil instrument but for its hindrance i could sing hymnshe began one dolorously then paused shaking his head lo it hath no discriminationa holy psalm is even the same to it as a ribald rhyme yea yea i follow i will drum to the herald of a live king and forget my sins so that day atma devi the mad singer reappeared in the city flitting hither and thither chanting of dead kings listening for the sake of a live one but she heard nothing yet as the day drew down she realised that the need of news was urgent for the whole town talked of siyah yamin and the kings luck as she sate in the moonlight on her roof that night she told herself yet once again that if the worst came to the worst she could but die to attest the truth of what she remembered but then the burden of disproof would be laid on the courtesan and if she failed she too must die poor little siyala better far if she could be warned be persuaded not to affirm this marriage at the tank steps at dawn tomorrow said atma briefly as late in the evening she parted with deena at the foot of the stairs she would do her utmost zarifa could be put to sleep with a pellet of the dreamcompeller so she would be free to spend every hour in search of siyah yamin chapter viii dear the sun that shines above thee spends his gold to see thee sweet let me like those rays that love thee kiss the dust about thy feet nizami there was a faint halfkissing sound as of bare feet on a wet marble floor and a running tinkle of light voices behind the heavy curtain which barred the archway to the inner bathroom but in the little balconied alcove at the end of the vestibule where aunt rosebody attired in a vivid rosecoloured wadded silk dressinggown sate drying her gray hair in the wind there was silence almost sleep for the active little old lady still preferred a swim to paddling in scented waters so she and umm kulsum the mother of plumpness both being of small size were used to start earlier in one dhooli for their morning bathe in the womens screen at the big tank beneath atma devis house being of the frank old chughtai type they were hailfellowwellmet with the all and sundry who came down to fill their pots or wash on the steps so nearly every day a gray head and a black one both sleek from a dive under the screen arches might be seen slipping sideways in the overhead stroke far beyond the womens limited range now such exercise is fatiguing even when age is set aside so lightly as it was by aunt rosebody therefore the time of hairdrying was for her a time of repose also the more so because umm kulsum always dried hers whilst picking her daily violet posy for the king and the other ladiesheaven rest their souls and bodiesalways spent such an unconscionable time over their scented paddlings while as for the dressings to come when fresh from their baths they all sate in the balconied vestibule to be perfumed and manicured and massagedwhy what with the drinking of cool sherbets or hot tea scented almost colourless tasteless save for the cinnamon flavouring it these seances seemed unending they were however amusing enough since this was a recognised time for morning callers primed of course with the latest and most vivacious gossip nor were the visitors necessarily of the class which nowadays the eastwithout thereby in the least impugning their respectabilitystigmatises as street walkers since the laws governing seclusion are now far more strict than they were in mogul times besides there were always the court ladies and the wives of the palace officials always indeed aunt rosebody broke off in the faintest of deep breathings which even by discourtesy would hardly be called a snore and remarked with drowsy captiousness what again when the african slave girlwhom the dear old lady had imported from mekka as part of her pietyingeniously roused her slumbering mistress by actually touching her feet in the deep salaam which accompanied the announcement bibi azizan noble wife of my lord ghiass beg treasurer and her daughter mihrunnissa crave audience aunt rosebodys beautiful wavy gray hair stirred like moonripples on water as she shook her head patiently let her come she said resignedly the others cannot be long now and mayhap if i let her tongue start fair at a gallop i may finish forty winks ere it slackens to a trot thereinafter swaying with an odd sidelong waddle of the hips in the fashionable gait which was supposed to emulate the grace of a swan or a young elephant there came over the marble inlaid floor strewn with silken carpets from khotan a truly marvellous figure being somewhat stout in the bodythough the face still charmingly pretty was curiously unmarred by fatness or flabbinessthe extremity of the modes in which the figure was dressed did not become the wearer the graceful dual garment almost diaphanous but for its exceeding fulness cut to the ground at the sides but literally yards long in front and behind instead of when swept back by the walk clinging in soft folds from hip to ankle and lying on the ground behind in a billowing train with no wrong side was ruckled about the fat legs and huddled itself confusedly behind them giving the appearance of a pegtop entangled in a handkerchief there was no lack of colour or stitching and sewings about the lady from head to foot she stood confessed as one of the leaders of ladies fashions and the jewelled chatelaine at her waist held kohl caskets and rougepots even an unmistakable powder box while a large mirror set in pearls shone ringfashion on her thumb she salaamed in the very latest court manner to aunt rosebody and came up from the semiprostration breathless but complacent to meet the little old ladys keen eyes fixed on her forehead whereon just at the parting was stuck a tiny round vermilion wafer what is that asked aunt rosebody pointing an accusing finger at her hast become a hindu azizan begum tittered la madam tis the very latest fashion one cannot with respect to oneself and others appear without it in in the rajput harem interrupted the little lady her tone rising ominously well tis not far distant aziz if thou hast missed the way thither just through the door down the steps across the yard and thou wilt find plenty of red tikkas but not here madam i protest expostulated the poor fat fashionable i have no desireand tis worn by everybody at court it is not worn here repeated aunt rosebody with cool dignity so if the desire to remain finds place in the respected and respectable ladys plans sheshe can wash it off ooma a basin of water let it be tepid lest the lady should receive a shockandand see it be duly scented with scent of flowers something that will make the respected and respectable lady smell less like a civet cat tis pity aziz thou dost not keep to roseessence after taking the trouble to invent it i protest murmured the bibi seeking support on the floor and adjusting the set of her veil and her folds generally with the sort of reflex action which exists still in the women of her typethat is to say hopelessly courtesan despite their excellent wifehood and motherhood tis the very latest of my perfumes and all the latest fashionables the elder womans face took on seriousness beneath its impatience i am not of the latest she said though in truth i be later in lifes journey than they yet even in my youthher sparkling bright eyes roved contemptuously over the others dressi did not clothe myself afterafter satanstown and thou growest old azizan thou hast a daughterbut where is shedid not they say she was with thee the child was beguiled bathward by lady umm kulsum whom we met bridled the bibi the child echoed aunt rosebody lo she will be giving thee dates ere longhaha she chuckled over her own little joke for the giving of dates is the first step toward a wedding but the bibi tossed her head she is but eight and i protest is quite a babenot one thought of marriage auntie rosebody leant back and yawned eleven she said calmly or twelve maybe tis thirteen since the illfated caravan left persia and on the way thy child was born strange surely that such close touch on death as must have been thine ere thou and her father could have left heras thou didstto die in the desert should not have brought thee some sense in life how about the betrothal to sher afkan bibi azizan gave an affected little scream la there tis did i not tell her father that if he would insist on sending the countrybumpkin a platter of welcome that the old tale would be revived la tis too vexing i could cry and my sweet poppet whom i long to keep always as my little babe my perfect innocent i protest madam i would kill any bridegroom oh fie marmie came a laughing voice behindnot prince salim i will wager both women looked round with a start to see holding back the wadded curtain such a vision of youth and perfect loveliness as the world shows but seldom yet once having shown does not let men forget for this small slender eastern maid comparable at her eleven years to western fourteen was to take her place amongst the beauty which has swayed the destiny of empires as she stood backed by the soft embroideries of the curtain the delicate outline of her still childish figure barely concealed by the silver tinsel veil umm kulsum had thrown over her in laughter at her utter nakedness as she had scrambled out of the bath she showed at once innocent yet full of guile there was not one false note in the harmony of her beauty the cupids bow of her mouth was curved into a mischievous smile as she looked at her mother halfjibingly and at aunt rosebody halfdefiantly oh my heart oh what words gasped the former having recourse to her vinaigrette while the latter looked at her nodding her moonshiny head so she said so azizan that lets the cat out of the cupboard but there was no time for more since through the upheld curtain trooped the bevy of bathers followed by their maids then arose such a chatter as to places and pillows such giggles such laughter waxing loudest round umm kulsum who ready dressed caught the silver tissued maidling about the waist and danced round with her whirling through the room feet flying hair floating untilquite breathlessshe pulled her partner down right on aunt rosebodys rug the little old lady looked at the perfectly bewitching face and a smile quivered about her mouth what about the prince salim child she asked accusingly what about him mihrunnissa looked arch in return and positively made a moue of uncontrollable high spirits before she put on an air of immense and demure propriety nothing gracious lady am i not betrothed to sher afkan khan bibi azizan let loose an absolute shriek oh my liver ah ladies heard one ever the like mihrunnissa how darest thouit is not trueit is a lie a curious expression of untamed obstinacy came to the girlish face and gave it a character beyond its years lo marmita she said lightly when thou and afkans mother have settled whether i be betrothed or no there may be talk of truth till then i marry no one bibi azizan subsided helplessly limply amongst her cushions to say more might only induce the enfant terrible of malicious intent still further to reveal the family strife so there was room for umm kulsums tactful raillery what thou wilt be an old maid like me and without even a pilgrimage to thy credit fie thou art too pretty for jehannum mihrunnissa laughed scornfully i would rather jehannum on my own feet than paradise on a mans coattails la la i hate men folk there was a general gurgle of laughter the girls face grew crimsondark her eyes filled with tears yet flashed also and she held her ground tis true she cried stamping her bare foot with an almost soundless yet curiously imperative smack on the marble floor i hate themthey think of nothing but themselvesandand women and i hate women tooi want to be a queen and i will be one come hither child and let me look at thee said auntie rosebody suddenly holding out her hand the supple young thing crossed to her proudly and crouching low touched the small fine old fingers with her forehead thine eyes childthine eyes said the old woman let me see thy fate in them so for an instants space the great lustrous soft depths of mihrunnissas fathomless eyes were appraised she might keep himas he should be kept murmured auntie rosebody to herself but mihrunnissa was thinking of the queenship what does the most beneficent see she asked eagerly shall i be queenqueen myself i meanreal queen there was an instants pause and in the silence which hung over the whole room the imperious young voice seemed to linger then umm kulsum seeing a look of sudden recoil in aunt rosebodys face laughed cheerfully ask the witch wives mihro not us or stay lo auntie dost remember the red woman with her curious cry whom we saw at the tank steps but now and bade come hither since she claimed to be the royal bard she is brahmin and tells the stars she said let us have her in if she is here and then mihro can hear fortunes la cried bibi azizan catching at any side escape from what had gone before i can tell the ladies who the woman is she is madquite madand the more suitable for this subject of queenship remarked aunt rosebody dryly twisting her hair deftly to a topknot which greatly enhanced her dignity ooma see if one atma singer of pedigrees soothsayer heaven knows what waits without if so bid her enter and bring me a violet sherbet such as my fathermay peace be his alwaysloved when he was aweary of fools then bibi azizan can have her say in peace after which parthian shot she sipped her sherbet in silence she was inwardly amused at the cat which mihrunnissaan enchanting piece trulyhad so wilfully and deftly let out of the cupboard in truth there was some excuse for such vaulting ambition in the childs extraordinary beauty pity she had not been a few years olderpity nephew akbar would not put pleasure first and politics second in salims marriagepity ah pity in so many things may the gods pity us dreamers who dream of their godhead the old lady started at the quaintly apposite cry which seemed indeed to force the whole vestibule into a seconds silence atma devi stood at the far arches her poppypetal dress showing for an instant brilliant in the glimpse of sunlight let in by the upraisal of the curtain in truth her entry brought a new note to the chord of womanhood which vibrated in the atmosphere a note that was foreign to its harmony a quick sense of tragedy came to the comedy of laughing ladies something in atmas womanly face and figure that was in them also disguised tucked away hidden out of sight but still recognisable made them recoil to silence perhaps it was the not womanhood of the dark days before sex shows itselfthe notwomanhood which with the notmanhood go to make up the paradise life in which there shall be neither male nor female atma felt the recoil herself as her dark eyes questioned the scene before them challenging it in swift antagonism for the past two days her thoughts had been concentrated on her search for some clue of siyah yamin she had drifted about the bazaars giving her curious cry she had watched at street corners and listened patiently through the hurlyburly of passing voices for some hint some sound without avail and time was running short she would not have wasted one minute of it in obeying aunt rosebodys order to attend at the palace but for a dazed sense of duty she the kings charan must not neglect royal commands even siyah yamin must give way to them siyah yamin siyah yamin ye gods why had either of those two children who had played together grown up to be women why should any womanchild grow up to be hampered by her sex left helpless atmas thoughts as she stood mechanically shaking the hourglass drum paused her eyes in the darkness to which they were becoming accustomed had found something which brought answer to her questioning it was mihrunnissa who barely veiled by silver tissue sate a little way apart from the others on a yellow silken rug her slender arms were around her knees her head was tilted back against the wall on which a flower garland of the inlaid mosaic seemed to frame her delicate face as through halfclosed lids she returned the singers stare art thou a witchwife asked the little maid suddenly as if none but they two were in the room lo i am mihrunnissa queen of women tell meshall i indeed be queen not of them only but of men also the brushers and dressers paused in their avocations to look and listen something insistent compellent seemed to have come into the atmosphere even auntie rosebody paused in the sipping of her sherbet and waited for the answer to that stillchildish voice and those two stared at each other feeling vaguely akin the woman who strove to forget her sex in a mans work the girl who cherished it as a means of gaining a like power i offer excuse for interference came rakiya begums rasping voice but soothsaying except by reference to the holy book tis but for fun most noble pleaded umm kulsum who was invariably the smoother of difficulties and they did it at the holy city for i paid seven golden ashrafees to a woman with a crystal who told me naught that i did not know before the little ripple of surrounding laughter did not soften rakiya begums sternness a crystal she said severely taking a pinch of snuff is different that hath as all know its gift of god in certain hands but the looking at grains of rice and the counting of peasepods is irreligious and most derogatory to true believers therefore in the absence of our lady hamida the acerbity of this allusion to an occasionally divided headship in the harem was interrupted hastily by a twitter from the elder salima who addressed her daughter nervously in truth dear heart ummu twere better not mayhapthe woman is hindu mihrunnissa her head still tilted back against the garlanded wall looked through her lashes and her cupids bow of a mouth smiled bewilderingly i mind not that one flys weight she remarked cheerfully casually as if her likings or dislikings were the only question at issue come good red woman begin my fortune please atma hesitated here was a household divided against itself and beyond auntie rosebody and umm kulsum whose status she knew she was unaware of the position of the scented languidly laughing ladies around her yet a false step might be fatal to future right of entry it was a time for swift decisive action i tell no fortunes she replied i look only in the magic mirror after the fashion that a pious pilgrim of mahomed taught my father and if god sends a vision i see it was a fortunate hit rakiya begum sate stiff with excitement not the magic mirror of ink such as is used in room lo ladies this is a chance indeed and i at the moment in one of mypoor verses was using it as an allegory for the vast enlargement of the mind by literature good woman let us see the process without delay what dost require atmas native wit was equal to the occasion a drop of ink from the inkpot of the poetess must bring visions she replied readily and khanum rakiya begum smiled her approval so the inkpot came and atma her full red skirts billowing about her sank to the ground opposite mihrunnissa whose bare limbs the colour of freshly garnered wheat overlaid with a faint tinsel sheen showed almost white in contrast with the intensity of the scarlet then holding the inkpot high in her right hand the charan began to sing softly drop ink and hide my flesh cover my worldly ways then let gods light afresh mirror gods praise drop ink drop deep cover in sleep my night of nights and bring the day of days a little pool of ink lay with curved surface like a dewdrop on her left palm as the song ceased if the gracious child will almost touch the mirror with her left forefinger and complete the circle of magic by touching my right arm with her right hand she suggested in a mysterious monotonous voice for answer mihrunnissas firm little fingers closed round her wrist tightly aye it shall not stir she said coolly i want to know for certainno clouds and waves and mistsi want to know dost hear childishly imperative her eyes questioned atmas nay replied the latter feeling in a measure at bay the gracious maid must close her eyes i atma will look alone into the mirror and seeif god willsthe fortune of the princess aunt rosebodys laugh came sudden sarcastic not princess yet woman not as yet she continued turning to bibi azizan even in the inmost heart of the house of ghiass beg the lord treasurer i protest began the fat fashionable one feebly atma gave a swift glance round at the speakers and the little pool of ink in her palm wavered despite mihrunnissas almost fierce grip how now slave cried the latter i said no wavering there shall be none highness replied atma bending her brows over her task again but the mention of ghiass begs name had brought back the thought of siyah yamin for the only clue of any sort which the two days of search had given to atma was a possible connection between the lord high treasurers house and that of the syeds of barha they were distantly related by marriage it was the faintest of clues but the thought of it filled atmas mind in an instant with a pressing desire siyah yamin siyah yamin she must be found time was passing the very next morning the audience would be held siyah yamin siyah yamin i see naught she went on monotonously forcing herself to words foreign to her thoughtsi see i seewhat do i see a crowd of banners waving tis a marriage procession and lo the bridegroomohe like the young krishn for beautytall slim and fair thou liest came mihrunnissas voice full of passion thou dost not see it thou dost not as she spoke she flung up the wrist she held so roughly that the ink drops spurted over atmas scarlet dress then with a sudden bound she stood confronting her a tornado in silver tissue lo i was looking too and i saw no crowd no banners no bridegroom all i saw was siyah yamin playing on the lute as she played last night when she broke off with a sudden dismay then laughing round defiantly to her mother went on recklessly there i have let that muskrat go but i did see her marmita just as she sate last night when you and she bibi azizans shriek drowned the rest then came auntie rosebodys voice of horror siyah yamin atat thy house azizan this passes indeed go woman and venture hither no more i offer excuse remarked rakiya begum who had risen and come forward in sedate annoyance her stiff brocaded petticoat looked almost regal but her thin angular body still suffered from lack of attire and her veillessness showed her scanty hair screwed back tightly ready for subsequent additions withal she had a certain dignity of thin harsh high features and scraggy uprightness that question khanzada gulbadan kkanum is as the lawyers have it subjudice tomorrow the king decides decides echoed auntie rosebody wrathfully and if he does decidewhat then you cant beat a drum with one hand and all the other five fingers are in the butter no no marry her fifty times siyah yamin is siyah yamin you cant hide an elephant under a hencoop so there thats my say rakiya begum took a pinch of snuff and i say nothing a wise man learns to shave upon strangers meanwhile mihrunnissa her swift anger passing into amused wonder stood looking at the ink spots on the scarlet dress until suddenly her cupidsbow mouth curved itself into a smile twas thy fault she said nodding her head thou must have been thinking of her for i saw her clear but seethat for thy spoilt dress she tore off a gold bangle from her arm and held it out they were standing close together almost unobserved the rest of the company being more interested in crowding about the discussion which still went on regarding siyah yamin why wilt not take it continued the little maiden stamping her foot as atma devi drew back because i want a bigger boon she replied hurriedly seizing her chance a greater boon echoed mihrunnissa curiously aye almost whispered atma devi if the gracious childin truth her head well deserves a crownwould take this in exchange for me she hastily wrenched off a thin silver bandbracelet all too small for the matured wrist on which it was worn take it to siyah yaminitit is hers see there is her name upon it she pointed to a word engraved on the bracelet mihrunnissa took it and stood holding it her unfathomable eyes full of malicious contempt so there is a mystery la i love mysteriesthey are so easy to guess yea i will give itand find out is there any message none the childish face broke into almost sinister smiles then the bracelet means the message what is it come or go no matter i will find out she slipped the bracelet round her own slender wrist and turned away nonchalantly a veritable queen of women chapter ix fling back thy veil beloved lo how long shall it avail to hide thy womanish nature and so wrong thy beauty frail is it thou siyala atma holding the cresset high peered out into the darkness of the stair a tinkle of soft laughter came from the shadows so thou hast not forgotten the old signal ato yet it was years agone that i gave thee the bracelet and thou gavest me thine still have i come for the sake of it that is enough yasmeen i stay here till an hour ere dawn then fetch me the last was called in a low voice down the darkness and thereinafter followed the sound of retreating steps yet still no figure showed in the circle of cresset light wilt not come in siyal said atma impatiently if by chance someone came and found us women another tinkle of laughter rose from the shadows and out of them stepped swaggering a slender youth the very print and spit of fashion made taller by a highwound turban his hand on the jewelled scimitar stuck in his tightwound girdle they would say that atma devi had found a proper lover laughed the masquerader la atma on my soul i do love theethou art so monstrous serious and thy large eyes have a fire in them be mine sweet widow peace siyal this is not time for jesting come in and let me shut the door i have matters of privacy to say say on retorted the other gaily but not here and call me not siyal i am thy true lover sherkhan in truth atma here the voice changed to seriousness this disguise was necessary seeing where i bide in gods truth we bazaar women have to go for trickery to the chaste zenanas i had but to tell yasmeen i wished to go out and thisshe touched her costumewas forthcoming instanter lo i shall doubt every likely lad i see for the future as myself disguisedwho knows indeed but what i was born to be a man come sweetheart i cannot talk here come with thy sherkhan she stepped forward and laid her hand on atmas wrist whither asked the latter feeling as she looked at the feminine face set in masculine clothes the nameless charm of the woman in the man the man in the woman and wherefore the answer came short and sharp because if i am missed they will seek me here first mihrunnissa knows and sheshe has no mercy when she feels power we will go to my paradise i have the key still lord how i shall love it after this past fortnight of a virtuous cage lo the dew of heaven is not a satisfying drink soshe snatched at the cresset follow me sistersweetheartwidow if thou wiltwoman any way bah how dark it istruly they say the torchbearer sees not his own steps thus chattering in shrill whispers she led the way a key rattled in a lock there were more stairs then another door opened and they stood in siyah yamins paradise a deserted paradise indeed dark almost dreadful in its unseenness with only a rustle as of dead dried flowers and leaves coming to them with the faint breeze which blew in their faces from the darkness a faint scent as of withered blossoms came with it siyah yamin closed the door with a bang burst into a perfect cascade of laughter and then out of sheer delight and devilry pirouetted and postured down the central walk singing as she danced a ghazal from hafiz love love it is spring be thou of joyous heart truly the birds will sing roses be blossoming though we depart this is our little day this is the hour of play ere you and i be clay kiss me my heart kiss me alway with the cresset in her hand its lights and shades falling on the high turban with its waving green ends on the effeminate embroideries of her dandified dress and bringing out into filmy clouds the long floating coatee of goldspangled white muslin worn as a loose overall she seemed like the very spirit of sex neither male nor female careless of everything save reckless sensual pleasure so suddenly the lithe body stooped and from the cresset in her hand one of the many little oil lamplets edging the paths and encircling what had been flower beds ere neglect and noonday suns had left them shrivelled flickered into flame then another and another and another as swaying posturing singing she danced on into the shadows leaving behind her a pathway as of stars ere she reached the pavilion at the further end and sank breathless amongst its silken cushions a dim radiance was suffused over the roof showing the withered roses the trailing dead tendrils of the scented jasmine the litter of spent blossoms all the lees and dregs of a past pleasure the very table low to the ground its motheropearl inlaying all dustcovered still held a half emptied wine cup or two a leaf plate of halfrotten fruit lo siyala said atma suddenly looking almost tenderly at her companion as she lay bathed in the rosy light of the hanging lamp she had lit what art thou in very truth sometimes thou seemest to me of the stars at times thou art very earth the courtesan laughed i am woman she replied flinging her high turban aside and drawing the loose fallen tresses of her hair through her fingers lazily settling them in dainty fashion on her shoulders i wait as i have waited all the long ages for the man lo i am ready for his desire i am the uttermost nothingness which tempts form i am maya illusion and delusion her voice full of music and charm fell on the ear drowsily and thou atma she went on shall i tell thee what thou art thou art that which seeks notwhich gives and takes nothing in return thou art salvation yet thou canst not savethe woman is too strong for thee thou lovest the king the blood flew to atmas face thou liest she cried hotly siyah yamins laugh filled the emptiness of the roof thy denial proves it sister were it not wiser to accept thy womanhood ohe atma there is joy in drawing the strength of a man through his lipsin making him forget high thoughtsin dragging him down down to the very depths ofof nothingness her small bejewelled hand closed on the empty air yet atma shivered that emptiness seemed to hold so much she sate down on the steps and resting her chin on her hand remained crouched in on herself silent looking out over the dead roses lo here is wine came the gay voice pledge me in it atma does not hafiz say the cloister and the wine shop are not far apart no more is thy womans love from my womans love why shouldst thou try to make it mans love my love is a burning fire and aloewood is my heart the censer is my desire oh me how i shrivel and smart yet the flame mounts higher and higher oh love depart make not a funeral pyre of censer and heart the trivial song ceased siyala slipping from her cushions had slidden toward atma and now her chin resting on the latters broad shoulder was looking up at the brave steady face with cajoling menace in her eyes why and what willst thou ato there is no third way woman must be as ithe eternal nothingness which something sought in the beginning sought tempted by the desire for form which men seek now tempted by the woman form they have made tempted by me the courtesan who drains the good from them and flings it sterile on the dust heap of the world or they must be as thou art not instinct with motherhood draining the soul of man to hand it on in ceaseless conflict of sex of form and matter through the ages but thou ato thou wouldst be neither thou art mother of the past not of the future thou wouldst stand aside and give the man part of theetis in all women even in siyah yaminthou wouldst give this man part which has come to thee through thy fathers back all untouched by thy womanhood to the man thou lovest fool there is no such love for us womenkind there thou tellest truth siyal said atma coldly it is not love did i not tell thee so but i came not here for this we must speak and speak quickly so the two women half seen in the suffused light of the empty roof sate talking while the little lamplets twinkled like stars and every here and there one growing short of oil flickered and went out leaving a gap of darkness three counted the courtesan with a yawn as the mellow echoing notes of the city gongs chimed through the night tis time i were gone she caught up her turban coiled her long hair beneath it thus stood transformed at once into effeminate manhood and sherkhan she continued swaggering hath not had even one kisssweet widowthe perfume of thy hair is wrapped round my living soul peace siyal said atma who risen stood sombre thoughtful then i can do no more i have warned thee if thou swearest i will speak and i will denywhat then then is my death siyah yamin burst into a peal of laughter death trust the men folkayetrust the king to put a spoke in that wheel a woman is a woman and thou art too good looking lord i shall laugh to see it and thou so serious come let us drink to our success before we go she seized an empty wine cup then stood looking at it for a second checked by the sight of it it was a blown glass goblet damascened with gold she held it to the light her small childs face grown suddenly soft the cup of pleasure she murmured to herself how long is it since he gave it so with a laugh she filled it to the brim from a flagon that stood near thy health ato and thy lovers she cried lightly lo he who gave the cup was mine once but siyah yamin will never lack for men since she is woman she raised the cup to her lips but did not touch it then with a sudden gesture flung it far into the shadows it fell with a crash beside a withered rose bush and the red wine trickled through the dry earth to moisten the roots below come atma she continued nay leave the lights as they are they will outlast the stars anyhow a minute later siyah yamins paradise held nothing but the twinkling lights flickering out one by one yet she was right the rising sun found some of them burning bravely and the roseshaded lamp in the pavilion shone persistently on the silken cushions as if seeking for some one perhaps for her the palace was early astir that morning and little knots of men waited gossiping in corridor and vestibule it is not politic sighed abulfazl the common folk well ask who is gods viceregent on earth if a kings order is no order tis the devils own foolery spoke up birbal roughly bitterly the long beards wag loosely already and if akbar gives them a field they will take a barn and in truth a certain illdefined smirk sate on the concealed lips of the learned doctors of the law who stood in a bevy near the door to them even consideration of the vexed question was a distinct score it was a confession that the usurper of their office did not know his business to the general public assembling in force it was an occasion for curiosity for something new which might pave the way to almost anything only the syeds their hawk faces clustering close together their hands clutching at their sword belts seemed certain of the future a burst of the royal kettledrums in the distance echoed finally over a dense crowd packing the wide arches of the huge hallofaudience and stretching beyond them into the paved courtyard if he wear the luck still it will be something to go by muttered a weaklooking courtier who by his very dresscuriously nondescripthis shaven chin and high green turban showed a desire to run with the hare and hunt with the hounds there were many such in akbars empire men whose imaginations went so far with the king yet whose hearts failed them before the strangeness of his dreams another long loud burst of wild music and the king showed alone on the high raised dais canopied and latticed at the sides with fretted marble which opened at the back into the private passage reserved for royal use only by reason of the limited space in which he stoodthe central archway rising but a few inches above his headhe looked larger taller broader than his wont and as he glanced keenly over the packed multitude before him he showed every inch a king yet he was conscious that he alone of all his empire saw strength not weakness in his readiness for reconsideration that he only felt that the revocation of his order would be a greater display of kingly power than the original order itself standing as he did in shadow it took the crowd a silent second or two before it realisedwhat to it was a stupendous factthat in this critical new departure of their kings he was prepared to defy fate he had deserted his luck the tight wound turban of royalty did not show the dull glow of the great diamond a sort of shiver ran through the hall checked by the kings voice are the suitors and the witnesses in the case present he asked abulfazl stepping into the wide open square kept clear before the railed dais replied in the affirmative then proceed the singsong voice of the court reader filled the hushed air but from outside beyond the redtoothed arches came the morning song of many birds the sunlight filtered in with the song making akbars attention wander how trivial these petty questions of rights and wrongs seemed beside the great questions of life in itself bring forward the woman let her swear that she is true and lawful wife the crowd swayed at the back a domed red dhooli showed forcing its way to the front room room cried the ushers room room for the virtuous if it was virtuous there was still something in the very fall of the swinging silk curtains in the lift of the liveried bearers which set mens pulses abounding for it was siyah yamins dhooli and she was inside would she unveil would they see her again uttermost mistress of art absolute owner of guile a faint sigh of disappointment seemed to shudder through the crowd as in obedience to order the bearers set down the dhooli and removed the red domed cover thus disclosing a muffled figure which rose and salaamed low toward akbar something there was of ultimate grace in the salutation which made remembrance still more clear and sent a pang of resentment through many of those present that this perfection should no longer be public property a cupola of chastity indeed screened and guarded by veiled duennas not one in faith but two it was preposteroussiyah yamin the darling of the town woman came akbars voice wilt thou swear that thou art lawfully wedded to the exiled jamaluddin syed of barha there was an instants pause then a gay clear voice with a bubble of laughter in it replied yea i swear even though atma where art thou sister disguised as yon duenna ill go bail at her first word there was a faint scuffle a flinging aside of a burka a silver flash and almost ere she ended the charans cry rang out it is a lie i atma i give it the lie ye bright ones see me die avenge the lie the deathdagger of atma devis race rose high in the air above the silver fillet on her loosened hair and the next moment it would have been buried in the heart beneath the silver hauberk had not a mans voicenot kingly at all in its hurried commandcried quickly hold her as she staggered back her balance gone by birbals swift arrest of the blow a mocking voice fell on her ear did i not tell thee so sister thou art too goodlooking for death it had all passed so quickly that folks were still almost incredulously craning to see when sudden silence came to that group on the clear square before the dais to siyah yamin muffled in her chaste veil to atma devi with her bare defiance to birbals eager acute face as he still held back that hand with the dagger speak what hast thou to say said the king through the silence this came the reply clear resolute as atma devi drew from out her bosom a folded paper it was the death word of the kings charan take it and read said the king and abulfazl stepping forward took the paper his practised voice sounded sonorously through the wide hall avenge the lie for which i die siyah yamin is siyala daughter of gokal brahmin of chandankaura rajputana we are sisters of the veil i saw her married with the seven steps and the sacrificial fire to the deathdagger of my race which grants no divorce she is bride of the gods for ever and ever and ever the gods curse him who steals her from them ye bright ones avenge the lie is this true woman asked the king sternly from behind the veil came the gay mocking voice let her prove it by this time the first shock of surprise was over and men had begun to turn to each other questioning and appraising the validity of atmas plea and even if she can prove it oh mostillustrious began budaoni who from his translating work was cognisant of hindu customs even if this evil woman was dedicated to the gods what then she has read the creed she hath become musulmanshe is duly married if the mostillustrious will hear me put in birbal bowing lowhear me bhat brahmin as one with knowledge and authority i will tell the mostjust that this is no ordinary dedication of a girl to the service of the gods devadasis there beaye even those married to a dagger or a basil plant on whom rests no lifelong deathlong tie but this is not of thosemarried with the seven steps to a charans deathdagger accursed be he accursed be thou hindu cried a voice from the crowd and in an instant hands found swordhilts and faces grew fierce sire he is right called rajah man singh the woman belongs to the godswho claims her takes her through my body idolater rose an answering sneer what islam claims is gods but behind these voices in the packed mass of the crowd men looked at each other dubiously hindu at mahommedan mahommedan at hindu should they claim this woman or let her go if this slave may offer opinion came abulfazls sonorous voice above the growing clamour the question must wait for proof enough said akbar sternly he had been standing with bent brows staring at atma and at the veiled figure beside her lost in thought then he turned to birbal on thee maheshwar rao called by me birbal the burden of inquiry shall rest speak as thou wilt answer to thy gods if what yon womanhe pointed to atma devisays be true would this marriage to the dagger hold against all others quick and sharp came the answer the marriage is inviolable sacred for time and for eternity then there must be proof what proof hast thou his voice softened slightly with the words atma devi standing tall and straight flung her left arm skyward i have none none save my own word i saw itwe were children and i cried because she left me yea i remember the bitterness of my tears there was a sudden gay laugh from the veilings at her side a sudden wreathing and curving of draperies and in an instant the woman within them stood revealed revealed not as the late wedded bride not even as siyah yamin the courtesan but as siyala the dancing girl of the gods her nutbrown body bare save for the tiny goldencrusted bodice following each swelling line of her bosom rose seductively supple from the innumerable fulnesses of the thin white muslin skirt which after clinging close to the loveliness of curve from hip to knees fulled out like a bursting flower weighted by its heavy banding of gold tissue she wore no veil but her loose flowing hair was wreathed with jasmine chaplets and round her neck floating with each exquisite movement of her arms was a multicoloured gossamer silk scarf rainbow hued evanescent everrecurring holding in its loopings its doublings something of the absolute grace of a coiling serpent and through the wide hall packed full of men instinct with anger malice hatred and all uncharitableness there ran swiftly at the mere sight of her a common admiration a common tremor of fear and hope even the king stepped back from her pure womanhood lo weep not ato wherefore should any weep when all life is for laughter she said and her polished voice sounded mysteriously sweet great king she says truth i am siyal beloved of the gods beloved of the godhead in the man i am no mans wife i am no mans mistress i am free to have and hold she flung both arms forward to the crowd and the rainbow scarf leaping up formed a halo round her head come come she murmured deeply almost drowsily but seek not to bind or ever you were i was yet i am yours her eyes flashed down upon those liveried bearers of her dhooli servants of her courtesanship raise me shoulder high slaves she cried so that all may see siyal the beloved of the gods the beloved by men so shoulder high she stood smiling while a hoarse passionate breath surged through the vast assembly and then suddenly she set up the oldest chant in the world the golden jingles about her feet clashing to its rhythm the heavy gold bracelets sliding and clashing on her arms as she waved them in the dance of the devaadasi i am the dancer prakrit the wanton of change and unrest and the sound of my dancing feet roused the sleeper selfemmeshed and the eyes that were blind with peace looked out and saw i was sweet so the worlds whirled to my feet and life grew big with increase death danced in the arms of birth and tears were coupled with mirth and cold things hurried to heat and heat to flame and fire till the whole world racked with desire kept time to my dancing feet prakrit prakrit she paused in her swift twirling and the long sinuous end of her silken scarf which had floated round her undulating almost alive in its likeness to the clutching creeping arm of an octopus hovered in the air for a second then fell on her outstretched arm in delicate desireful folds something like a faint sigh breathed through the audience there was no other sound every man was spellbound as swaying posturing yielding she went on allure in her eyes her voice i am the woman prakrit the keeper and wanton of sex and the clash of my dancing feet is a lure that ruins and wrecks mens lips touch mine and desire the nothingness that is sweet and their souls flock to my feet to die in a kiss of fire and i give them death for life and i bring them sorrow and strife as i suck their senses away as they follow and follow for aye the fall of my dancing feet prakrit prakrit prakritiprakritiprakriti the answering cry came multitudinously but on it came the voice of the king syeds of barha do you claim this woman or shall she go there could be but one answer with that unveiled unabashed figure challenging every eye flaunting before all men making their very bodies and souls thrill to the cadence of her dancing feet the syeds hands felt their sword hilts sullenly but their spokesman had no choice of words let her go we of barha harbour no harlotsno idolaters so through the audience in obedience to her sign the servants of her courtesanship carried her seated discreetly smiling decorously salaaming but once outside the crowd which followed her to satanstown caught up the song she had sung and bellowed it to the skies filling the lanes and byways with the tale which told so many ways brings the mind back at last to the beginning of all thingsto the sleeper sleeping selfemmeshed as the procession passed a narrow turn two men dressed as natives almost of native complexion yet of such curious dissimilarity of features from the crowd around them that the eye picked them out instinctively as strangers stood back on a high piled doorstep to escape the crush vadre retro satanas muttered the taller of the two crossing himself and thus giving a glimpse of a violet ribbon on his breast hung with the portuguese order of christ its white cross charged upon a red one glistened for an instant in the sun like silver they were jesuit missionaries and the smaller of the two as he watched crossed himself also and murmured under his breath god help us she is like a madonna and in truth siyah yamin silent possibly fatigued by the excitement seated with her childish face upraised her eyes seemingly full of wistful thought fixed on vacancy as if somewhere out of sight lay something very precious looked innocent enough to touch that other pivot of feminine life motherhood and i give them death for life and i bring them sorrow and strife and i suck their senses away as they follow and follow for aye the fall of my dancing feet prakrit prakrit the chorus bellowed out to the skies as the procession swept on leaving father ricci and father rudolpho acquaviva to continue their way to the little mission chapel which akbar had built for them so they went on their way while in lessening sound came the chorus which holds the secret of the sin for which all religions promise forgiveness it brought a vague throbbing restlessness to the hot air chapter x opportunity flies o brother as the clouds that quickly pass make use of it now for another will never be yours alas hafiz birbal lo it is always birbal may gods curse light on him for an infidel prince salims young sullen face lowered gloomily he flung aside the halftasted sweetmeat he had taken from the golden basket which was always held within his reach by a deaf and dumb slave ameen murmured mirza ibrahim piously khodadad who in the petit comite of the heirapparents innermost circle of friends was enjoying the newly imported luxury of smoking puffed a cloud into the scented air smiled bowed gravely finally yawned in truth the prince wearied him not a little with his childish petulance his hasty resentments his invariable failure to take action for he had just enough of his father in him to desire power to feel aggrieved at his own subordinate position yet not sufficient to make him set his desire above comfort even above family affection they managed such matters better in sinde there since time immemorial fathers had killed superfluous sons sons had killed a superfluous father and brother removed brother without ridiculous reference to relationship khodadad looked at the heirapparent negligently through a blown ring of tobacco smoke and appraised him critically in a way it was true this great lout of a lad formed the most convenient nucleus round which conspiracy against the king might gather since he would carry with him the sympathy of the orthodox that is of at least twothirds of the court but if he would not move he must be left behind and conspiracy must go on without him it was nothing to sinde who sate on the throne of india so it were not akbar with his strong hand on the throat of all rulers who chose to rule in the good old fashion if salim could be squared well and good sinde would help him to his ownon condition but if not khodadads sinister face grew more sinister that ended it anyhow continued mirza ibrahim who was recounting the events of the morning for the prince was a late riser and seldom attended audience his majesty appealed to the infidel who was backed of course by other idolaters such as man singh prince salim shot a savage glance at the speaker have a care fool he cried man singh will be of my house when i am married mirza ibrahim spread out his hands in apology this slaves tongue slipped over the tangled knot of matrimony he replied suavely but as i say the king forwarded by birbal and others of his kidney began to inquire the firebrand of a madwomanshe was a picture for looks as she stood breathing defianceby the prophet i envied the idolater his hold upon herbegan on childish tears and ere one could cry rotten fruit there was siyah yamin true daughter of the devil outraging everybody and making each mans skin thrill to her dancing feeteven i dare swear the king your fathers if he be human enough for such frailty prince salim gloomed round from another sweetmeat some men stand above humanity sir chamberlain he said sullenly as some who call themselves men sit below monkeys mirza ibrahim lifted his eyebrows in courtly surprise bowed and went on undisturbed in truth the jade was superb so they carried her back shoulderhigh to satanstown where half the young blades still linger hoping for a smile but not i the madwoman is my quarry strange one can look fifty times at a woman and only fancy her the fiftyfirst he spoke calmly as one who took his amours rationally and the syedan what said they asked the prince what could they say with that dancing daughter of the devil all unveiled in gods truth they breathed the more free knowing themselves rid of the necessity for sooner or later sewing her into a sack and committing her and their honour to the silent bottom of the nearest river khodadad laughed suddenly immoderately it will be a jest to hear the tale of how the virtuous mothers of barha received the darling of the town as daughterinlaw let us appoint a time for it what say you my prince salim frowned his silence he was in a virtuous mood that morning having as yet hardly recovered his rebellion after the check his father had given to it ibrahim looked at khodadad with a covert sneer and took up provocation the most illustrious prince had better ask of birbal what the syedan said or what akbar did since he only was present at the secret interview prince salim burst out with an oath curse birbal i would to god the jesting hound were dead khodadads evil face came up alert eager from his smokewreaths is that in truth the wish ofof the most excellent the heirapparent to the throne of india he asked and there was something in his steady stare which made salim shift his eyes evasively what good were death he grumbled twould but make him and his advice grow in grace with my father as do all folk who die in sanctity if thou couldst kill the kings trust in him that would be different it also might be compassed suggested khodadad suavely but once more salim said nothing ibrahim concealed a yawn by putting a scented sweatmeat into the cavern of his mouth then proceeded with his daily task of poisoning the princes mind against authority yet seeing that our gracious king akbar gives up his luckas folk say he hathto the infidel birbals wisdom may yet be needed so twere a pity his luck what mean you asked the prince quickly khodadad shrugged his shoulders lightly the diamond most noble was not in the kingly turban at the audience and folk saywith what truth i know notthat it hath gone to the english jeweller to be cut western fashion salims heavy face became vital in an instant with a curious mixture of anger and fear gone he echoed my father has no rightit is mine to wear also when i am king i tell thee tis an heirloom of luck mayhap the luck will not be cut out of it mayhap it is but talk after all put in ibrahim deftly diminishing the immediate wound so that its venom might have time to work remember the saying the truth none heed lies are the worlds creed time enough for trouble when your turn comes meanwhile let us sing he let his hand stray idly to the strings of the latest fashionable instrument which stood by his side it was a sort of guitar shaped like a peacock real feathers being let into the frets to form a tail nothing on earth is hidden in the field the little buds of ruby or of pearl burst into flowers so tinted and the blaze of diamonds in hard marble heart concealed waits for times touch on all things to unfurl their stony shroud and give them back the rays in which gems glisten as they were always the tinkle of the satara and the high trilling voice filled the quaint arches of the building in which the prince lounged idly surrounded by all the luxuries of young and sensual life it was the panchmahal or five palaces that puzzle to archaeologists of today few of whom seem to know that it was built as a playground for akbars longlookedfor eagerlyloved heir to many hopes here from sun or storm alike shelter could be found shelter that could bring with it no sense of being cribbed cabined or confined since in these four columnsupported and arcaded platforms each superimposed on the next in lessening squares no two things are absolutely alike carven capital fluted pillar and scrolled entablature each tell a different tale and in the wide aisles open to every wind of heaven a child might learn almost as it might learn from nature the unending mutation the ceaseless variety of life whether it served its purpose who can say one thing is certain salim as he lay sullenly resentfully searching the long processions of bird and beast fruit and flower magical monsters and mythical men that lay carven before his eyes seeking therein more cause for rebellion found himself assailed on all sides by the memory of an eagerfaced teacher who called him son his father yes a deep unreasoning jealous affection lay at the bottom of half his unreasoning revolt so as he lay divided between resentment and pride the sound of many hoofs outside disturbed the sleepy afternoon air a swift step took the steep stairs to the second story in its stride and akbar showed at the stairhead unannounced he was in riding dress with untanned leathern gaiters to the knee his white cloth jerkin buckled tight with a broad leathern belt on his grizzled hair he wore a closefitting leathern cap cut like a chainhelmet it was devoid of all ornament save a herons plume at the side his lean figure and alert air made him look years younger than his age and his entry brought instant change of atmosphere to the perfumed indolence of the young princes court akbars quick eye took in at a glance the sweetmeat baskets held appetisingly near by slaves beautiful or quaint the scent fountains the fighting avitovats the diceboxes and all the other paraphernalia of luxurious sloth come boy he said sharply thou canst not stay idling here till bedtime i come to challenge thee to a game of chaugan elders against youngers see you and i and birbal will he turned affectionately as he spoke to the latter who had followed him more leisurely but the very conjunction of names was sufficient for salim his lustreless eyes flashed sudden fire he was on his feet in a second so be it noble father he cried since being foe to you makes me foe also to rajah birbal i am content without a moments pause khodadad was on the princes heels in provocation nay most puissant heir to empire he cried with a sort of servile swagger filch not my foe from me firsts pair with firsts seconds with seconds so i khodadad lieutenant of the princes team claim birbal as my compeer to stand or fall together in all things there was no mistaking the utter unfriendliness of the challenge akbar stood frowning but birbal suave sarcastic only smiled not in crime tarkhanjee i bar crime tis one thing to murder or steal without fear of punishment another even to lie with a bowstring about ones neck so seeing the most excellent of lieutenants through being tarkhan hath a supremacy in sin i pray so far to be excused twill but bring khodadad one step nearer to judgment he turned on his heel as he spoke then continued nonchalantly will your majesty choose sides nay replied the king making an effort to restore goodhumour shaikie shall choose his and a cast of the die as ever settle minesave only for thee may he be accursed muttered the young prince as he flung aside his deftlypiled and jewelstrung turban to don a closeeared leathern cap like his father his mind was full of vague anger against that father had he indeed parted with the luck of the house leaving him the heir forlorn of hope that must be birbals doing birbal with the sneering bitter tongue which found out the joints in ones armour with such deadly skill it was already late afternoon an hour or even less would see the rapid indian dusk settle down over those wide plains below the sikri ridge but as yet the suns slanting rays shone on the chaugan ground catching the gilt spikes of the red boundary flags and the red and gold boundary ropes which were held at intervals by pages dressed to match in red and gold within the oblong thus marked out the glittering white and gold and red and silver teams loosing their lean low betasselled ponies in preliminary canters or gathering in knots to discuss the tactics of the coming game made the scene show like some richly jewelled square of embroidery stretched out among the dusty levels closely akin to polo chaugan was par excellence the game of mogul india and akbar excelled at it holding it to be no mere play but a means of learning promptitude and decision a test of manhood a strengthener of the bonds of friendship it differed chiefly from the modern form of the game in having no set goal the whole of each end of the oblong being counted as one so as a single flourish from the royal nakarah sounded ten riders ranged themselves at the farther end of the ground eager alert their mounts and themselves hard held all eyeseven those of the poniesfixed on the ball which was held high in the kings right hand on either side of the tense vibrating line stood a pony one for either team its rider holding it by the reins ready on the instant to fling himself into the saddle and ride out to replace anyone disabled in the game beyond these again at each corner was a group of other ponies other riders also ready when the gong sounded every twenty minutes to ride out and replace two players in either team thus ensuring a constant supply of fresh blood fresh zest for the fight are you ready sahiban shouted the king and with the cry dashed forward the tense vibrating line giving a wild whoop was not a second behind him and so tassels waving sticks carried like lances came a veritable tornado of a charge that swept up to the centre of the ground where a red patch of brickdust showed set foursquare ralph fitch who with his companions was watching the strange new game perhaps the first englishman who saw polo played felt his pulses bound with excitement at this forward dash they be sportsmen anyhow he muttered under his breath bravo bravo for akbars nimble little bay arab pony who played the game as keenly as its master had propped on the red delivery point and stood quivering with the arrest while its rider holding back in his stirrups for all he was worth sent the ball spinning skyward with an awkward twist on it then gripped his club held till then with his reins hullullalalalaharriho arinilakunta the confused cries rose from the wrestling knot of caps sticks tassels hoofs and swinging arms which in an instant gathered a whirling nebula of potential force about that nucleus point of a halfseen falling ball ibrahim shouted khodadad whose vicious chestnut hard held flung itself high in air almost unseating its rider to the left or the king has it so swift as light aid and prevention hustled each other all so quickly that a snapshot would hardly have registered the contest until a click faint yet loud enough to fill each heart with joy or anger told that the kings stick catching the ball fairly ere it fell had sent it away in a clear swooping flight he has itride ride rose the cry from both sides and away they went helterskelter pellmell too late however for either side to intervene for the ball driven with a will dropped rebounded fell again within a foot of the fatal line at the end and so easily softly trickled over it well hit father called prince salim forgetful of anything but sheer pride in the kings prowess his face nevertheless lowered again as in accordance with custom the defeated five rode back along the sides of the ground toward the starting end pausing every twenty paces to pirouette their ponies and to salaam to the victors who when the conquered had reached their places rode triumphantly at a canter down the middle to take up theirs but consolation comes in all games and the next throwup decreed that the king shouldnot unwillinglymake obeisance to his son after a hard tussle the third goal also went to the juniors for whether due to the replacing in the kings team of rajah man singh by that inferior player his cousin bhawun singh or to a trifle of lameness in akbars little arab certain it is that after much swinging and driving of the ball backward and forward the cry arose amongst the spectators he hath itkhodadad hath it this time and there was the tarkhan his eyes glued on the ground deliberately trundling the ball along safe clipped in the crook of his stick while the prince and dhara beside him rode off all attempts at rescue he hath birdlime on it muttered birbal as he swooped down fruitlessly the ball trickled on deftly and even the king galloped forward to defend the goal but it was in vain for in the final melee someonein the dust and glamourgod knows who gave the final impetus and the victors and vanquished wiped their streaming foreheads ere recommencing another struggle it began on both sides with almost fierce determination gods truth it stirs the blood gasped ralph fitch he had seen many wonders at the court of the great mogul but none so germane to his temperament as this it was a game worthy of englishmen he thought almost prophetically since its lineal descendant polo has made india bearable to generations of an english garrison so while john newberys eyes wandered over the jewels of the spectators around him and william leedes found his attention too much concentrated on the kings figure for due grip on the game as a whole it was ralph fitch who despite distance dusk and dust cried excitedly he hath it againthe sindi hath it once more true enough through the looming medley of dust men horses khodadad by many considered to be the best player of chaugan this side the indus showed ahead trundling the ball as he might have trundled an iron hoop in a hooked iron stick but this time he had the king to contend with back birbal it will come back shouted akbar suddenly and khodadads thin lips set firmer his wrist stiffened itself in downward pressure as just ahead he saw a faint inequality of the ground no the ball should not rise nor swerve not even if the hammerhead of the kings stick lay so close ten thousand devils it was but a quarter of an inch but it was enough for dexterityand like a lofter at a bunkered golf ball akbars club was underneaththe next instant played backhanded the ball shot rearward to birbals keeping khodadad riding back amongst the defeated with a wrist which still felt the forceful grapple of akbars cursed under his breath he had been bested and everything else was forgotten for the moment in pure personal anger the thought of revenge rose in him unhampered even by care for personal safety for was he notas birbal had taunted him with beingtarkhan unpunishable that is till he had told his full tale of crime the hindu dog might have to learn this to his cost the dusk had fallen here and there among the throng of spectators beyond the boundary ropes the twinkling light of a wandering sweetmeatseller showed dimly amid the dust and high on the towering palaces which backed the ground a few faint gleams from a lamp within gave outline to some latticed window or corbeilled balcony the game stands drawn said prince salim wiping the sweat from his brow it grows too dark for more dark tis never too dark for victory cried akbar gaily let us have out the blazeballs shaiki twill be a point in thy favour young eyes being sharper than old so choose thy team and mine shall choose itself either way they were likely players who ranged themselves in line while the blazing ball of pilas wood soaked in oil was handed to the king in the earthenware cup of a pipe stem he held it aloft flaring we play for life or death gentlemen he laughed as with a bound his favourite countrybred mare bijli the fastest pony in the royal stable answered to the spur for life or death murmured khodadad giving the rein to his mount a chestnut sindi stallion almost oversized for the game but savagely keen in the playing of it by this time a perpetual film of dust lay square over the ground showing lighter than the undimmed dusk around it and the watching eyes of the spectators strained into it seeing now a faint star of light as the blazing ball sped onward now a cloud of darkness as the huddled riders followed on its track not all of them however one rider held aloof evidently biding his time for something which every instant of growing darkness would favour it was khodadad tarkhan a sinister indifference possessed him if the chance came as come it might he had made up his mind to take it a purely accidental collision would at least serve his purpose of personal revenge without much personal risk his being by far the heavier horse while its rider of course would be prepared for the shock yes if the chance came like a skimming meteor the ball shot to the right of him and the kings voice came close on it ride birbal ride which of them was on the ball no matter thought khodadad either was fair quarry he dug his spurs into the vicious chestnut and cut across to take them on the flank birbal yes that was birbals little gray all the better since there could be no doubt as to who would have the worst of it the hindu pig would at least get a fall heavy enough to send better men to jehannum khodadads malicious chuckle ceased abruptly a lean bay head showed close to his stirrup leather and he realised in an instant that he was observed yes he was being ridden offridden off by the king damn him well let him try two could play at that game he jagged fiercely at the chestnuts tight rein and overborne the bay head yielded a point but the pace of the brute was the devil what right had even kings to ride racers at chaugan if once it crept past the stirrup level curse it another fierce jag overreached its mark the vicious beast he rode threw up its head flung out its feet so losing half a stride and khodadad beside himself with sheer temper struck it madly over the ears with his polostick that finished it with a scream of rage and fear it plunged forward almost knocking over the smaller horse by force of its superior weight but the next instant it was on its hind legs beating the air vainly while the little bay at full racing stride swept under the battling hoofs only however to find itself in fresh danger a horseman unseen till then had been creeping up on the right in support of khodadad akbar who had been giving bijli the rein in reckless devilry uttered a sharp cry as he recognised salim collision was inevitable and the wonder as to which would suffer most flashed through the kings mind as after one vain almost unconscious tug he realised the position flung his stick from him dug spurs to the bay and gripping it all he knew with his knees rode straight to the crash it came but as it came akbars arm clipped his son and borne on by the fierce impetus of bijlis pace the two shot forwardakbar underneathover the bays head to lie stunned for a moment by the fall the king was the first to speak thou art not hurt shaikie he gasped the breath wellnigh pommelled from him by the princes weighty body not i gasped salim in his turn beginning to realise what his father had done for himbutthouthou art bleeding from the nose only replied akbar cheerfully as a crowding posse helped him to rise it was thy foot did itgod sent as much strength to thine arm nay gentlemen we are unhurt the assurance was needed for already on all sides the cry had risen the king is downthe king is killed and folk were in the dusk and gloom pressing round a figure which still lay prostrate on the ground and those on the outside of the everthickening ring could not see that it was only khodadad knocked out of time for the moment by that backward flung stick of the kings which had caught him fair on the cheek bone and felled him like an ox akbar walked over and looked at him contemptuously lo tarkhan he said briefly to the man struggling back to consciousness in ibrahims arms ride not soso reckless again or ill may befall thee tarkhan though thou be chapter xi sing me a ditty sweet singer i sue afresh and afresh anew and anew sing of the wine cup the red roses brew afresh and afresh anew and anew sing of my sweetheart close claspt to my side loves lips to her lips in secret confide kisses to

morning that flyest so fleet haste thee ah haste thee to her happy feet tell her the tale of her lover so true afresh and afresh anew and anew siyah yamin paused ending the songwhich echoes and reechoes through every harlots house in indiawith a gay flourish of her small fingers on the drum which had been throbbing a monotonous accompaniment she looked more like a piece of confectionery than ever in saffron and white and silver and her indifferent laugh rang through the arches of her balconied room and out into the wickedest alley in satanstown without a hint of anything in it save pure contentment contentment at being set free from unwelcome trammellings contentment at being once more the darling of the town as for ato serious old ato with her mock heroics she siyala bore her no grudge for having supplied an excellent opportunity for dramatic effect of course the memory of tears had precipitated matters somewhat but the denouement was foreordained had not she come prepared for it with her dancing clothes her dancing feet thus she lay lazily contentedly among her cushions and watched mirza ibrahim and khodadad smoking their drugged pipes in her balcony her house was the rendezvous of all evil things and scarcely a plot was hatched without her knowing something of it so after a time she rose silently as a carpet snake and crept behind their backs then she laughed hast not hit on payment yet for thy scarred cheek khodadad she asked derisively lo it spoils thy beauty friend and i have a mind to pass thee off as damaged goods to yasmeena over the way she is not bad as a mistress though somewhat too stout but there when the stomachs full the eye sees god daughter of the devil muttered khodadad succinctly siyah yamins childish face grew hard and clear as if it were carved in crystal bandy no names o gift of god she said disdainfully who made me made thee are there not ever two splits in a pea yet would not i sit still with a firebrand in my face she pointed at the red mark left by akbars polo stick neither do we broke in ibrahim angrily leave us to our talk fool we will hit this time on some plan with which no womans lack of good faith can interfere siyah yamin yawned imperturbably what would you she replied i am better as i am as the rat said when the cat invited him out of his hole thy party purpose did not suit me but blame me not with the luck that lies ever with the king curse him muttered khodadad sullenly and the courtesan gave another evil little laugh yea even at chaugan thou hast no chance she went on maliciously tis a pity he was not killed lo being so stunned thou couldst not realise what the mere rumour of his death meant or thou wouldst regret thy failure still more the bazaar rang with the news for halfanhour half groaning half cheering then was the time for action not now when the blind giant of india formed of fools like my friends here is ready once more to drive home akbars javelin head where it lists to go god did you but hate him as i woman hate him the man what wouldst thou do harlot asked ibrahim turning on her sharply what couldst thou do she halfclosed her sleepylooking eyes and stared out into the sunshine in which the lane below lay festering not a hundred yards away in the sunshine also lay the high road from the great stretches of fields where the peasants toiled uncomplainingly to the palace where the king dreamt his dream that was born out of due time and along it the workers were passing bringing in the fruits of their labour piled baskets of greenskinned melons red earthenware pots of milk creaking wains of corn for them life was simple untouched by the imagination of either evil or good for them even the gossip of their townbred neighbours was unreal fantastic what would i do pandar replied the courtesan slowly her eyes brightening in measure with her words her voice gaining strength from her evil fancies if i believed that the luckstone of akbar brought luck as thou dost it should be mine stay it should be mine and bring discredit on the beast birbal to whose charge tis given hold interrupt me not i see furthersuch thoughts come with the thinking aye i would make prince salim the thief and so force him to revolt see you not see you not akbars every thought of empire is bound up in the boythat would be revenge indeed there is no tie so strong as the tie of blood loose that and the ship of a mans mind may go adrift make his son the thief i say by guile if thou willst but make salim the thief her large eyes had grown larger with her evil dreamings they sate and looked at her as the fascinated bird looks at the snake impossible murmured the lord chamberlain feeling nevertheless an answering quiver of assent naught is impossible to ultimate guile she went on every atom of her seeming to gain in vitality as her dream of deceit unfolded itself to her ready mind where is the diamond keptdost know khodadad spoke then he was gathering initiative from her malice he knows he said nodding his head at ibrahim as chamberlain he must know where it cannot be touched retorted the palace official sullenly in the hall of labour guarded besentinelled day and night no chance of theftsave by deep treachery and there is none to bribe shall i offer a price to virtueridden budaoni court preacher who works there at his translations or blazon our attempt abroad by approaching the rajput soldiery or the kings paid artizans khodadads face fell in truth bribery in such a stronghold of the kings as the hall of labour where the best workmen were employed at fabulous wages seemed hopeless but siyah yamins took on a sudden expression of amused contempt so she began but they are men that is enough for me and one of them is diswuntdiswunt the kings crippled painter aye assented the lord chamberlain still more sullenly diswunt who is devoted to his master tis next his studio the englishmans lathe is set up farthest therefore from the door farthest from treachery siyah yamin stretched her beautiful arms in an allembracing gesture and leant back against the wall that was grimed by a hundred a million such contacts with vicious humanity what wilt give me for the diamond ibrahim she said suddenly a thousand golden pieces i will not take a dirrhm less twill serve to pay the crazy painter for his likeness of me hast seen it no she clapped her hands and sate up with an odd expression of doubt dislike and desire on her small childish face then thou shalt see andand condemn it what drumbanger she went on sharply as deenas wicked old face showed at the stairhead in answer to her call how now where is nargiz gone out princess leaving me the while devising a new devils dance for my lord chamberlains delectation this evening he entertains the kings friends siyah yamin interrupted a malicious leer at ibrahim with scant courtesy peace fool go fetch the portrait of me diswunt painted these gentlemen would see it well she added when a minute or two afterward four pairs of eastern eyes were gazing at a picture which offended every canon of eastern art here were no tiny smooth surfaced stipplings no delicate dottings of jewellery no faultless complexion no plastered hair even its size its composition were unconventional this was a lifesized facethe face and no morepeering out of a white swathing veil which filled up the small oval panel on which it was painted but it stood there propped against the humanitygrimed wall a veritable marvel in the fierce determination to be quit of all convention which showed in its every touch the fighting quails called from their shrouded cages below the sounds of the bazaar drifted upward and on these sounds came ibrahims sudden contemptuous laugh thou shouldst keep it as a scarecrow for unwelcome lovers he said idly by god even hot lust would fly from such a churail footnote a very dreadful female ghost siyah yamin flushed angrily and bent forward to look at the picture more closely something there was even in its outrageous originality which she as woman recognised as true the lad meant well being my lover she murmured softly then her eyes turned to mirza ibrahim with a whole world of malice in them thou shouldst get him to paint such an one for thee of atma devi friend it might serve to heal thee ofof her scant courtesyto say nothing of her bruises the lord chamberlain grew purple with rage curses on her he cried how didst hear did the jade dare to tell the courtesan interrupted him with absolute contempt truly thou hast a poor purblind brain concerning women mirza couldst not see man with half an eye that ato is not of those who speak of insult nay twas old deena yonderwho spends half his time with vice and half with virtuewho when thou wast attempting to thrust thyself upon her saw thee put through the door and trundled down the stair like a bad baby fie upon thee sonling the raillery of her voice matched the derisive shaking of her jewelled finger as he rose sullenly muttering curses and swearing to stop the old drumbangers loose lip aye thou canst do it with a handful of gold yawned siyah yamin deenas mouth just holds twenty good gold pieces i have had to gag him myself ere now farewell then conspirator i will take a thousand of those same myself for the kings luck not one dirrhm less mirza ibrahim stood arrested at the stair head angry as he was he knew her wit and a glance at khodadads face showed that he knew it also how wilt thou compass it he asked sullenly she looked at him jeeringly by my wits friend have i not all the vice of all india at my finger tips is not pahlu the subtlest thief in hindustan amongst my brethren do not the stranglers and poisoners and beguilers rub shoulders with virtuous gentlemen as ye in this my house nay leave it to me mirza leave it to me the courtesan she lay softly laughing to herself when they had gone until deena the drumbanger coming up the stairs with laboriously secret creakings whispered mistress atma devi hath been waiting below for a private interview this hour past shall she come then she sate up suddenly serious ato she said yes let her comelet her come there was an almost malicious content in her tone for she realised that here was metal worthy of her steel that in the coming interview she would have no crass heavy mans brain and heart to deal with but a womans dull they might be it is true yet would they be full of intuitions of sudden unexpected grip on motive and sudden clarities of vision yet for this alone atma devi might be useful to her in the immediate future since she would need every atom of knowledge every possible fulcrum ere she could lay hands on the kings luck aye atma might help though she was for the king but that made it all the more imperative all the more worthy skill that she should be bent from her purpose and be made unconsciously to work for the kings disadvantage so once more the whole vitality of the courtesan leapt up toward evil woman against woman aye that was it woman glorying in her serpentbruised heel against woman treading on the serpents head woman the temptress against woman the saviour dimly she saw thisthe unending conflict of the worldas she gave greeting with a mysterious smile on her babyface to the tall somewhat gaunt figure with the harassed perturbed look in its great grave dark eyes in truth no imagination could have conceived a more subtle antagonism than lay between those two women as they sate for a second in silence looking at each other across diswunt the crippled painters picture which still stood against the wall something there seemed to be indeed in this mans ideal of the woman he loved of his endeavour to solve the mystery of womans dual nature which jarred upon the nerves of both these types of womanhood for as their eyes met siyah yamin laughed hurriedly and pointed dost recognise it she asked atma devis straight brows showed level and steady as she looked aye she answered then added swiftly lo siyah with that before thee i marvel thou canst be so unkindto a poor lad who loves thee the last words came softly lingeringly for love was still to atma the one thing worth having in the world though she denied it strenuously the craving for it lay behind all her claims to charanship vaguely she knew it vaguely she was ashamed of it not more unkind than he who would fain thrust deformity upon my love retorted the courtesan airily lo ato even thou with all thy fine feelings couldst not love crooked legs and a hunchbackthe king hath neither then wherefore should i be kind wherefore indeed assented atma disdaining her own flush so why not give him dismissal instead of keeping him as thou dost on the rack see you i speak warmly in that he had his food from my fathers house for service done before the king found him drawing dogs upon a white wall with a burnt bone and reft him from us for teaching thus it grieved me to see him but now so distraught so but now echoed siyah yamin sharply what hast been at the hall of labour atmas face fell nay not there no woman finds entry there else had i seen for myself and not come to thee seeking news her troubled eyes sought siyah yamins almost resentfully news echoed the latter craft growing to her face what news somewhat that diswunt would not tell thee out with it ato tell me thy endgod knows but it may fit mine since so they say extremities meet aye assented atma sombrely that is why i seek thee hate and love are not far distant with us womenkind then suddenly she reached out a tense nervous hand to lay upon siyah yamins smooth round arm lo sister thou hearest all things here and ii hear nothing what news is there of the kings luck hath he in truth yielded it to the englishman siyah yamin stared for a second then burst into a perfect cascade of highpitched laughter said i not truly she gurgled that extremes meet see i will send for a cooling sherbet and i will tell thee all it was not all it did not even approach the truth but it served her purpose so she sate watching the effect of each word and atma devi listened weighing each word both with the same indescribable intuitions of their sex appraising this discounting that until at last the latter rose tall dark menacing to look down on the other crouching like a coiled snake among her cushions yea as thou hast said siyal true loyalty would lend itself even to theft or rather to the snatching of luck from ill luck and the protection of the king from evil magic and so i will tell diswunti his mistress by inheritance and to give it to the keeping of the beneficent ladies as i have said were well done the lady hamida the kings mother carries his honour close day and night even as she once carried him and khanzada gulbadan begum hath wit more than most men so i will aid if i can being bound also to the kings honour but hearken siyah lo draw thy veil solet me have it she sank to her knees and leaning forward caught the loose end of the courtesans tinsel veil and flung it round her own head also now let us swear once more as sisters of the veil to be true to each other until the deathuntil the deathdost hear taken by surprise siyah yamin shrank back from those blazing eyes paled faltered finally compelled thereto by the grip of a nature stronger than her own muttered faintly i swear till the death tilldeath after atma had gone the courtesan sate for a while as if halfparalysed she had gone further than was safe seeing that she was to use atma as a tool a halfcrazed tool then she looked about her the heat of the day was waxing below her the bazaar becoming drowsy was leaving a thousand wickednesses to welter and fester under the noontide sun while it slipped from them for a while in sleep leaving them restlessly active ceaselessly on the move like molecules in a sunray thought hustling thought intention seeking desire making evil ready for the awakening of men to find a new stimulus to wrongdoing in the coolness of the afternoon it was always so evil grew day by day there was nothing else alive in the whole world so by degrees courage and confidence returned send for pahlu the prince of thieves she said and bid pooru the false gemmaker be here when i awaken meanwhile let deena take this to diswunt at the hall of labour she sate for a second pen in hand cogitating half amusedly then with a sudden smile wrote in delicate curvings a verse from saadis lamp and the moth oh fearful tearful lover cease to sigh passions worst pangs thou knowest notas i leave pining leave lamenting and be bolder woman yields readiest to those who hold her so swallowing a perfumed pill of opium all sugar coated and silvered she too slept in her balcony chapter xii live in the living hour fortune is fickle to thy lips laughing flower let good wine trickle who hoardeth wealth to leave he is a neerdowell who lives to rail and grieve he is an infidel rest in thy cypress shade fill the cup higher drink to each merry maid drink to desire so saith the cup bearer so sings the lyre hafiz the hall of labour lay deserted as if the artificers who worked in its surrounding arcades had taken profit by the wisdom of hafiz which came trilling from the furthermost sunsaturated end of the long parallelogram of roof in which akbars especial artificers laboured at especial tasks it was a quaint place this hall or rather roof of labour for it was set high between the higher palaces which rose around it on three sides the fourth was arcaded as were the others but in dummy fashion that is to say with the shallow archways filled in with brick workand gave on the wide plains of india which were however invisible because of the height of the wall most things indeed of the outside world were invisible from the hall of labour you had to go through the sentryguarded door opposite the hidden plains before you could get rid of a certain sense of imprisonment of absorption in duty the artificers in the celllike workshops on the left hand of the doorway were however better off in this case than those on the right since the superstructure above these was but cell wide and so from their farther ends high unattainable windows partially bricked up let in a cross light on lathes and crucibles paintbrushes and even inkpots for in one of them near the door budaoni the historian used to sit most days engaged on his uncongenial task of translating the hindu scriptures and glaring at another writer over the way who was copying the translation of the gospels for which akbar had paid the jesuits a round sum of money money not quite honestly earned since the text was deftly doctored to suit jesuit dogma but even if this had been known it would have mattered little to the jealousies of the rival writers farther down this left hand side worked a chemist employed in testing atomic weights an engraver busy over a ruby intaglio an experimentalist attempting to prove the properties of quicksilver in the transmutation of metals a worker in gold on crystal and so on till at the end came an empty arcade with shut door then william leedess workshop and on the other side the studio of diswunt the crippled painter he was especially favoured for in addition to the high window which like those in the other cells gave on the court of dreamson the opposite side of which stood the kings sleeping palacehe had a corbeilled balcony overlooking the indian plain at least so much of it as could be seen by reason of the towering arch of victory which thrust itself skyward from its great plinth of steps looking downward one could see them receding in sharp angles almost to the bottom of the rocky ridge no place here therefore for escape or entry so diswunt was allowed the luxury of light even when his great wide door was shut he kept it so constantly for he was morose by birth embittered by the accident of it and yet the idle rhymes of hafiz came to his lips as he sate irresolute thinking of the paradise one woman had promised him if he did somethinga mere triflefor her of the hell with which another woman had threatened him should he fail to do the same thing it was too bad to have duty and pleasure on the same side and against themwhat only loyalty to the man who seeing himthen a mere beast of burdenas he paused in the bazaar to make with a bit of the charcoal he was carrying and a whitewashed wall a spirited sketch of a dog gnawing a bone had sent him for training to the court school of painting that after all had been but a sorry action diswunt looked distastefully at his worka portrait of akbar small enough to go into a ringand his whole soul went out to charcoal and a white wall for the misshapen lad whose face had the brilliant bizarre beauty of strongly marked feature which so often goes with physical deformity was without doubt part of the sixteenth century crop of genius of which so much has remained to the world so much more has passed out of it unwitting even of itself his eyes as he sate listlessly were dull with the hemp he drank habitually to deaden the depth of his discontent for akbar had not been able to uphold against the whole artistic verdict of his court his own opinion that the portrayal of real life gave special facilities for true education since every touch that went toward the likeness of reality must make the painter feel his own impotence to bestow life and so lead him to a right appreciation of the immeasurable dignity of the creator they had been brave words but they had ended in stipplings and blobs of white paint to imitate pearls yet there were some who thought as he diswunt the kings crippled painter thought he shivered as he remembered the day but a week ago when the infidel jeweller next door with whom he had scraped up an acquaintance had replied to a question he had asked in the lingua franca of mixed portuguese and arabic which served as court jargon for strangers nay friend such missals such pictures as these jesuits bring are but monkish work there be other painters over the black water lo i studied for a while under one in italia stay i bethink me to have backed yonder chart on the wall with a copy turn it round and see see diswunt had seen little else since it was only a bad copy in red chalk of a torso by michael angelo all blurred and half effaced but it had been a master key opening the door of real art to the lad driven half crazy by dreams and drugs since then he had closed his door and the stippled face of akbar had not received a single touch but the back of that closed door which was made after indian fashion of plain whitewashed wood nailed to a strong outside framework showed the cloudy smearings of much charcoal should he or should he not it was close on noon the silence told that the artificers were putting by their tools stay they were beginning again how was that he set the door wide open and carefully fastened it back then looked out the reason of this brisking up to business was evident for the king followed as usual by birbal and abulfazl was crossing the court not that he noticed the general activity his objective was william leedess workshop for it having been notified that the first facet of the diamond had been duly cut he was keen to see it but the sight of his protege diswunt at his door made him forget his hurry to pause and say kindly come thou with the artists eye and help akbar hold his own with these ignorant ones who have it that dulness equals gods luck he flashed round halfcontemptuous raillery even at birbal nay sire retorted the latter if the light of the world will pardon his slave we do but hold that the kings luck equals brightness but akbars quick imagination was already caught by the angular speck of clear dark sheen which showed like a shadow on the dull radiance of the uncut diamond as it lay matrixed in the cutters lathe so dark but so clear it is like a door he cried exultantly look diswunt is it not as a door through which one might pass and see what other folks see not and therefore desire not put in birbal quickly my liege it is not yet too late let yonder flaw made of man remain as an outlet or inlet for akbars dreams but let the remainder be as it has always been a sign of sovereignty to the people ask abulfazl here what thinkest thou diwanjee is there danger in this thing or no there is the chance of it replied the kings prime minister slowly i can say no more no less but birbal was more vehement it is more than chance it is certainty i have my finger on the pulse of the people already it beats irregularly had i but the power peace birbal said the king sternly thou hast it not then turning to william leedes he continued as if nothing had been said and the next the jeweller pointed to the mathematical diagrams at which he had been working that is as fate and figures will have it my liege i labour to lose as little as may be akbars eyes twinkled he gave a boyish laugh for fear of cutting out the kings luck lo that should satisfy thee birbal not one whit sire replied the latter stanchly birbal knows his own mind and by all the gods in indras heaven had i not been put in charge of illluck by the kings orderii would have stolen luck for him he laughed lightly giving his usual slight shrug of the shoulder but diswunt turned away suddenly and stood looking out on the sunlight should he should he not it meant paradise it meant escape from hell according to two women but this was a man and the kings best friend the keenest intellect in the court i stay he said curtly to the sentry who came to keep watch and ward while william leedes went out for the midday recess best not remarked the latter casually art needs rest and thou has been at it ever since thou didst see michael angelo lo were i to work unceasing at my problem i should grow crazy with angles and take a month where a week would suffice take the month an thou willst retorted the cripple illhumouredly as he banged to his door so there was no hurry he had a week wherein to do the little thing that was asked of him only to wile the jeweller from his cell for one brief minute it was however but two days afterward that he stood at the lintel of william leedess workshop something had gone wrong with the latters calculations and he had lingered after the hall of labour had emptied the lads eyes were bloodshot his hands were trembling with the hemp he had drunken and then suddenly he walked over to the diamond truly as the king said it is like a door he murmured a door through which men could seebut these men can see naught though every line is truethey cannot see it cannot see what asked william leedes abstractedly from his compasses for answer diswunt gave a wild jeering laugh and clutched the jeweller by the wrist come and see it thou canst see come i saynay thou must come and tell me if i be fool utterly his door set wide almost elbowed that of the jewellers and overborne by diswunts wild appeal william leedes found himself on its threshold not that not that almost yelled the lad his half insane reckless laughter echoing loudly through the arches didst think i brought thee to see the pattering of fliespaws stand forward a bitso forward the wide door as he set it aswing enforced his demand and what it brought to view as it swung astonished william leedes to forgetfulness and left him silent with admiration it was a hunting piece in rough charcoal a buck standing at bay amid a herd of hyenas but there was something more in it than that and william leedes involuntarily crossed himself thou hast a devil diswunt he said at last and once more the halfmad painters high reckless laugh filled the arches so thou canst see dost mark the tarkhans sneer the chamberlains cold glare it was true something in the noble poise of the stags head was reminiscent of the king and each one of the savage beasts surrounding it recalled by some witchery of touch or line the foremost of the kings enemies lo yonder is the stupidity of the makhdum went on diswunt punctuating his words by that high laugh yonder the selfsatisfaction of budaoni the fat foolishness of ghiass beg he paused almost as if listening to the faint echo of his laughter in the roof then sudden seriousness came to him but he will escape them now dost see the javelin to the right yonderthat shall save him and his luck the last word came curiously clear as if intended to awake remembrance it did so byr lady cried william leedes i had amost forgot he was back in his workshop in a moment to find the diamond matrixed as ever in its place with the darker sheen of the first facet showing full of promise but diswunt stood at the lintel and looked out not at the sunshine but at the door of the empty workshop next to william leedes it quivered slightly as if wind were behind it or as if someone were gently closing a bolt chapter xiii whirr spindles on my rushing reel leap thread from out my fingers feel time dwindles fate will cut the thread sleep dead before her grinding wheel kindles lifes spark again for woe or weal birbal paused on atmas threshold listening to her deep voice backed by the burring hum of her spinning wheel and as he listened he shivered this thought of unending life aroused from death or ever the tired eyes were fast closed appalled him not for him such slight slumber then he knocked there was a sound of quick uprising from within a swift echo of footsteps and then atmas voice at the door said with a breathlessness in it what ist hast brought newsis all well well or ill matters naught he replied cavalierly open i come from the king but the phrase had lost its charm go thy way chamberlain of princes came the mocking answer once bit twice shy thou mistakest sister urged birbal who knowing mirza ibrahims reputation had no difficulty in guessing the cause of atma devis refusal i am maheshwar rao disciple by birth of thy dead father the reassurance was deft and the door held ajar upon the chain showed atmas figure tall lowbrowed defiant what wants my lord she asked and her voice trembled as if from some secret perturbation a kiss like my lord ibrahim ere i turned him out close clipped in an embrace for which he cared not yet enterin the kings name enter to the house of his charan something there was of strain of anxiety in face and manner that made birbals keen eyes seek round the roof for its cause then he laughed nay i seek no kisses widow where a lover has just left his lips she stared at him haughtily what means my lord he pointed easily to a pair of mans shoes which stood in a corner beside the door smagdarites sister ah i have your secret he is here for yonder are his shoes atmas eyes following his grew puzzled in their anger shoes she echoed superbly i see them not my lord this time the laugh came more coarsely none so blind as the blind beggar bah woman do i not know what woman is he is here i sayhath been here always and thou didst delude me last time with the childs voice he paused for suddenly a tremulous sweet song as of some mating bird rose on the air my singing soul has its nest near the great white throne where the roses of paradise rest on its corner stone and the scent of those roses seems to bring idle dreams of life and love and the endless quest oh bird arise lift up thine eyes to the heaven that lies beyond paradise once again the man who doubted all things felt a thrill almost of fear but fate promptly gave him back his selfconfidence for a voice behind him said as the song ceased if my lord seeks me i seek my lord he turned to find the rebeck player on the threshold but with bare feet so the cynical laughter rang out this time in frank amusement well designed musician but the shoes lie yonder and then he hummed gaily the refrain of a popular song love to her mind came like the wind all stealthy as the cat is but those not blind next morn will find footsteps beneath her lattice a flickering smile showed on the rebeck players lips my lord has learnt that of lust in the bazaar if he desires to learn of love he should goto bayazid the faintly inflected play of words was out of keeping with the man who made it but the vague questionings concerning him which for days past had been in birbals mind seemed to have vanished with his first look at the miserable almost squalid figure the dull eyes the deathlike mask of the face what could the fellow be but street musician exceptsince women were incomprehensiblethe widows lover something of curiosity however remained bayazid he echoed haughtily what knowest thou of the drunkard who calls himself king of malwa that he is king of musicians my lord and this slaves master he could tell my lord all concerning love aye even as well as the sufi from isphahan those dull eyes seemed to take on a leer and birbal stared at them startled back into questionings the sufi what dost know of him he asked quickly naught replied the musician evasively save that the servants said he sups at the river palace this night he and another kingpayandar of sinde mayhap he looked up again with that leer in his eyes and the wonder died out of birbals the man was palpably a trickster palpably trying to play on credulitycredulity in birbal prince of doubters then will they sup in hell slave he said curtly since payandar hath been dead these fifteen years so farewell smagdarite lest i disturb love staylet me see thy talisman once more this dustborn atom in a beam of light resigns it came the reply and for an instant birbal stood paralysed by dim remembrance but the green stone on its greasy skein lay in his hands all inert without perfume without charm it was like nothing so much he told himself as half chewed cud and he tossed it back contemptuously a gold piece following it that for thy pains farewell widow luck to thy love he turned to go but the rebeck player who had stooped to pick up the coin still stood in the doorway and the sun flashing on the gold he held betwixt finger and thumb seemed for a second to blind birbals eyes to everything else if the most excellent desires to hear of love came the musicians voice softly he might go to the king bayazids river palacethis nightwhen the moon is waning the river palace my lord when the moon is waning the words echoed down the stairs after birbal who seemed not to hear them they had however the opposite effect on atma devi who all this time had stood silent apparently engrossed in listening now she roused herself and turned accusingly to her companion so thou has been here all the time and it was to thee the child talked in gray dawn and gray dusk wherefore did i not see thee because thou wouldst not sister because thy mind has been elsewherewhither god knows she started and looked at him halffearfully but he went on unregarding it is what the will wishes to see that is seen to all else we are blind something in the words seemed to strike a new note in her and the half savage half anxious look on her face vanished yes mayhap i have been blind she muttered to herself despondently but whereforeoh ye dear gods wherefore am i blind she turned to lean over the parapet as if to rest her eyes her very heart upon the dim blue distant haze betwixt earth and sky because thou wilt not see the truth sisterthe voice seemed to her to belong to that dim earth and skybecause thou hast denied love yet naught else will save the king she gave a startled cry but looking round saw that the wayfarer had gone may shivjee protect me she murmured to herself he is magician for sure yet is he wrong i am no woman but the kings charan i have done my duty so clenching her hands she sate and dreamed for him of safety honour empire birbal meanwhile dreamt the same dream as he plunged into the increasing intricacy of cabal which centred round his master so he gave no thought at all to so contemptible a person as the opiumdrugged songbesotted bayazid who still styled himself the king of malwa though he had fled from royalty for the sake of a dead dancing girl as if any woman were worth such a sacrifice true the tragic tale of rupmati the poetess musician singer ultimate artist who had made her king forget even statesmanship for seven long happy years had its aesthetic beauty one could picture the consternation of the dovecot when adham khan akbars general and fosterbrother put the royal lover to flight picture still more easily knowing adham khans nature his defiance of orders and the proposals he made to rupmati while the rest was pure poetry the beautiful woman dressing herself as a bride is dressed for the conquerors assignation and then leaving nothing but dead flesh awaiting him on the couch strewn with flowers that was fine but bayazid even though akbars own hand had brought retribution on libertine adhams head for this and other offences he birbal would never have come cringing to the emperors court to spend his time in singing love ghazals that was contemptible and yet as the day wore on the memory of the rebeck players words returned inconsequently almost annoyingly what was it to him birbal if bayazid had a supper party or no he had other corn to parch and he parched it consistently until late on in the evening having excused himself he knew not why from an entertainment at the palace he fell asleep peacefully the gongs were sounding eleven when he woke suddenly to a new resolve which admitted of no reconsideration he would go to the river palace after all there might be something in what the rebeck player had saidhe might be in the right at any rate there was no harm in seeing he clapped his hands and ordered his fast trotting bullocks but the river palace lay some miles away in an orange garden down by the sliding yellow stream which flows past agra and it was nigh on midnight ere he reached its wide open gateway bidding his rath await him outside he passed inward a sentry slept in the scented shadow of the archway so he went on unchallenged into the scented garden where the faint shadows of the waning moonlight slept also across the broad paved walks and on the conduits of running water that was hastening to slake the nightly thirst of the sunwearied plots of pomegranate and orange trees on which the ripe fruit hung obscure the dim clearness seemed to show the darkness above all the utter darkness of the great pile of the palace no signs here of a supper party the fact whetted his curiosity and he went on feeling himself the only live thing in a world of drugs and dreams in the hallway another drowsy servant showed curled up half asleep upon the floor your master asked birbal roofways came the answer with a yawn the whole place seemed opiumsoddened there was a cloying savour of poppy and dead roses in the narrow turret stairs which led upward so narrow that the stone wall on either side was polished by the elbows of the passers up and down the first floor was dark save for the fading moonlight seen through the open window archways so he went up again until the wide roof set amid the encircling shadowy trees through which the pale gleam of the river showed lay beneath his feet and overhead were the stars beginning their watch of the night one seemed to have fallen from heaven to burn in a silver filagree shrine in shape like a domed mausoleum which was the only thing dimly visible in the darkness that and still more dimly the lute with broken strings which lay before it illumined by the twinkling light bayazid he stood and called till from the night beyond the light came a chanting drowsy half coherent voice none knows the secret therefore take the cup lightly with laughing lip and drink it up though it be hearts bloodjust one little sup so that is good now die true wisdom hafiz prince of poets murmured birbal as he went forward and called again this time the answer came from near yea i am bayazid welcome friend he was resting on cushions behind the shrine and the light from its little lamp showed him long lank listless but the wide eyes in which burnt the dull fires of the dreamgiver recognised the visitor and the man who had been king of malwa roused himself to give salutation with stately ceremonial courtesy and motioned birbal to a seat beside him as the latter sank into the cushions they gave out a scent of roses and swift memoryswiftest of all for perfumesmade him look round hastily but the roof showed no sign of other living soul it is good of my lord to come so far and so late murmured bayazid in what can i help my lord the words came drowsily he seemed in danger of falling asleep once and for all i came to see payandar king of sinde said birbal sharply if that did not rouse the besotted fool nothing else would the result was in its way excellent bayazid sate up instantly and laid his hand on birbals arm what of payandar he queried his face working what of the master of love does he indeed live as some folk say that bayazid should know better than some folk replied birbal dryly since he was to have supped here tonight tonight echoed bayazid nay not tonight or she would have told me she knows the secret now birbal laughed lightly as we shall all know itor not know it some day as payandar knows it also since he died in the desert a sudden bitter exaltation came to the halfseen haggardness of the face the voice rang almost militantly aye in the desert driven thither as we dreamers of love are driven ever by lustmans lust lo thou knowest of my own seven happy yearsof my songstress who sang of loveof the viper who slew her and slew the king in me ohi rupmati rupmati were it not that thou comest to me ever in the song of birds in the breeze of the night in gods sunshine and in his flowers i too would seek the desert and save myself from the deadly companionship of my kind so i wait for thee and thy broken lute he sank back into his cushions stilled by the very violence of his emotions but after a while his voice went on more and more drowsily that the world knows all know the tale of bayazid and rupmati but who knows the story of payandar shall i tell it as she told it me how he loved a rose in a garden of roses naught but a gardeners daughterand he a prince of the tarkhans what do the tarkhans know of love but he knew he loved heraye though he was heir so vile utterly his father betrayed him a bastard younger brother did the deed one night in the garden of roses and when dawn came the rosebud had been plucked despoiled he left kingship and died mad in the desertso they say but love cannot die even in the wilderness there is a rose garden ready for it so he took the rosebud thither plucked despoiled soiled bruised and broken and out of death came life out of lust came love though the child was a crippled thing despoiled spoiled bruised and broken by its birth but death came also to the rosebud in the rose garden of love amidst the perfume of roses is it not even now in the air is not the darkness full of the essence of love ohi ohi rupmati let me hearken to thy broken lute was it fancy or mingled with the faint sighing of the night wind amongst many leaves and the fainter rush of the sliding river was there a sound as of jangled music birbal sate arrested for a second then seeing from the supineness of the figure beside him that all hope of further speech with the drugeater was over rose impatiently and made his way downstairs asking himself why he had come he paused astonished however to find the lower story no longer dark it was on the contrary brilliantly lit servants were flitting about and in the central room whose twelve arches gave on surrounding arched aisles which in their turn gave on overshadowing trees and river gleam a supper cloth was laid for two and by all the gods the figure which sate there holding a cup of wine in its raised right hand was the sufi from isphahan chapter xiv bring wine and i will read the riddle of this life of mine the old stars wizardry the shine of new moons wandering overhead all this ill read with wine hafiz for an instant birbal was speechless then he recovered himself who art thou man of many faces the question came peremptorily the answer suavely thine host for the rest as thou art a mere wayfarer on the limited path of life combining the two this slave ventures to offer refreshment cupbearer wine of shiraz and scent the goblets edge with rose mechanically birbal drained the beaker and the good liquor tingling to his finger tips he faced his familiar world again incredulous as ever so he said as following the sufis sign he seated himself among the cushions at the other side of the supper cloth it is as i thought the wayfarer how many disguises hast thou o bairupiya musician envoy sufi then a thought struck him and he gave his little contemptuous jeering laugh mayhap king payandar alsobut that he is dead footnote a tribe who have the gift of to use theatrical parlance making up to perfection aye dead assented the sufi gravely and the dead being but the castoff garments of the living count not in disguise but wherefore began birbal his host smiled let me quote the king of poets to my lord ah soul of a man live free of the wherefore the how for the passing moments flee drink deep of the wine cup now drink deep for he who is wise he hath the seeing eyes he knows the secret that lies in the hows and the whys cupbearer yet another wine of shiraz and scent the goblets edge with the roses that grow beneath the vine the echo of the chanted song died away then suddenly he reached out his thin brown handthe index finger wore a ring set with a marvellous emerald the surface of which was close covered with fine flowing hieroglyphicsand laid it on birbals in familiar grip the latter started turned pale thou art the deviljuggler with thy tricks he muttered faintly how didst learn the signmanual of my race secret inviolate the sufi laughed there is no devilry to the hindu in being the outcome of many incarnations mayhap in my past i have been bhatbandi and my lord he paused what matters it tis but the trick of memory birbal forgets this slave remembers aye friend tis but a trick indeed i juggle with mens eyes and they with their own senses he clapped his hands gave a swift order in some unknown tongue and as if by magic the servants disappeared extinguishing the lights as they vanished leaving those two alone in the rosy radiance of a lamp that swung above the supper table its downward light left their two faces in shadow listen my lord said the sufi rapidly i will waste no time in words i am here at akbars court a spy wherefore or who my master is seek not to know mayhap time will show i spy on prince dalil of sindedost know him khodadad tarkhan boon companion of the heirtoempire start not i watch him i wait for him not for myself only but for sindefor that unhappy country which counts on akbars aid aid which will not come if the assassins daggerif conspiracysucceeds dost see dost understand lo i am sinde incarnatewaiting watching he paused again and in the brief silence birbal could hear a long sobbing breath the lamp had grown dimmer and to his half startled eyes its radiance seemed to leave the whiterobed figure to chill shadow he too caught in his breath as a thought came to him but that payandar is dead he began whisperingly i should deem aye he is dead echoed the other almost menacingly but though he died in the desertas thou hast heard from bayazidlove unconditioned ineffable a sudden distaste to the man who spoke to the whole tenor of his talk boastful as it were of some hold on the unseen not known of commoner clay seized on birbal keep that for the king holy man he said decisively birbal talks not till dawn of winecups and roses and the beloved perhaps twere better if he did replied the sufi boldly nathless i did not bring thee hither to talk of love but to tell thee by my arts that the kings luck is stolen the impulse to start to rise was strong for an instant then memory came to calm the man of the world impossible he said quietly i saw it today it is in safe keepingthe worse luck perhaps a jibing laugh echoed through the arches so even birbal hath superstition but listen stay i will tell thee common truth i go nightly to swing up the palace wall to akbars balcony wherefore because my lord i pass not far from a certain window where mirza ibrahim and khodadad khan hatch conspiracies and there is an iron stanchion by the side of it with which even a swinging dhooli may find restand listen dost understand so i hear all even their hours of meeting and i am spy a man of many facesas thou knowst i was there but nowand the diamond is stolen i meant when i bid thee come hither simply to warn thee since to thy charge birbal rose then his eyes full of impatient disregard for the trickster the jugglerthe man who pretended to supernatural knowledge and found itor said he found itby common spying why dost thou tell me he asked quickly thou sayest thou art friend to akbar thou art no friend of mine there was a pause a faint hesitancy came to the shadowed face before him as of one who playing many different parts finds them mixed up in general confusion suddenly he seemed to grip himself the real man behind so many disguises of the unreal yet are we both friends of akbars aim that is unity thy hand birbal let us swear troth for that that slender brown outstretched hand with the green glint of the emerald on its index finger seemed to have a compelling power birbals sought it and the result was startling the man whose whole life was one long claim for individuality realised in a second that so far as his impact on that clasping hand was concerned he had lost all sense of personal touch flesh seemed made one with flesh with all things tat twam asi thou art that the fundamental creed of the east overwhelmed him as he stood then suddenly he was alone again alone in the darkness save for the faint glimmer of the toothed arches that gave on the shadowy gloom of overhanging trees and sliding river wayfarer he called wayfarer juggler where art thou sufi spy but there was no answer he stood for a moment dazed then he felt his way for the stair and called again a steady snore came in return the drowsy servant he had questioned on entering was evidently now fast asleep no wonder he told himself as he made his way outward to his waiting rath the whole place was full of dreams the very roses in the garden had lost their scent through slumber as he passed down the garden path he caught himself yawning though his mind was broad awake therein lay the puzzlethe body slept the soul he turned at the outer archway to give a last look at the palace to his intense surprise it was ablaze with lights from basement to roof and standing in a balcony of the second story which gave on the sliding river he could see quite distinctly a figure looking out over the gleam of the water the face melancholy beyond words was deathly pale and seen in profile only looked like a cut cameo its drooping eyelid half hid the lustreless eye the long black hair escaping from the high green turban outlined the narrow contour of forehead and cheek then fell in ringlets on the sloping shoulders green clothed and hung as was the turban with festoons on festoons of emeralds the light struck them they shone coldly green incomparably clear the emeralds of sinde surely no other regalia held as the thought flashed to birbals mind the lights flashed out and he was left to the scentless darkness of the garden to a half muttered curse at the untrustworthiness of his own senses when in the grip of of what as the trotting bullocks made their way back to fatehpur sikri the puzzle of what had held him recurred again and again even amid his turmoil of thought regarding the diamond the tale he had heard could scarcely be truehe had seen the gem safe but a few hours back yet the fact that such a conspiracy was on foot was quite credible and might necessitate still greater care and at once the gray dawn was breaking into day when having roused william leedes without ceremony and carried him to the hall of labour they entered the sentinelled laboratory to find the diamond gleaming as ever on the lathe it was a relief birbal sate down on the jewellers stool and breathed again despite his incredulity he felt that his whole being mind and body had been impressed by the mountebanks manner he had actually allowed it to overcome his reason william leedes still but half awake in utter ignorance of why he had been brought thither stood for a while stupidly awaiting a remark finally he ventured to ask what was required of him what echoed birbal lightly recognising with his usual craft that the less said about his fear the better only that the king is eager to know somewhat of the second facet the jewellers face fell therein lies the puzzle he said and i have not yet solved it the thickness of the stone is greatalmost too great and to cleave it would be to remove mayhap too much yet without it to find true axisthe sun as we call it in the tradeis a problem that defies at present my geometry hast tried aljebr asked birbal roused instantly to interest show me thy work sir jeweller mayhap i can help passed master as he was in the eastern science of algebra they were soon at work with signs and figures that comes more nigh it said william leedes hopefully taking up a small style and going to the lathe were i to make this point the axis and the lathe spun round then stopped suddenly as he bent to look closer itit scratches he murmured too astonished for bewilderment birbal was by his side in a second had wrenched the gem from its holding and had it at the light a scratch indeed in an instant his subtle mind followed the trail unerringly the trick of a false diamond which he and abulfazl had urged upon akbar had been played here but how who was the culprit his knowledge of humanity of the world and its ways instantly exculpated the englishman from implication in the theft but had he been careless that was a point for inquiry but now this instant moment what was to be done what had best be done sit silent on yonder stool and work out thy problem fool he said in a whisper to william leedes who stood gaping ready to burst out into speech when it came back to him and leave me to work out mine this is no diamond tis a false gem made i swear by pooru but to whose order and for what purpose he paced the little workshop every fibre of his keen wit vibrating to the tense pressure of his thought then he laid his hand suddenly on the amazed jewellers shoulder when didst thou leave itonly for a moment speak truth but william leedes brain had already begun to work slowly diswunt he said mechanically he showed me the next minute they stood looking round the painters empty studio through the corbeilled balcony they could see the miracle of dawn being enacted but in the wide cool airy room was nothing what did he show thee asked birbal menacingly for answer william leedes threw back the door it fell into its place with a clang of chain upon staple leaving disclosed no hunting scene that had been fiercely rubbed off leaving gray clouds upon the whitewashed wood but on this indefinite background limned in with large lines and splashes of a curious scarlet was the figure of a woman a woman standing her feet moving in a rhythmic dance her scarf floating in serpentine curves siyah yamin cried birbal under his breath and stooped to read a legend dashed in roughlywith the brush apparently that still stood half immersed in a bowl where lingered dregs of the same curious ghastly crimson scarlet pigment with which the portrait was limned it was only a verse from hafiz each man has his gift to one a cup of wine to another the hearts blood so ask not life from the picture on the wall the man of wit of intelligence beyond most stood looking at the picture in silence then he bent to pick up a scrap of crushed paper which lay before it as he smoothed it out his face was a study in distaste which grew to quick sympathy as he read it contained but a few words from saadi wide is the space twixt him who clasps his love and he who watches for her door to move and below this in flowing curves watch no longer cripple gulamar hath consolation if tis needed birbal crushed it in his hand again and walking straight to the corbeilled balcony looked out in the dawn light a confused dark bundle as of clothes lay on the angled steps of the arch of victory the distaste vanished from birbals face he stood looking down infinite pity in his eyes as he quoted softly yea he who made me from the clay and set my soul within it and alway pities and pardons and enfolds me ever in his beneficence shall i not lay my heart back in his hand hehe hath killed himself cried william leedes who had followed to look also nay she hath killed himhe painted her in his hearts blood replied birbal grimly stooping for a closer look at the nigh empty bowl the incarnadined brush yet i fail to see began the jeweller when his companion swept him into silence with a rush of contemptuous irritation fail to see how shouldst thou see strangebred as thou art from the uttermost guile of indiathis old old india that was guileful long ages before thy island came into being what canst thou or thy kind know of the bottomless deceits the dregs of many years the sediment of many men which must underlay the smooth levels of india but i brahmin indian bred i see all and i see here the wagging beards of mahommedan doctors virtuous traditionbound i see the lawless desires of libertines like ibrahim the deep designs of khodadadmisnamed mayhap but under all i see the ancient harlotry of womankind aye even what they call lovemisnamed again yea i see the scented balcony in satanstown where this he pulled himself up and laid his hand compellingly on the jewellers arm but of that hereafter for the present keep council if thou lovest life to you and to me only is that gem no diamond cut an hundred facets on it an thou wilt but if its falseness be found out ere i will it thou diest dost hear then his tone softened a little stay this scrawling must not stand to tell its tale water and this brush sir jeweller will send it flyingdo this for meand for thyself he paused to give another look at the lads last work lo there is genius in it for tis the jade herself poor fool pity he had not read the master to better purpose so he passed out with studied carelessness humming as he went another bit of the wisdom of hafiz wisdom is wearisomevery bring the noose of wine for its neck let us drink my friend and be merry theres nothing to fear or to reck the sun is wine and the moons the cup pour the sun to the moon and well drink it up and be merrybe merryvery chapter xv i have oft said it and again i say that i poor soul did never choose my way but like taught birds in hooded darkness heard what was the masters will the masters word bramble or rose whateer his order gives i take in joyknowing the gardener lives jami auntie rosebodys face showed pale above her wadded pink wrapper in the light of the little cresset that was set upon the floor her small hand shook as she reached it out mechanically and took something that was held out to her by one of the two women who closewrapped in their burka veils squatted opposite to her she did not look at this something she simply held it fast in her closed palm what else could she do at two oclock in the morning when she had been aroused from innocent slumber to decide in an instant the part she would play in a conspiracy to preserve her nephew the kings luck and increase that of her beloved grandnephew the prince salim decide it when she could scarcely gather her senses together sufficiently to understand what the woman told her the woman with the polished persian periods the persuasive voice which stamped her what she was courtesan the other voice she vaguely recognised so after a time she challenged it thou art atma devi the mad fortune teller she said catching at any straw of reality in this whirlpool of dreams i am the kings charan came the reply therefore as the most beneficent knows his honour stands for my life true there was reassurance in the thought besides that which came from the glib list of respected and respectable names that fell from the other glib mouth khodadads was not amongst them neither was mirza ibrahims for siyah yamin knew her company she was too wise even to betray her own identity and strove to keep the polish from her periods as much as she could as she talked on and on of the safety of the king of bewitchments of the immense value it might be to the prince in the coming audience of nobility if luck and favour might be assured to him by the secret wearing of the talisman even so much she protested should be sufficient reason for the most benificent assuming custody of the great diamond even if she returned it afterward it would be as easy to replace the false gem with the true one as it had been to replace the true with the false but once the bewitchment of the foreigner was broken the king himself would likely give thanks to god and to his greataunt here was her opportunity poor auntie rosebodys eyes wandered helplessly from one burkaed form to the other she could not even think what dearest lady would have said her mind held nothing but the fact that she the lady hamida and the whole harem had but that very afternoon discussed with tears the question of this cutting of the kings luck and that even hamida had applauded her impulsive assertion that to steal the gem would be allowable under the circumstances and now here it was stolen and in her very hand it was like the day of resurrection and the prince will need fortune came the glib voice since for these two nights passed he hath undoubtedly been in satanstown with siyah yamin and that angers the king so those who send us say twere better if the king his royal father were to give him some distant post of honouras indeed is but his right but this can be compassed but by favour and for this purpose the wearing of such a talisman is potent aunt rosebody groaned did she not know it were there not instances without number even in her own family of such influences if she could only consult someoneeven hamida but the women were urgent except in the safe keeping of the beneficent ladies and under promise the diamond could not be left then it was that the little lady reached out her hand and took what was held out to her after that there was but a short whispered conference and then aunt rosebody was left feeling as if the whole round world was tight clasped in her small hand while the women stole back as they had come protected by the lord chamberlains order well asked siyah yamin when safe beyond the walls speech was possible art satisfied ato now that thou hast seen the kings luck out of my evil hands ah fie on thee sister for thy threats thy unkind thoughts of poor little siyala who heaven knows has had more curses than cowries out of the business yet but for me and my pet thief pahlu who between ourselves nigh starved waiting in the empty workshop while diswunt was making up his mindthe kings luck would still bewhere it ought to be atmas face grew troubled ever since the deed had been done she had woman like become afraid of it it was this vague fear which had made her insist on accompanying siyah yamin so that she might see for herself that the gem had been given into the hands of the beneficent ladies thinkst thou so in truth siyal she asked reproachfully and yet thou hast not ceased to assure me she broke off then added and but for me sister diswunts mind would never have been made up it was i siyah yamin burst into a low laugh as she disappeared between the curtains of her waiting dhooli give him good reward then sister after womans fashion lo i have given him mine already something in her tone made atma stoop and hurriedly open those closed curtains that were heavy with stale scents a glimmer of gray dawnfor it had taken time to persuade aunt rosebody to actionshowed faintly the courtesans face set in the white folds of the burka she had thrown upward for more air perhaps it was a memory of the portrait thus framed which made atma repeat herself i wonder thou canst be so unkind to a poor lad who loves thee unkind echoed the courtesan with the zest of a child who kills flies death is no unkindness and they will give it him doubtless if he hath been unwise for he will not blabthat i knowhe loves too much she was right even as she spoke diswunt was seeking the great silence the wind of dawn which found his face as he fell found her soft babyish face also but it brought no message told no secret atma stood watching the dhooli as it swung off toward satanstown with a rising dread at her heart and yet she had acted for the best and when all was said and done the kings luck was in good hands siyah yamin said the same thing to the two conspirators mirza ibrahim and khodadad whom she found waiting for her return anxiously yea yea yea she answered yawning lord how we apples swim she will put it as talisman in the princes turban the rest is not for me lo i have done my work and more spoke up khodadad after a vain look at his companion to urge him to the task why hast thou taken the woman atma into thy confidence it may spoil all why hast thou done it i say for that we will have answer now will we not ibrahim thou hadst no right siyah yamin yawned again because fool without her i could not work then she smiled suddenly lo there is something betwixt me and old ato which mankind wist not of and which iunderstand not but see you gentlemen if i need a scapegoat she is ready to hand and if that please you not go but quarrel not over such trifles in the making of plans my friends time runs short and as the proverb says one can hear snakes bickering by the long tongues flickering so this advice i givesilence as usual she had the last word poor auntie rosebody was at the same moment giving herself the same advice sleep had of course been effectually banished from her eyes and she was still sitting with the little packet she had received from the women close clasped in her hand she had held it for so many minutesnay surely hoursthat it seemed to have become part of herself and her thoughts had long since left even the question as to whether she ought not at once to summon the king and give it back to its rightful owner the only point with her now was how she could manage her part without help she had made up her mind not speak to hamida one never quite knew what she might think or say but was there no one else aunt rosebody felt as if she must burst without speech but it must be speech with silence and except at night time it was almost impossible for any one to have a private interview with any one else in the womans house it was full to the brim with idle hussies eunuchs actual spies naturally if she wanted audience of hamida begum she could claim a private one or even of rakiyahere the blood flew to auntie rosebodys face no it should never be old rakiya with her hemistitches her girding tongue her illbred remarks about dead saints gulbadan begum was a good hater and the mere thought of confiding in her enemy quite flustered her yet she could not wait for discreet nightfall what was to be done must be done at once that very morning since the festivities that were to commence the six weeks revelling in honour of salims coming marriage were to begin that afternoon and then suddenly a thought struck her umm kulsum little umm kulsum who was such a tower of good sense and sympathy she would tell her yes she would tell her not in the dhooli going to the bathing steps there they might be overheard by the duennas who walked beside it that was the worst of being a womanthere were spies everywhere even upon the bathing steps but out on the water right away in the tank under the azuresilk sky of heaventhere she could ensure solitude aunt rosebody heaved a sigh of relief ah it was very well of rakiya khanum to jibe at indecent youth but it was something to be able to swim and so get away from old cats and so it came to pass that umm kulsum coming up to shake her head like a wet spaniel after her dive through the arches nearly went to the bottom from sheer affright of what she saw in auntie rosebodys face dont cried the little lady catching her by the hand and thus largely adding to her imminence of sinking now do listen ummu but i think my dear you had better turn on your back and float for what ive got to tell will make your liver melt for sure so side by side hand in hand they floated in the warm mornlit water auntie rosebodys gray hair mingling in snaky fashion with umm kulsums black locks while the former told her tale and more than once the elder woman had to adjure the younger one to keep a straight back and float decently since some of aunt rosebodys revelations were disturbing and now o umm kulsum pilgrimess mind you to holy mecca save my soul from sinif thou canstand tell me above all if i be asleep or awake the confused appeal brought silence for a moment whilst those two brave superstitious affectionate womens faces stared into the azure blue then umm kulsum said softly it is gods will he has sent us to do this thing and we must do it yea auntie even if they kill us we must save the kings luck and buy favour to salim oh ummu sobbed auntie rosebody how glad i am i told thee thou art wisdom itself and thinkest even as i do we are two splits to one pea and so two set determined and in their exaltation supremely happy faces showed ducking and bobbing as they swam and made plans ummu was to set to work at once and make a seedpearled and goldembroidered brocade bag for the stone which should deftly disguise its shape and aunt rosebody was to say it contained a precious relic from mecca and insist on the scapegrace wearing it concealed in his turban for the day after that why why after that all would depend upon the fortune of the prince so little umm kulsum retired to her violet garden in hot haste to dry her hair as usual and then having dismissed her maids began work in the solitude of the secluded spot set round with low walls and orange trees she had thought it all out had seen that time pressed and so without remorse cut a bold snippet out of the pearledged embroidered hem of her very best overcoat which she had told her tirewomen she meant to wear the damage would not be seen if she wore a thick veil and a very little sewing but a few pearls deftly applied would make of the precious piece a relic holder as good as any in the palace so her round simple face grew absorbed in her task when a rustle in the orange tree above her made her look up she saw another laughing face looking down a face that with its orangecoloured veil showed like a ripe fruit amongst the burnished green leaves the next instant mihrunnissas lithe stillchildish figure had swung itself to the ground and her forefinger was wagging roguishly at umm kulsums hasty and futile effort to conceal her work oh fie ummu what secrets came the mocking voice dost not know here it took on a ludicrous likeness to her mothers that only illbred young women degrade themselves by duplicity then she cuddled close and looked at umm kulsum with a perfectly ravishing smile say sweetheart is it a love letter umm kulsum gave a little shriek of horror go to thou art a bad girl mihru how didst come here and how darest thou even mention love letters mihrunnissa cuddled closer how because i needed to see thee ummuauntie ummu i shall call thee dearest so when they denied me i crept out by the window and along the wall mother is at the reception but i needed thee and as for loveah ummu i have seen him seen whom asked umm kulsum stolidly her mind was busy with likely lies for she knew the penetrating wit the cold clearsightedness of this childgirl whymy man of course came the reply with sage noddings of the pretty head everything save horrified outrage flew from umm kulsums mind thouthou shameless onethou canst not mean it and if thou hadstby chanceto dare to say it mihrunnissa begum say it is not true the pretty head nodded again cheerfully but it is true auntie ummu and it was not by chance i climbed into a treethou knowest i can climb treesand saw him over the wall as he came to sup with father and i like him he hath a kind strong face andlo ummu one can be queen of a mans heart as she sate there her small slender hands closed on each other as if she held something very precious a mysterious smile came to her eyes her mouth years younger than her companion in all things of womanhood she outpassed her utterly so as she paused sudden shame came to her and dost know ummu she went on a fine blush invading her cheeks that were the colour of ripe wheat her hands unloosing themselves to plait and replait in her confusion the fold of umm kulsums best overcoat which lay beside her ii think he saw me forfor he smiledthough he walked on sedately as a gentleman should but i am not sure his eyes she paused abruptly gave a little shriek oh ummu thou hast cut itthy beautiful overcoat she held up the accusing gap in the hem and her young face took on swift keen interest sothy secret come out with it auntie she snatched at umm kulsums work and held it out derisively an amuletnay a relic holder she cried gaily lo umm kulsum khanum it must be for thy lover to wearin his turban likely umm kulsum gasped and leant back against the orange bole helplessly truly mihru thouthou art a witch she murmured feebly the expression on the girlish face intensified into absolute cunning sothen it is for some ones turbanprince salims i dare swearto bring him luck with his father ohi ummu i have hit it tell me sweetheart what goes in it come let me have a look at thy facefor umm kulsum in sheer dread of those piercing inquisitive eyes had swaddled herself hastily in her veil what thou willst not then it is something worth knowing i will find outbut la that scent of ambergris portends my mothers passing i must begone auntie ummu ere they seek for me farewellandand good luck go with thy prince he needs it she had swung herself into the orange tree once more and was gone leaving umm kulsum with a beating heart it was an ill chance and the girl was as a wizard with her guesses but seeing that the audience of nobility was to be held that night there was small chance for mihrunnissas wit to do harm and the prince would be under solemn promise to bring the talisman back next morning without fail whether he intended to keep the promise or not certain it is that he made it while auntie rosebodys voice shook over the oath she administered and little umm kulsum stood by trembling in her very marrow and when the young man had gone off all duly dressed for his part in the festivities sulkily carrying with him the well wishes of every woman in the harem in addition to that mighty talisman which they all looked at from a distance with awe those two poor conspirators retired together and wept on each others neck i will fast tonight o child said the old woman ruefully god knows it may be my last but he may spare thee being young umm kulsum only sobbed the more why should she add to aunt rosebodys anxieties by telling her of mihrunnissas visit and after all the girl had wished the prince good luck something at least should come of that and ere many hours were over something did for as prince salim walked back through the palace gardens fate beckoned to him and from that time forth until his death he never forgot the call it happened on this wise vaguely disturbed he dismissed his retinue in an ill temper and despite the heat of the early afternoon sun sought solitude wherefore who knows had the conspirators gone so far as to tell him that he carried with him the kings luck and that he had but to declare himself to find following sufficient to give him the sceptre or had they merely begun to prepare the way for such telling in the future certain it is that he was moody thoughtful beyond his wont in half an hour or so the festival would begin by a grand illumination the festival which would bring him marriage if his father that break in his thoughts seemed to end every subject for thought if his fatherif his father the noise of the firework makers and lamp sellers who were at work in the principal paths annoyed him so he wandered off into the more private ones amusing himself idly almost unconsciously with a pair of doves he had taken as the only silent companionshe had said bitterly in the court if his fatherif his father the question obsessed him whether he knew actually that he carried kingship with him certain it is that his thoughts were with himself as king what he would do what he would say what he would think ifthis thingwere to happen now would he marry this rajputni notby all the twelve imamsif she were ugly and as his friends saidthey were all mahommedansthe first wife should be of islam he had wandered farther than he knew and without realising it had entered the garden belonging to the womens apartments but it was empty the hour was early and every one busy dressing for the festival so he went on unhindered it was cooler here in the pleached alleys and perfumed too out yonder in the sunlight the very scent of the flowers seemed burnt up yes if he married the onyxeyed birds of love he was carrying fluttered and fretted were they too dreaming of liberty curse the brutes why could they not keep quiet and give him a chance of making up his mind his eye caught someone a slip of a child it looked wrapped close in a creamy veil sitting beside a fountain some coolies daughter no doubt waiting for her father to finish work here hold these birds child he cried peremptorily the figure did not move and with another curse on its stupidity he strode up to it thrust the pigeons into its lap and with a brief order to hold them fast till his return strode off again something he must settle he felt before he met his father in the audience of nobility vague instinctive affection and loyalty had to war with passionate desires for power with the thousand and one poisoned thoughts which day and night were put into his mind diligently by those who sought him as their tool when he had disappeared into the thickets of pomegranate and orange there came a sudden little laugh oh birdies birdies what a stupid stripling the shrouding veil which she had hastily drawn round her on the appearance of the prince slipped back and mihrunnissas dimpling face was buried in the opalescent feathers of her captives nay no struggling sure thou art better here than with your sulky fatling princethough see you my birds he is not so illlooking when he is seen close as the squirrel said of the spider when he had dismembered him but he is not a patch on sher afkan la how ummu squirmed when i spoke of him what sillies women be as if one might not use ones eyes ohi now i have it tis the talisman in his turban gives the prince his air have a care mihrunnissa lest thou fall in love with him and desert true friend and yet she paused looked down at her own face mirrored in the water and what she saw there held her it was true what the woman told her that was no mere wifes faceit was the face of a queena real queen the birds of love fluttered in her listless hold lost in her dreams she scarcely noticed that one eluding her slack grasp fled joyfully to coo his paean of liberty from an orange tree hard by was it worth it was it worth it what was all the power in the world worth to a woman as shethe girl upon its vergeimagined womanhood my birds the prince had returned the imperious voice roused her roused her temper also here my lord she replied curtly what only one the voice was angry now almost ready for a curse she set as it were soul and body into cold ice sire she answered with chill courtesy one has flown in the shade of the trees her face averted was unseen and of her figure crouched in upon itself instinctively the prince saw nothing but childish outlines stupid fool he cried roughly how damn you tell me how she was on her feet in a second facing his anger fearlessly her own blazing hot in defiance of all things aye even this fading prince who dared to call her fool so my lord she cried defiantly and from her outstretched hands the second dove flew circling to join its mate salim stood startled into silence from the orange tree the doves were cooing the perfumes of the garden rose up around them overhead blazed the brazen sky but the heirapparent of india saw nothing save that first glimpse of the woman who as mihrunnissa queen of women nurmabal the light of palaces and finally as nurjahan the light of the world was to play so large a part in his life he was too much taken up with the love which like the doves had flitted from the listless hand of fate even to attempt to detain the girl when with a sudden sweeping salaam a soft sweet your servant mihrunnissa she turned and fled at least she felt he might as well know who she was chapter xvi a thousand ships have foundered here before so lost no chip of them came back to shore i too on those waves wandered many a night till terror plucked my sleeve and cried no more back to the land gods wide horizon rings thee and the worlds thinkst thou the king of kings to compare by conjecture ah poor wight wisdom itself wists not his hidden things saadi when mihrunnissa fled from the prince in the garden she did not fly far just round the corner waiting for her return stood her covered palanquin her dutiful duenna for mussumat fatima had long since given up attempting to control her young mistress to begin with she had found out that mihrunnissa was not as other girls she was wild as a young hawk but there it ended except in so far as uttermost mischief went she was to be trusted there never was any fear of love letters or any improprieties of that sort so if she chose to fancy sitting beside a fountain by herself in the womens garden where was the harm she was a mound of sense so much so that on this hot afternoon heaven knows why the child had insisted on coming outto ruin her complexion doubtless if she couldbut she couldntfrom the crown of her head to the sole of her foot there wasnt a speck or a freckle no one could blame a body for dozing in the dhooli and dreaming la child how thou didst frighten me gasped fatima as a tornado of yellow and purple draperies flung itself breezily on the top of her fat person oh futtu futtu panted the girl half laughter half tears i have seen him what again shrilled the duenna waking instantly to a sense of her responsibilities impudence knowest thou not that paper boats dont float for ever and that who lacks modesty lacks conscience oh have done with secondhand wisdom said the girl superbly and it was not himit was the princeprince salim fatima let loose a shriek oh my liver an thou darest to tell me tis bread and water for a week miss and i spoke to him and he spoke to me continued the culprit calmly out of sheer perversity reversing the order of events fatima let loose a louder shriek what lo the noose is round thy neck and mine too may the devil be deaf if folk hear but the girl who had drawn aside with distaste and was now seated half in and half out of the palanquin interrupted the duenna contemptuously futtu thou art a fullweight fool why dost not remember it needs skill to do wrong instead of making thy nose red with wrath suddenly she stood up a curiously defiant figure lo i am sick of saws and sayings i want to know at first hand and i will know call the carriers i go to atma devi lo i have tried as thou knowest to see in the ink again but it comes not i lack the charm she said she shall teach it me nay she continued stemming fatimas rising flood of denials see here fool if thou deniest me i go straight home and tellnot my mother she would be pleasedbut sher afkans and then she clasped the old womans neck with both hands and squeezed it tight does it feel nice futtu she asked solicitously so it came to pass that just as the sun was setting its last rays sparkled on mihrunnissas jewelled hair as she sate on the charans roof waiting for the drop of ink to fall into her palm she was more woman than child now since she had watched the birth of desire and of something more than desire in prince salims eyes so that was love a queer thing at best it must be to feel as he must have felt before he could look so poor a slave if that was love she could not give it back what give homage to a lout of a lad and yet the queenship oh if it had been akbar himself then she would have known what to do for he was king indeed or ifyes if it had been him for he was a man indeed drop ink and hide my flesh cover my worldly ways then let gods light afresh mirror gods praise drop ink drop deep cover in sleep my night of nights and bring the day of days this time the chanted words thrilled little mihrunnissa through and through for onceand perhaps for the first time in her young life she was in deadly earnest but once again poor atmas mind was far from her spell ever since deena that morning had brought her word of diswunts death regret remorse had warred with her defiance it was strange what did it mean had he regretted and wherefore at times absorbed with fear lest she should have betrayed the king she had been ready to seek out birbal and tell him the truth risking her own life but there was her promise her sisterstroth with siyah yamin that cut both ways it forced her to silence so long as the courtezan kept troth and had she not had not atma devi seen with her own eyes aunt rosebodys hand close on the diamond could it be in better keeping if the gracious child will complete the circle of magic she began when mihrunnissas laugh rang out disdainfully what to see what thou thinkest not so what i shall see what i shall do is of my own gift stand back womantouch me not drop ink drop deep cover in sleep my night of nights and bring the day of days she chanted the words lingeringly and for an instant there was silence while those two women the fat worldly duenna and the passiondistraught denier of her sex listened and looked with longdrawn tense breathings it was deadly earnest to them also would she see could she see such things were they knew beyond the magic frauds of fortunetellers and then suddenly the sweet round voice rose eagerly i see holy prophet i seeit is the prince but lord how fat he hath grown and how oldi think he is the king fatima under her breath muttered an old kings better than a young prince mihrunnissa flashed round on her an egg todays better than a hen tomorrow so there sawsayer then she looked again sher afkan this time he hath a scar upon his face that suits him well and a drawn sword the soldier gains his bread by the risking of his head murmured the irrepressible fatima lie you must or your belly will bust quoted mihrunnissa shamelessly too interested really to do more than fling a reply in this war of wise sayings lo cloudscloudsnothing but clouds again whats this crossed swords and someone fighting for his life holy prophet save him save him clouds again that is my face grown oldand i am all in white the girls voice seemed to shrink in on itself her eyes startled looked indeed as if across the chasm of the years she saw herself as she would be surely i am widowand theres the king once more she drew back from her own hand as she might have drawn back from fate then he was not killed she muttered in a low whisper it must have been thethe other oh help help help she started to her feet and as if in answer to her scarce audible cry a violent knocking shook the door open open in the kings name open the command reduced even mihrunnissa to the conventional quiet which on such occasions sinks on an indian womans house when those are within who should not be seen you might have heard a pin drop atma devi charan of the king open to his demand came birbals voice clear unmistakeable followed quickly by the orderbreak open the door slaves i must see if she be within ere seeking elsewhere there was no time to lose instinctively fatima holding fast to her charge and dragging her with her fled noiselessly to the closed door of the slip of a room where zarifa lay sleeping and mihrunnissa herself seeing no other way out of the impasse allowed herself to be dragged as stealthily as noiselessly none too soon for as the latter motioning her duenna arbitrarily to the farther corner of the darkness was limply closing the door so as to allow a crack for hearing a crash told that one bolt of the outer one had given way and atma devis voice rang out hold i will open to my lord birbal his voice in return came through from without so thou wouldst spare thy lock widow see that thou spare thy life also slavesget you goneawait me on the landing below and if i call come a moment after he was facing atma devi his face pale with contemptuous passion no lies widow he began at once i have come for the truth old deena the drumbanger hath blabbed somewhat i have gathered more in the bazaars thou art in this plot of the kings luck or thou knowest something of siyah yamins part in it speak or the flash of the poniard he held met an answering flash as atma slipped forward the deathdagger of her race ready on the instant her passion roused instinctively at the sight of his the kings charan she replied haughtily knows how to dieknows how to protect the kings luck and as for siyah yamin she is my sister of the veil between us lies trothto death that had been her chief thought during the past few hours it had indeed been her consolation in the vague regrets which had assailed her siyah yamin was handfast to her the courtesan had repeated the oath solemnly when atma devi in restless anxiety had gone to her again what is more she had given words of warning against birbal against the faction which he and abulfazl represented she had stigmatised them as selfseeking as those who led the king astray and had he not gone astray was there not to begin with this new edict forbidding widows to burn with their husbands would not the next stepif these two remained his advisersbe the forbidding of women to be widows indeed every atom of womanhood in her all tangled and torn apart by the plucking fingers of natural instinct and inherited ethics rose up in revolt against herself against everybody everything in the world save that one thingthe kings honour the kings luck she stood surging in uttermost rebellion and birbal realised that a deftless word almost a deftless look would send the dagger of her race to her womans heart so realising also his mistake in having thus driven his last chance of discovery into such sharp antagonism he shrugged his shoulders strolled over to the parapet and sate dangling his legs in his usual debonair fashion but his keen eyes were on hers thy pardon sister he said who can doubt that the kings charan has his luck at heart and it is for this that i have come to thee now listen he paused and but for his intentness those keen eyes of his might have seen the faintest quiver of the door opposite him as if someone behind it wished to hear better the kings luck given to the stranger to be cut hath been stolen from the lathe and a false gem put in its place shall i tell thee how his questioning eyes found hers with a baffling stare in them and he went on a thiefpahlu prince of thieves most likely but i have naught against him as yetmanaged entry to the empty workshop next to the diamond by scarceseen clamps in the outer brick wall he must have worked hard and risked his life many dark midnight hours but he did it the clamps remain and doubtless he had a silken rope then diswunt the kings painter beguiled the foreign jeweller out of his cell for a second or two so the deed was done but who beguiled diswunt siyah yamin doubtless i have proof of thatbut the boy was loyal it would need some sense of duty of devotion to beguile him that i know now thou didst go to his house not once but twiceof that also i have found proof wherefore that is what in the kings name i ask he paused for a reply but none came and his face hardened now listen further he went on again of another thing i have but too much proof the court is astir but now i passed that helldoomed cur khodadad and he smiled at meat me his bitterest enemy so he is content some plot is afoot and the foundation of all plots is the prince salimthey seek to oust akbar and place the drunken lout slave to his own passions and so slave to theirs upon the kings throne atma laughed scornfully that will they never domy lord the king hath too many friends and too many enemies also retorted birbal fool thou dost not see thou dost not understandthou art but a woman of whom men expect naught it was growing dusk rapidly so a faint widening in the doorchink passed unnoticed now listen again he went on yet once more thou hast been often to siyah yamins of late and deena hath a tale of two veiled women at the palace last night there was the faintest flicker of a flinch in atmas eyes and he was on his feet in a second stretching out an accusing hand toward her thou wast therethou and that accursed harlotdeny it not she withdrew a pace and set her back to the wall i deny nothing and i affirm nothing my lord she replied coolly obstinately though she felt torn in two by the conflict of her doubts fool he blazed out again i tell thee every second may be precious listenif thou canst listen being but woman not only the court but within the last hour or so the soldiery the people show unrest also and we may be undone this night i myself can scarce understandit has come in a second like a miracleas of some talisman his quick wit caught at his own wordsi have itthe kings luck the prince hath it in a second he had gripped both atmas wrists with his lithe hands and held her pinned to the wall tell me fool all things rest on it mayhapall things for which we have worked and hopedfor which he hath worked and hopedthe peace the unity of india say woman didst give it to the prince then seeing the utter obstinacy of her face he realised the futility of wasting time with her when he had found a cue which might lead to much elsewhere and throwing her hands from him with a curse on all womanhood he turned to go relying on his own keen wit but another keen wit joined to a mind capable of comprehension had been at work behind the chink there was a faint scuffle a muffled shriek as fatima who had heard nothing made a dive at her little mistresss dress as she flung the door wide and stepped out fate forced the duenna to grip the veil so she only made matters worse for mihrunnissa stood bareheaded before the strange man birbal however even in his hurry to seek help elsewhere did not need such trivialities as veils to make him pause with instant consideration for the dignity of the slim young figure which barred his way my lord came the full rich young voice need not rail at all womankind here is one who will tell him the truth for the sake of kingship peace atma continued the girl turning hotly on the charan who would have interrupted thou understandest not so be silent my lord i judge the talisman of the kings luck to be at this moment in prince salims turban for at the palace this morning i saw khanzada umm kulsum sewing somewhat into a relic bag for this purpose and she denied me knowledge nay i am sure of it she paused and birbal asked quickly will the queenofwomen give reason the girls face suddenly dimpled into smiles a mischievous twinkle took her eyes captive because the mostexcellent the heirapparent straightway came out of the palace and fell in love with me a shriek of horror from fatima who was employed in attempting to reenshroud the young girls beauty emphasised the absolute impropriety of the remark but birbal bowed to the very ground that is luck beyond the luck of kings madam he said and reason beyond question this speck of dust in the court of intellect gives thanks for the truth and withdraws his earthly clayhe paused for as he turned to go he saw the rebeck player standing on the threshold back slave he cried at once impetuouslythis roof is sacred to a queen but the musicians pale face lit up suddenly a queen suffers no ill from the eyes of a king he replied fixing his gaze on mihrunnissa so for an instant they stood measuring one another then the man turned quickly to birbal come my lord he said the sufi from isphahan desires to see the most excellentwhen he can withdraw his earthly clay from the presence of the queen of queens mihrunnissa stood looking after them as they disappeared nodding her head with a superior air then in sudden change she clapped her hands together joyfully like a child that is good she cried it is lovely to be called that lo i would do most things for thatexcept marry the prince yea most things so that it was the luck of a real king something in her own words made her pause that must be safeguarded she murmured as if to herself then she wheeled round and caught the fat duenna by both hands and tried to force her to her knees kneel fatima or i will hurt thee kneel dost hear what thou disobeyest me a stamp of her foot emphasised her order and brought the fat duenna down in a hurry say didst hear aught asked the girl superbly in the room i mean not here highness not a word protested fatima but what i heard herewhat i saw herehave made me deaf and blind for ever so much the better futtu so much the better nodded mihrunnissa wisely still tis always best to be on the safe side so put thy mouth in the dust and say after me may crows pick out mine eyes say dost hear may crows pick out mine eyes an ineffectual murmur came from the dust may pigs devour my thighs the dust had evidently got into the speakers mouth for the words became more and more inaudible as the stern young teacher went on my heart rot carrion wise my liver be eaten with flies my lights blown up with sighs myself my son and all that i prize burn in a fire that never dies if ever i open my lips to say the things i have heard and have seen today so said mihrunnissa when the formula was over thats done and as for thee she passed quickly to atma devi who half stunned by the swift mastery with which the girl had taken the whole business out of her hands still stood leaning blankly against the blank wall and looked her curiously in the eyes why wouldst thou not tell and wherefore didst thou steal the diamond then as she stood childishly curious comprehension came to her and she smiled halfcontemptuously halfmysteriously so thou also lookest a slave she said poor slave but as she and fatima went whisperingly down the stairs the faint clatter of their loose slippers mingling like castanets amid the soft swishing of silk the jingling of jewels she paused to listen to a birdlike voice singing love dost live in the red rose garden love dost grow from a red rose root dost set thy springe with th boughs that harden or twine it soft with the young green shoot love dost thou lurk in the red rosebud love is thy throne in the rosehearts crown love does the perfume of red rose flood in on the soul till the senses drown nay love lives not in a garden of roses root nor bough nor the young green shoot bud nor chalice the perfume encloses of love lying lowly at loves own feet for love is the rose love is the star love is the heart of things near and afar and afarand afarand afar mihrunnissa shook her head as the whispering descent began again of a truth love was far very far away chapter xvii yet when from off the table of gods grace he gives what each may carry to their place satan draws nigh even for me he says a portion has been portioned in gods ways saadi the most illustrious the mighty in power the high in pomp the exalted in splendour the father of his people the conqueror of the age the pole star of faith the sun of the world jalaluddin mahommed akbar great mogul emperor of india sate enthroned on a dais which had been erected for the purpose of the festivities on the uppermost terrace of the palace gardens the violet blackness of the sky above him was ablaze with stars as only an indian sky can blaze when the dust held in the atmosphere has been laid by recent rain and to the infinite relief of the town and all concerned in its welfare rain had fallenfallen in torrents suddenly sharply during the later hours of dawn leaving every tank full every street washed clean under the vivid blue sky which the storm seemed to have washed also relief had come from heaven but no one looked at the stars for the blaze below held all eyes a circle of bengal lights so arranged that the kings head should show against them shed veritable sunlight on his golden throne and on the whiterobed figure that sate on it for as ever akbar was dressed with studied simplicity true the benares muslin with its fine stitched edging of silver had taken years in the loom the ropes of pearls he wore over it were worth a kings ransom but there was no note of colour anywhere and the turban guiltless of all ornament save the herons plume of chieftainship showed dull without the calm radiance of the great diamond yet all things centred on the man who sate enthroned because it was his thought his imagination which had inspired the whole marvellous spectacle that was being held in the terraced garden surrounded by distant halfseen palaces and it was marvellous indeed the dais behind which in darkest shadow rose the latticed vantage ground of the court ladies was semicircular roundfronted and was superabundantly lit by that crown of twelve bengal lights representing the twelve solar months which hung like a halo round the man who claimed to be the sun of his world a big claim but in this instance it was made with such magnificent straightforwardness such clear perception of all that the claim entailed as to disarm criticism this dais some ten feet high rose from a semicircular roundfronted plinth which was lost in shadow partly because of a projecting eave which prevented the light from above striking on it and partly because seven equidistant lights representing the seven days of the week and in varying colours showing the tints of a rainbow were so cunningly set in shades round the dais that their light left the plinth in darkness and shot out in ever widening rays through the garden growing less and less distinct until at its farther end colour seemed lost in a general mist of light and in six of these rays red orange yellow blue indigo violet widening with the light sate in ordered rows on the red side the hindus and buddhists of the court upon the violet side the mahommedans the jains the jews only the central green ray compounded of these two factors blue and yellow remained empty showing nothing but a narrow marble walk bordered on either side by wide water ways out of which fountains shot high into the still dark air shot illumined so far by the lights then rising high above them mere ghostly shadows on the darkness to fall again in drops that grew iridescent as they fell there was no other illumination in the garden but the distant palaces were outlined in every curve every detail by little soft flickering lamplets like stars the running water in the waterways came out of the dark plinth below the dais and about fifty yards from it ran under a wider crossways marble platform which ended the narrow pathway emerging from this short hiding to fall rippling over a marble slope where safesheltered from every drop in deftly cut niches cunning little coloured lamps shone converting the whole cascade into a rainbow hence united the stream of the two waterways merged into one and flowed to disappear from the garden through a low archway tunnelled beneath the palace thence to find its way by underground passages to the tank at the bottom of the sikri ridge even as a mere spectacular effect the scene was striking but once the inner meaning of it so clear to the mind of the whiterobed figure on the throne was grasped it became of absorbing interest as representing the vast empire which akbar had so far succeeded in welding together first the surging misty radiance of the crowd at the end then strengthening as each ray narrowed the broad demarcations of the various religions professed by akbars subjects rajputs in their red robes on the one side elbowing the brahmins in the orange of the ascetic shiahs in purple beside the sunnis in indigo while in the yellow ray sate buddhists in their devotional colour in the blue the sufis the jews the jains all the smaller cults that are to be found in india between them centring all shone the green ray of the true faith the perfect equality of toleration and freedom which was akbars idealand it was empty perfect as the scene was every soul in the garden that night felt a consciousness of vague depression vague expectation eyes wandered as they were not used to wander from that central figure on the throne tis the talisman which the scapegrace wears whispered aunt rosebody ruefully from behind the latticed screen to little umm kulsum who was holding her handshe had been holding it practically ever since the fatal moment a few hours back when they had seen the prince walk away unconcernedly with the hidden diamond in his turban of state oh ummu i feel so cold down my back but there is no remedy against ones own acts though why such temptation should be put in the way of an old woman only god and his prophet knows but tis always so he had but one eye and the grit fell in it we did what we thought best auntie whimpered the mother of plumpness and we can take it back when the audience is overor we can die aunt rosebody shook her head mournfully dying is no good she protested but why doth not the scapegrace come and have done with it if oil isnt ready when the frying pans ready it had best go away in truth it appears long waiting mayhap for the last day sighed umm kulsum tragically last day echoed aunt rosebody snappishly lo who wants a last day not i sure i am betwixt and between earth too hard sky too far like the swallows please god theyll hurry up and let me get to my prayers lo there goes khodadad with a smile on his face true is it that lies only shine in the dark in truth khodadad stepped jauntily and his face shone with content as he passed to his place in the lightscreened plinth where the court officials were gathered awaiting the signal which was to summon them to the dais above there to range themselves behind the emperor for the coming audience it is nigh time said mirza ibrahim who as court chamberlain had charge of the ceremonies gentlemen are you ready then he bent forward to the newcomer and whispered something the whispered reply brought such satisfaction to ibrahims face also that he stared with open contempt at birbal who lounging in lazily late was making his way toward him my lord has nearly missed his chance he said meaningly nay sir chamberlain replied birbal coolly i am about to take it andand give it he held out a paper as he spoke the matter is urgent since as the envoy comes with all the insignia of royalty he must be presented before the heirapparent but such etiquettes are safe in the hands of a chamberlain for the rest he and his retinue await reception at the gate what ist asked khodadad in an undertone as he saw ibrahims face change but his own turned grayish green as over the shoulder he read the titular address i payandar tarkhan of the house of sinde coming by order impossible he gasped thisthis is some jest of my lord birbals payandar is there be other tarkhans so called besides the one who died in the wilderness retorted birbal slowly and this one comes as kingso he says read through the document mirza sahib and see if all is in order if so do the duty of chamberlain and be quick about it for yonder go the royal nakarahs the hour of audience has come gentlemen to our places i will inform the emperor a minute later the court officials stood in a serried semicircle behind the king and the green light the central light of the seven had divided into two and shone guarding either side of a narrow marble staircase which was disclosed leading upward to the dais at the foot of this stood mirza ibrahim reading aloud in a voice which betrayed his agitation the titular names and designations of the amir of sinde his mind was busy with a thousand questionings what did it all mean and why had khodadad been so disturbed surely their plans were secure surely the prince had been told of the talisman surely this knowledge would breed confidenceand sowith aiddefiance every one was ready that very night might see conspiracy successful at last the prince at last forced into taking his part let the royalty of sinde as represented by him who wears the insignia of royalty be welcome to the court of the sun of the world the words were spoken by abulfazl as prime minister his face showed a slight astonishment which was reflected even on akbars he leant forward as if eager to see the unexpected visitor and all eyes followed his toward the dim radiance of the distant crowd something there was in the multitude of faces half seen though deepshadowed which thrilled many of the lookers but the thrill passed into something like an electric shock as tearing the still night air with discordant clangour an almost inconceivable clash and crash of copper kettledrums and brass cymbals seemed to crack the ears that heard it instinctively almost every one present drew back from the sound blinked then opened eyes afresh upon the world of coloured lights and hidden imaginations even akbar started and birbal looking eagerly into his eyes gave a quick sigh of relief so swiftly had the start come and gone yet so real had been its effect upon every nerve that people felt dazed uncertain waking as it were to the perception that a figure was standing on the crossway platform of marble above the rainbow cascadestanding almost alone though backed by a confused crowding of retinue on either side the central waterway the only other figures really visible were two misshapen dwarfs one in front bearing a tasselled lance the other behind bearing a tasselled lance also but both showed jet black from head to foot and each carried the front one on his breast the one behind on his back a round brilliant mirror or was it a brilliant light certain it is that as the dwarfs strutted forward leading and following the central figure these round plaques shot out a dazzling brilliance and for an instant seemed to cloud all else the next thing that became clear was the vivid green of emeralds such ropes of them shining like young green wheatfields in the green radiance shed by the central light of green the emeralds of sinde sure enough said man singh half to himself and settled down comfortably to look as he sate heading the red ray of rajputs but there were others in those converging rays who stared and said doubtfully sure yonder are birbals daughters two dwarfs that all know until hushed by some neighbours contemptuous denial they also saw their mistake and looked with believing eyes there was one man however who though he denied strenuously grew grayer and grayer as he watched the slight figure with the long black curls resting on its sloping shoulders and the slight beard scarce covering the thin narrow cheeks tis sufurdar for sure muttered khodadad fighting against fearit is but the emeralds that bring the resemblancethat is allbefore god that is all so the green light in which the little group was enveloped growing greener as the three figures approached the dais they advanced until at the foot of the stairs the dwarfs stood one to each side the one who had walked in front wheeling to show his mirror also to the watching eyes to that confused crowd at the end of the garden these two shining spots glowed beneath the green lamps that was all and the familiar words of welcome given as akbar motioned the representative of sinde to the cushions beside him took all the strangeness from the scene it was the beginning of the marriage festival other princes had sent or would send their representatives sinde no doubt to curry favour with the mogul had sent its royalty by the hand of an envoy but the great event of the evening was yet to come for that was the reception of the bridegroomelect the heirapparentthe man who might come to his own any day since akbar was ever reckless of his own life had he not escaped by a miracle being killed at chaugan but the other day so the whole assembly stirred as one man when the royal nakarahs sounded once more and prince salim followed by a right royal retinue showed where the envoy of sinde had showed on the marble platform above the rainbow cascade lo ummu whispered auntie rosebody we did the right thing he looks the archangel gabriel let me go to bed in the dark my day is full and in truth the prince had never looked better in his life perhaps the wholeheartedness of his plunge into loves sea was the only reason why his hopes ran high perhaps he knew of the talisman he carried but carried it with no evil intention perhaps again those hopes of his had gone further than mere love so that he saw himself master of the situation able to give the rajput girl whom he had never seen the go by able to do in future what he chose what he desired but certain it is that every eye followed his youthful dignity with admiration and more than one looked furtively from the son to the father appraising both in that fathers mind however was no hint of jealousy only unmixed joy as he raised his son from his obeisance and kissed him on both cheeks it seemed to him as if at long last content had come to him the questionings which had so harassed him of late seemed to have fled here was an heir indeed how well thou lookest shaikie he whispered affectionately in the young mans ear ere taking him by the hand and leading him forward so that they might be seen by all the populace a goodly pair indeed the younger man somehowfor this evening at any ratewith more personal charm about him but the elder one even in his plain dress his unadorned turban a king every inch of him heralds read out the titles of this my beloved son salim akbars voice raised in command penetrated to the farthest corner of the garden and every ear strained to catch the honours that were to be showered on this heir to empire aunt rosebodys face flushed with anxiety grew crimson dark with sheer delight as she listened captain of ten thousandpraise be to allah she commented breathlessly what a viceroy in the northeastnow may i go to paradisemaster of distinctionswhat sunshade and fly whisk umm kulsum i go again to mecca to give thanksand the jewelsnot sirapa head to footnot sirapayesnow may they kill meone can take two kicks from a milch cow unalienabledid i hear rightummu tell me tell this poor old woman whowhocannot believeher ears unalienable never to be neglected always to be considered by right election and consent crown prince so far the mother of plumpness repeated in a trembling voice then the two women fell on each others necks and wept bring the well murmured auntie rosebody ill drown myself and akbar stood holding his heir by his right hand full of a great triumph lo i have given thee all shaikie he said fondly art content not all said a quiet voice beside him there is yet one honour withheld from this peerless prince this honourable heir it was the envoy from sinde who as the representative of royalty stood on akbars left hand a step behind him akbar flashed round on him haughtily what honour hath sinde to suggest the honour of brotherhood to the sun of the world the honour of the exchange of turbans the converging rays of spectators suddenly seemed to quiver as if some of their component parts stirred but the emperor stood still his eyes upon the envoys then his own narrowed with quick thought sinde is right he said slowly there is no tie like brotherhood it is the chain which links the whole world to one he turned swiftly to his son withdrawing his hand from him and so for an instant standing apart dissevered independent the stir in the rays grew more evident but his voice quieted it brother it said and its ringing tones filled the wide spaces let us exchange the sign of brotherhood his own simple turban with its herons plume was in his hand for an instant prince salim hesitated the next his more elaborate one with its hidden diamond was in his it could not be otherwise so smiled akbar giving himself up as he did always to imagination to sentiment to dreams take thou the inner place shaikie next my heartmy arms are longer long enough any how to reach round salims less sinewy ones and place the tufted turban of kingship on the young mans head where being a trifle too large it slipped well down over the ears and forehead thou must grow to it little brother quoth akbar in fond pleasure as for me i must walk circumspectly lest my brotherhood fall and in truth the princes turban showed all too much of the grizzled hair ummu i will go back and say thanksgiving till dawn faltered auntie rosebody behind the screen truly what is to be wont rub out the lord had it in his keeping all the time and we were wondering which side of the wall the cat would jump so the king hath his own again and salim hath more grace than the scapegrace deserves truly you may toil and sweat what fate wills youll get the proverb might have been quoted by many another in the assembly had they been able to realise at once the full meaning of the little incident but a sort of blank amaze settled down even on those conspirators who grasped at once that the chance of immediate defiance was over mirza ibrahim looked at khodadad khodadad at mirza ibrahim and their glances betrayed one and the same thought this was no accident someone had split on their secret who come my brother said akbar taking his sons hand and advancing toward the marble steps now that the conferring of titles is over let us pass to amusement the court ushers rushed to their places the royal nakarahs sounded and the cortege of the select few passed downward amid a seething shout of content from that dim crowd at the end of the garden but above that strange sound like a surging wave which seems to sweep along any densely packed mass of men rose another this had a rumble in it a sharp hiss then a deafening low long continued roar akbar who had just reached the narrow marble pathway stopped dead and looked round him sharply the reservoir he cried the reservoir above his instinct was right the rain of dawn had found some weak spot in the masonry and the next instant bursting its hidden way beneath the dais and hurling great blocks of marble before it a huge volume of water rose spurtling into the air run for it shaikie run for it leap from the platform the cry came not one moment too soon keeping within bounds by the very force of its onward impulse the great wave of water which would have hurled them down the marble cascade but just touched their heels as choosing different sides they leapt to safety leapt turbanless their illfitting headdresses having tumbled off at their first start the general shriek of horror at the impending catastrophe subsided into confused babels of relief centring round the prince on the left the king on the right so none noticed two men one on the right one on the left of the wide central waterway who instantly started to race two halffloating halfsinking objects which swept over the cascade by that wild impulse of flood were now unsteadily swirling down to be engulfed under the low archway leading to subterreanean passages and neither khodadad nor birbal had eyes for anything save the prize of that race a sudden swerve to the left taking the princes turban with its talisman almost within reach of the enemy decided birbal he paused a second then his low forward dive gave him a yard or two and he rose to find his hand and khodadads both clutching at what they sought but his was the nearer not so fast tarkhanjee he jibed breathless unable to resist retort even in that moment of stress beware stealing or thy list of crime is full this is my masters then the current caught him and hurled him almost helpless to the other side half a yard farther and he would have been sucked down into the archway but a thin arm clutched at him and the clutch held a brief struggle and he stood beside the rebeck player gazing at him stupidly but half conscious of who he was only for an instant however the next he faced khodadad who backed by mirza ibrahim was scowling at him across the water your pardon gentlemen he gasped politely as before their very eyes he calmly searched for and tore out the talisman which umm kulsum and aunt rosebody had sewn so deftly into the folds of salims turban but i would fain see if this be my masters headdress given him in brotherhood by his son yes of a surety it is it will be kept messieurs the appointed time and returned in due coursewith the talismanby all the gods with the talismani wot not if it be a true or a false oneto those who gave it with that he turned on his heel regardless of the volley of curses from over the water but he rounded fiercely on the rebeck players sardonic request to be remembered in that he had saved the masters life thou art the devil juggler he said and there was real fear in his voice get thee gone since before god i know not who thou art a laugh followed him chapter xviii longing for the unseen as never one longed passionate for seen remembering none from dawning to the setting of the sun save secret things unheard unseen unwon no man shall know till this worlds life is done saadi i would have sent for thee said atma softly but there was none to send the whole town was away at the festivalso i stayed she sighed almost fiercely in her regret at having been let and hindered though her eyes were tender as she gazed down on little zarifa who lay in the wayfarers arms it was bare dawn and in the shadow of the wall one could but just see the perfect outline of the sleeping face that nestled close to his pallid mask she fails fast methinks added the woman in a lower tone aye she failsat last echoed the mans voice as if to give them both the lie the whispered words brought a sudden smile to zarifas face her eyes opened full of swift desire her whole deformed body pressed closer to the breast on which it lay and there was unmistakable appeal in the soft curved cheeks the curved waiting lips the wayfarer answered it instantly and laid his to hers the kiss was long his mask came up from it with a certain repulsion of expression at once tender and cruel yea it is true she nears womanhood and what hath she to do with its blessing or with its curse he muttered looking at the face which satisfied had sunk to sleep once more a smile still hovering over it then he laid the misshapen bundle of humanity he heldso small so helpless so apart from everything save limited lifeon the string bed whence he had taken it and covered it gently with the quilt for the air of dawn was chill atma stood looking down on the beautiful face feeling a hot anger rise in her heart against all mankind thou didst never love her mother or thou wouldst not speak so she said scornfully the wayfarer who at the parapet was watching the slow growth of dawn turned on her swiftly not love her woman he echoed passionately fiercely that god knows it is her father that i hateit is for him i wait her father art thou not then began the charan in surprise but the rebeck player had recovered his calm monotony of manner her father truly he said since of love i brought her into the world of love i care for her of love i give her love as he spoke his fingers were busy about his neck and atma seeing him stoop over the sleeper saw also that he left something in the ghostly halfseen folds of the white quilt what ist she asked curiously stooping also conscious of a certain unreality in what had passed in what was passing she had sate up all night beside zarifa unable to leave her unable to get a message sent to summon any one and so unable to hear what was happening when so much might happen the nervous tension of that night of waiting of watching had been great yet she had forgotten it when in the false dawn the wayfarer had suddenly appeared since then she had been absorbed as he was in the childthis child of love ye gods what was it that exhaled roses the whole air was full of their scenther very eyes seemed to see them crowning the sleeping head hiding the scant contour of the deformed body and to her ignorant in a way yet from her birth familiar with mystical thoughts credulous of all mystical things the sudden inrush of unreality brought small surprise but quick curiosity and she caught imperatively at the wayfarers hand who art thou lord she asked simply in the name of this rose of love tell this slave the man drew back from her touch resentfully his face grew more human less deathlike and atma watching it wondered at the change in it and asked herself if this were indeed the poor musician who played for the chance hearers of the bazaars thou hast spoken a compelling word sister he said so thou shalt be told but guard the secret if thou lovestany i am payandarwhether king or hind matters little mayhap i am both since i am love incarnate and hate incarnate that is spiritual love which knows not sex and earthly love which lives by it and idoubtless thou hast heard the tale told as a legendi loved one who was to be my wife but she whom i held sacred my brother of wanton wickedness dishonoured yonder child is hisso the earthly love that is in me still despite the rose garden of the wilderness waits till the measure of his iniquity shall be full it will not be long he stretched his hand out menacingly and turned to go thy brother she echoed who he stopped her with a sudden wild gesture ask not that fool he cried passionately lo thou art very woman cleaving to the detail seeing naught of the spirit thou canst not even see that i have lied i tell thee she is my childthe child of the sins which i tarkhan inherited even as he didthe child of many sins that are in me even as they are in him he stooped over the sleeper and kissed her on the forehead master said atma tremulously as she saw him cross to the door must thou go i have waited longand now there comes one who will bring thee news and i will be back ere long he answered and even as he spoke a voice full of importance breathless with hurry came from the stairs mistress atma mistress i say god send she be not out or if mischief come of it i will be double damned for double treason the next instant old deena the drumbanger his drum hitched to his back like a huge hump hustled the departing musician at the door and flung himself blubbering at atmas feet lo chaste pillar of virtue said i not ever ill service was as the feeding of snakesone never knows but when one has to turn on them rather than that they should turn on thee he began tumultuously but i have come yea old deena hath to remember his soul and if mistress siyah yamin siyah yamin what of her queried atma sharply even as she added speak lower fool thou wilt disturb the child deena made a grimace of apology pursed his face up looked at the sleeper shook his head with elaborate regret and then hitching his drum round to equalise his balance squatted with his elbows resting on it ready for a calm whispered recital of what he had come prepared to tell there is no need to begin at the beginning he said tentatively and was rewarded by atmas curt tell all slave i have been held here by the child all night and know nothing thank god for ignorance ejaculated the old gossip piously and went on to recount the events of the past night atma listened quietly she started and clasped her hands tighter when she heard how the king and prince salim had exchanged turbans but her long nights vigil had brought so many visions of what birbals wit might compass that she scarcely felt surprised the story of the bursting of the reservoir and the miraculous escape of the father and son however told as it was from the outside for old deena naturally knew nothing of the extraordinary import of the incident he was describing roused her instant alarm prate not about their bareheadedness she broke in on his tale of how the two had stood before the multitude shorn of honourable headgear but mighty in monarchythe turbans man the turbans what of them deenas wicked old eyes lost their sparkle his tone grew peevish lo mistress wouldst spoil the picture doubtless they drowned who thinks of turbans when atma was on her feet bide thou here i must go she said hurriedly she felt she could no longer stand inaction all this had came aboutif indeed it had come about yea i must go to siyah yamin she repeated blindly old deena laid a detaining hand on her red skirt not there mistress not there lo thou hast not heard what i come to tell thou didst bid me begin at the beginning and i began but tis not only scorpions tails that end in a sting and this one hath venom in it i swear if thou hadst heardnay listen mistress twas meean khodadad and mirza ibrahim who came raging to siyah yamins half an hour agone i had gone back thither after the show was over to have speech with yasmeen and the hussy was virtuous and would not let me in so standing there i heard what asked atma fiercely canst not speak without twists and turns lo mistress let my tongue follow my brain as the potters donkey follows muddy breeches thinking them his master replied deena mildly i am at the very prick o the point they swore vengeance on thee for what i know not protesting that thou and thou only couldst be the cause and then they swore at siyah yamin for telling thee but gingerly for look you siyala is not one to threaten lightlybut she saiddoubtless with that smile which makes a body feel like a camel without legs what said she fool interrupted atma exasperated that without the seeing of thee she could not tell whereupon they said that if they saw thee atma caught up a white cloth and wrapped it round her stay thou here she said imperatively the child sleeps and i will be back in half an hour she was well down the stairs ere deena ceased to call feebly not so oh mistress most chaste not so and resigning himself to circumstances closed the door hasping it lightly by the bottom hook and chain then sate down beside the sleeping child even as a peri he murmured to himself as he looked at the face showing more clearly now in the coming light truly god knows his own workyet is there no mortal sense in sending such a countenance of beauty with no body to match it fit for hugging so he dozed off into the sleep which pure vice had taught him to take in snatches meanwhile atma hurrying through the still deserted alleys felt her mind too much in a tumult for concentration thus as she almost ran past the high unarched doorways the blank walls shutting out all things the constant burr of the unseen handmills busy over their daily task of grinding flour came to join the unceasing burr of thought that whirled in her brain doubt as to her own wisdom had assailed her the night long and now with this uncertitude concerning the fate of the diamond she felt she could have killed herself for the part she had played in its theft why had she played it why why the futility of fighting against fate came home to her as from a closed courtyard rose shrilly the voice of a woman chanting the song of the grinding stone and the grounden wheat red sandstone and redhusked wheat whirl in your dancing part and meet my right hand is your master what if the stone be rushed what if the grain be crushed men and women must eat the cry of the child be hushed whirl faster and faster gods right hand is our master what though love mates with lust though just yield to unjust what care the stone and the wheat for men and women must eat the cry of the child be hushed so dust grind dust dust grind dust she smote her hands together and sped on she could at least challenge these men for the truth and tell them that they lied she had told no tales and as she made her breathless way toward satanstown mirza ibrahim and meean khodadad were making their way back from it they had gained nothing from siyah yamin save biting words and contemptuous gibes she had done her part and there would be time to hold her fool when it was proved that atma had betrayed her for herself she did not believe it and in so saying she for once spoke her real thought she knew briefly that treachery was out of the question with her sister of the veil but the two men held manlike to what was on the surface fret not khodadad said mirza ibrahim with a sinister smile as they passed out from the courtesans house there is no hurry to settle scores with the madwoman i being chamberlain claim her as the kings woman and then then may i go shares with thee or take thy leavings muttered khodadad fiercely that may be thy revenge but i am tarkhan tarkhan or no it grows too light for us now meean sahib so fare thee well for the time remarked ibrahim significantly and in truth the sky was beginning to show pearly over the pile of the city tarkhans need no darkness for their deeds retorted khodadad recklessly his temper as ever had overmastered him he was literally beside himself with rage and disappointment these two confederates were fools what man could succeed bound hand and foot by chickenhearted cowards like ibrahim and the rest of them but heaye he would take revenge dawn though it was for he was tarkhan accredited to evil deeds to siyah yamins paradise he said flinging himself into the palanquin which followed behind him the madwoman lived in the same tenement so much he knew and the rest would come if he had luck if not there was no harm done pure devilry possessed him he could not rest without some attempt at retaliation and so old deena woke from his snatched snooze at whispering voices outside followed by a steady calculated shouldering of the door a slip of the illhasped chain and the sudden consequent sprawl of half a dozen stalwart abyssinians on to the roof back slaves said khodadad his voice low and hoarse with passion that leapt up with the chance of satisfaction and close the door behind you old deena scrambled to his feet my lord my lord he expostulated every atom of virtue in him rising up scandalised at the intrusion all the more so perhaps because of his loose life this roof is the abode of chastity fool said the tarkhan seizing him easily by the throat the womanwhere is she speak low or i strangle thee sheisnot here gasped the old manmercy lord mercy not herethou liest still holding deena fast pinned against the wall khodadads eyes flashed round the roof there were no shadows now the morning light clear and fresh filled every corner ye gods and devils the words came low almost soft with the sudden inrush of admiration as khodadads hands fell away from the old mans throat and he took one step toward the bed my lord my lord cried deena starting forward she is ill she is a childshe is he staggered back from the blow dealt him recklessly she is beautifulthat is enough came with a chuckling laugh wake my houri wake up my peri of paradise there was a faint scream the mere cry as it were of a wounded bird nay beauty thou shalt kiss me what scent of roses and no love pah how the perfume gets into my brain never but once beforebut this is no time for the past nay struggle not such beauty needs no veiling the little murmuring wail died to silence and the half jibing voice was silent also so horrorstruck khodadad stood for one instant before the deformity he had unshrouded then with a curse he turned and fled deena still dazed with the blow crept over to the bed and covered crippledom again little one he crooned there is no fearhe will not come back but there was no answer and he leant swiftly to listen for a breath little one little one he cried he could hear none and as he stooped his wrinkled face puckering into tears a voice behind him said quietly she is dead lo it was time deena turned to see the rebeck player who closing the door softly came to stand beside the bed dead dead blubbered the old sinner yea yea it is sohis kisses killed heronly his kisses whose the question echoed and reechoed over the roof instinct with a sudden new fire a sudden authority and it reduced deena to snivelling submission only a kiss lord only a kiss but meean khodadad he paused struck dumb by the expression on the wayfarers face grief horror exultation showed on it and over all a great awe as of one who sees a mystery khodadad oh thou most mighty khodadad it is the end chapter xix love sent music to sing loves praise so harmony came to this worlds sad ways master of melody caesar of sound each chord he struck fettered reasoning till man and beast by it quite were bound into friendship fast and companioning yea at the note of his crooked lyre one wakened up one was lulled to sleep and the whole wide world grew quick with desire to dance and to die to laugh and to weep at the burst of his blended melody the heart of the wise knew the mystery nizami lo i am true cried atma menacingly art thou so also o siyal she had been with the courtesan for full half an hour time was running short and yet she felt that she had gained nothing and knew scarcely more than she had done when she had climbed the steep oilgreased narrow stairs to the balcony room she had been eager then to face factif need bekeen to test the loyalty of her fellow conspirators but now she stood baffled before siyah yamins easy but inflexible contempt that someone had betrayed them the latter said was indubitable and as atma was the only outsider she must be the culprit not necessarily a conscious offender but by all she held most sacred did not atma know of some indiscretion could she not briefly guessand then the noisy yet silvery laugh had rung out at the charans telltale face her tongue however had been loyal she had refused to say a word not that she felt in any way bound to shield mihrunnissa from the possible revenge of those whose game she had given away but because it was out of the question to tell of the secret visit of a screened lady so siyah yamin had declined information except by fair barter declined it with jibes and smiles but now sudden pallor came to her face she shifted her eyes uneasily from atmas half accusing ones true she echoed and and her voice had a petulant ring in it aye as true as it befits womanhood to be lo ato i grow tired of my sex at times and would i were a man she pressed her hands close to her heart then suddenly burst out again into her hard silvery laugh and thou sweet widowdost not pine for thy lover sher khan is he not here despite thesepetticoats she flounced out her clinging muslins peace fool so thou wilt not tell said atma frowning then i must ask elsewhere aye ask jibed the courtesan there be many with tongues beside poor little me who will look you have confidence for confidence belike the beneficent ladies or mayhap rajah birbal for the envoy from sinde whom some deem a mere simulacrum of a man or even the feringhi jewellerto say nothing of the king himself her eyes were keenly on the charans face as she spoke but there was no flicker of expression to give her any clue in truth atma was absolutely in the dark she did not even know if the turban were lost or found her mind ran riot over supposition in either case if the former it could not remain lost for ever in those underground chambers it might even now have drifted to the tank where a hundred hands might find it she must go and watch and yet what use the rather send divers to search below if indeed any man would so adventure his life and for this she must proclaim a cause proclaim that she knew of the theft and after all there might be no reason for this birbal with his quick wit must have saved the turban he must yet not even he could outwit fate she smote her hands together again impotently as she ran this time toward the roof which she had left too long that feeling of neglected duty strangely enough overmastered all others she must go back to her immediate charge once there she would have time to think what she must do to find out the truth for she must find it even if she had to go to the king himself tell him all and then repay herself for treachery by the death dagger but what she found awaiting her on the roof drove these thoughts from her mind for a time only for a timethat time which meant nothing to one brought up as she had been in a philosophy which counts the past the present the future as one for in india there is no hurry about anything the wisdom of isaiah is in every mouth he that believeth shall not make haste yet as she joined in the womans wailing over zarifafor the news of death spreads quickly and the neighbours troop in as to a festivala dull wonder lay at the back of her brain a vague resentment at her own ignorance in truth the resentment was scarcely justifiable since many others concerned in the incident were feeling the same dull surprise the conspirators first of all who found themselves once more deprived of their point dappui and khodadad the archplotter was strangely silent strangely lacking in suggestion as the day wore on indeed he withdrew petulantly from all conclave and taking mirza ibrahim with him plunged into pleasure at satanstown for something in that scent of roses on the roof something in the look of that face sleeping so peacefully upon the pillow had roused memory and memory in her long slumber had somehow from some subliminal consciousness in that unknown ego of which khodadad tarkhan was the outward and visible sign associated herself with regret he told himself lightly that it was the shock of seeing deformity where he had expected beauty which had unnerved him but it was not that it was the ineffaceable memory of beauty itself then in the palace where umm kulsum and aunt rosebody had sate in the little balcony outside the latters private room all the morning unable to feel joy over the merciful escape of the most high and their scapegrace darling because of the probable loss of the turban with its talisman yet unable to feel sufficient grief over the latter because of bubbling gladness over the brotherhood between those two dear ones a brotherhood that nothing must disturb not even selfseeking confession of sin on to all this had followed a dull wonder as to what was to be done next for after noonday prayers were over had come a despatch by hand from my lord birbal chief constable of the kingdom returning in due course of etiquette to the givers the turban they had supposed lost and what is more when their anxious fingers had privilege to pry there was the talisman also safe and sound the shock of relief kept them both silent awhile then aunt rosebody cracked all her knuckles vehemently so goes care she cried adding piously truly we might have trusted god his club makes no noise and whats in the pot comes on the plate then her face clouded but what is to be done next ummu she asked feebly umm kulsum shook her head we might give it back to the woman what interrupted the little old lady peevishly to a civetcat from the bazaar of whom we know nothing there was the red woman also auntie suggested the mother of plumpness she seemed honestat least when she came to tell mihrus fortunea pack of lies sniffed her companion canst think of nothing better child mayhap it might be wiser suggested umm kulsum again to consult consult whom shrilled gulbadan khanum and this time the interruption was wrathful what would be the use of asking hamida all know her answer tell truth and shame shaitan and as for rakiya begum with her spectacles and her etiquettes and her distiches i would sooner die now it would be different if dearest lady were alive she paused and her lively dark eyes grew limpid with sudden tears we can go where she went for wisdom whispered little umm kulsum consolingly we can pray aunt rosebody gave a grunt of satisfaction and dried her eyes aye there is some sense in that we can pray and wait twill at least give us time to think out some plan for ourselves and sleep brings wisdom but ummu ummu i would give every hair i possessand though they are gray they are not uncomelythat i had never mixed myself up with the kings luck tis worse than the day of resurrection for then a body will but have two roads to chooseup and downand here lo wonder grows like a white ants castle in this feeling aunt rosebody was not alone birbal himself was in a similar state of blank surprise for to him had come the most startling denouement of all after the momentous events of the night he had felt himself entitled to a few hours rest he had had little of it by day or by dark ever since he had discovered the theft of the diamond for he had given himself up wholly to the recovery of the stolen jewel but now that he had this safely stowed away in his waistbandpurse he could spare leisure for comfort so he slept the sleep of the just without a dream to disturb him yet his brain must have been working for when he woke it was to a sense that in the excitement of the moment of success he had made a mistake had he had time to consider he would never have given himself away to his enemies as he had done by showing them that he knew of the talisman it was a tactical error which might be partially rectified so far as some people were concerned therefore without further delay he sent a message to william leedes at the hall of labour to come up to him at once bringing the false diamond with him when this arrived it did not take long to exchange the true for the false and then with due decorum to send the turban back to the beneficent ladies who he knew from what mihrunnissa had said had given it to the prince he calculated cunningly that this return would at least keep them quiet and women were invariably at the bottom of every conspiracy he felt very secure very confident very complacent and spent an hour or two in entertaining william leedes with eastern sumptuousness ere ordering the palanquins to take the jeweller and the diamond back to safe keeping in the hall of labour whence he assured himself no thief in the world would have another chance of purloining it in truth he had some reason for complacency since the general outlook was clearing these repeated failures must dishearten the enemies of empire and the mere fact of the bond of brotherhood between the king and his sonwhich had come incidentally by the way in the course of counterplotadded to the chance of akbar being content with practical politics and remaining at fatephur sikri the only unsatisfactory item in past or present was the memory of the man who juggled with other mens eyes and ears who and what was he a friend to akbar at any rate and for the time being that was enough the wide roof of the hall of labour lay ablaze with afternoon sunshine as they entered it and as they passed along the arcades the workmen looked up and salaamed the door of diswunts studio was locked and barred and a sentry paced across that of the jeweller known though they were it required the password ere william leedes could produce his key unlock the door enter then close and lock it again behind them birbal gave a sigh of relief as he drew out his waistbandpurse at last he said holding out the diamond replace it on the lathe sir jeweller and once i see it therelo i will vow pilgrimage if needs be yea i will cry hari ganga like any drunk man in a puddle he turned aside out of sheer lightheartedness humming a ghazal from hafiz make fast a wine cup to my shroud that at the latter day my soul a good drink be allowed to nerve it for the fray meanwhile the jewellers deft hands were busy a few turns a click or two and william leedes bent over the treasure joyfully there it is my master with naught but a few days delay in the cutting thereof i must be all the quicker now else the king will wonder yet have i lost as little time as may be since the next facet is assuredit will run so the delicate steel point he held just touched the surface then it fell away from it as the hand holding the instrument seemed to shrink back the foot too left the treadle and the spinning pivots slackened speed and sank to rest what ist asked birbal turning hastily the jewellers face was white his very jaw had fallen itit scratches he muttered faintly there is some mistake there was no mistake about the scratch however it showed distinct and wrote the truth without a shadow of doubt this was no diamond it was a fraud like the other for an instant birbals head whirled then helplessly he fingered his purse again could he by chance have made a mistake and sent back the wrong one impossible and yet he sank on the jewellers seat and covered his face with his hands for once his wit was not quick enough to grasp the situation and clogging thoughtthat dim suspicion recurred despite denialhad he by chance made a mistake so atma as she sate apart on the roof watching the mahommedan woman prepare zarifas body for the burial which was to take place at sunset had no monopoly in confusion and wonder she could take no part in what was going on she dare not from fear of defilement even touch the dead child with a kiss but she sate jealously watching that every ceremonial was duly carried out lo she is lovely as any houri now chattered the dom women who had come in to perform the last offices as they bound the corpse with gold tinsel to the string bedstead on which it was to be carried to the grave tis a sin for sure to have more body in death than in life but what will you mayhap munkir and niker seeing her look so may not ask questions but give her a decent body for paradisesure she needed one poor thing footnote the two recording angels so they stood looking down on their handiwork and in truth the crippled child looked very beautiful the rebeck player saying it was the custom of his tribe had hired from somewhere a low oblong lidless coffin more like a deep picture frame than anything else and in this as it lay on the bed these tirewomen of the dead had so disposed draperies and pillows and whatnot that all the curves of the budding womanhood showed beneath the face that remained more beautiful even in death than it had been in life it was covered only with a fine network for the veil was draped carefully on either side the slender neck one corner of it and a loop of jasmin chaplet fell over the dingy worn gilt of the coffin frame lo many will envy death his bride and send regrets after her as she passes by said the oldest of the domni nodding her head wisely and it was so for as the two bearersit needed but two for that biershuffled at sunsettide with their light burden through the crowded bazaar more than one careless eye grew to sudden interest and one spectator an idle reckless looking man who sate on a sherbetsellers threshold joking with a light woman in an upper balcony ceased his sarcasms to murmur a stanza from hafiz for he was rhymster too no more from poets lips shall love songs pass she who once garnered them is deadalas there were few mourners only the professional wailers and the rebeck player who with bent head followed the bier making mournful music as he went atma of another creed still held aloof walking veiled and stately some way behind and all around them slipping aside to let the dead pass for the most part careless almost unheeding were the living buying selling gossiping chaffering atma drew breath more freely when they were through the city gates and the bearers stepped out more quickly over hard stretches of sand and waste hillocks set with thorn and caper bushes toward the little cemetery which the musician had chosen a few gnarled jhand trees decked with coloured snippets of cloth tied there by many mourners a few nameless rolypoly concrete graves a sprinkling of tiny turrets showing where someone was laidsomeone whose resting place was unknown to all save the women who came thither every week to mournmarked the spot a dreary lonesome spot in truth but the westering sun showed warm and red over the desert horizon and the chipping notes of the sevenbrother birds sounded cheerful as the family flitted from one tree to another the grave was already dug and the diggers stood by waiting for their days pay it was a wide deep grave looking as if it had been cut out of yellow rock so dry so even were the sides and the low arch of the long niche on one side in which the corpse was to be laid as in a coffin was as regular as if built in with unburnt brick to atmas surprise the floor of this niche was set thick as by a coverlet with roses she glanced hastily at the rebeck player but he was already immersed in the prayers with which an attendant priest had greeted the little procession she listened gravely repeating to herself meanwhile the formulasso few so simpleof her own creed and yet when after saying aloud the prayer for benediction the rebeckplayer stood forward raised the sad gracious figure from the coffin and stepping into the grave laid it gently in the niche she shivered as she saw him stoop to gather up a handful of earth we created you of dust and we return you to dust and we shall raise you out of the dust upon the day of resurrection the words seemed to her almost horrible to be left lying alone in the desert waiting waiting waiting for what for yourselfthe old mean self of which she was so tired ah better surely to find rest at once in the great self which pervaded all things wilt thou not throw earth also said a voice beside her then throw flowers these are the roses of love the rebeck player pulled aside the kerchief covering a flat basket which one of the dom women had carried and lo there were roses red at their hearts pale where the sun had kissed them their scent filled the air yea lord she said meekly i will throw them the priest the bearers the dom women had disappeared their task done only the gravediggers chattered to one another as they filled in the grave lo she would have been ripe for kisses soon and now the worms have got her said one discontentedly ballah friend quoth the other lovers die but love dies notthere be ever other food for lust in the world throw them into thy life also sister said the musician suddenly there is no fear or blame in love so as he stood watching the shovelsful of earth hide the roses which covered little zarifa he played softly on his rebeck and sang a whispering song to its wailing music love is a full red wine bowl passion the bubbles on its rim drink deep down to the dregs soul heed not the froth on the brim passion has wings like an eagle love needs none she is at rest flood tide fullas the seagull drifts the cold wave at her breast love is the lightless ether passion the starshine it lets through building senseworlds beneath her love seeks not form seeks not hue passion has myriad senses love has not voice eyes nor ears space time life moods and tenses chain not her soul to the years love is a sail midocean losing itself in the whole passion the wavelets commotion blurring the shores of the soul he ceased suddenly and his whole face changed the grave was filled up the diggers were already passing stolidly back to the city on the desert horizon the red sun had lost its warmth and was sinking coldly behind the gray verge lo i have done with love came the musicians mocking voice so take this sister and may it bring thee more luck than it hath brought payandar for him only hate remains when she looked up from her hasty glance at what he had thrust into her hand the rebeck player was moving away rapidly after the gravediggers and she was left alone looking at the newmade grave looking at the quaint green stone she had just been given chapter xx a trembling fell on mountain and on plain the earth unstable as a jugglers ball became a rolling sphere the dust rose up high to the collar of heaven the clarion of the wind roused shock on shock and from the valleys streams the fish outcast lay gasping lightning flash on lightning flash split the wide sky the sinking rocks disjointed filled with water and the hills clasping each other squeezed themselves to death nizami khodadad khan tarkhan sate at the head of his supper cloth with the dazed look of one who has taken drugs in his eyes and in truth he had drugged himself body and soul to the uttermost he had passed from one pleasure to another and all the while he had raged inwardly at the necessity for seeking yet further forgetfulness since after all what had he to forget only the shock of seeing deformity for the rest was dead as the past years which had contained it and yet he could not forget even as he had come hither to this last stimulant to jaded appetitean al fresco entertainment out in the desert stretches beyond the city where all the wallowing wickedness of humanity would show up the more alluringly vicious against that pure background of solitude and silenceeven then he had shrunk back as from a snake before a glimpse that had come to him in the bazaar of a dead face it could not be the same girl from whom he had turned horrorstruck that morning for his practised eye noted in a second all those graceful contours of budding womanhood which showed above the shallow coffin besides why should she die he had barely kissed her andhe laughed cynically as the thought came to himwhere was the woman who objected to a kiss who was the worse for it were they not made for it he flung his arm round yasmeena who lolled on the cushions beside him and kissed the heartshaped curve of skin which her swelling filmy bodice left exposed below her dimpled chin she slapped him lightly on the cheek and the company laughed at his frown none can escape wounds in the red rose garden where no rose but arms with thorns her beauty quoted one of the guests my lord is over hasty our stomachs are not yet satisfied though by the twelve imams this saffron pillau of tender chicken filters fast to my vitals he leered at siyah yamin who threw up her dainty little head disdainfully keep thy spiced sentiment to thyself fool she replied archly i desire no forced feeling of fowl the laugh at her retort ran round boisterously and even khodadad joined in it but it was a mirthless laugh still as the hours went on the fun waxed fast and furious and the stars above must have been glad of the widespread square canopy of tent which hid some of the doings of man from high heaven it was well on into the night ere the first guest excusing himself jingled in his palanquin back cityward so by ones and twos the party dispersed until khodadad was left alone looking contemptuously down at mirza ibrahim whose senses had deserted him in the long orgie and who lay helpless amid wine cups torn shreds of muslin and all the indescribable beastliness of uncontrolled amusement take the fool home slaves said the tarkhan thickly and bring a bed here i stop the night air will cool my brain so in the midst of all the refuse of vicious humanity they set a dirty string bed and covered it with satin quilts as he lay on it he formed fit matching to its hidden squalor it was now the hour before the false dawn that hour of slumber even for wickedness and wrong the servants outwearied by long ministering to every whim of their masters were soon asleep even while they simulated watchfulness but khodadad lay awake halfdrugged halfdrunk though he was his nerves tingled he started at the least sound possibly some vague unacknowledged fear of what the darkness might bring had lain at the bottom of his resolution to sleep were he was where none could know of his presence yet everything disturbed him a prowling jackal a mere noiseless shadow in the moonlight made him sit up and watch till it had slunk away how still how horribly still the desert was one could almost hear the soft patter of the birds feet which would leave delicate tracery upon the sand for the dawn to discover and then his mind flew back to another still hot night in the past surely it must have been about this time of year perchance this was the very night was it so his brain reluctant yet insistent traced back the past nay it could not beand yet yet it was before that aye and after that and by an odd chance beyond a low thicket of caper bushes that bounded the desert to one side of the scene of past orgie lay the little cemetery where zarifa slept so soundly he did not know this but he lay awake thinking of her ye gods why could he not sleep what had he to fear a tarkhan in a strange country nothing on the morrow he would be himself free of all thingsfree to do as he chose and so suddenly with the comfort of the thought came slumber was it for an instant or for an hour he sate up the sweat starting from him with causeless fear to look about him he could see nothing all was darkness itself then a sense of constriction about his forehead made him raise his hands to feel if aught were there god and his prophet he was blindfolded he was on his feet in a second but even as he rose strong hands of iron grip closed round his and despite a wild struggle he stood helpless his arms fast pinioned to his sides what ist he asked putting unfelt boldness into his voice it sounded thick almost unintelligible dalil tarkhan of the royal house thou art summoned to the last assize of thy peers the answer came from close so close that it seemed to knell in his ear as if it came from inside himself and it brought a sudden throb of purely animal dread to his heart but he essayed a laugh this was not real it was but a disordered dream a nightmare due to the excesses of the day his peers here in a strange land where were they wherefore he asked the answer was too swift for him to judge of the quality of his own voice the other was resonant though still curiously personal curiously close to him because the measure of thine iniquities is full at last mount the white horse and ride bravely to judgment as thou hast ridden bravely to sin he felt himself halfforced forward halfwillingly yielding to unseen pressure and he told himself again it was but a dream the sooner through with it the sooner to wake it could not go on forever the warmth of the horses body felt against him brought another throb of fear he heard its screaming neigh was it indeed the tarkhans white stallion of death which he bestrode ah if he could but see could but move but his feet were fast bound beneath the warm breathing belly his arms were close pinioned to his side for an instant he thought of shrieking aloudit might at least wake him then somethingperhaps pride of race and that admonition to bear himself bravelyheld him back from cries whither were they taking him the way seemed endless and he fought for bare breath between the mad throbbings of his heart his very lips tingled and smarted as the life blood pulsed irregularly through them would that ceaseless strain and relaxation of muscle as the horse galloped on and on never end must he always wait and wait for what something worse perhaps halt he gave a convulsive gasp the whole universe seemed to stand still so an awful and intolerable silence settled down on all things who are ye he cried at last in desperation and his voice rang out strident yet quavering like an illtuned violin a low reverberating roll of kettledrums was the only answer and an uncontrollable shiver shook him replying to the shudder with which they filled the air who are ye this time the cry had a wail in it but once again that roll of kettledrums was the only answer who are ye it was a mere whisper hoarse halfchoked but this time a voice came instant clear in reply unbind his eyes heralds and let him see those who judge him the flood of moonlight seemed at first to blind him and even after his eyes recovered sight a mistiness a vagueness rested on all things and yet he saw all things aye and recognised them not from personal experience for the last assize was even in those days fast becoming legendary but from the racial experience which he could not escape aye beneath him was the white stallion of death standing square upon the square of white cloth whose purpose sent a shiver of horror through him those were the heralds masked veiled who rode on black horses beside him and at their feet curled up cowering like loathsome reptiles he could see the two executioners their long fingers clutchingat what not a sword or a dagger no he knew what they held and with a wild hope of pardon his strained eyes sought beyond these nearer things the semicircle of faces before which he stood the moonbeams showed them clear yet blurred how like himself they were these chieftains of the barlas clan and whence had they come from the grave surely some of them or were they only simulacra was it indeed the race which sate in judgment on him the race and so himself ah in that case what hopewhat chance of life had he dalil and then suddenly there leaped to clearness the figure which centred the wide semicircle of dim countenances it was dressed in regal robes it wore the emeralds of sinde and there was no mistaking the face which stared at him with cold implacable justice payandar he gaspedhast come back from the dead to kill me from a life that has been a death i come to judgment was the reply chiefs of the barlas clan assembled for this high purpose listen listen to the record of this mans iniquities and say if the cup be full it was a long record yet dalils memory gave assent to all and as each crime was counted a surging murmur of acquiescence came from those listening faces it seemed to deaden the miserable mans senses for after a time he forgot all things but that one accusing figure in its royal robes and the hard cold accusing voice it is but eight he muttered hoarsely no tarkhan can be condemned by eight listen o chief of the barlas clan interrupted the accuser to the ninth crime yestermorn he did of vile licence kill with his lustful kiss khodadad essayed a mocking laugh with a kiss what then lucky for any maiden to be so honoured by a tarkhan so much the more lucky for such a devils mash of deformity his own daughter rang out the charge harder colder crueller his daughter by the rosebud of love which he dishonoured his daughter whom he called into being without cause when he defiled her mother ah now he knew now he understood whythe thought came to dalil even as he fought blindly against it thou liest he murmured thickly she was payandars spawn he he is the accuser returned the voice calmly and by his right of tarkhan he swears it before the last assize speak chiefs of the barlas clan doth this man deserve sentence once again that surging assent mingled with the rolling of kettledrums filled dalils ears but through it he heard the words executioners open the veins of his neck and let the barlas blood go free of his vile body let him bleed to death while i the king mourn the spilling of good barlas blood then from all around seemed to arise a low wailing backed still by that quivering roll of the kettledrums the veiled figures rose slowly a blackness rose also obliterating all save awful fear ah he knew what was coming he knew was that the keen prick of a long lancet at his throat was that a warm stream trickling trickling oh ye gods and devils it was time to wake ohi my son ohi my brother the longdrawn wail rose louder and louder wake wake wake what a hideous dream it was she was notshe could not be his an awful cry halfchoked broke from him it was bloodwarm bloodhis own blood caressing his bosom nestling at his heart wake wake ohi my brother ohi my son something surged in his brain he heard no more it was dawn the delicate tracery of the desert birds feet showed close up to the edge of the ruffled carpets whereon layhideously confusedall the indescribable refuse of sensuality which the mind has enabled humanity to bring to bear upon its pleasures but he who had called all the past lust and licence into being still slept peacefully on the squalid string bed beneath the rich satin quilts a servant or two wakened and yawned then seeing his services unrequired slept again so swiftly the sun rose with a ruffling wind that followed the footsteps of the birds in circling eddies and passed on leaving the sand without a sign of passage on it he sleeps long said one a servant let him sleep grumbled another when he wakes it will be but another service of sin for him and us but others needed the quick wit and relentless purpose of khodadad so almost ere dawn had passed to day two or three horsemen came galloping from the city intent on finding help from the archconspirator god and his prophet faltered mirza ibrahim shrinking back from the shoulder on which he had laid an awakening hand he is dead dead and cold there was no sign of violence upon him only on his neck two blue marks mere signs as it were of scratches about half an inch long he has died in the night said ghiass beg with a shiver no one is to blame god send he had time for a prayer but mirza ibrahim clutched the complacent lord high treasurer by the arm and gasped look look in front of the tent just beyond the ruffled carpet lay a square of white cloth and on it as if in blood lay clear distinct the red marks of a horses hoofs tis the sign he whispered his face ashen gray the sign that judgment has been passed by his peers chapter xxi no strength of hand no strength of foot have i to reach the restful heaven of thy throne yet can my souls eyes gaze upon the sky and finding dream there dream the truth mine own even while wearied by its ceaseless strife i watch the shuttle in the loom of life nizami that selfsame dawn akbar the king sate alone as he so often did upon a large flat stone which lay in a lonely spot beside the anup tank he was dressed in the saffron sheet of an ascetic and a fold of it drawn across the lower part of the face completely disguised him though the few persons abroad at this early hour were not of the class from whom he could fear detection or even interruptionexcept perhaps a petition for a blessing for this was the widows hour that strange hour in india while the world still sleeps when sorrowful womanhood works out the salvation of mankind when dim ghostlike in their white shrouding figures creep out of the shadowy homes burdened with the sins of men and after washing them away in the chill waters of dawn creep back to the hearthstones ere the sun rises upon the devoted drudgery of another widows day the sight of these figures the whole scene unreal mystical had always had a fascination for akbar a curious almost angry interest he felt himself helpless before it king though he was true he had abolished suttee by a sweep of his pen the swift cruel sacrifice of life he had checked but this longdrawn agony was beyond him and what did it mean when all was said and done his active mind ever wrestling with problems of the psychic world fought for a conclusion on this the question which has puzzled so many inquirers whence and wherefore comes the sense of sin which in the woman lies ever at the root of sex making her falsely modest or boldly brazen how silent they were these mateless almost sexless bodies whose souls were seekingthrough past aeons and for endless centuries to comesalvation not for themselves but for their men folk the very water slipped noiselessly over the shaven unveiled heads that slipped into it as noiselessly sound only came when on the red sandstone steps of the tank once more they again drew their wet shrouds round youth and age alike drip drip drip the water fell in bloodred tear drops beside the bloodred print of their bare feet upon the stones a dolorous way indeed a dolorous life a couple of graycrested cranes mates evidently showed nestling side by side as they stood kneedeep in the gray levels of the tank levels which brimmed up from the dim shadowy steps of the dim shadowy reflections in the water of the dim shadowy realities of stunted bushes and gnarled caper trees that rose against the dim gray of coming dawn why was not humanity like the birds accepting the great mystery of generation as differing not one whit from other functions of life there lay the puzzle what sin was it that the woman had committed in the dawn of days yea the dawn came fast below the distant verge of sight the brighthued riders of the day were galloping hard each bringing his pennant to the battle of light and darkness blue upon gray violet tinting the blue so passing to red flaming to orange then with one throb of primrose light he felt the thrill of itthat endless quiver of the ether waves passing on and on regardless of him around him through him in himfelt it in a sudden answering shiver of nerve and vein and muscle as he stood up absorbed utterly in adoration thy blessing o my father came a voice beside him may thy sacrifice be propitious o my daughter he replied mechanically and may the kingofkings live forever his slave kisses the dust of his footsteps he turned hastily kingship coming back to him at once to recognise atma devi crouching at his feet the wet folds of her widows shroud clung to every curve of her supple body after a night spent in fruitless inquiry she had come to the tank at the earliest point of dawn to wander fruitlessly in search round its shores so after a hasty performance of her sacrifices she was on her way cityward again when she had seen the solitary figure and guessing instinctively that it was the kingfor his habits were known to all his peoplehad come to test her suspicion and so perchance gain direct speech of someone from whom surely she might hear the truth but his first words checked her i wist not woman thou wert widow he said sternly as a rule thy dress thinking he blamed herand blame from him meant all thingsshe was quick in explanation the mostauspicious is right she almost interrupted but he to whom i was wedded as a babe proved vile so my fatherpraise be to the godswithheld me from him utterly yet these few years past that the mans evil body is dead i come hither to ransom his soul the answer fitting so aptly with akbars previous thoughts roused his instant curiosity wherefore he asked his keen face lighting up with interest as he seated himself once more sit yonder sister at my feet and tell me wherefore because he was my husband came the almost aggressively quick reply and a wife is bound to her husband in life and in death akbar smiledthe foibles of his world always amused him not in death nowadays my good woman he cried lightly akbar hath forbidden death would that he could forbid this also he touched a fold of her wet shroud with his finger a shiver shot heartwards from the contact was it merely the chill to his flesh warmed by his hearts blood or was itsomething he had told himself he had forgotten he drew back in resentment she also but from his touch on what to her as to most hindu women was the dearest privilege of her sexthe right to burn the most excellent is a mighty king she commented sarcastically but even he cannot stay the immortal man in woman from following man in death we are not all cowards like she who sent yonder ramrucki to the most high she pointed with scorn to a slender silken cord behung with coloured tassels which the king wore on his wrist bracelet fashion akbar frowned so thou knowest the story this slave knows all that concerns the honour of the king she replied proudly the frown grew the king can keep his honour without thy help woman aye and his promises too so this coward shall be saved then as was so often the case with him eager questioning swept away everything else yet wherefore coward tell me that thou her sister in sex wherefore should a young girl not shrink from burning with an old profligate whose very age hath prevented natural fulfilment of husbandhood by the sun my very stomach turns at the thought of it yet womanhood accepts it dutifully lo couldst thou but tell mebut thou canst notwhence comes this sense of sin which makes women prostitute and tempts men to be far worse than the beasts i would give thee he paused looking into her soft dark eyes whence the fierceness had died away giving place to wise surprise at ignorance the most excellent must know she replied our mothers teach it to us it is the love which seeks for pleasure which forgets motherhood lo in the beginning we were the nothingness which tempted form even as siyala the courtesan sang so we cannot live save through that which we create we are thieves of form and sanctuaries of souls even as the princess sanyogata told prithviraj aye though she had lured him with the love that is illusion but she was brave also she left her womanhood to die and followed the immortal in the man then this mortal love is womans only he asked critically eager as ever in argument aye she answered simply in the beginning it was so but we have taught it to man thus it returns to us again in every soul to which we give a body yea it is so look how far we are most excellentshe pointed with slim finger to the distant cranesfrom yonder birds to whom pairing time is breeding time who know not sex save for the life they have to give to the world she paused and there was silence for once again the example she had chosen fitted in with past thoughts far away on the primrose verge a swordshaped shaft of redencircled cloud hid the rising sun and there is no other love he asked moodily forgetful as ever of his entourage in the absorption of inquiry her face grew paler her hand went up almost unconsciously to her throat round which the green stone of the rebeck player hung but no essence of rose assailed her senses or if it did she denied the fact strenuously i know not my king she said quietly there be some who talk of it but my fatherhe was very learned most highheld that love needing both subject and object she spoke quite simply of such abstruse idea as many a nigh naked coolie in india will do if so be he is brahmin lay outside the great unity and so was illusion yet to me she hesitated and looked at him almost appealingly out of her large dark unfathomable eyes lo i am woman so i cannot thinkwherefore should not love be all things wouldst thou have it so sister he asked meaningly she flushed faintly under her dark skin nay most high she replied proudly for me honour is enough since i guard the kings the words held something of selfrevelation in them he rose and wound his saffron veil closer so be it sister guard the kings honour aye and his luck too if thou canst he added with a smile as he moved away the word roused her to a sense that her chance was departing she caught at his feet and bowed herself over them in the attitude which in india brings arrest to all in authority for it is ultimate appeal what is it sister he queried almost mechanically whatwhat most excellent of the kings luck she asked tremulously at the moment other clearer words failed her what he echoed perplexedly wondering what the woman would be at naught that i know of save that it shone when i saw it yesterevening and that it will shine still more when the feringhi jeweller hath spent his western art upon it he added with a smile yestereven she could scarce speak for surprise thenthen it is not stolen the kings luck is safe stolen ye gods no his look of wonder changed to kindly compassion go home my sister he said as he might have said to a child and dream not so much of the king and his luck he is not worth it so farewell yet stay i owe thee something once more forthy treatise on love i gave thee thy fathers titular office did i not well tomorrow take up his duties come to the great durbar in thy charans dress and for once a woman shall challenge the whole world for akbar lo it will make some of the durbaries see shaitan he interpolated for himself lightheartedly but come and fear noti will warn the chamberlain to give thee place so once more farewell widow thus far he had spoken with a smile now his face grew grave lo despite akbar methinks thou wilt die for some man yet thou art of that quality heaven send he be worth the sacrifice i will die for the kings honour if need be she muttered true by instinct to her lifeidea even in the midst of her mingled joy and amazement she sate for some time after akbar left her trying to piece together the tangled clues she held but such intricate balancing of facts was beyond her she lived only by what she felt so she was without guide in following up the actions of others that the diamond had been stolen she knew and now it was evident that birbal had kept the knowledge of the theft from the kingdoubtless to save him from distress this latter thought leapt to her heart and found instant harbour there so that she began to reproach herself with having gone so near to making such forethought of no avail a forethought that had done its work too since as the most high had seen the diamond but the evening before it must have been recovered the incident was therefore oversmall thanks to her and yet the king had bidden her challenge the whole world on his behalf she crept home and looked at her fathers corselet and sword wonderingly how had it come about that the great hope of her life was about to be realised and she could scarce feel any joy in it meanwhile akbar was doffing his ascetics robe and donning the heronplumed turban of empire it was a change to which he was accustomed but this morning he felt that something of his interview with atma devi lingered with him he paused for a moment as he passed to the private hall of audience with birbal to look out across the palace courtyard and so through the arch of victory to india stretching wide and far beyond it if i leave this place he said quietly as leave it surely i shall some day thus condemning myself to sonlessness i shall go down to the ages as one who failedwho built dreampalaces unfit for humanity therefore fit home for the bats the foxes the hyenas this will i warrant sire replied birbal hotly in instant defence of his master let who will come to akbars arch of triumph in the future it shall remain to them unforgettable unforgotten until death kills memory the memory of a great defeat continued the king shaking his head and to my mind a greater one if i remain he turned and laid his hand on birbals shoulder yea old friend i have failedwhy strain thyself to hide it whereforegod knows for i have striven he paused then went on there was a woman at the tank this morning who said that love was all things is it so have i not loved enough is that the solving of the riddleis it the masterkey birbals face was a fine study in sarcastic disagreement mayhap my king the poets have it so though in gods truth this wondrous key has unlocked naught for mesave nothingness a perfect mating went on the dreamer absorbed in his own thoughts the twain once more as one sex and its vain search forgotten strange if it should be so strange if the finding of self in the giving of self should bring back memory yet forgetfulness of that far beginning when the ocean of light everlasting quiescent stirred into ripples of shadow and the one became two the audience waits sire said birbal drily akbar laughed and went on yet he turned to birbal swiftly half an hour afterward when in the course of business words were let fall which brought back the memory of this conversation it had been rather a disturbing audience and akbar ere he commenced it had felt wearied beyond his usual measure so as he sate below the throne the position he invariably occupied as symbolising that he was but the representative of a higher power he had listened with a certain sense of irritation while a letter which father ricci the jesuit had left behind him was read aloud by a slim whiterobed man with a marked bend of the head and a kindly patient face it ran as follows to the most merciful and most illustrious king and emperor jalaludin mahommed akbar greeting from his father in god and vicar of christ servant of the king of kings whereas for long years past i have to the great injury of the cause of christ yet with the most pious hopes of eventual harvest permitted that good servant of the lord priest rudolfo acquaviva to reside at the mostexcellents court in the hopes that by his godly example and teaching light might come to the eyes and knowledge to the ears of the emperor yet having during my recent visit seen with mine own eyes how small a part the great truths of the church play in the life of the mostexcellent and having in view also the most great favour extended to heretick protestants birbals mimelike face puckered he bent over the king said i not the reception of the english merchants would bring about greater zeal for majestys conversion but akbar checked him with a frown so the long phrases of disappointment partly pious partly pique went on and on when they closed he turned swiftly to the reader be thou the arbiter friend rudolfo dost wish to go is akbar not kind enough padre rudolfo acquaviva looked affectionately at the man whom he refused almost to the point of insubordination to count accursed the king is not kind enough to himself he said his gentle face a benediction as he noted the strain the anxiety which in all moments of rest sate on akbars countenance wherefore should not weariness lay down its burden at the gracious command come unto me and i will give you rest for a second there was a pause then akbar rose and squared his broad shoulders i could not if i would friend he replied proudly a kings burden must be carried so with a loud voice he cried has any or aught further need of the kings wisdom there was no pause this time the makhdumulmulk in his robes of chief doctor of the law stepped forward hastily and began to read lo makhdumsahib interrupted akbar lightly vet impatiently majesty hath listened to this before the petition is dismissed it hath seemed good to the crown so to cement union with our rajput allies the marriage ceremonies are commenced therefore this demand that the heirapparent shall have his first wife one of his own faith is idleand illtimed it hath the signature of fifteen thousand learned ulemas of islam continued the makhdum militantly if it had fifty thousand interrupted akbar again this time sternly ghiass beg the lord hightreasurer flung himself suddenly at the kings feet and his example was followed by half a dozen of akbars most tried and trusted mohammedan counsellors if the mostauspicious will grant us private audience for a space we will disclose that which may alter majestys opinion said their leader akbar frowned birbal and abulfazl scenting some further conspiracy stepped forward with instant excuse it is not on the list sire said the latter but the emperors sense of kingship had been aroused first by his reply to padre rudolfo next by the makhdums militant protest so with a quaint admixture of pride and humility he set aside the prime ministers plea haughtily justice shaikhjee is not listed like an auctioneers tale of goods ushers clear the assemblage my friends farewell i would be alone with these gentlemen for a while after the ceremonial salaamings the rustle and glitter of retreating silks and satins had died away he faced those few as he stood below the throne well he said speak a little old man poet as well as prince prostrated himself and so began with many flowers of speech many ambiguities and many quotations from hafiz on the story of prince salims sight of mihrunnissa thus o most illustrious king o most indulgent father fate hath intervened and sent love he concluded adding in pompous monotonous chant the wellknown lines he whose soul by love is quickened never can to death be hurled written is his name immortal in the records of the world then it was that akbar turned and looked at birbal the latter was instant in reply to the unspoken questions the love of a lad of eighteen most high can scarce be counted love and might we learn the honourable family of the lady that hath been omitted ghiass beg prostrated himself my daughter sire the shame of this plea overwhelms me but in justice to majesty i cast away honour my daughter sire a most excellent admirable and beautiful young lady but surely put in abulfazl swiftly suavely already betrothed to sher afkan captain in the kings horse akbar frowned is this so he asked and listened the frown deepening to the altercation that followed finally he raised his hand enough he cried that ends it what is talked of is bespoken and not even a kings son hath right to interfere the makhdumulmulk was the next to prostrate himself and speak true o ruler of the universe but the head of the church hath ever had the right to annul such promises and majesty having assumed that title might exercise the functions thereof the suggestion was deft but it failed for my sons benefit retorted akbar not so makhdumsahib the office is held more incorruptible now the august pillar of empire mistakes put in a younger man alert intelligent it is for the good of empire lo we be here as humble friends advisers counsellors with all duty be it spoken the young princemay he live for everhath given cause for anxiety this chaste cupola of chastity of whom undesirable mention has been made whose name my unworthy lips refuse to utter hath a reputation for great wisdom as well as beauty if then the heirapparent were wedded to her if love akbar raised his hand again sharply and birbal divining hesitation whispered in his ear remember the rajput allies sire a hint of this the king checked him haughtily peace that goes on as ever i was but thinkingthinking of the boy andand the girl then he raised his voice gentlemen i admit much of what hath been said the prince hath given cause for anxietyhe gives it still and if fate had been beforehand with fact such might have been good solution for much anxiety but she is behindhand the wedding festivities of the heirapparent have already begun the nuptials could be simultaneous most high interpolated the younger man who was court lawyer it is a royal custom and the young lady is already betrothed went on akbar inexorably that in itself is sufficient the kings promise is given in the first her fathers in the second akbar will break neither and then suddenly resentment perhaps a faint regret seemed to come to him and his voice rose lo have i ever broken faith has not my yea been yea my nay nay of a truth it has great sire answered the court lawyer deftly as his forehead once more touched the dust yea even beyond the ordinary faith of kings since akbar hath not shrunk in the past from rescinding orders he hath made in error will he not do so now will he not bow to fate it was boldness beyond belief and both birbal and abulfazl stood aghast yet it was a masterstroke for akbar paled and was silent fate he echoed at last and the tone of his voice brought birbals to his ear in earnest entreatybut it was too late so be it fate shall be the arbiter for this boy and this girl let her see to it his eyes lit up a certain buoyancy seemed to lift him above the dull world i akbar challenge her ye say fate hath intervened let her intervene if in the hours from dawn to dawn she can make the king go back from his word in one thing to her the victory if not to me the words rang out through the maze of arches in the diwanikhas then there was silence till on the silence the kings laugh rang out look not so solemn friendsand foes mayhapakbar like all things else is in the hands of fate but as birbal went out with abulfazl he cursed and swore aye he assented tis true enough all things are in the hands of fate but wherefore should the king be in the hands of his enemies they will strain every nerve tis but for a short timefrom dawn to dawn put in abulfazl consolingly and we must strain every nerve also then suddenly his face softened lo i would not have him otherwise birbal he is like a racehorse the least touch of the bit of fate andfor all his wordshe chafes against it tis not acquiescence it is defiance that wings his challenge aye grunted birbal with a whimsical smile and a halfhearted belief that love is all things chapter xxii take to the garden thy carpet of prayer wait and watch how at gods command the daffodils girdles of green prepare how sentinel straight the cypresses stand forget thyself in the pathoflife plunge for a second in gods own sea and the seven tides of the water of strife will never encompass thee hafiz lo i have prayed said auntie rosebody captiously and i have watched but naught has come of it save a browache truly ummu at my age piety is fatiguing and tis better to trust the senses god gave than seek a new gift from him belike he is tired of old gulbadan and would as lief she took her rest decently in death like the rest of her generation one cannot expect him to count an old woman as worth so much to the world as a young one little umm kulsum looked shocked nay auntie she began are we not taught taught echoed the old lady tartly aye we are taught much that is not true and more that is no use to us when we lose our way but there it serves me right none lose themselves on a straight path so minenayit is mine child not yourshath been crooked that is the truth but i have made up my mind the diamond shall go back to the jeweller from whom it was taken for tis my belief that his majesty the king knows naught about it when i came from morning prayers and found him paying his respects to the lady mother my conscience was exalted to the edge of confession and i began as one does begin to skirt round the subjecti never could abide like my revered fatheron whom be peaceto go head foremost into cold water but the fount of my penitence soon ran dry in the parched desert of his ignorance tis useless telling a blind man that you have stolen his spectacles so i gave over came hither and ordered a dopiaza with double spice of onions to it for i was sick with fasting and it hath cleared my brain the diamond shall go back and i will trust the red madwoman as thou didst suggest last night for his highness the mostauspicious spoke of her this morning to lady hamida and bid us all look out to see this charanforsoothat the durbar tomorrow truly my august nephew hath a wit like a camels cantrip it leaves one uncertain whether to laugh or to weep but he must hold her faithful so i will write a letter to the feringhi in a feigned hand appointing time and place for restoration this she shall take and afterward i will lay strict oaths on her such as not even a woman could evade and she shall have the stone and bring back receipt therefore so that settles it and may god forgive silly old gulbadan she frowned fiercely yea granddaughter that is the sting in the scorpions tail for once khanzada gulbadan begum hath been a fool she hath acted without counting the cost so secretly and in haste atma devi was sent for and shewn into the little corbeilled balcony overhanging the lofty outside wall of the palace where there could be no eavesdroppers save the purple pigeons that cooed and strutted on the wide cornices the diamond she said incredulously oh beneficent ones it is not stolen or rather it hath been given back my lord birbal must have replaced it for the king knows naught about it tis my lord birbal who knows naught about it foolish one said auntie rosebody peremptorily for he sent it back here safe sewn in the princes turban lo unbeliever look and see if i lie her small hennatinged palm went into her bosom and there like a huge dewdrop among rose leaves lay the gem the kings luck murmured atma in stupefaction the kings luck and yet my lord birbal knewthis slave knows that he knows and the king does not knowthis slave knows that he does not know oh cloud not perspicacity with noes and not noes cried aunt rosebody wrathfully and yet with a whimper in her voice if the mostexcellent is ignorantas i too believe him to be and as i pray he may ever remainthat is the more reason why this should go back at once aye assented atma her face scarcely less bewildered than little umm kulsums as she sate rocking herself to and fro mechanically repeating penitential verses of the koran but my lord birbal knewwherefore wherefore echoed aunt rosebody vehemently protesting lo if thou wilt ask questions i shall lose my way again remember the saying ask not the road of twain if one can make it plain and for my part i think the better of birbal for his silence if my nephew knew that his heir had filched his luck from him and then suddenly she dissolved into tears oh gulu gulu beloved of thy father why didst not think of this before thou sillyoldfool umm kulsum joined her in tears only atma devi sate calm frowning aye she assented gravely i see the most high must never know therefore if the beneficent lady will give me the letter i will see it delivered and when dark comes i can take the kings luck to the place appointed aunt rosebody gave a sigh of relief truly thou art not so bad good redwoman ummu my pen and ink and wewe three will swear never to open our mouths concerning this again least of all to the mostauspicious no not even as dying confession to ease our miserable souls lo i promise sobbed umm kulsum god gives the reward of silence yea i promise murmured atma softly and so it came to pass that just as birbal had almost given up hope of coming even upon a trace of the lost diamond when thrown back upon himself he was meditating the possibility of a private audience with the beneficent ladies and a complete throwing of himself upon their mercy he received a message to come down without delay to the hall of labour he found william leedes attempting to make out the meaning of a little scented note in a brocaded bag which had been left for him at the outside door a womans writing for sure said birbal quickly at his first glance see how the curves are clipped showing lack of decision he read the first wordsye gods he muttered so ran hastily through the few lines which appointed a place for the due restoration of the missing gem then he refolded the letter replaced it in its covering without a word and stood silent all the confident vitality gone from face and figure suddenly he sniffed at the brocaded bag aye violets he murmured the lady umm kulsums favourite flower by heaven and earth birbal thou art a fool he flung his arms out so recklessly that it seemed as if he would strike himself tis my mistake after all sir jeweller i must have confused the true and the false for this is from the palace he said bitterly and all my searchings my chase after that vanishing quantity the harlot siyah yamin hath been lost time i am a fool it was a few minutes ere his quick brain had regained sufficient selfconfidence to work but then it worked rapidly at nine oclockit was now sixby the large flat stone at the anup tank not only william leedes must be in evidence but he birbal and a strong guard of deaf and dumb slaves must be concealed close by so as to prevent any possibility of treachery for birbal did not forget akbars curious challenge to his courtiers that day or that the safe conduct given to the englishman was a promise which an assassins dagger might easily break ralph fitch and john newbery were too far away to be points of attack but william leedes must be guarded aye and endless other possibilities must be foreseen and precautions taken against defeat for in this case defeat would mean a change in the kings whole line of policy it is true that it would also in all probability mean his acceptance of practical politics and so bring him round to birbals point of viewnamely that kingship must follow certain definite and familiar lines but birbals wholehearted love of his master could not brook defeat for him what action he took must be free not forced so in the interval between the time of receiving the notice of appointment and the appointment itself birbal set seriously to work in consultation with abulfazl the hounds of hell will scour heaven and earth to find some pitiful failure he said finally almost grinding his teeth with impotent regret lo shaikhjee what ails the king at times to give such handle to his enemies it is his sense of strength replied abulfazl calmly he feels like a god and of a truth he is one the prime ministers flattery had grown to be part of himself he really thought of akbar as he wrote about him perchance growled birbal but he lives among men and men know how to trick their gods i can think of no more promises if thou dost guard against failure for my leisure may be scant as he made his way to the appointment he told himself that it might be scant indeed since somehow he must recover the diamond that night despite his unbelief his clear wit his critical outlook on all things he could not escape from the feeling that the best safeguard to his master would be the repossession of the lucky stone yes he must recover it the night was dark dark enough to favour the posting of men unseen in the shadow of the trees to the left of the big flat stone so dark that even the still levels of the tank lay unrevealed save here and there where a feeble oil rushlight shone on the shore showing the little platter of food for the dead on which it stood the fading chaplet of flowers twined around the offering so dark so still so quiet no sign anywhere of movement stay up yonder where the steps might begin a twinkling light was it some other bereaved woman coming to place her remembrance on the waters edgeor was it the messenger by heaven it bore to the leftjust a twinkling light no more birbal held his breath and now grown nearer the faint circle of radiance showed a hand holding a little platter of offerings and on the wrist a fold not of white but red drapery by all that was holy atma devi then she was at the bottom of it after all the next minute he and his slaves were surrounding her and the dark figure of william leedes who had risen from the large flat stone where he had been waiting she stood quite still apparently not much surprised and her eyes met birbals without fear yea kill me when i have fulfilled my errand she said quietly but not till then i have sworn to give it to none but the jeweller is he here take it from her sir jeweller came the quick order i can settle with her afterward there was a pause as atma devi appraised the feringhis strange dress then from amongst the little pile of uncooked grain upon the platter of the dead produced the diamond it shone with a faint lambent glow in the flickering light of the oil lamp a sigh of satisfaction came from birbal but william leedes bent closer to look at what he held and his face as he raised his head showed ghastly gray it also is false master he faltered see yonder is the scratch my tool made on it false birbal stood transfixed feeling even amidst his stupefaction a quick sense of relief that after all he had made no mistake false he echoed and turned on atma devi she also stood surprised so surprised that birbal realised in an instant that she was innocent of all complicity in whatever had brought about this astounding revelation so without a word he drew out the other false gem which he had brought with him and laid it beside its marrow on the jewellers palm there be two false stones sister he said striving to be calm feeling that it was his only chance of getting any hint on which he could work from her but where is the real one dost know her great wide eyes roved helplessly from the twin stones to the jewellers face so back to his then back again to the stones pooru must have made them she said slowly but i wist not they were even made then suddenly she threw up her arms and clapped her hands together high above her head the platter of death offerings with its little lamp falling from her hold dashed itself to pieces on the stones and there was darkness so from it came her waillo i have betrayed the king i his charan yet i know nothing she sank huddled in a heap upon the ground there is no use wasting further time here said birbal roughly after several vain attempts to rouse atma devi from ineffectual despair leave her to her own condemnation this points to deeper plotting than i dreamt of and there is no moment to lose as he hurried off he marshalled half a hundred theories before the judgment seat of his brain the biggest villainwho was the biggest villain khodadad without doubt but he was dead could he have had the diamond it was becoming plain to birbal that in this scheme of theft some one had played for the chance of the great diamond never coming again within reach of a jewellers lathe someone had kept the real stone and played off false ones upon the conspirators he must search khodadads house aye even the corpse which still awaited the next dawn for burial then there was siyah yamin but that devils limb had once more disappeared she would be found of courseno power not even fear could keep a woman of her kidney quiet for long but this was all in the future and deep down in the cynical heart of the man lurked a clamour that his king his master should have the benefit of his luck stone within the next few hours it must not be in the keeping of his enemies it must be secure in the safe custody of a friend yet he felt curiously helpless though he had ransacked fatehpur sikri aye and agra also in search of the socalled sufi from isphahanthe mountebank the juggler with mens senses he had not come upon a trace of him william leedes was of no use and the only other human being friendly to the king who knew of the diamonds loss was the halfcrazy woman whom he had left crushed in despairing remorse by the anup tank most likely she would go home and kill herself with the deathdagger of her race well she was of no use from beginning to end she had been a hindrance not a help and atma meanwhile was feeling that the seven tides of the waters of strife had overwhelmed her what had she done she had persuaded diswunt to give the opportunity for the theft of the diamond it is true but only that she might take itas she had taken itto the keeping of the beneficent ladies and they had given it back to her she sate unconscious of the passage of time puzzling herself vainly to account for those twin stones which had lain shining in the jewellers palm chapter xxiii wash white the pages in no book loves rule is written wherefore look not in my words for flattery nor dare to claim me as thy rightful share traced on my brow is lovefate wrote it there hafiz the gongs striking eleven roused her she stood up and looked about her feeling lost forlorn and lo she was in a world of stars for it was the night of the dead and every little hovel every house and homestead and palace in the town behind her glittered with the small lamps set to illuminate the feasts that are laid out for wandering spirits and as she looked out over the unseen levels of the tank the stars were there also twinkling farther and farther away to the horizon in every hamlet and village for an instant the inner vision of the soul was hers and she saw as it were a map stretched before her the wide plain of india receding on and on into the darkness of the night all sown with such stars in constellations and every star was the memory of some dear face every star was set for some loved wandering soul she felt like a disembodied spirit herself as she looked down at her feet remembering the little decorous platter in which she had hidden the diamond should she go back to the beneficent ladies and tell them what had happened no she had done her part toward them she had given the gem they had given her into the jewellers own hand as she had promised so that was the end but it was not the true luck thus her duty so far as she herself was concerned still remained she must try and find it and if she failed there was always the deathdagger for she must be true though she was a woman true aye as true as it befits womanhood to be who had said that siyala then in a second she knew and turning swiftly on her heel ran toward the town siyal siyala was the thief she had the kings luck ye gods had it come to this her sister of the veil the little dainty delicate perfumed piece of femininity which she had borne with nay had almost loved as a halfforgotten part of herselfshe and she only was preventing her atma the representative of charans from playing her mans part in charanship an uttermost loathing of herself as woman came to the mind that had been educated to believe in her womanhood as nothingness the while she hurried through the full bazaars toward satanstown she almost had to fight her way through one portion where the crowd filled every inch of the roadway past khodadads house he was lying in state there with all the royal insignia of a tarkhan about him that had not saved his corpse however from quick searching by the hands of the city police for treasonable papers was the excuse but now that birbal had come and gone unsatisfied the professional wailers were once more skirling away their mercenary grief and through the wide arches of the upper floor the swaying heads of the hired priests could be seen as they chanted their orisons for the dead who ist she asked faint curiosity rising in her as she passed khodadad tarkhan hast not heard answered someone they found him dead at dawn the blood pouring from his veins and the white horse from which he had fallen by his side aye but thou forgettest neighbour said another eager voice his hands were tied and god send his soul to the nethermost hell for treachery broke in atma on the gossiping as she fought her way on ari sister have a care protested the crowd thou hittest like a man and will hurt but she was gone ere the sentence ended in a broad laugh and a rough jest on him who had such a termagant to wife old deena caught sight of her as she came breathlessly along the balconied lane there were lights and to spare here but siyah yamins house stood a dark block amongst its radiant neighbours thou art too late mistress most chaste he called the singing bird is fled whither she gasped he shook his wicked old head and leered with his wicked old eye nowhither so far as this world knows a many have been after her even my lord birbal without success she left for the desert to my lord khodadads devils feast last evening and hath not returned now he is dead and she hath disappeared belike the white horse carried her off too or belike he spoke in a lower voice the desert was but fair doubling ground for pursuit atma stared at him uncomprehending but i need her she muttered a hard metallic laugh rang from a neighbouring balcony no woman needs woman came a coarse jeering voice but such a strapping wench could mayhap play a mans part play it sister and god go with you atma turned and fled from the burst of wild laughter that followed on the sally there was nothing left now for her truly but the mans part she must find the deathdagger of her race and die as they had died but not for honour for dishonour by the time she reached the winding tenement stair which led upward to her roof she had grown calm and her mind set loose from the urgency of the present had begun to wander amid past scenes yea yonder were the steps leading down to the cellar where the wayfarer had lain asleep half dead in dreams with zarifas face upon his bosom a strange man indeed what was it he had said about love her hand sought her throat involuntarily and finding the quaint green stone clasped it roses roses roses their scent bewildered her then in a second she saw all she understood all aye she the woman in her had loved the king and she had been ashamed of it but thisthis was different this was the mortal following the immortal she was going to death as to a funeral prye to find herself sexless beyond the flames she stumbled on and on up and up every atom of herself forgotten save the deathless desire for unity which lies behind sex until suddenly some unfamiliarity beneath her feet made her pause had she come too far she stopped in the mirk darkness to feel the step on which she stood so groping felt the wall a nail and something had caught on it what a tiny scrap of fringe and that was scentnot bewildering scent of roses but bewildering scent of musk and ambergristhe essences of satanstown siyah yamins paradise the thought leaped to her brain a second or so afterward she stood at the secret door it was ajar but this time the darkness of the roof showed like a black shadow against the diffused radiance from the town below siyala she cried but there was no answer she moved forward a step then bethinking herself turned back locked the door and thrust the key in her bosom if anyone were there they would have to meet her face to face so her eyes becoming accustomed to that outside radiance that central shadow she halffelt her way down the broad path from the door toward the place where when last she had seen it silken curtains had still hung and the remains of feasting had still lain rottingrotting surely slowly by day and night but there was nothing now even the dead roses had disappeared and her feet as she walked sank softly in the carpet of sand and dust that covered all things was that a darker shadow flitting back as she advanced she turned swiftly heard an ineffectual rattle of the lock and the next instant in her haste her outstretched hands pinned a slight figure to the door lo ato came a petulant voice thou art rough as any man i am here if thou needst me so take thy big hands from my frail body and let me light a light twas thy stepmanlike againmade me extinguish mine for fear a spark from the tinder box showed small hands shaking and the following light a second too soon found traces of sharp terror behind the mocking smile on siyah yamins face she was dressed as she had been before in mans clothes but this time they seemed to sit ill on her shrinking figure yet she strove hard for boldness well what ist ato she went on recklessly as if trying to put off time somewhat of the king i will go bailthe king thou dost not love ha ha her jeering laugh roused a muffled echo from the low empty walls yea i love the king as woman loves man replied atma gravely what of that it is illusion it will pass siyah yamin gave a little soft shuddering sigh come she said sharply we cannot talk so come widow follow thy lover sher khan she sprang forward light in hand and her slender figure fled forward leaving darkness behind her darkness through which her light song echoed what says philosophy loves an illusion silly delusion give me your lips take mine such sips prove love felicity wisdom is wearisome closer my dearie come let us find unity peace siyal said atma sternly interrupting the ribald verses peace oh yea let there be peace between us laughed the courtesan as she sank down on the dusty step of the dais and put the light beside her but her wide eyes belied her light words fear sate behind their glitter watching wickedly and every subtle sense sought for some means of escape some method of cajolery wherefore not she rattled on lo i give you in his monkeymajesty he is not a man after my heart yet i would not his enemies got the better of him as they will do what hast not heard he challenged them this day to write failure across a promise of his or change across his mind from dawn to dawn it was and see you ato the hurried palpitating voice steadied as the wild search for some false trail happened upon one thou art the kings charan and must warn him they have sent poison out to the paralysed profligate at shakingarhhe will be burnt at dawn and with him the girl whose ramrucki the king wears there is small time to lose atoi know it i tell theei heard it from their lipsgo thou then with warning she leant forward her face full of guileful beguileful beauty close to the grave level brows that met in a steady frown aye i will go siyalbut not without the kings luck give it me thou hast it in thy bosomthy hand has hovered there give it me i say she essayed to grip those fluttering fingers but siyah yamin was on her feet in a second and stood back swaying unsteadily one hand clasped to her heart ilo it is not true tis something here that hurtsshe beat her breast sharply be not so rough ato thou wert always rough as a man lo in the old days it was i little siyala who was to marry atma singh and nownowsher khan she paused tore off her dandified turban and let the great plaits and coils of her hair fall loose see i am woman again and thouthou art man and ato hist knowest thou why i came back here tonightwould i had never come it was to find the broken pieces of the glass goblet i broke her small face melted almost to tears the babyish lips trembled over the words yea yea it is true i came for themi was going awayfor everand i remembered lo ato a woman always remembers her first lover even if she be courtezan yea thou wilt remember the king so have pity what dost not believe lo i was looking when thou camest and frightened me into putting out the light see here if i lie with her right hand she tore something out of her bosom and shifting it swiftly to her left held it out it was a curved fragment of the blownglass goblet which had fallen with a crash upon a rosebush whose red wine of shiraz had trickled thirstily to the roses root twined upon it in golden tracery lay part of its legend take the cup of life with laughing lip forget the bleeding heart within she caught at the words hysterically so have i taken life ato as all women should i have drunken hearts blood ato touch me not or before god i what dost seek madwoman the kings luck harlot thou hast it in thy bosom give it me or they were locked in each others arms but atma devi was a second too late for siyah yamin had drawn something besides a broken glasssherd from her bosom and her right hand with a flash of steel in it rose high then fell on the charans broad breast atma staggered under the blow but the poniard blade crashing on the collar bone turned aside upward and cleft the muscles of the neck harmlessly she had the weapon wrested from the small hand in a second and her voice breathless from exertion yet steady went on relentlessly thou hast it siyal thou didst steal it and betrayall men best give it to meoror i shall have to kill theesister of the veil but siyah yamin was true to her womanhood and every atom of her fought for full possession as she struggled madly itit is mine she gasped no one shall have iti claimi am the woman and i will have suddenly there was silence resistance melted out of atma devis arms her insistent hand still seeking found what it sought she gave a sharp cry of joy and relaxed her hold but the dainty figure her insistence had supported doubled up limply and fell in a huddled heap upon the ground she sank beside it on her knees she would have killed it as she had said aye killed it remorselessly but surely she had not siyal siyala sister but she called in vain the very glare of hatred and fear was dying from the eyes over which the impenetrable veil of death was creeping she watched them for a second or two then closed them and stood up she was not frightened nor remorseful at what had happened vaguely she felt relieved it was womanhood which had died there on the roof in the paradise of lust now that she had time to think she saw it all it was so simple siyala beset by the desire of possession had ordered the false gem maker to make two false stones and palming them off on the conspirators had kept the real one trusting to her luck that the one supposed to be the true gem would never again fall into the hands of the jeweller but it had the exchange of turbans had brought discovery close at hand so she had meant to fly and doubtless for once had spoken truly when she said she had returned during the night to gather up the broken fragments of her first cup of joy so quietly methodically atma straightened out the huddled figure that had held the devadasi sister of the veil daughter of the gods covering it decorously with the tinselled muslin scarf sher khan had worn in gay mockery of his sex so it was pure womanhood that lay there with face upturned to the dark then taking the light atma searched under the rosebushes for the broken cup she found the bowl intact save for the one curved splinter siyala had gathered up the stem too jarred and chipped would still stand upright so making a little pile of dust she set them together beside the dead womans hand and left her lying there in the shadow with the diffused light from the lamps of the dead below making a faraway halo to that central darkness closing and locking the door she flung the key through a narrow loophole in the stairway through which that same radiance of the dead could be seen faintly so passed down to her own door there was much to be done the diamond however being so far safe her first care must be to warn the king that the little coward of the ramrucki was in imminent danger for this she must make her way to the palace she made it quicker than she had thought for since as she unlocked her door figures started out on her from the darkness below and she felt what the beneficent ladies called an allover dress being respectfully yet firmly pulled over her by the kings command bibi said the oily voice of a eunuch thou hast been appointed of his household and the lord chamberlain hath ordered us she made no effort at escape knowing herself helpless but she could defend herself the lord chamberlain being here himself she interrupted at a ventureand a faint stirring as if those around her turned to look at someone told her that her surmise was correctcan take me prisoner if he choose but let him remember that the king desires my presence as charan at the great durbar so let him treat me ill at his peril mirza ibrahim who had indeed come to see his orders executed said nothing but he inwardly swore that the jade should repent her defiance there were endless possibilities for a lord chamberlain once the wildcat were fairly housed within reach atma meanwhile in her screened dhooli felt herself going palaceward contentedly enough so far was good but how to get her message conveyed to the king yet conveyed it must be and before long for the soft radiance of the lamps of the dead had begun to die down the wandering spirits had had their feasting they must be in their graves by dawn could she escape could she by good luck see a friend bribe one of the bearers but time slipped by without opportunity and she found herself lodged at last in a very handsome apartment consisting of a room and beyond that a slip of roof with a latticed cupola before any chance had come of accomplishing her desire nay no more i need nothing more i will call if so be she said to the servants who fawned about her go i tell thee she must think she must devise some plan the room was well appointed even a long penbox with a quaint pot of glazy ink stood by a low stool so she could write meanwhile she must have a few minutes in the open the musk of the tented dhooli had almost been too much for her so out on the roof of this cupolas bastion or turret half way down the palace wall she leant her arms on the parapet and looked downward and upward above to one side was the palace but which part of it below her was one of the wide eaves so characteristic of indian architecture and it ran after skirting the turret octagonally along the walls into the darkness there was foothold for one with a strong head doubtless but what then as she thought a sound of whirring ropes met her ear and something dark slid down the wall from far above her the preachers dhooli then the kings balcony was somewhere above her could she how far did the eave run it would need ten yards at least and could she start the equipoise if once she got a hold on the ropes stay she would only have to signal chapter xxiv oh clear the cushioned thrones from those who sleep preach thou the truth let the untruth be dumb till gladsome voices once more fill both worlds freshen the universebe thou our soul we are dead bodies bring us back to life thou art our guard the caravan is lone thou art our army let thy standard wave lo the day steed is weary the dim night to all around us bid thy seraphim herald the coming dawn and wake us lord as helpless babes we sleep and sleep and sleep upon the threshhold of another world nizamia d birbal had been wakeful the discovery of the second false gem had thrown him back on himself at dawn all his energies must be turned toward making it impossible that the kings rash almost incredibly rash challenge should bring disaster on the policy of years so ere that dawn came endless plans for the recovery of the missing jewel must be set in train then if possible he must find the juggler with mens senses the man whose marvellous art had helped him before there was a chance that king bayazid might know his whereabouts so an hour or so ere daylight all other things having been started birbals swifttrotting bullocks drew up at the garden gate of the river palace all was dreamful as before here no lamps of the dead shone in the wide arcades only on the roof the light which burnt ever in rupmatis shrine showed the gaunt length of her lover asleep on cushions beneath it the sufi from isphahan he said drowsily he who called himself the wayfarer pretended to be payandar and was musician yea he left a message for theethat his work was accomplished he whom he watched was dead the danger was overpast therefore he went whither i know not neither do i care he sang me a ghazal ere he leftit hath a good lilt to it and birbal as he ran down the stairs again heard that same lilt of it ringing after him a broken glass that held the redwine of strife the corpse of a man besprinkled with essence of rose a child asleep on the threshold of larger life such is thy dawnwake lover who seeks repose lend for the loveofgod to my thirsty heart thy bowl so with the dawnwaked winds he shall refresh thy soul he muttered a curse on sufi nonsense and flinging himself into the rath again bade the servant return cityward so after a while he dozed seizing on time for sleep when naught else could be done he was aroused by a sharp jolt a sudden drawing to one side on the part of the driver what ist fool he queried sharply protector of the poor replied the man it is the king he was on his feet in an instant rubbing his eyes in the gray dawnlight in time to see a rider whirl past alone the king undoubtedly but his escort was this all an old man bent with service dropping farther and farther behind not so much from any fault in his mount but simply from lack of riding that anyhow could be remedied your horse he cried and the old servitor a tall bony mahommedan recognising birbal instantly recognising also the advantage of the slim hindu in a stern chase obeyed what is it where goes he asked birbal briefly hands busy shortening stirrups shakingarhto the burning the mostauspicious slept when the madwomanshe who calls herself charan came up in the preachers dhooli two horses are aye kept saddled in the yard below the king was on bijli in a twinkle and ithere was none elsescrambled on chytue shouting for some one to follow but birbal had gathered up the reins and was off chytue lightened by the change of riders sweeping on at a thundering gallop lessening the distance at every stride between him and his stable companion akbar looked round to frown then to smile a race he cried gleefully how now bijli the mare answering to the call shot forward like an arrow from a bow a race indeed thought birbal a lost one too most likely for the gray of the false dawn was passing into primrose how had they managed itthey must have killed the old man and he would be burnt at sunrise and then akbars promise to the little coward of a ranioh curse all women fifteen miles good though in the far distance behind him the low jagged ridge of sikri loomed like a cloud one by one the mud mounds which tell of village sites rose out of the treeless western horizon showed silent lightless smokeless in the halflight then sank dwindled to join that shadow of the ridge how many more of them must be passed before dawn before dawn so thought the rider behind cursing himself as he rode for having forgotten this easybroken promise of his king but akbar riding ahead had forgotten anxiety in determination and as at a deviating curve in the track he struck boldly across country his every vein thrilled with joyful excitement the dawn was coming under his horses flying hoofs the interminable sequence of sandy bypaths through the sunbaked fallows chequered with fields of young millet and maize seemed to slip past as the light grew the purple eyes of the feathery vetches seemed to look at him teardrenched with dew the goldygreen balls of the colocynth apples as they cracked under the thundering feet gave out a bitter bracing wholesome smell down in an old backwater of the river which held a few acres of damper ground a flight of cranes rose to wing a wedgeshaped way to the west oh for the wings of a dove that was what padre rudolfo sang was that a spiral trail of smoke on the horizon aye but from a village rubbish heap after all a funeral pyre was nothing more a mere rubbish heap of accessories in which a soul had played its part yea but as when one layeth his worn out robes away and taking new ones sayeth these will i wear today so putteth by the spirit lightly its robe of flesh and passeth to inherit a residence afresh the words of the bhagavadgita recurred to his mind bringing with them as they do to every human mind that knows them a sudden sense of companionship of hand clasping in the wilderness of life the pale primrose of the dawn was reddening fast a few more minutes and the suns edge would for half a second sparkle like a star on the rim of the world and then with the coming of sunlight the kings shadow swifter than the king himself would speed ahead lengthening out reaching touching all things before he the flesh and blood could touch them ah the shadow was the real man he glanced backward he had come fast no one was in sight following the whimsey of his thought he told himself it was always so behind out of sight almost out of mind rode the world in front the shadowthe will the ideal the unattainable faint and far on the horizon a square speck of light showed the tower of shakingarh the falcons nest there was little time to spare then for the sun shone on its battlements little indeed for as the gleam of the village clustering about the feet of the fortress rose to view a sound of shawms and trumpets arose also but there was no spiral of smoke as yet to tell of fire bijli responding to the spur swept on over the more cultivated country an old canal dug hundreds of years before by some dead dynasty sent sinuous channels through the fields high cactus hedges shutting out the view formed impenetrable barriers with irritation at the delay akbar had to follow a winding cart track deeprutted beyond wordsan old waythe old way that made reform so difficult the sun at last akbars shadow sped before him climbing the thorn enclosures which at a sharp corner barred the way if he himself could but so override difficulties ye gods smoke bijli at racing speed was round the corner in a second before her lay a mud wall beyond that an open space a dense crowd encircling a huge pile of wood as she rose like a bird to the leap akbar saw nothing but a smoking flaming torch in a mans hand hold he shouted akbar the king forbids it bijli over the wall was treating the crowd as she was given to treating a squash at chaugan with kicks and bites and an instant after akbar slipping to the ground stood stern beside the pile there was a murmur of sheer surprise but akbar had no eyes for anything but the dulled drugged acquiescence of a girls face as dressed in bridal finery she sate on the funeral pyre with an old mans head upon her lap unloose her let her go came the order bringing consternation yet also relief for half shakingarh knew the greed of land and gold which led to this enforced suttee briefly the young wife had powerful friends who would claim her full widows share therefore she must die but a buxom woman deepbreasted arrogant had seized the arrested torch from her husband and was brandishing it fiercely for being wife to the old profligates eldest son she had everything to gain by this getting rid of a rival king she echoed by thine own word only and even so king of men only we women claim our right she shall not be defrauded of it our father shall not go to the realms of yama unattended then go thyself woman retorted akbar peremptorily thy part is done thy breasts have given suck to grown sons hers await an infants lips at thy peril fool or on thine own head be he started forward to seize the torch she was in the act of thrusting into one of the firing places that were ready filled with resins oil and cotton wool to escape him she leaped nimbly to the pyre and with outstretched arm sought another feeder of the flames as she did so something that had lain like a withered branch moved and shot arrowlike at her bare ankle snake snake her yell of ultimate fear rang out and was caught up by the crowd the torch dropped recklessly she was down on her knees rocking herself backward and forward a judgment a judgment let her burn the cry of the crowd merged instantly into condemnation but akbar had leaped after her dispatched the cobrawhich hidden in some hollow log had doubtless crept out for warmth when the first sun rays had touched the pyreand crushing out the torch flame with his heel had his mouth on the womans ankle to no purpose even in that brief second the poison had reached the heart and after a few moans of agonised fear merciful drowsiness invaded heart and brain she breathed slowly and yet more slowly akbar stood up and looked about him dazedly this instant response of providence in his favour filled him with exulting awe the almost fanatical enthusiasm for himself for his ideals which so often possessed him seized on him and birbal riding up in weary haste found him the centre of an enthusiastic crowd who granting him supernatural power were busy substituting a dead woman for a living girl while the latter sate stupidly in the sunlight watching the flames blaze up round another victim with that burden of an old mans head upon her lap anyhow the promise was unbroken but birbal as he rode back behind majesty told himself there was trouble ahead such incidents were not wholesome especially when every effort must be made to keep the king down to practical politics so little might make him break away so shaikie hath lost one chance of love said akbar suddenly when after a long and silent ride the towers of fatehpur sikri showed clear again and empire hath gained many chances of stability replied birbal drily with grandsons of rajput descent majesty may hand on the crown when gods time comes in security of what asked akbar swiftly that my dream will be fulfilledthe dream of a king and then suddenly he almost drew rein the woman must be rewarded birbalshe who came god knows how to warn me i would not have her escape reward as majesty has bidden her act charan at the festival today replied birbal still more drily there seems small chance of her escaping notice the kings face broke suddenly into charming whimsical smiles of a truth friend i must be a thorn in the flesh even to thee and to those others god knows how they bear with me or how they will bear with her acquiesced birbal grimly for all his liberal culture his boasted freedom from prejudices he was conventionality itself in somethings and it irked him to think of a woman masquerading as a charan and yet atma devi looked her best when a few hours afterward she knelt on the floor below the short flight of steps on the second of which the emperor sate on the royal yellow satin cushions while the throne a marvel of gold and gems occupied the highest step her long black hair unbound encircled by a steel fillet fell like a veil over her shoulders but left her bosom halfhidden by a mans steel corselet bare a cuirass of steel chains hanging below the corselet covered the muslins of her womans drapery and her shapely arms strenuous under the weight of the huge straight sword held hilt downward balanced it straight as a die steady as a rock point skyward in truth the whole scene was magnificent beyond compare the ordinary reception was over but there was to follow one of the great episodes of the gorgeous yearly round of splendid yet curiously imaginative festivals which marked akbars court that is to say the emperor having challenged his court to play chess with him was to play the game with the living chessmen who stood duly ranged on the huge chequered board of black and white marble which still exists at fatehpur sikri just beyond the flight of steps which leads downward from the hall of audience so akbar alone the empty throne above him occupied those empty steps at the foot of which his challenger crouched opposite on the other side of the marble board the court a blaze of colour and gemssave for a knot or two of ulemas in their dark robesstood ranged while between them immovable as statues waited the living chessmen the very horses of the knights black and white scarce moved a muscle and the unwieldy masses of the elephants which in the indian game do the bishops duty looked carved of stone black and silver white and gold each and all ablaze with black and white diamonds the pawns peons footmen cased in gold or silver armour each carried a pennant in black or white velvet embroidered in gold or silver and the great castles or fortsalso of gold or silverwere worn as corselets by huge giants of men who each held aloft a royal standard of the rajput sun or the crescent moon of mahommed overhead the hard blue indian sky as a background rosered palace or grassgreen trees and through it all insistent never ceasing like the shiver of cicalas on a summers night a low tremor of muted strings and deadened drums challenge for the king o charan came akbars voice and on it almost clipping the last sound followed a blaring clang as the great steel sword sweeping forward hit the marble floor the sound echoed and reechoed through the arches almost confusing the wild chant borne upon it ohi the king challenge i bring let every man in the worlds span do what he can to best the king a faint shiver ran through the crowding courtiers and birbal standing in a group composed of the kings greatest friends and allies looked round anxiously as a rule these contests were foregone conclusions to begin with the king was undoubtedly the best chessplayer in his dominions then as a rule the games were generally of the most jejeune descriptionmere spectacles of games but today some new interest seemed to make the spectators faces sharp and though he could scarcely see how even defeat could be construed into such failure as akbar had meant in his challenge he felt vaguely uneasy thinkst thou they mean mischief he said to abulfazl the latter smiled mischief not they mirza ibrahim hath as ever forwarded the schedule and the king hath seen ithe laughedtis an irregular opening but the onslaught is trivialan elephants charge he paused interrupted by the herald on the other side who took up the challenge on behalf of the emperors court birbal looked over to his master he could scarce tell why but he was not satisfied to begin with that masters eyes were too dreamy had he perchance heard that prince salim seeking consolation from love had been found drunk in satanstown that morning as like as not some of those sourfaced holy ones of set purpose had told him ah if the next few days were but over if this rajput betrothal had but gone so far that there was no drawing back how many hours yet were there before this gnawing anxiety lest he should be overreached and the king overpersuaded should be past akbar nevertheless showed intent enough upon his game he was leaning forward his head on his hand rapidly and in a low voice calling out each move to the figure beneath him and ever almost ere the tone ended came that clash of steel on stone that high strident cry ohi the king peon to rukhs fourth and so on yet in truth birbal was right akbar was preoccupied the mornings ride with its hint of omnipotence had naturally enough roused his physical and mental vitality to the highest pitch and so dissociated him still further from his surroundings and brought back the old question why should he cling longer to the ancient pathways being a king accredited by god seeing the truth clearly why should he not cast aside old shackles cease to attempt immortality through his unworthy sons and achieve it for himself by himself alone and something had happened that very morning which had almost driven from him all hope of one son at any rate not the escapade in satanstown of which he had of course been informed that was bad enough bringing with it as it did scorn of a love which could so solace itself no it was not that it was this he had seen being carried to a hospital almost lifeless the body of a slave brutally beaten by salims orders before salims eyes and the sight had forced from akbars lips the bitter question as to how the son of a man who could not see gods littlest creature suffer without pity could be so barbarous would it not be better to give up the struggle all this was in akbars mind as halfmechanically working as good chessplayers can with a portion of their intellect only so that they can carry on many games at one and the same time he marshalled his forces swiftly in these opening moves and now the board was clearer behind it on either side stood a long row of prisoners the final onslaught was at hand it is an elephants attack murmured abulfazl and then checked himselfthey have changed it he exclaimed louder as the court herald cried ghorah knight to badshads kings seventh wherefore not sneered one of the mahommedan faction who stood hard by there be many alternatives in a game of chess birbal looked hurriedly round him there was evident eagerness on the very faces where he expected to find it aye and there was anticipation in many more then he glanced at the board seeing in an instant that this move altered the whole defence but even as he recognised this and recognised that an answering change would make it strong as ever the charans cry rang out badshahs rukh takes wazir queen akbar had let the move sliphad evidently been in a dream was still in one yet it would need skill now to extricate himself for by god he himself had not seen that before it would be checkmate in two moves if the rukh were moved the only defencewhat was the defence wazirs rukh takes peon inexorably the courtheralds voice echoed through the arches and out into the garden it was followed by a little tense murmur from the crowd ye gods what was the defence ghorah to no that was fatal the king of course the king one step backward and the game was won would akbar see it his attention had anyhow been aroused he had leant forward his elbow on his knee his brows bent the question washow much of his mind had been withdrawn from dreams he is not here murmured abulfazl hurriedly but surely they cannot they can and dare all interrupted birbal oh devils in hell for clear from the kings lips came the words ghorah to this time however that clang of steel on stone blurred the closing tones of the kings lips and the charans rose on it clear badshah to his eighth birbal gasped the king started the courtiers stirred swiftly but birbals quick wit was the first to recover from surprise repeat the move o charan of jalaluddin mahomed akbar emperor of india it hath not been fully heard instantly the clang repeated itself and the words followed high strident unmistakable by the order of the king badshah to his eighth but we protest cried the makhdumulmulk finding voice and akbar rising looked angrily downward and prepared to speak great sire interrupted birbal advancing on the very board itselfwe protest also against disorder a charans voice duly challenged is the voice of the king naught can alter it save treachery where is the treachery here he speaks that which he hears question the woman ask her what she heard a great wave of sudden curiosity swept over the kings mind what would this woman say so far birbal was right she could be punished for treacherybut speak atma devi charan of kings what didst thou hear his voice was strangely soft but so clear that it could be heard by all there was not a quiver in the straightheld sword of steel no tremor in the firm mouth that gave the answer i heard what i spoke there was an instants pause she sate motionless her face impassive the halfshut eyes gleaming coldly out at all the world then birbal laughed a quick cackling laugh the move is played messieurs answer it if ye can and then he looked admiringly across at atma devi in truth she was man indeed in womansnay by the gods she was man altogethera man amongst men for that was checkmatecheckmate to the kings enemies chapter xxv tis eve o sakil fill the wine cup high be quick the clouds delay not as they fly ere yet this fading world to darkness goes my senses darken with thy wine of rose till fate makes flagons of my worthless clay then fill my empty skull with wine i pray so neither death nor judgment shall be mine the grave a brimming cup of limpid wine saadi footnote sir edwin arnolds translation atma back in the palace was once more racking her mind what to do about her remaining responsibility the diamond so far fate and the gods had guided her aright she had managed to give the king timely warning that the little coward would claim his promise better sure if she had burned then having little time for thought and knowing in truth that she had no chance of escaping unmolested through the strictly guarded entrances to the kings private apartments she had returned by the swinging dhooli to her own thus for the time keeping her method of escape secret from her gaolers so immediate urgency being over she had set to work first to conceal what till then she had hidden in the dark braids of her hair for she guessed at once by the luxury with which she was surrounded that tirewomen would appear in the morning that every temptation would be plied to make her yield to mirza ibrahims lawless desires she smiled at the thought yea let him come but not till after she was prepared so she deftly cut a snippet of brocade from a hanging and greasing it in an oil lamp rolled the diamond and the wayfarers square stone together so as to form a fine large packet stitched it together with gold thread she found ready on an embroidery frame and hung it once more on the greasy black skein telling herself none would interfere with so palpable a talisman for the rest she had the deathdagger of her race which she hid until dressingtime was over in a womans workbasket though nothing she told herself would happen before her appearance at the festival as charan so seeing always but a short space into the future she lay down and slept when she had wakened servants had been ready to fly in lawful command to temporise soothingly with unlawful ones and she had smiled grimly telling herself they were afraid of her and that when the end came she need only fear the violence of poison but that again was not yet even after the festival was over after she had lied so calmly to save the kings honour she had hours to spare the mirza would need darkness for his proposals so she had quite smilingly put on the gorgeous dress of a court lady which on her return from the audience was all she had found in the place of her own old red garments what did it matter the steel hauberk of her fathers the circlet and the sword were still hers these she had worshipped these would look down on her death for honour so if her white robe trailed on the ground and was sewn with stars if her jewelled bodice flashed under the light folds of a saffron pearlset veil what was that to her the kings charan who carried a deathdagger in her waistband nothing mattered so long as her hardlythoughtout project for the delivery of the kings diamond could be brought about if the message could be sentif old deena the drumbanger would take it then the jeweller might come disguised as a sufi in the preachers dhooli and she could fulfil her promise she could give it into his very handsyea even if she had to yield before that to the lord chamberlains desires even this supreme sacrifice she was prepared to make if they failed to send deena or if the feringhi failed to come for she must have time she leant listlessly on the steps below the cupola toying idly with a scrap of silkmade writing paper and pen and ink a slavewoman gaoler duennawhom atma had sent from her very side on plea of chilliness was standing a little way apart making believe to drive away the sunsettime mosquitoes with a peacocks feather fan in reality watching every movement of her charge would deena come she had sent for him calmly to drum to her rhythm of pedigrees that was her right and he was so far a hanger on of the mirzas that they might count him of themselves yet he might be true to her also the drumbanger waits said a eunuch at the door and her heart leapt to her mouth lo tis luscious as honey to a bee lascivious to the liver as saffron pillau to the stomach ejaculated the old man admiringly in truth atma looked superlatively handsome amid the fine feathers of silken carpets and satin cushions thy liver and thy stomach sinner retorted atma carelessly as she crumpled up the scrap of paper and flung it into the lacquered pentray but come to work since i am here as kings woman i may be called on any moment to sing in the harem and i sing few womens songs none of the modern style she broke into the high trilling commencement of a not overrespectable ballad of the bazaars deenas wicked old face took on an air of outraged virtue his hands refused to touch his drum nay mistress most chaste he protested in an injured tone salvation comes not that way to old deena he can get drumming and to spare of that sort elsewhere atma stared at him and held his eyes with her large meaningful dark ones tis not drumming but deeds that count sir sinner she said slowly as king solomon said to the peacock who remained to salaam by drumming his wings while the hoopoe gained his golden crown by running a message deenas old face set instantly like a stone no muscle quivered but his wicked old eyes twinkled he understood in a second what was wanted of him for intrigue was his very food and drink it made him feel years younger to carry a love letter this would have naught to do with love of course but the joy was in the deception happen he meant to help happen he did not it was all one to him it meant the deceiving of a duenna shall i then take a message for the mistress most chaste he asked hardily winking the while at the latter as if taking her into his confidence message echoed atma scornfully nay no message my lord ibrahim my lover will come when he thinks fit and go when i choose like a cur with his tail bellywardsshe had been full of such jibes all dayso let us to work the song of the tale of the wisdom of the princess fortunata can hurt no woman folk but take heed to the time she broke at once into irregular chanting listen women i pray to the wise sanyogata the queens advice to prithvi on courage and cowardice then she changed rhythm and the words swept on like a torrent what fool asks woman for advicethe world holds her wit shallow even when the truth comes from her lips men stop their ears and smile and yet without the woman where is man we hold the power of formfor us the fire of shivs creative force flames up and burns lo we are thieves of life and sancturies of souls and sanctuaries of souls of souls there was a sudden check of irritation the singer interrupted herself to complain of lack of accord then continued vessels are we of virtue and of vice of knowledge and of utmost ignorance astrologers can calculate from books the courses of the stars but who is he can read the pages of a womans heart our book hath not been measured so men say she hath no wisdom but to hide their lack of understanding yet we share your lives your failures your successes griefs and joys hunger and thirst if yours are ours and death parts us not from you for we follow fast to serve you in the mansions of the sun the mansions of the sun yet once again some discord in voice and music seemed to rouse ire fool cried atma hast no sense thou art like a sitting hen with thy cluck cluck cluck all out of tune take a paper if thou canst not remember and set it down in notation see there is a bit yonder she pointed to the pentray and deena with contrite face took the crumpled scrap smoothed it out on the top of his drum and thereinafter with some slight exaggeration in displaying a fair white surface proceeded to write down quaint musical hieroglyphics then folding it notation uppermost stuck it into the drumbrace now let us try again mistress most chaste he said cheerfully for old deena never failed a woman yet least of all one who hath oft times stood between him and damnation there was a faint tremble as of relaxed tension in atmas voice as she went on love of my heart lo you are as a swan that rests upon my bosom as a lake there is no rest for thee but here my lord and yet arise to victory and fame sun of the chanhans who has drunk so deep of glory and of pleasure as my lord and yet the destiny of all is death yea even of the gods and to die well is life immortal therefore draw your sword smite down the foes of hind think not of self the garment of this life is frayed and worn think not of mewe twain shall be as one hereafter and for ever go my king we twain shall be as one as one the nicest musical ear might have detected small change in deenas accompaniment but atma professed herself satisfied and now asked the old gobetween as she leant back wearily what next nothing she answered one is enough for a day thou canst come tomorrowfor reward or punishment and the mistress hath no orders no message he asked winking at the duenna elaborately nothing save to get thee gone as quick as may be see him out woman that faint tremor of voice only betrayed that her nerves were almost at breaking point that she felt the need of solitude for a second when it came she passed swiftly to the sword of her fathers and kissed it passionately then flinging her arms on the parapet she gazed out over the plain scarce seeing the pageantry of sunset that was being enacted on the distant horizon what had she written on that scrap of paper it had necessarily to be guardedbut had she said enough to the feringhi jeweller come disguised as a sufi in the preachers dhooli tonight at one oclock atma devi will give thee the luck thou desirest after all it did read like a love letter so much the better perhaps with deena as messenger anyhow the message was sent what therefore lay before her within measurable distance of probabilities now she could face them supposing the mirza came that night oh where was the use of considering what at the worst she might have to do in order to secure leisure at one oclock for that had to be gained aye even though before that hour say at eleven she had to one and eleven her mind unaccustomed to strain circled vaguely there was only a pinspoint difference between the two hours on paper just a mere scratch a duplication and yetmayhapbetween them tonight a whole life and strange so little difference why didst thou lie today woman said a voice beside her to save my honour she turned with a cry and fell at akbars feet he had met deenas outgoing had sent the duenna packing by a word backed by the display of the ring which was royaltys sign manual in all matters pertaining to the womens apartments so entering had flung aside his muffling shawl and for the last few seconds had been watching atma for a sudden new perception of her beauty had come to him perhaps with the sight of her in a dress familiar to him since it is generally some such subtle hint which at first makes a mans eyes differentiate one woman from another down at his very feet atmas voice was yet proud to save the honour of the king akbar was quick in comprehensionwho never diesnot to save jalaluddinmahomed akbar still thou needst not have lied this slave only said what the king would have said a quick frown flew to his keen face thou speakest bravely woman but tis true akbars brain was clouded how came thine to be so clever my father was a chessplayer she said simply he taught me and it was not difficult most high it was trivial for a second he looked really angry then said quietly true again o charan stand up woman wherefore shouldst thou grovel beforetriviality standing there beside her their eyes met and his showed admiration so thou didst not lie because the king can do no wrong then art thou woman to be judge thy thought thy standard always to be right itit was today great king she said gravely he laughed outright this is wholesome as a draught of bitter apples lo charan thou didst give me a lesson in love last time we met give me one in tactics today not tactics in chessthat is past praying forbut in kingship she looked at him with pitiful humility this slave knows not she is only woman and yet thou didst come at dawn to save me from a broken promise i have not thanked thee yet for that but in truthhere his voice grew softer and leaning his elbow on the parapet he looked into her eyes thanks being all on one side then suddenly curiosity beset him how didst thou comehe looked down rapidlynot by yonder projecting eave not by that surely why even my head he paused a while and her silence assuring him murmured and thou didst that for me for the king mosthigh she protested in a low voice as she clutched convulsively at the talisman for through her swept with tumultuous force her first real knowledge of what her womanhood might hold ye gods have pity she must not lose herself the kings luck must be safe first he must never know the tale he looked at her curiously her lips were parted her breath came fast thou hast the nerve of ten he said rapidly thou couldst walk yonder ledge where ieven imight fear to fall and yet his hand reaching out as they stood close together by the parapet caught her wrist swiftly and clasped it yet now thou art afraidafraid of what her pulses bounding under his cool firm touch seemed to suffocate her aye she admitted turning her mind frantically to excuse i feari fear the night alone in a strange place in truth she did fear it her soul shrank now knowing what she might have to sacrifice but for the blind halfconfusing memory of one oclock she would have fallen at his feet and begged for freedom she might have done so had she had time to count the cost strange echoed akbar haughtily dost forget it is the kings housethat the king is guardian though in truth he added with a smile jalaluddin mahomed akbar sleeps tonight in his pitched camp beyond the gates the memory seemed to obsess him with other ideas for he turned away gloomily farewell widow akbar will strive to be kingthou hast done thy best to make him one anyhow he added almost angrily but as he went something in her face and form recalled his youth and he hesitated then drawing off a ring hastily he strode over to her and taking her hand roughly slipped it on her finger yea thou hast done many things for me he said proudly so let me do one for thee this ring the signet of the palace may calm thy fears for tonight none dare harm its possessor without my order at thy peril use it not unworthily i he paused drew his shrouding shawl round him and corrected himselfit will be reclaimed at dawn the dusk had died down almost to dark the stars grew clearer and clearer on the growing violet of the sky atma stood gazing with unseeing eyes over the wide plain that was losing itself rapidly in shadow she was scarcely thinking at all she was only feeling how increasingly hard it was becoming to dissociate akbar from the king love from love the lord high treasurer hath called to inquire and craves admittance she awoke to realities at the duennas voice but with a new element in her outlook on the futurea palpitating horror at the thought of the sacrifice she had faced calmly but an hour ago hehe is welcome she said faintly there was no use shirking and she might be able to put him off till after one but his first words told her theirs was a fight for life in the present all in the dark he said lightly so much the better mayhap mistress for ibrahims peace of mind seeing that he hath but a few hours to count his own the jackal hath to eat his bones betimes what meanest my lord she asked hurriedly that his majesty the king will feast on the flesh he replied recklessly ah i have heard he hath been here this last halfhour in troth but that he interferes with my quarry i would say thank god the anchorite hath found his meat as it is i have come earlier to handsel my share then he turned swiftly to the duenna leave us for a while i would speak alone with this lady when she had gone he said curtly thou hadst best sit down i have much to say say on replied atma laconically as without the faintest sign of trepidation she sate herself calmly down amid the silken carpets and cushions for behind her propped against the marble pilasters were the hauberk the sword of her fathers to give her courage it was the mirza who showed uneasiness he walked up and down as if uncertain how to begin well she asked with a scornful smile as she played idly with the pens in the open penbox what hast thou to say he cast aside doubt at her words flung himself on the steps and leaning forward peered through the dusk into her eyes what thou wilt not care to hear so brace thyselfif thou canst woman thou didst send by deena he has betrayed me she exclaimed involuntarily or died take it as thou willst the letter was sent to its destination anyhow for it served our purpose thou knowest the kings challenge well we have sought all day to get hold of the feringhi jeweller so that his death might break the kings safe conduct but birbal hath been too quick for us he hath him safe cooped up in his house but thou hast called the man here atma with a cry rose to her feet i meant but she began what thou didst mean matters not now though i have my suspicions broke in the mirza brutally sit down i tell thee and listen whether thy call be as i hold it to be one that even birbal would admit time will show but if this doubly damned infidel be found within the palace precincts it is death and see herehe held out a paper i cannot see she murmured dully it is too dark and in truth even as she spoke the palace gong sounded one stroke how often it sounded one she thought as the mirza struck a light but this time it meant halfanhour beyond eight one yesit was the knell of doom the spark had come to the tinderroll and now a sputtering oil lamp in the sevenfold cresset showed her the writing on the paper to the sergeant of the palace watch at one of the clock guard the preachers dhooli and enter the apartment of atma devi her lover will be there he is not my lover she began but he will be there at one he laughed devilishly now listen none but me know of thisas yet atma his voice took on urgency almost appeal grant me thyselfand this paper shall be destroyed so it had come she was the price of honour would it not be the simplest way it must be tonight he whispered hoarsely tomorrow the king she could have struck him full upon the mouth but she sate trembling with tense desire to do so if i promise she asked firmly may this paper be mine she had noticed that it was signed and countersigned by the captain and commandant of the guard if she had it it might be difficult to get another anyhow it would show good faith ibrahims face grew hard nay fair one he said hardly till the promise is fulfilled i must have due security and she must have it also she thought fiercely aye she knew him devilspawn vile utterly he meant to take all from her and send the order too she might give him everything at eleven and yet at oneeleven and one and she glanced hastily at the paper then sate silent her face hardening her hands still playing idly with the pens in the pen bag think over it bibi he said insinuatingly for even the faint lamp light showed her bewilderingly beautiful it is not so much to ask i am no illfavoured churl and before heaven i love thee then surely thou wouldst not betray the king betray the king no that must never be she had thought of a way to prevent that andand if i give the audience thou desirest atat eleven she began slowly he fell at her feet rapturously atma i swear she stilled him with a wave of her hand i must think she cried and rising walked to the parapet only however to return after a second i consent she said quietly at eleven be itthou wilt not send this she showed the paper she still held nay he replied with a bow as he took it from her i will keep it ever next my heart as security for happinessat eleven when he had gone she broke into a sudden wild laugh and flung the pen she held concealed in her right hand into the pen tray only a flys foot on the paper but it will show truth or untruth she muttered then she sate down and waited there was nothing else to be done she dare not use the kings signetif indeed this token of mere personal safety to herself would be of any availsince that might lead to his discovery of the diamonds theft and that this had grown to an immutable creed must never be light not so many lights she said to the servants who came in with long garlands of flowers and coloured lights but they went on with their work it was by the lord chamberlains orders they said and they brought her new jewels and scattered roseoilwater about the cushions and spread a low stooltable with fruit and goblets and wine flagons she sate and watched them interested as she would not have been but for the awakening of her womanhood under the kings touch now she understood now for the first time she realised the philosophy of siyah yamin so ibrahim coming in earlyshe smiled mysteriously at his hastefound her watching the slavewomen who were reaching up to place coloured lights amongst the roses twined round the cupola and as they worked they sang in a quaint roundel shine earthen lamps outblaze the stars so cold so white so far shine little lamp hide heavens light love comes to love tonight bid them remove them my lord she said eagerly lo they are garish are not mine eyes and the stars sufficient forfor lovers she hung her head and looked at him her cheeks showed a crimson flush beneath the corncoloured skin her eyes blazed indeed like many stars he gave the order instantly and as it was being executed walked to the parapet whence he could feast his eye upon the picture she made as she sate in the cupola the rose garlands bending to touch her the light of the sevenlamped cresset on the step below her shining full on her face and glinting behind her on cold steel of sword and hauberk aye she was right the coloured lights were garish she was colourful enough herself she needed no adventitious aids to passion that hint of cold steel was enough his blood rose to fever heat quick slaves quick he cried are we to be kept waiting all night her laugh rang out provocatively my lord is before his time it is not yet eleven drink to our love mirzaor stay let us drink to the truth between us she filled two goblets of the good red wine and passed him one so to the truth between us she cried then as she drained the glass flung it far into the darkness of the night it showed curving cometlike then sank a distant tinkle telling where it had smashed to atoms thine also thine also ibrahim she cried to the truth between us he muttered something unheard flung his glass away then essaying a laugh caught up a lute and began to sing in high airy trills lo the greenhued sea of heaven and the crescent moon its ship bear me dearest to the haven where loves anchor i may dip in the harbour of thy bosom find in shelter of thy lip kisses seven kisses seven oh what nectarone more sip surely thou wilt be forgiven even angels sometimes trip as he stood there dressed in white from head to foot becurled bescented bedandyfied atma thought of the man who had stood there before and something purely savage crept into her smile lo thou singest well she said so do i give me the lute the servants had gone he crossed to her passion in his eyes i came not here for lutes he cried almost brutally i came for love she motioned him back with her hand it is not yeteleven and i will singofoflove he drew a long breath she was surpassing beautiful with that enticing smile why should he be greedy of his pleasure love of my heart bring blushes to my face seek not at wisdoms hand excuse or grace speed thou my blood in passions tireless race till lip meet lip and arm with arm embrace for the love of the heart has no end atma i love thee his quick cry sank before her steady voice but the grave but the cold cold grave but the grave he gave a slight shiver and drew back then threw himself beside her come he said there is life before the grave she shook her head playfully not even siyah yamin with all her knowing wiles could have played her part better it is not yeteleven she answered and if her face showed haggard it was belied by her gay laugh lo keep to compact mirza sahib there is another verse by then it may beeleven she paused a second as if her keen ears had caught some faint sound then she swept the strings with a resounding force that echoed and reechoed through the roof drowning all else love of my soul bring courage to my heart seek not at passions hand her lure and art claim thou the whole of me and not the part though death meet death and life from life depart for the love of the soul has no end in the grave in the cold cold grave in the grave a crashing chord dissonant fierce overbore all things and out of it rose mellow the first chime of eleven she leant forward her eyes full of allure on his out with the lamps love needs no light she quoted rapidly one her curved red lips smiled parted and one of the cressets was gone its dying breath exhaled perfumes of musk again the mellow note rang out two she whispered and again a cresset flickered went out three four this time the mirza seemed to be listening it will be counting kisses by and by when light fails she suggested gaily pointing to the three remaining lamplets five there were but two now she was leaning closer to him his arm had stolen round her waist six something made her glance hastily to the door but the bounding blood in his pulses seemed for him to have invaded the whole world and he heard nothing seven it was dark now and from the darkness came the longdrawn sound of a kiss then of another eightninethe chiming hour went on his arms were round her aye but hers were round him also arms like iron lips like steel upon his mouth ten die dog she whispered with the kiss nay thou shalt take it he struggled fiercely eleven die in mine arms for thine untruth traitor help he choked feebly harlot let me go but it was too late the palace guard under orders for eleven not for one had found their quarry in the dark had found him in a womans arms and swift daggers did their work there was not a quiver in mirza ibrahims body when turning it over they discovered by a lanterns light their mistake and started back in horror yea he is dead said atma as she stood fast held for future punishment there was sombre menace in her voice her eyes blazed with a cruel fire then she turned on her captors loose me slaves i carry the signet of the king seek his orders concerning me it was true the signet was on her finger so releasing her they doubleguarded the door while with the dead body of the lord chamberlain as witness they sought superior wisdom left alone atma found the old sword as solace and clasped it to her bosom she had but killed for the king a her fathers had killed many a time chapter xxvi twas in the bath a piece of perfumed clay came from my loved ones hands to mine one day art thou then musk or ambergris i said that by thy scent my soul is ravished not so it answered naught but clay am i but i have kept a roses company saadi it was nigh twelve of the night and akbar was awake he sate on the low divan which served him as a bed and in a measure as throne also when he was in camp but there was little else about the magnificent apartment in which it stood to suggest the smallest withdrawal of luxury still less of comfort the walls were of the finest kashmir shawls draped in panels between the parcelgilt tent poles and the floor was covered with strangelyglistening silken carpets from khotan a marvellous lustre of precious stones hung from the roof and beside the divan stood the sevenlight cresset stand the golden and gemmed scent brazier and the clepsydra with its lotus bowl without which the king spent no night he was alone for the time though countless guards doubtless stood in the vast city of huge tents which formed the kings camp weary work indeed is it to even read the catalogue of such a camp of the hundreds of tents of scarlet cloth bound with silken tapes fitted with silken ropes some of which would seat ten thousand people of the great circle of doublestoried screen around the akassdeva lampthe kings lamp that showed the way to gods justice then the dais for common audience with its avenue of five hundred feet by three hundred broad and its great circular enclosure of over one thousand feet diameter truly the mind wavers over the tremendous size of it and refuses to grasp the possibility of a pavilion with fiftyfour rooms in it such nevertheless was the camp in which akbar sate alone awaiting a favoured visitor for he had made up his mind to see this little queen of women with whom his son was said to have fallen in love it was easy she was but a child and he the father of his people so he had ordered ghiass beg to bring her to the camp privately at twelve of the night when all was quiet then he felt he would be able to judge aright since what was this challenge of his but mere childishness everyone even birbal was keen to win or lose but if he lost or won how did that affect the truth was love powerful enough to wean salim from his life of debauchery the idea of it had not been but the compelling force depended on the woman was this child of twelve pshaw it was impossible yet he must see her he felt for it was a momentous decision not to be made lightly he rose and walking over to the clepsydra watched the lotus cup sinking with the weight of time so sank beauty under the weight of years and then suddenly to him came the remembrance of atma devi ye gods if from the beginning he had had a mate such as shea woman to whom the honour of the king outweighed the honour nay even the love of the man he need not now have stood uncertain hesitating whether to leave all even his sons to wallow in the mire of conventionalityto leave all and dream out his dream of empire in his own way for he would have had not only sons but heirs should he so leave all should the morrow see the camp no more spectacle to the wedding festivities but a real departure he could take her with him as an inspirationthe sudden unlooked for thought caught him unawares left him surprised the captain of the palace guard without and the chief eunuch have urgent news came the obsequious voice of a page bid them in he replied returning to the divan almost glad of an interruption to what was disturbing in the uttermost dead he echoed incredulously to the news they brought the lord high chamberlain deadby whose hands by mine most high answered a trembling voice as the sergeant of the guard fell at the kings feet we had warning that the english jeweller was to be in mistress atma devis rooms tonight at eleven we went all was dark we found him as we thought in her very arms yet when justice was done and we brought the light itit was mirza ibrahim in whose apartment akbars voice was very cold very quiet in the charanwomans most high lo there is some mistake doubtless yet she was brought in by the mirzas ordersshe had the fairest apartment set apart for her andand he visited her this eveningjust after majesty so the woman said akbar rose to his feet fiercely what has that to do with it slave he interrupted his voice full of swift sudden anger go on with the noisome tale of a truth sire there is no doubt lamps were lit and wine brought so he deserved death and the woman too aye assented the king she deserved it more didst kill her too he felt outraged beyond words every atom of his manhood rose in hot anger against the woman who had daredaye dared to make him think of things he had forgotten when she herself ah it was past mere anger nay most high sheshe showed us the signet of majesty and so under his breath a curse broke from akbars lips aye he remembered now he had given her the ring and with the memory came back such an impotent flood of pure savage rage as never before in all his life had he felt the mogul scratched showed the tartar for an instant not even his ancestor timur could have felt more bloodthirsty the shame of it alone cried for instant revenge the thought brought him outward calm she dies at dawn he said quietly as women do who sin in gods night bring her here then she shall affix the seal to her own deathwarrant write it now and lay it on yonder desk so that it may be ready and till then most high leave her where her lover died being hindu she may learn to follow him without fear for already bitter anger was passing inflexible justice taking its place his highness the lord treasurer waits without with a dhooli said the page once more close the screens let no one enter bid the lord treasurer bring the dhooli to the outer tent and remain there himself the order was given calmly but he who gave it was in a whirlwind of passionate protest and this womanthis common strumpet of the bazaarshad talked to him of love had in reality set him on the first step which had led him so far from commonsense which had brought him here to an interview with a chit of a child at dead of night a slim white figure parting the curtains which separated this inner pavilion from the one beyond brought him back to his bearings it was not the childs fault she must be courteously dealt with wilt not unveil my child he said gravely there is none to fear and mihrunnissa fears none came the reply as the cloud of white drapery thrown back fell on the ground and the girl stepping forward lightly from the billowy folds stood to salaam there was a moments pause then eager warm came akbars verdict by all the gods of indra by allah and his prophet thou art beautiful indeed my daughter a deeper flush tinged the rounded cheeks but the girl looked frankly into the admiring eyes i am glad something in her conscious unconsciousness made him ask quickly wherefore because they call me queen of women sire and the queen should please the king she answered demurely thou hast a ready wit child dost wish to be a queen there was not a trace of sauciness in her quick reply it depends sire upon the king akbar felt completely taken aback he recognised in this slender little maidling of twelve the germs of something that might grow to greatness indeed i am a churl lady he said at last to keep beauty standing seat yourself so beside me and we can talk or stay a whimsical smile irradiated his face he put out his hand to lead her to the thronedivan sit thou upon the seat of majesty and i will sit at beautys feet i have much to learn from it she did not even protest she took her place with childish dignity and waited for him to speak frankness seemed the only possible approach so he plunged at once in medias res lady dost thou love my son salim the cupidsbow of her lips smiled over a cold definite no akbars parental pride rose instantly and why prithee the answer was nonchalant uncompromising i like not his looks yet he is not illfavoured protested the proud father beginning to feel injured he is stalwart and young hath fine eyes and he is not so good looking as his father iseven now said mihrunnissa sagely nodding her head but for that even now fair daughter said akbar nettled your compliments might make one shy then thou lovest sher afkan the flush came again he is a brave soldier anyhow said the little maiden holding her head high a brave soldier indeed assented akbar gravely yet feeling inclined to smile but as for looks hath he not a scar upon his face twill be a place whereon a wife may lay her kisses retorted mihrunnissa hastily then grew crimson with shame at having inadvertently used an argument which had evidently done duty in sparring matches on the subject with her mother akbar laughed out loud then grew grave of a truth mistress quickwit women are beyond mens comprehension but we have been playing with words hitherto now let us be seriouslet me see thy mind why dost not like my son instant clear decisive came the reply because he doth not love his father wherefore does he not love him what proof hast thou asked akbar hotly mihrunnissas face had no pity even in its deep unfathomable eyes because great king he seeks ever to betray jalaluddin mahomed akbar ohthe words once started rushed out now like a torrenti know they say it is better akbar should not know i know how they alleven my lord birbalkeep things back saying the kings mind should be tranquil but it is not so kingship is the truth kings must know all things there is the diamondthey have kept that back i dare swear it was stolen most high stolen echoed akbar stupidly who was itwho spoke of that before then memory returning impotent rage once more rose in him well what then he queried roughly i say the king should know came the high girlish voice pain is but a safeguard from ill he should know aye and use his knowledge that it was stolen for the princethat he wore it in his turban and that if it hath gone back to safekeeping tis not because of remorse upon the princes part but because the king exchanged the turban of brotherhood it is not true muttered akbar hiding his head in his hands childsay it is not true something in him told him it was true therefore he fought against it all the more fiercely will saying it alter fact went on the inexorable young voice my king the knowledge of all this is to be king ignorance isis foolishness she stood up a startled look in her eyes have i have i made thee cry she said solicitously then she burst out fiercely oh if i were queen i would have no son no husband i would be queen indeed akbar had stood up also his face blurred by emotion but strong and stern i have to thank thee for the truth strange i have had to learn it from a little maids lips lo mihrunnissa wilt thou not love my son she shook her head had he been more like she paused and hung her head shy for the first time he took her little hand and stooping kissed it and had the queen of women but been fifteen years olderthou art sure child thou wouldst not care to be queen her face grew grave the perfect features took on dignity queen i shall be the crystal says so but not now for i am too young and he would break my heart why should i give up youth then suddenly recollecting her role of virtuous wisdom she added solemnly but god alone knows what the future may hold when she had gone akbar sate down feeling dazed by the many unlooked for buffettings which fate had given him that night to begin with he had been within an ace of dishonour himself aye there was no use denying it it must have been unrecognised passion in himself which had led him into this childish unkinglike challenge and now had come this dishonour of degenerate heirs for what use was there in dissociating salim from murad murad from danyal his sons were all alikewere they indeed his sons these dissolute drinking louts he paced the tent almost in despair pride anger love justice tearing at his heart yes he must go he must leave his city of heirship for ever he must cast off earthly shackles and live only for the immortal dream birbals slim figure stealing through the curtains roused him to instant anger almost as instant patience since how could he judge of those bound by conventional standards what now he asked briefly something uncompromising in his tone made the minister begin an excuse he had been close by and hearing that majesty waked akbar walked up and laid his hand on birbals shoulder lie not friend he said hath the stolen diamond been found sh hold thy peace i know the tale a queen of common sense hath told it to me and rightly told it what she said was pain but a warning against evil that is truth but is the stone found that is what i ask birbal whose jaw had almost fallen in his blank surprise was on his knees instinct telling him to attempt no excuse sire i have it with me now the madwoman atma devi what of her asked akbar fiercely truth was the only resource so birbal told it she sent a message to bid william leedes come to her at one o the night in the preachers dhooli and i fearing treacheryfor i never trusted woman yet without regretting itwent myself for the safeconduct given by majesty to these strangers was a fertile field for the breaking of promise akbar interrupted him impatiently and she met you where in truth where there was scant foothold for a goat said birbal glibly trying to get through with confession lightly on the wide eave of the turret belike she heeded not the danger being as she said under sentence of death at dawn and it was that made her yield the gem to metwas her last chancefor she held fast to her promise to give it to none save unto the jewellers own hand so she stood there with death in a falter administering fearful oaths and he had been feeling in his breast and now held forth the luck of the king here it is sire in the light of the cressets the gem glowed familiarly like soft moonshine but akbar peremptorily set it aside thou art under oath to deliver it to none but the jeweller traitor are women to be more faithful than men birbal grovelled at the kings feet but akbar did not notice him he was dully trying to piece the parts into a whole telling himself he would hear the truth when atma devi should be brought to him at dawn chapter xxvii look lover now indeed love endeth right this is the only road oh learn of me that death shall give thee loves best ecstasy oh if thou best true lover wash not hand from that dear stain of love from worldly brand of wealth and selflove wash it at the last those win who spite of fortunes tempests stand glad to wreck all for lovei say to thee i saadi launch not on loves boundless sea but if thou puttest forth hoist sail quit anchor to storm and wave trust thyself hardily saadi footnote translated by sir edwin arnold the womancharan waits without under guard bid her inalone akbar had been awaiting this it seemed to him for hours now that it had come he would have delayed if he could the tent was still dark but as the outer screen was lifted something paler grayer than murknight showed in faint square grew blurred with moving shades then disappeared altogether the cresset light scarce reached into the shadowy corners of the tent where hung faint clouds of scented smoke but akbars keen eyes pierced the gloom clearly what have they bound thee i meant not so he stepped to the tall dim figure and unloosed the cord with which its hands were tied come hither woman the kindly office done he was back on the throne his face showing stern in the cresset light as she came forward she stumbled slightly in her walk they must have tied her feet also when they were bringing her to the camp and she was numb and stiff his heart went out to her in swift pity then returned to him in swifter justice the ring woman the signet that i gave thee he said peremptorily until that was gone from her finger even he could not touch her for harm she held it out to him without a word then sinking to her knees crouched at his feet the folds of her starset skirts clung round her closely the saffron pearlsewn veil hardly hid her beauty of strong supple curves she had begged to be allowed to die in the steel hauberk of the charan but they had jeered at her saying the race was well quit of such representatives as she so in her final arraignment she stood as simple woman perhaps by so doing she gained advantage anyhow akbar who had meant to be sternly judicial felt now they were alone together that this was no question of culprit and judge but of a man and a woman and with the feeling came to his surprise a sense of keen personal injury why hast thou done this thing he asked bitterly the long tension of the night the sight of the man she knew she loved the very touch of his hands as he undid the knot which had bound her and now the regret the pain of his voice all conspired against calmness though she fought for it desperately there was but one refugethe refuge of race ii did it for the king she said mechanically not realising the full meaning of her words he caught at it in a moment for the king then thou art true she gave no answer what was the use of explanation when she could not explain when the king must never know aught concerning the theft of the diamond silence was better god gave the reward of that atmashe shivered at the name at the tone of the kings voicei command thee as king answer truly what was there betwixt thee and the mirza she sighed faintly by forgetting what really mattered in the purely personal he had enabled her to obey that which is ever between a man and woman when they both need somewhat my liege she said simply so now i must die it will be better she had told herself this a hundred times that night she had done her work life might bring difficulties death was the only remedy but she overreached herself in selfsacrifice oh let me die my liege she cried kissing the dust of his feet majesty will forget this hope was also in her blurred mind it will not forget he cried passionately unless it knows the truth speak womanblazon out thy shame if shame there be else i call birbal with the diamond he took from thee she was on her feet trembling with anger outraged utterly what he hath told the mosthigh oh traitor coward and he sworehe bade me never tell akbar gave a sigh of relief he understood now this woman had been in the conspiracy of silence and she would have kept that silence until death sit thee down again kings charan he said almost with a smile the king was not to know aye but he does know so silence is of no avail he knows allhow the luck was stolen for the prince salim and how he deceiving his father atma gave a little cry and crept closer almost as it were consolingly to his feet he is but young my liege he did not think she pleaded truly he loves his fatherthere is no cause for pain in the slight pause akbars eyes showed suspiciously as if they held sudden tears not so spoke she who told me he said his voice bitter yet she also was woman atmas slow brain busy over that she broke in on the silence wast khanzada gulbadan or umm kulsum she asked naively akbar frowned quickly i wist not they were in the scandal he said quite petulantly but what matters it if all the world knewsave only the king leave that alone for gods sake and tell me truly what lay between thee and ibrahim to him so near desire that was the fateful question to her also for dimly she saw ahead silence is best she said obstinately it does not injure truth whose hiding place is immortality whose shadow death the wellworn quotation fell from her lips like the juice of poppy restful soothing opiate but akbar was in no mood of acquiescence he bent hastily and seized her by the wrist fiercely tenderly all his blood was stirring in him as it had not stirred for years i tell thee thou shalt answer i the king command thee charan nay i jalaluddin mahomed akbar as man command thee as woman tell me the truth she shrunk backlooked into his eyes whence peace and dignity had fled leaving naught but mans passionthen gave a little sob feeling her effort had failed he was man not king yea i will tell thee jalaluddin mahomed akbar so she told him dully piteously of her treachery concerning diswunt of her immediate repentance of her much searching of the wayfarer and his strange gift that she wore even now around her neck and how it had helped her until as she spoke a scent of fresh roses seemed to fill the tent where those two sate hand in hand for the grip on wrist had slackened and her fingers now lay in his willingly confidently then she told him of mihrunnissa and the beneficent ladies of the false gems and the true one hidden in a harlots bosom until interest growing in akbars eyes she forgot herself in her story as she told of the mirza and his uttermost deceit her very hand withdrew itself unnoticed as she described the flys foot upon the paper which had altered the hour and her voice rang defiant as she gave her challenge for the truth so instinct with the mere drama of the deed she sprang to her feet and made as if she flung the goblet curving like a comet into the night and akbar sate and watched her with ever growing admiration as action by action she followed her own words it became breathless palpitatingthe seven lamped cressetthe chiming gongeven the longdrawn kisses akbars cheek paledthis was more than womanhoodthis was his dream of it die dog die for thine untruth her passion had risen to its height she staggered for it was akbar whom she found within her clasp but it was akbar who held her close as men hold women whom they love who strained her to his breast murmuring nay thou shalt live live for thine uttermost truth the excitement died from her face in a moment she drew back from him in deadly fear my liegemy liegenot soit cannot befor pity sake my liege cannot he echoed with an exultant laugh wherefore can it not be am i not the king it is because the most high is the king she beganremember my liegethe death warrant he had forgotten it but he passed rapidly to the desk whereon it lay that is easy remedied said he seizing on it and making as if he would tear it up hold she cried peremptorily wherefore he asked as peremptorily she drew herself up to her full height because i am keeper of the kings honour and i forbid it again wherefore checked in his immediate intention his temper rose does my liege forget she said and her voice was calmness itself that it is not yet dawn that to destroy that paper is failurethat the kings enemies will triumph it is not yet dawn and thatshe pointed to what he heldbelongs to today there was an awful silence akbar stood blinded by the truth it was as she had said to annul the deathwarrant was to confess failure so after a time his voiceor was it not his voicesounded through the tent it is not sealed thou hadst the ringtherefore it doth not count she had taken a step or two nearer to him as if to beg the paper of him now she shrank back as from a snake frozen with fear what she whispered and her voice was close on tears shall kingship stoop to craftleave that to the kings enemies but akbar was past reproach passion had mastered him and his hands instinct mobile with fierce life met and parted again and again until the deathwarrant torn to shreds lay in his clasp a mere handful of waste paper lo he cried joyfully let kingship go jalaluddin is manhe will reap mans harvest of love he flung what he held from him with the action of a sower who sows the light scraps of paper hung in the air for a second then fell steadily softly like seed grains some of them fell on atmas white starsewn skirts she stooped slowly to raise one and hold it up menacingly not a grain of the sheaves of life is stored by one who has trod the furrows and fallows of passion and sown no seed for god but akbar had drifted too far from philosophy for such hoarded wisdom he was back beside the speaker his arm around her it is idle atma i tell thee naught shall stand between us let kingship gothou art my queen she fought frantically against him and his claim sire bethink you if the challenge be lost what care ithou lovest medare not to say thou dost not yea yea i love thee oh jalaluddin she cried pleading with him for himself but thou art the king thy faith must not fail my faith in thee will never fail he replied naught else matters not mine in thee not mine the charans in the king nay it shall not be so atma the charan dies her hand which had snatched out the deathdagger of her race held it high above her head but akbar was too quick for her his was on hers so arrested it remained bringing her face closer to his nay my queen he said and the softness of his voice sent despair and delight through her veins thou hast said thou lovest me as i do thee is that not enough for poor mortal man what is kingship compared to it let it go kiss me sweetheartkiss me but once and thou wilt learn she lay passive on his shoulder her eyes full of the fire of love immortal found and held his what shall i learn great king she whispered falteringly to take even love from my hand he said bending closer her whole body seemed to yield to him she nestled closer finding soft rest in his strong arms yea she whispered raising her lips for the kiss i will takeall things from the hand of the king so ere he could prevent it ere taken by surprise his iron muscles could counteract the strong downward sweep of her right hand his clasping hers followed the flash of the deathdagger of her race it found fit sheathing close to her heart atma he whispered sinking to his knees with the dead weight he held atma he did not call her love or queen he knew too well that she was slipping away from such empty titles a low murmur made him bend his ear closer may thegods pityus dreamerswhodream the old refrain the first words surely he had heard from her lips but at least she still lived gathering her in his arms he carried her to the divan then knelt supporting her on his breast if she died she should die as a queenin the kings claspupon his throne so there was silence the dawn was coming fast it showed in streaks of shimmering gray light between the dark screens atma there was no sound then suddenly gay lighthearted as a bird a bugle rang out followed by another and another the dying woman stirred thethe dawn has come she whispered to herself and then suddenly as if galvanised to an instants life she sate up and the tent rang with her cry ohi the king the king challenge i bring ohi the kingthe the last word never came in her effort to rise she overbalanced and slipped in a huddled heap at akbars feet he stood quite still he knew that she was dead that nothing but worthless clay lay there the deathless spiritthe dreamer that never dieshad fledwhitherward his way surely so as he stood he felt kingship rise in him as he had neverno not even he the prince of dreamersfelt it before ohi the king the king he stooped gathered the dead thing in his arms and laid it on the low throne he did not even kiss the dead face though the scent of roses clung round her for an instant he felt inclined to take the gift of the wayfarer from her as a remembrance then he remembered himself such things might be for jalaluddin the man he was the king she should take love with her outside the bugle notes were echoing each other merrily through the camp all things were astir with the dawn and he the king was needed elsewhere he called and a servant entered lo i have killed the woman he said pointing to the divan briefly give her fit burning at once ere the sun rise she is sutteeshe hath died for a man so he strode through the screen to the larger tent and gave the signal for the uprising of majesty in a second the huge weighted curtains at the end had swung to their high looped places and advancing he took his seat upon the canopied dais behind them on the far level horizon the pearl gray of dawn was changing to primrose darkening even as it changed to rosyred for dawn comes swiftly in the cloudless skies of india before him thronged with courtiers circled the vast enclosure of the inner audience opening out into a wide avenue wherein drawn up on either side stood soldiers in battalions their spear points struck at the sky for beyond was nothingness only a wide empty plain reaching up to a wide empty sky allahhu akbar the cry rose from a thousand throats akbar was indeed the king his enemies had failed yet there was one thing which must be done before the dawn if all was to be well and birbal looking somewhat crestfallen stepped forward at a signal from the throne behind him came william leedes the jeweller the latter was saying avemarys under his breath partly from pure fear of evil partly from thanksgiving for delivery from evil mirzarajah birbal came the kings voice clear and resonant to be heard of all men deliver up the diamond called the kings luck which was stolen but which the kings charan atma devi hath died to restore birbal started then hung his head deliver it up to the western jeweller william leedes in accordance with the oath by which she bound you then turning to the englishman the royal voice became less stern and youwho are without blametake it once more to thy lathe akbars will hath not changed his luck shall shine aye and his empire shall shineas he chooses let subjects princes friendyeaeven sons say what they may then changing gravity for cheerfulness he called down the line of soldiery gentlemen make ready for your march akbar goes forward he leaves this town of many tears and lack of water behind him for ever as he spoke the curved edge of the sun showed like a star for a second across the waste of desert that stretched as a sea before him and from behind from the darkness of the tents from the shadows of mans habitations came the procession of the hours in rosy pink like dawnclouds the pair of little children no longer wideeyed and solemn danced at the head and behind them radiant with smiles followed the choric singers each with an unlit taper singing the song of the dawn that has been sung in india since the dawn of days manytinted morn th immortal daughter of heaven young whiterobed come with thy purple steeds follow the path of the dawning the world has been given follow the path of the dawn the world still needs from behind came quaint interludes that sounded like the carolling of birds the whisperings of wind among the corn the lowing of cattleall the sounds of waking life upon the earth and three of the taper holders advancing placed a taper one on each side of the dais one in the middle so stood beside it still singing darkly shining dusk thy sister has sought her abiding fear not to trouble her dreams daughters ye twain of the sun dusk and dawn bringing birth oh sisters your path is unending dead are the first who have watched when shall our watching be done once again three taper bearers bore their burdens to the appointed places bright luminous dawn rosered radiant rejoicing show the traveller his road the cattle their pastures new rouse the beasts of the earth to their truthful myriad voicing leader of lightful days softening the soil with dew the semicircle round the dais was almost complete now it needed but three more tapers and once again the voices rose exultant wide expanded dawn open the gates of the morning waken the singing birds guide thou the truthful light to uttermost shade of the shadow for see you the dawning is born whiteshining out of the gloom of the night as one the twelve camphor candles flashed into white light that shone for a second then grew pale and cold as the sun heaving his mighty shoulder out of the dust haze that hung on the horizon flooded the wide earth with his shine there was a pause akbar was about to rise so ending the ceremony when down the wide centre betwixt the serried ranks of the soldiers showed a man he walked slowly his head was bent and on his right arm was knotted a blue handkerchief news of death commented the soldiers quickly recognising the emblemwhose whose asked the courtiers rapidly while akbar stood arrested whose queried birbal quickly he had been busy all night had heard nothing his halfbrother of kabul said abulfazl sadly the runner came in but half an hour agone and this seemed the best way of breaking it the shock will help now heaven be thanked cried birbal not that i do not grievefor the king but this may make his decision less final he must go now for the sake of kingshipbut his dream in red sandstone may see him yet once again lenvoi o gardener wide open the gate of the garden let in the rose from her long winter sleep bid the tall cypress stand sentinelwarden spreading soft shade where the narcissus keep heads drooping down in their slumbering deep bid the shoot harden bid the sap leap gardener array all with manifold flowers figure the garden like damask of old tell of its hues in the turtledoves bowers gild the bare ground with the pansies of gold pomegranate lips stained with wine have you told these are the rose hours nightingale bold lo she returns with budcradle of birth rose of the winehouse she brings to the earth drink to the spring time to love and to mirth nizami four years had passed away and the dream in red sandstone still waited for the dreamer waited as it still waits deserted but not ruined the great arch of victory remaining as birbal had prophesied that which no man having once seen can ever forget but birbal himself had passed into the unknown almost into the forgotten save for his masters undying affection which even after two years still scanned the earthly horizon eagerly looking for news at any rate of his lost friend since birbals actual death is one of those things of which neither past or present hold any knowledge he disappeared in the mountains of swat whither he had gone in the vain effort to translate one of akbars dreams into terms of reality for the great mogul emperor of india had dreams of conquest not by sword not even by religion as his great forerunner the emperor asoka had had in the years before christbut by common sense that is the voluntary submission of the individual to a collective policy which makes for peace and prosperity to the mass of the people deprived of latterday delusions modern foolishnesses akbars dream was socialism not the socialism which proclaims the right of the individual which presses that home against all other considerations but the socialism which sweeps all things individual poverty as well as individual wealth into the great mill of god for the good of the race which holds personal comfort unworthy of consideration it was not perhaps a policy suited to the most turbulent tribes upon the indian frontier still kabul had been annexed almost without a blow kashmir brought into the imperial net by a peaceful demonstration and but for sinde the imperial armies would scarcely have struck a blow during these years of imperial aggrandisement anyhow the experiment one after akbars own heart was tried and birbal went with the forces as a counterpoise to the old commander in chief he was the wellington of akbars reign and his more antiquated methods of suasion they drew lots those two friends of the king abulfazl and birbal which should take the onerous post and the lot fell on birbal it is said that the king hesitated to let him go but behind friendship lay kingship so he went and disputes soon arising between the policy of pike and cannonade as against a mere display of force birbal left in the lurch disappeared for ever with fifteen hundred picked men amid the peaks and passes of the alai mountains it had been a great blow to akbar he had indeed refused to believe in his friends death and still looked for him to returneven if from the other sidein obedience to his promise but now this th of may he was pausing a little below the top of the pir panjal pass on the way to kashmir awaiting the arrival of william leedes the english jeweller who all these years had been engaged in cutting the great diamond of india it was ready now and akbar was eager to see it but the little party escorting the jeweller and his charge had not arrived that morning so akbar had come out alone to a favourite vantage point below the actual snows whence the whole panjab plain rising an almost incredible height in the sky could be seen it was like a shield he thought suddenly as he noted the palpable curve of the horizon higher in the middle lower at the sides that was the curve of the worlds surface of course still it reminded one of the curve of a great shield set between these holy snows of himalya and the world beyond aye for the blue of that distant plain was darker nowhere was lighter nowhere and everywhere alike it was damascened with threadsbroader narrowerof gold the land of the five rivers a fair land indeed a broad battle shield to the rest of india lo there is grandad came a voice from behind him and he turned at the sound of little pattering feet to see his grandson a child of about two stumbling swiftly over the broken ground toward him have a care fairface khushru he called holding out his arms and the child with a laughing crow hurrying still harder almost fell into their shelter truly thou art as two peas in one pod gasped a breathless voice as auntie rosebody completely done by hurrying up the hill flung herself on the ground beside her nephew she looked not a day older with her gray hair stuffed away into a mogul cap her petticoats tucked away into full mogul trousers so had she roamed the hills as a girl with her father babar and now in her old age she set an example to all other ladies of the camp umm kulsum ever her close companion followed on her heels dressed in like manner and stood looking down on the little family party lo nephew at times it takes me said the old lady nodding her head sagely to leave the scapegracewho hath nathless been behaving more reputably of lateout of the bargain altogether the boy is more like jalaluddin mahomed akbar than salim ever was and that is a fact butseeing a frown come to akbars facei am not here to fashion likeness but because here she drew her face into a decent pucker of sorrow having beengod forgive meaye and umm kulsum toopart responsible for its thefttruly nephew your old aunt feels ever about her neck the bowstring that should have been drawn and was not thanks to akbar interrupted her with patient gloom we have talked this out many times oh most reverend aunt after all there was no mischief done he thought ever as he spoke of that arch of victory standing deserted on the sikri ridge but there might have been interrupted aunt rosebody hotly take not penitence from my soul nephew tis good to have sins to repent when one grows old and there are no more to commit so having been in the tale at the beginning akbar looked pathetically at umm kulsum who had sunk to her knees in contrition it is because highness she answered as if to a question the jeweller is arrived and is even now on his way hither akbar sprang to his feet light as a boy dressed in hunting leathers with the close mogul cap crested with a herons plume he looked not a day older though his short hair above his beardless face had grown almost white here he cried and even as he spoke a party of three or four showed rounding the rocky path a few minutes later akbar stood holding the diamond half its original size but brilliant exceedingly in the hollow of his right hand for my part sniffed auntie rosebody i liked it better as it was true it dazzles the eyes but to look at it much would be to court blindness lo it gives me the browache come ummu let us on our way i have promised hamida rhubarbstew to her dinner and we must climb to the snows for that but umm kulsum lingered for consolation since in truth the stone bewildered her true chachaji maternal uncle she said softly i am not clever enough for it there be so many sides and each seemeth different aye that was it so many sides thought akbar as after dismissing the jeweller and his escort for refreshment he sate on that pinnacle of rock almost overhanging the panjab plain and looked at the luck which he had had cut in western fashion his fowling piecefor he had been on his way to one of his long solitary rambleslay beside him and on the polished steel of its lock the brilliant sunshine glinted sending reflected light to touch and make visible the almost microscopic fruition of a tiny lichen on the rock but how much more brilliant was the light that sparkled from the diamond a hundred suns in one no it was a hundred worldsworlds unseen till then what would itwhat might it notwhat ought it not to make manifest so once more as he sate holding his luck in his hands holding it between him and the riverdamascened shield of the wide panjab plain the self that is behind self found eyes and saw what did he see did he see the shield of india stand in the forefront of battle for the principles he preached as it did in mutiny time or did sight pass beyond that and did he see the east intoxicated by the errors of the west aping the horrors of a civilisation which has missed its way which has forgotten that socialism is despotismthe despotism of fate whose eye is fixed not on the equality of the individual but the ultimate outcome of race who knows for as the morning sun rose to power vapoury mistclouds gathered on the damp mountain sides below and crept up and up hiding all things obscuring all things the wide shield of the land of the five rivers went first bit by bit the hurrying mists obscured it the damascening disappeared until high upon the sky only a clear blue curved rim remainedan arch of victory that stretched over the visible world then the mist claimed akbars outstretched hand so rising rolling over on itself almost playing with the short flowerset turf patched here and there with melting snow and nestling into the crannies of the rock it shrouded the king from his kingdom the man from his worldand the dreamer was alone with his dream he was asleep his head resting on a tuft of those tiny blue poppies which grow on the peaks of holy himalyapoppies of heavenly rest whose petals look as if they had been cut from the skywhen aunt rosebodys voice roused him the sun having overcome the mists was shining brightly lo she exclaimed the king hath been delayed no doubt but high up where we were seeking rhubarb it was like the day of resurrection to see the mists tear themselves to shreds in rage as the sun caught them so goes ignorance before wisdom and little fairface hath found his granddad a nargizpresent it child though tis late for a new year offering lo he is the spit of my fatheron whom be peaceno flower escapes him and i have found violets for the king smiled umm kulsum comfortably she was more than ever a mother of plumpness in her stuffed mogul costume pssh commented auntie rosebody scornfully what are flowers to rhubarb and i have enough for two stews so rakiya begum may lay her tartness to thatif she will eat of it though mayhap at her age she hath forgotten her youth as for me twill be a day of resurrection indeed to taste of it again for i have dreamt of it all these years akbar caught up the child with a sudden laugh and setting him astride his shoulders began the descent to the camp below tis as well most reverend he said that some dreamers dream true did he think as he spoke of a woman who had dreamed her dream through to the truth whose hiding place is immortality whose shadow is death perhaps he did perhaps even now on those misty spring mornings when the sun chases the snow vapours over the blue gentians and rosy alpine primulas that edge the snow patches on the peaks of the pir panjal the self that lay behind the self that was called akbar sits enshrouded by the mists and looks out over the empire of the great mogul what does the prince of dreamers think of it f a steel th january

from the verandah of his house in cavendish square that this his lordships daily habit was rather the expression of an ineradicable selfcomplacency than its own justification by results the appearance of the withered old applejohn himself gave testimony for here in truth was a very doyen of dandycocksa last infirmity of fribblesa macaroni with a cuticle so hardened by the paint and powder of near fourscore years as to be impervious to the shafts of ridicule he would blow a kiss along the palm of his palsied hand and never misdoubt the sure flight of this missive though his unmanageable wrist should beat a tattoo on his nose the while he would leer through quizzingglasses of a power to exhibit in horrible accent the rheum of his eyes he would indite musky billetsdoux like meteorological charts to dolly or dorine and forgetting their direction when despatched would simper over the quiddling replies as if they were archly amorous solicitations upon the truth that is stranger than fiction he had looked all his life as upon an outer barbarian the measure of whose originality was merely the measure of uncouthness nature in fact was a dealer of ridiculous limitations art a merchant of inexhaustible surprises vanity he would quote one fifty instances in support of the fact that it was the springhead of all history selfishness was it not the first condition of organic existence makebelieve the whole worlds system of government from royalty to rags was founded upon it therefore he constituted himself understudy to his great prototype of queensberry and therefore he could actually welcome the loss or deterioration of anything bodily and personal for the reason that it presented him with the opportunity to substitute mechanical perfection for natural deficiency perhaps at no period of his life had he so realised his ideal of existence as when upon his seventyseventh year he found himself falseinside and outfrom top to toe death he chuckled will be devilish put to it to stab me in a vital part he said this to his grandnephew the orphaned heirapparent to his title and moderate estates and to nothing else that he valued the young man was indeed his uncles very antithesishis butt his foil his aggravation he the nephew considered no doubt that he held a brief for the other side truth to oneself we will call it and he was never at great pains to disguise his contempt of a certain order of licence cold dry austere he had yet that observant faculty that conceiving of circumstance may fall pregnant with either justice or inhumanity at present from the height of his twentyfive years he looked with a tolerant serenity into the arena of struggling passions this is all vastly foolish was his superior reflection am i destined to make a practice of turning my thumb up or down now on a certain day of he walked into the house in cavendish square and joined his unvenerable elder on the balcony give me the parasol jepps said he i will hold it over lord murks head the man obeyed and withdrew the uncle turned himself about with a little feint of protest well he said resignedly your chacolate makes a pretty foil to my azure and if you must dress like an attorneys clerk you hev at least the unspeakable satisfaction of posing as background to a gentleman his glasses dangled from his neck by a broad black ribbon he lifted them as he spoke and conned a passing face egad said he involuntarily extending his left hand as if to deprecate interruption what a form what a ravishing and seductive elegance strake me ned but if thou wert other than a branstuffed jackalent id send thee thither to canvass for me he scratched his chin testily with one from several little cockedhat notes that lay on a chair at his side his fingers were steeped to the knuckles in gems his cheeks plastered with chalk and rouge looked in texture like the dinted covering of honeycomb now and again he would shoot at his young relative a covert glance of extreme dislike rat thee ned he exclaimed suddenly thou hast a devilish face tis no index to my character then sir i can assure you you neednt egad theres a shrewd measure of reserve in these matters show me a face thats an index and ill show you an ass but id like to learn as a mere question of curiasity why you persist in dressing like a cit eating at beef ordinaries and sleeping at some demned low tavern over against the cock and pye ditch sure sir in this connection at least youll grant me the authority of fashion fashion paris fashion franklin fashion but its not for the heir to an english viscountcy to model himself on a yankee tallowchandler i model myself on the principles of independence sir principles quotha why od rat me ned you make me sick principles of independence are like other principals i presumeclamorous for high rates of interest i think not indeed do you indeed but youre a convert to the new religion and rabid of course and a mighty pretty set of priests youve got to expound you your gospels who for an instance the uncle leered round viciously when he was moved to raise his voice old age piped in him like winter in an empty house i dont know why i call you ned he protested peevishly i dont feel it and it fits you worse than your cravat who for an instance mr edward murk why a defaulting exciseman for one a reskel by the name of paine that writ a pamphlet on common sense to prove himself devoid of it according to the point of view oh i cry you pardon sir i judge from a less exalted one than this patriarch of principles here but voltairediderot my lord gads my life and now you hev me a school of incontinent rakes to reform the warld and not a man of em i vow but had drained his last glass of pleasure before he set to disparaging the feast the nephew was silent what indeed would it profit him to answer he looked with a passionless scrutiny at the face so near his own he could have thought that the old wood the old block had shrunk beneath its veneer and he had an odd temptation to prod it with his finger and see if it would crackle oxford snapped his lordship is the very marketgarden of selfsufficiency thou needst a power of weeding nephew oh its possible sir only i would clear the ground myself indeed and how would you set about it by observing and selecting that is all by forming independent judgments uninfluenced by the respect of position by assuming continence and sobriety to be the first conditions of happiness by analysing impressions and restraining impulse by studying what to chip away from the block out of which i intend to shape my own character with the world for model i see i see a smug modest programme i faith id not have thy frogs blood ned though it meant another twenty years of life to me and so youll do all this before you step into my shoesand may the devil wedge them on thy feet you are bitter sir i think perhaps you misconstrue me im no fanatic of prudery but an earnest student of happiness were i to convince myself that yours was the highest expression of this i would not hesitate to become your convert id not ask thee thou chilly put hadst thou been my son twere different but thoust got thine independent jointure and thoult go thy waysover the continent as i understandnot making the grand tour like a gentleman of position but joggling it in diligences faugh or stumping on thy soles like a demned brawny pedlar and what is to be thy equipment for the adventure a fair knowledge of french a roll of canvas and a case of colours cry you mercy sir id forgat you were an artist wilt thou paint me some naked women ay sir and see no pleasant shame in it ned nedgive me a hope of thee oh sir believe me tis only when woman begins to clothe herself that indelicacy is suggested a hat a pair of shoes a shoulderstrap even would have made a jillflirt of godiva hmph looked at from my standpoint thats the first commendable thing thoust said but its a monstrous ungentlemanly occupation ned and that no doubt is the reason that moves thee to it no sir but the reason that a painter more than another has the opportunity to arrest and record for private analysis what is of its nature fugitive and perishable his canvases indeed should be his textbook his confessor and his mentor oh spare me parson thou shalt go cully my neighbour here with thy plaguey texts theyll fit him like a skin glove what neighbour sir him that sold his brush to charlie grevilles mistress a grim little toadromney by namethat my lord thurlow pits against reynolds for something better than a whores signpainter well sir doubtless the man will learn to read himself in his work and to profit by the lesson master ned parson when do you go it cannot be too soon for me i may start at any moment heaven be praised and whither possibly by way of the low countries at the outset will your lordship give me some letters of introduction what your independence doesnt strake at that you greatly misapprehend me sir i go to seek mental not bodily discipline chastisement as a forcing medium ceases of its effect with the second age of reason and that you have come to i presume go to the low countries i gads name and find your level there ill give you fifty recommendations and trust to procure you a years hospitality from each only one word in your ear ned if you bring back a prig to wife ill hev the two of ye poisoned if i hang for it the nephew condescended to a smile of some amused toleration my marriage when it occurs said he will mark a simple period in the evolution of my character that it may be easily understood might require a foil to its processes of development as a hen swallows gravel to assist her digestion you need feel no surprise sir if in the end i marry a properly wicked woman egad tis my devout hope you will and that shell brain you with that demned encyclopedia that you get all your gallimaufry about equality from call back jepps and ill dictate the letters chapter ii on a supremely hot noon of august mr edward murk walking leisurely along a road pounded and compounded of small coal came down towards the ancient city of lige and paused at a vantagepoint to take in the prospect this was a fair enough one to any vision and fair in the extreme to eyes so long drilled to the interminable perspectives of flandersto loveless dykes to canals like sleek ingots of glass to stretched ribbons of highways tapering to a flat horizonas that a tumulus would seem as sweet a thing for them to rest on as a womans bosom now his sight reining up against hills gave him a certain emotion of surprise such as he might have felt if a familiar hunter had unexpectedly shied at a hedgerow he stood a little above the town looking over and beyond it in the middledistance of his picturepulled into the soft arms of hills that melting to their own embrace became mere swimming banks of mistfloated a prismatic blot of waterthe vista of the meusedinted like an opal with shadowy reflections and lit with sudden sparks in dreamy places thence nearer a greystone bridgeits arches glazed he could have thought with motherofpearl windows like a chinese model in ivorybestrode the river channel seeming to dam back against his foreground an accumulated litter of wall and roof and gable that choked the town reaches and breaking away piecemeal stranded its jetsam all down the valley here and there fair steeples stood up from the litter here and there in his close neighbourhood gaunt chimneystocks exhaled a languid smoke like tree trunks blasted in a forest fire some distance to his left a pretty lofty eminence that broke at its summit into a fret of turret and escarpment stood sentinel over the ages while below this and nearer at hand the great block of an episcopal palace sprouted from a rocky plateau the velvet slopes of which trailed downwards into the very hands of the city the bishop and his trainbearers thought mr murk the town holds up the skirts of the palace that must all be changed byandby but i confess i should like to record a little of the picturesqueness of life before the roller of equality is dragged over the continents he had out his tools then and there and essayed to give some expression to his mood the sun crackled in his brain a pug of a child in a scarlet linsey petticoat came and sniffed beside him offending his ears and his eyes a dawdling cart mounting the hill lurched into his perspective and blotted out its details foot by foot down below in his farther foreground a cluster of buildings lying under a churchtower in a bath of shadow invited him as if to a plunge into cool waters he glanced crossly at the obtrusive child collected his traps and strode down the hill at its foot however he seemed to come upon the actual furnacefloor of noona broad place that bickered as it were throughout its length with iridescent embers these were figured in crates of russian cranberries glowing like braziers in pomegranates bleeding fire in burning globes of oranges in apricots pearlypink as balls of whitehot glass and over all the long looped awnings of olive and stoneblue and cinnamon served to the emphasising of such a galaxy of hot dyes as made a core of flame in the heart of the blazing city the close air prickled with a multitudinous patter of voices like blisters of fat breaking on a grill old burgundian housesbaked to a terrasienna drowzing and nodding as they took the warmth about their kneesretained and multiplied the heat like the walls of an oven the shop windows were so many burningglasses the marketwomen fried amongst their cabbages like bubbleandsqueak the very dogs of draught hauling their gridirons of carts had redhot cinders for tongues there seemed in the whole width of the square no shadow of which a devil could have taken solace exhaling some little of the breath that remained to him in an appropriately volcanic interjection ned mounted the steps of the church he had looked down upon brushed past the outstretched hand of a flyblown beggar and dived into the sequestered obscurity of amberscented aisles here the immediate fall of temperature took him by the throat like a showerbath if i shiver he thought there is a goose walking over my grave so he stood still and hugged himself till his blood was accommodated to the change then he penetrated into the heart of the place he had visited many churches in the course of his travels dispassionately but with no irreverence it interested him no less to note the expressions of faith than of faces generally it seemed to him religious ideals were not transmissible there was seldom evidence that the spirit that had conceived and executed some noble monument yet informed its own work through tradition the builders of cathedrals wrought it was obvious for little clans that through all the ages had never learned the respect of soul they the latter had stuffed their heritages with trash because their religion must come home to them in the homely sense they could not think but that the god of their understanding must be gratified to have his houses adorned after the fashion of the best parlour now to see a fine interior vulgarised by the introduction of barbaric images of artificial flowers and of pictures hung in incongruous places offended mr murk as a fooling elephant in a circus offended him he recognised and condemned the solecism in the present instance yet at the same time was conscious of an atmosphere foreign to his accustomed experiencean atmosphere so like the faint breath of a revived paganism that he looked about him in wonder to see whence it emanated there could be however no doubt as to its source the whole church was a grove of orange oleander and myrtle trees they stood in tubs filling the intercolumniations of the stone avenues climbing the steps of the altar thronging about the pulpit the quiet air held their fragrance like smoke they could fatten and bloom unvexed of any wind but the sweet gales blown from the organ and even as ned looked this wind rose and wooed them some one was at the keys and the soft diapasons flowed forth and rolled in thunder along the roof the young man strolled down the nave music of itself held no particular charms for him its value here was in its subscription to other influencesto the cool perfume of flowers to the sense of serene isolation to the feeling of mysticism engendered of foggy vastness traversed by the soft moted dazzle of sunbeams such spanning gulfs of shadow propping the gross mechanism of the organ itself seemed the very fabric of which the floating harmonies were compound there needed only a living expression of this poem of mingled scent and sound and colour and to ned this was vouchsafed of a sudden in a luminous corner he came upon where a painted statue of the virgin standing sentry in a niche looked down upon a figure prostrate before it in devotion a little lamp burning with a motionless light like a carbuncle was laid at the mothers feet about her shoulders suspended from the neighbouring walls were a halfdozen certificates of miracles approuvsdecorated placards recording the processes and dates some of them quite recent of extraordinary recoveries one of these related how to a marie cornelis was restored the sight of an eye that had been skewered by a thorn faith here had at least made its appeal in a sure direction who could forget how that other woman had worn a crown of thorns about her heart now the gazer would have liked to know what manifestation of the supernatural was craved by the young girl fair and quiet as the image itself who knelt before the shrine she this dvote reverencing with her mouth pressed to the clasped knuckles of her hands had so much of the madonna in her own appearance as to suggest that she might perform rather than demand miracles her eyesned fancied but could not convince himselfwere closed as in a rapture of piety she was very pure and colourless apart from an accidentalism of tinted rays for over her soft brown hair from which a folded chaperon of white linen had slipped backwards wings of particoloured light entering through a stained window played like butterflies lower down the violet haze that slept upon her cheek gave her something of a phantasmal character but her fingers were steeped in crimson as if they were bloody at her side knelt a little lad five or six years of age with a most wistful small face expressive of as great a humility of weariness as the girls was of worship he looked at the stranger with curiosity and with the dumb appeal of the petty to the great and independent and as he looked he lifted one after the other his poor chafed knees and rubbed them his round pale eyes were underscored for emphasis of this appeal but without effect on mr murk who had indeed no fondness for children presently the girl rose with the action the wings of light fled from her hair her passionless face revealed itself a sunless white fruit there was no consciousness of the observant stranger under her lowered lids viens donc baptiste she whispered and the little boy gazing up at her in a breathless manner got to his feet the two genuflected to the high altar and stole reverently from the building mr murk followed immediately he had a desire to win into the confidence of this butterfly madonna outside he saw the girl and child go down into the blazing market as into a lake of fire giving them fair law he started in pursuit arrived at the level he found he had for the moment lost sight of his quarry he strolled up and down gathering what shade he could from the awnings voluble marketwomen waxing tropically gross in their vegetable hotbeds rallied him on his insensibility to their cajolery stolid flemish farmers with great pipes pendulous from their mouths like tongues lolling and smoking with drought winked to one another as he passed in appreciation of the rich joke that here was a foreigner the gentler classes it seemed were all in siesta low life vehement motley and picturesque held the square as if it were a fortress under fire now whether as a consequence or in spite of this gregal plebeianism a strange unusual atmosphere ned fancied was abroad in the town he had been conscious of a similar atmosphere in other cities he had visited en route and of an increase in its density in steady ratio with his march southwards it was not to be defined it might have been called an inflection rather than any expression like the change of note in the respiration of a sleeper who is near waking it only seemed to him that he moved in an element compounded of shadowsthe shadow of watchfulness the shadow of insolence the shadow of an evil humour cursing its own centurylong blindness the shadow of a more wickedly merry humour rallying itself upon that old desperate screwingup of its courage to attack a boggart blunderbore that had fallen to pieces at the first stroke the shadow embracing all others of a certain freemasonry that was deadlily exclusive in the opposite to a conventional sense and this is for no dispassionate soul to resent thought mr murk who as a child had set his feet square upon the basis of an independent impartiality and at the first age of reason had pledged himself to forego impulse as being the aboveproof of ardent spirits and fatal to sobriety now he admitted to himself jacques bonhomme is simply awaking to knowledge of the fact that he may boast a familytree as thickhung as his lords with evil fruit and that he was not spawned of the mud because no record exists of his grandfather byandby strolling down a little court he turned into a wineshop for a draught to his dusty throat he drank his maon mixing it with water in a tiny room off the tap of the auberge and while he was drinking the sound of a low vehement voice in the street brought him to the window he looked out it was his very madonna of the butterflies and presented under a new aspect her hands were at the neck of the child she was rating him in voluble viraginian the poor rogue sobbed and protested but he would not loose his grip of something of which she strove to possess herself ptit dmon she gabbledbut i will have it i say it is no use to weep and struggle give it me baptisteah but i will no no cried the boy it is mineit has always been mine thou shalt not nicette she so far secured the bone of contention as to enable ned for a moment to recognise its nature it was a silver medala poor devotional charm strung round the infants neck the child by an adroit movement recovered possession she looked about her unconscious of the observer as if safe from interruption she would have dared torture and maltreatment then suddenly she fell to wheedling babouin little babouin wilt thou not make this sacrifice for thine own loving nicette who is so poor so poor little babouin because of the small brother she keeps and feeds and clotheswilt thou not no cried the child again half hysterical it is mineit was blessed by the holy father but the guava baptiste the sweet red jelly in the little box i have eaten of it once before and oh baptiste it is like the fruit that tempted the first mother and it so seldom comes to market and i have not a sou and before next wageday all may be appropriated wilt thou not then mon poulet mon ptit poulet but the poulet only repeated his tearful pipe thou shalt have thy share pleaded the girl i swear it i should not sobbed baptiste thou wouldst eat up all my medal and it was blessed by le saint pre ned peering forth saw his madonna jerk erect her eyelids snapping give me thy hand then she said in a cold little voice thou shalt walk back to mricourt all the way and have thy medal to supper at the end give me thy hand the child cried out when she took it ned showed himself at the window nicette he said with particular softness i will exchange thee a louisdor for one single little confidence of thine the girl started looked round and stared at the speaker in breathless consternation a bright spot of colour like pink light caught from an opal waxed and waned on her cheek how monsieur she muttered ned held out the coin here is a surfeit of guava jelly said he if thou wilt tell me what was the miracle thou cravedst of the holy mother yonder he knew watching her face that she would reject the condition and that with all suitable decorum but he saw the pupils of her eyes dilate at sight of the gold piece monsieur it seems said she can better afford to jest than i to accept insultand she hurriedly caught at her charges hand and drew the child away mr murk with plentiful complacency paid for his wine and sauntered in pursuit at a particular fruitstall he saw his peasant madonna linger a moment hesitate and then go on her way with an uptoss of her chin he came to a stop and considered mricourt but i have an introduction to monsieur de st denys of mricourt how far i wonder this nicette would make an admirable study to an artist i will go to mricourt chapter iii facing an opulent sunset ned made his way some three or four miles out of lige through scenery whose very luxuriance affected him like the qualmish aftermath of excess it gave him a feeling of surfeitof committal to a debauch of colour that it was no part of his temperament to indulge if his soul had attached itself to any theory of beauty it was to a theory of orderliness and sobriety that took account of barbaric dyes but to set them to an accordant pattern its genius was of an adaptive rather than an imaginative bent it desired to shape his world to man not man to his worldto appropriate the accidents of nature to the uses of a wholesomely picturesque raceto emasculate the bull of violence by withdrawing from its very experience the hues of crimson and orange on any display of passion this young man looked with cool dislike his instincts were primarily for the gratification of the understanding the premeditated involutions of fancy did not engage his sympathies the mystery of brooding distances peopled with irisated phantoms of the hazy wanderings of the undefined he was not greatly concerned to penetrate claude he would have preferred to turner and nasmyth to either fuseli he already detested and blake was his very bte noire things rude boisterous and ugly he would wish to crush under a heel of iron thinking to enforce the peacerather after the fashion of his timesby breaking it but he would raise not level the world to an equalitywould make out of its material a very handsome model in which the steeples should clang and the waterwheels turn and the seasons pulsate by a mechanism common to all such was his creed of eventual reconstruction of a social fabric the downfall of which was much predicted of the jeunesse politique of the day and in the meanwhile he was very willing to acknowledge himself to be in the condition of incomplete moral ossificationto be travelling indeed for the sake of bone and gristle and in order to convert the misuses of other characters to the profit of his own now he advanced with a certain feeling of enforced intemperance upon a prospect of superabundant beauty the great noontide heat was become a salt memory to be tasted only for emphasis of the bouquet of that velvety wine of air that poured from the heights distant hills ran along an amber sky like the shadows of nearer ones far away a jagged keep surmounting a crag stood out deep umber from a basin in the valley brimming with blue mist closer at hand a marrowy white stream sliding noiseless over the crest of a slope silhouetted against the northern vaults seemed the very running band drawn from the heavens to keep the earth spinning the grasshopper shrilled in the roadside tangle comfortable doves drowsing amongst the chestnut leaves exchanged sleepy confidences sometimes the clap of a cowbell sometimes the hollow call of a herdsman thrilled the prosperous calms of light as a dropped stone scatters a water image these were the acuter accents on a tranquillity that no thought could wound at last when the sun flamed upon the horizon like a burning house of the zodiac the traveller came through a deep woodpath upon the village he sought and was glad to see dusk mantling its gables and blotting out the red lights of the open valley in which it lay if madame van roon keeper of the hostel landlust cut her coat according to her cloth she should have been in affluent circumstances daniel lambert might have furnished her his vest a couple of dragoons their cloaks for skirt this proceeding from a mighty roll of paddinga veritable stuffed bolsterthat circled her unnamable waist swayed in one piece like a divingbell in a current with her every movement her stays hooped with steel after the dutch mode would have hung slack on a kilderkin the lobes of her fat ears stretched under the weight of a pair of positive little censers but the finished pride of her was her cap a wonder of stiff goffering against the erect border of which her red face lay like a ham on a dishpaper with so full a presence she had only to stand in a doorway if inclined to argument and not so much as a minor postulate could evade her questce que cest doncg cette manire de moogsieur l she gasped at our gentleman with a choking shrillness mais o est vgtre valetaille vgtre quipage she quarrelled gutturally like an envious stepmother with the speech of her adoption i am in my own service madame said ned in no small wonder and that is to own the best master a man can have she slapped the threepartitioned moneypouch that hung at her middle oo ay she gurgled truculently and a fine master of economy ill be bound ned for short argument fished out a palmful of pieces she admitted him grudgingly even then but the young man was completely satisfied this is excellent tonic he thought after an enervating experience in mricourt it seems there is food for study he appeared to have struck a sort of francoflemish neutral ground he was put to wait in a little kitchen like a bright toy the floor was ruddy brick the walls were white tiles outside the window a shallow awning tinkled sleepily in spasms of draught with the stirring of innumerable small bells the stove or range a shining cold example of continence seemed innocent of the least tradition of heat on the polished dark dresser vessels of copper of pewter and of brassstewpans lidded flagons and the narrownecked woodstoppered resonant jugs in which it was the dutch fashion to bring milk from the fieldsshone with a demure sobriety of tone in the falling light but the meal when it came was served in the french manner and without stint the traveller seeing no preparations toward in the spick room he inhabited was falling into a mood of gentle depression before his fears were dissipated then he ventured an inquiry of the solemn wench who brought in his tray she almost dropped the load in her amazement holy saints cook here in the show kitchen she put down with crushing emphasis a fresh tablenapkin a small blunt knife a silver fork and a silver spoonall la franaise this was luxury as compared with recent experiences ned looked serious over the knife he did not know that french meat stewed to the meltingpoint dismembers itself at a touch he had a very succulent salmis and no fewer than four hot eggs cuddled in a white clout were served to him am i to devour them all he asked of the girl with the help of god she answered ambiguously in her soft picardian byandby madame lhtesse condescended to come and talk with him while he ate she was veritably charge de cuisine she seemed to fill the place width and height what is your condition in your own country she asked with fat asperity i am grandnephew to a monseigneur to whose title and estates i shall succeed vraigment she clucked incredulously how arrives it then that you pad the hoof like a colporteur i travel for discipline and for experience madame wisdom is not an heirloom she nodded her head truly it must be bought i myself am a merchant of it doubtless said mr murk witness your politeness to one who can afford to pay for politeness she seemed an atom disconcerted well she said there is no accounting for the vagaries of the quality and is his meal to moogsieurs liking it is very well indeed tout va biend i was in the half mind that you would wish your meat raw langlaise that is not the english fashion oh pardon they tear it with their hands and teeth for i know and sometimes it is worse how worse then she nodded again pregnantly vampires they will prey on the lowly of their kind oh it is infamous my cousin le bon gaspard saw a dish of theirs once in barbadele maure dans le bain they called ita slaves head served in sauce this will be unknown to moogsieur unquestionably it is possible it is possible also that gentlemen who travel incognito may learn some vulgar truths i accept your ignorance in proof of your aristocracy those who sit in high places look only at the stars you alarm me madame indeed i remember now that in my country it is possible to procure for eating ladies fingers oh the barbarians is it not as i said ned rose may i suggest to madame that i have not yet seen my bedroom platil doncg if it will give you any gratification but there is company there at present the gentleman stared madame van roon backed from the doorway gave an inaudible direction and disappeared the solemn girl took her place by permission of monsieur she said and ned followed her out of the room she led him down one short passage straight into the practicable kitchen a rather melodious sound of singing greeted him on the threshold he stopped in considerable wonder postponing his entrance while he listened little lady dormette hark to my crying would not you come to me though i were dying little lady dormette kiss my hot eyes make me forget little lady dormette why have you left me sure not to lie with him that hath bereft me little lady dormette oh do not kiss him lest he forget little lady dormette thee i so grieve for if thou forsakest me what shall i live for little lady dormette crush thy heart to mine make it forget the voice was small sweet emotional but a mans the soft throb of a guitar accompanied it all bespoke a certain melting effeminacy that was disagreeable to ned he pushed open the door however made his salutation and stood to take stock of his surroundings here in truth was revealed the working heart of the modelthe stokehole of that vessel of which the outer room exhibited but the polished bearings the fat air was heavy with the smell of lately cooked food the pots the trenchers the waste parings that had served to the preparation of the latter were even now in huddled process of removal by a panting cuisinire with whom the company present did not hesitate to exchange a droppingfire of badinage a foul litter of vegetable and other rubbish disgraced the white deal of the tablecabbage leaves and broken eggshells and a clump of smoking bones in the scuttle was a mess of turnip peelings on the hearth an iron pail brimming with gobbets of grease and coffeegrounds and the severed head of a cock a dutchmans cleanliness thought ned and he had some experience of it is like the elf maids face a particularly hollow mask he reeks fustian while he washes his windows three times aday the room was long and low with black beams to its ceiling from which hung bushes of herbs a steaming scullery opened from it on the fire side on the other against the distempered wall stood a row of curtained cupboards halfadozen of them like confessionalboxes and in the intervals of these were perched on brackets five or six absurd little figuressaints and virgins the latter with smaller dolls to represent the christ pinned to their stomachers there was but a single window to this kitchen at its far end and a couple of lamps burning rancid oil seemed the very smoking nucleus of an atmosphere as stifling as that of a ships caboose in the tropics a figure seated on the table struck a tinkling cord as ned advanced and sang up a little impertinent stave of welcome behold endymion wakes from latmus said he and flourishing a great flagon of wine to his mouth he tilted it and drank he was a smoothcut young fellow with features modelled like a girls his hair his brows the shade on his upper lip toned from brown to rough gold his eyes were soft umber his cheeks flushed sombrely like autumn leaves he was as assured of himself as a gillian and a little theatrical withal in his pose and the cock of his hat there were two others in companya serene large man with deliberate lids to his eyes and straight long hair and a roundfaced sizar from the university of lige these latter smoked and all three drank according to their degree of wine hollands or brandyandwater you flatter me monsieur said ned a trifle grimly and he sat himself down by the table and returned with a pretty hardihood the glances directed at him for some moments no one spoke the placid mana prosperous farmer by token of his buttonbestrewed jacket and substantial smallclothsput a piece of sugarcandy in his mouth and drank down his glass of hollands over it in serial sips the student looking to him on the table for his cue sat with the expression of a chorister whom a comrade secretly tickles mr murk felt himself master of the situation so long as he resisted the temptation to be the first to break the silence suddenly the young man with the guitar unbonneted himself kicked his hat up to the ceiling gave an insane laugh on a melodious note and turned to the newcomer i surrender said he i would rather lack wine than speech both are good in moderation said ned bah a monks aphorism monsieur moderation makes no history it is to grow fat under ones figtreelike lambertine here he signified the contented farmer who chuckled and shut his eyes and what of the wise ulysses quoth ned he saved himself for the orgy cried the stranger he was moderate only that he might taste the full of enjoyment i go with you there not with me indeed no of course there are blindworms amongst men for me i swear that human life has an infinite capacity for pleasure he took another great pull at his pot and laughed foolishly his face was ruddy and his eyes glazed with drink you were singing when i came in said ned dont let me interrupt you the student sniggered the cuisinire sniggered the farmer waved a tolerant hand you see said the musician we make no business here of any mans convenience but our own i shall sing if i want to he twitched the strings with some loose defiance and swerved into a little vacant amorous song does that please you he asked at the finish it neither pleases nor disgusts me said ned it is simply not worth considering you must not say that said the roundfaced student mr murk turned upon him gravely i am a foreigner sir as you see said he i come amongst you to enlarge my experience and to correct a certain insular habit of prejudice to this end i use a sketchbook and sometimes i paint portraits i shall have the honour of depicting you as a starling oh eh said the student that is funny and why it feeds on the leavings of my lord the rook said ned the farmer chuckled heartily and the musician burst into a wobble of laughter i am the rook he criedi am milord the rook you are a man of penetration monsieur and i take you to my heart he endeavoured to do so literally and fell flat off the table on the top of his guitar which he smashed to pieces and then he composed himself to slumber on the floor and in a minute was snoring he acts up to his creed said the farmer in a tone of unruffled admiration you must not misjudge him monsieur the artist m de st denys is generous to a fault st denys is that m de st denys the other swang his large head it is so his reputation extends itself it would appear he makes himself a name beyond mricourt for the most liberal principles liberal to excess indeed the student ventured again he illustrates what he professes an infinite capacity for piggishness no monsieur but to extend the prerogatives of pleasure to set the example of a cultivated licence that the canaille may learn to elevate itself to the higher hedonism ned had nothing to say to this boozy ethology the other two chorused crapulous praise of the fallen musician he is the soul of honour said the farmer who seemed a man of simple ideas he devotes himself his oratory his purse to the cause of intellectual emancipation cried the student and what does his father m de st denys say to all this asked ned lambertine shook his perplexed head the student humoured a little snigger of deprecation there is no father said he m de st denys the younger reigns at the chteau mricourt i see you sneer monsieur it is natural for a victim of insular despotism here the prospect widensthe atmosphere grows fresh you will not have heard of it no but it is true that there is a sound in the air monsieur i will not be sneered at and what is to be the upshot of it all inquired ned ignoring the protest according to m de st denys a universe of gentlemen he is at the same time the soul of honour said lambertine well said mr murk i think i will go to bed he appealed to the cook who still fussed among her pans with a look of puzzled inquiry she answered sourly you can take your pick there are plenty to choose from it was then he discovered to his profound astonishment that the confessionalboxes were sleepingplaces to the use of one of which he was unblushingly invited in the very face of his company well thought he i am travelling for experience and he took his knapsack chose that cupboard nearest the window and farthest from the table and withdrawing himself behind the curtains undressed folded and laid his clothes aside and philosophically composed himself to slumber on a little bed that smelt of onions conditions were not favourable to rest the heat was suffocating the atmosphere unspeakable in the distance the voices of his late companions droned like hornets in a bottlesometimes swelled it seemed into a thick passion of tearfulness without brooded an apoplectic silence broken only by a spasmodic rumbling sound that might have signified dogs or cattle or indeed nothing more than the earth turning in its sleep or the rolling heavenwards of the wheel of the moon now and then some winged creature would boom past the window its vibrant note dying like the voice of a faroff multitude now and again the seething rush of a bat would seem to stir up the very grounds of stagnation suddenly a heartwrung voice spoke up outside his curtain monsieur i am not to be laughed at bear that in mind there followed a sound of sobbingof footsteps unsteadily receding and thereafter a weary peace was vouchsafed the traveller and he dreamed that he was put to bake in the selfsame oven that had provided his supper that is a fine economy he heard the cook sayto roast the rooster the words troubled him excessively he thought them instinct with a dreadful humourtoo diabolically witty to admit of repartee and so lapped in despondency oblivion overtook him chapter iv writhing as it were from the edges to a central core of heat ned woke to find himself wriggling like an eel in a bath of dripping he sat up in his dingy cupboard and feeling and seeing a slant of sunlight blazing through its curtains plunged for the open and breathed out a fainting sigh of relief shrill murmur of voices from a distance came to him but the kitchen stalely redolent of washhouses was deserted of all save himself a puddingbasin on a magnified milkingstoolpresumably a washhandstandwas placed in a corner and thereat he fretted out an ablution that was a mere aggravation of drought then he dressed himself with a sort of fierce and defiant daring rather hoping to be taken to task for some intolerable solecism in his rendering of local customs he was disappointed the solemn girl came into the kitchen when he was but halfway through his toilet and without exhibiting the least interest in his condition set to preparing and serving his breakfast byandby he seated himself at the table i am sorry to have kept you out of the room he said with superfluous sarcasm i do not understand she said indifferently at least you will know now how a gentleman dresses it is possible she said but if i were one i should put on my shirt first well said he where is m de st denys she stared at him like a cow but it was the provoking part of her that she would not avert her gaze when he returned it where said she if not at the chateau he recovered his feet then it would seem his feet oh mon dieu they were not lost what questions monsieur are they not and who now is this lambertine he is lambertinea farmer very prosperous of mricourt with whom the lord of the manor consorts m de st denys then is not fastidious in his choice of company truly even you need not hesitate to address him if that is what you mean he listens to all alike he holds himself a human being like the rest of us when he walks in the sun he will not think his shadow longer than that of another man of his height and he is the soul of honour essentially monsieur he would extend the right of an equal indulgence in pleasure to all ah ma chrie said ned calmly how you must love him that is of necessity said the girl he has lowered himself to make us do so ned ate a very large and deliberate breakfast and then issued forth into the village carrying his letter of introduction with him this st denys he thought has been reading diderot and the encyclopedia has he also theories of reconstruction my uncle would not think it amusing that his letter should so miscarry a little breeze had risen blowing from the south it made the heat more tolerable and it was the begetter of a pretty tableau by the village fountain for there with her pitcher set on the wellrim stood a bright hebe of the sun ripe warm and glowing as the very fruit of desire now she had put her hands back under her freefalling hairthat was thick and pheasant brown and wavy like a spanielsand had lifted it sagging that the cool air might blow under and comfort the roots she was a fullbosomed wench and the pose threw her figure into energetic and very graceful relief ned who was really passionless and responsive only to the artistic provocation went up to her at once i should like to draw you like that said he she twitched involuntarily but with immediate intuition maintained her posture and conned him from under languorous lids how monsieur said she exactly as you are i have my tools with me i beg you to do nothing but just breathe and enjoy life actually before she could deny him he was sketching her then suddenlywatching first the quick travelling of his pencilshe lowered her arms and like a foolish virgin extinguished the light of inspiration i think you are very impertinent she said if beauty said he calmlyfor he had secured the essentials of his picturewill distribute largesse it must not be surprised to see it scrambled for the girls lips parted as if the fairy bee were probing there for honey what insolence she murmured am i then beautiful but perhaps monsieur sees his own image reflected in my eyes and falls in love with it like the damoiseau narcisse she showed the slightest rim of white teeth it was as if the bow of her mouth revealed itself strung with silver her eyes when open floated with deep amber lights her cheeks were sweet warm beds dimpled by loves elbow she was full of bold rich contrasts of coloura young vestal flaming into the lust of life ned was a little surprised to hear a peasant girl as he thought her imaging from mythology i never fall in love he said gravely not even with myself the girl laughed out putting her arms defiantly akimbo then i would not be a suitor there she said to me and why not because no man ever loved a woman well that did not love himself better she took her sunbonnet and pitcher from the low wall i have heard of such as you she said it is to make your art your mistress is it not yes said ned come and see why he held the sketch out to her he had been working at it all the time he talked little holy mother she murmured after a vain attempt to repress her curiosity is that i is it not he said and would not you love an art that enabled you so to record impressions of beauty it is an impression my faith am i black and white like a spectre where are my brown hair and my red cheeks ned tapped his breastpocket in your heart monsieur in my paintbox mademoiselle well she said they may remain there for me i shall never come to claim them you had best not he said it is full of ghosts that might frighten or repel you she was moving away when she stopped suddenly look who comes she cried low there is the pretty subject for your pencil the fountain stood at the village head on ground somewhat raised above the wide street or place round which the hamlet was gathered not a soul seemed to be abroad in the hot sleepy morning the jalousies of twenty small houses were closed the groundhaze boiled up a fair mans height as seen against any dark background the tower of the little white church looked as if its very peaked cap of lead were melting and sinking over its eyesan illusion grotesquely accented by the exclamatory expression of the arrowslit of a window underneath there was scarce a sound even to emphasise the stillnessthe tinkle of a running gutter the drowsy weak ring of iron on a distant anvilthese were all mricourt lay sunk in panting slumber in the lap of its woods its chimneypots gasping at an inexorable sky but now there came towards and past the fountain from a hidden meadow path a second girl who bore upon her head gracefully poising it a fragrant bundle of clover young forest shoots and tufted grasses under the shadow of which her face was blurred as soft and luminous as a face in tender crayons it is a picture said ned it is half a saint said the girl then she cried in her flexible rich voice hol nicette i shiver here in a colder shadow than thine nicette muttered ned and he scrutinised the passing figure more closely how throigne answered back the other without slackening her pace or turning her head there runs a new spring in mricourt cried the girl with an impudent glance at the young man but a new spring and how dost thou know my little finger told me it has veins of ice nicette thou needst not scruple to bathe in it for all thy modesty the cloverbearer passed on with a little ambiguous laugh and she is a saint said ned half a saint by monsieurs permissiona sweet bonchrtien with one cheek to the sun and one to the convent wall and presently to fall of her own sweetness no doubt to his surprise the girl drew herself up haughtily at his words you exceed the bounds of insolence monsieur she said frigidly it is like blasphemy so to speak of nicette legrand and what authority has monsieur for his statement how can i have any throigne but your own show of levity towards me she seemed about to retort angrily changed her mind shouldered the pitcher and turned to go at least said ned have the goodness to first direct me to the chteau mricourt she twisted about sharply the chateau what do you seek there only my friend m de st denys your friend she conned his face seriously then suddenly her own lightened once more of a truth she said i would rather be your friend than your lover love is much on your lips mademoiselle you should say he shows his pretty judgment but nicette has the mouth of austerity follow her then she will have no need to rebuke you ill warrant there is some contempt in your voice mademoiselle is not that to give yourself a little the lie how monsieur but now you chid me for speaking lightly of this very nicette she has a better grace than i perhaps to care for herself i mean only she will lead you whither you desire to the chateau she keeps the lodge at its gates she frowned nodded her head and went off with a little mocking song on her lips turning down a side track that led to farm buildings she was a lithe voluptuous animal breathing a lavish generosity of life ned watched her in a sort of rigor of admiration as she retreated a high stone wall pierced at regular intervals with loopholes enclosed the steading she made for above the coping showed the roofs of the house and of numerous substantial barns that backed upon the wall and at a point in the latter frowned a huge studded gateway strong enough to withstand the shock of anything less than artillery by this gate the girl paused a moment looked back and seeing the stranger still observant of her whisked about resentfully enough to bring down upon her head a sleet of acacia petals from a bush that stood hard by then she vanished and ned turned him to his pursuit of the other she had already reached the farther end of the place and he followed rapidly lest she should disappear from his ken but he came up with her as she was leaving the village by a road that mounted on a slight gradient amongst trees at the wroughtiron gates of the chateau set but a few hundred yards farther in a thicket of evergreens he addressed her as she was shifting from her head the great burden it had borne that is much for a girl nicette i will help you with it she looked at him he could see with some abashed recognition her lips that were a little parted in breathlessness trembled perceptibly without a protest she let him receive and drop upon the road the truss of clover some strands of the bundle that were yet entangled in the disorder of her rabbitbrown hair gave her an unlicensed strangeness of aspect but for the rest it was the madonna of the old church of ligethe colourless pure dvote with the greek profile and round blue eyes smallpupiled nicette said the young man who if cold had an admirable assurance to pass from throigne to you is to go to sleep in the sun and wake to the twilight she gave a little gasp does monsieur come to visit the chateau she murmured or its masteryes but first i will help you in with this no no she protested faintly but yes i say open the gate nicette and for what is this great heap of fodder it is for my beautiful gnissemadeleine of the white star she pushed open the gate within to one side was a low trellised lodge set within the forward apex of an elliptical patch of garden farther back was a byre and behind all a lofty bank of trees a fine avenue of spanish chestnuts led on to the house which was here hidden from view whither said ned she intimated the rearward shed with a halfaudible note of deprecation he shouldered and carried the truss to its destination a liquideyed cow with a rayed splash of white on its forehead blew a sweet breath of wonder as he entered within all was daintily clean and fragrant now said he i must go on to the chateau but i shall come again nicette and paint you into a picture the girl stood among the phloxes utterly embarrassed he made her a grave salutation and pursued his way to the house at a turn of the drive he came in view of the lattera sombre grey building sparely windowed and with a peakroofed toweremblem of nobilitycaught into one of its many angles a weedcumbered moat with a little decrepit stream of water slinking through the tangle of its bed surrounded the walls and in front of the moat as he encountered it a neglected garden fell away in halfobliterated terraces here and there placed in odd coigns of leafiness decayed wooden statues of fauns and dryads once painted properor otherwisein flesh tints had yielded their complexions piecemeal to the rasp of time and indeed the whole place seemed withdrawn from the considerations of order much wondering ned crossed an indifferent bridgelong ceased it would appear from its uses of draughtand found himself facing the massive stone portal of the chateau there is a canker hath gnawed here since my uncles day thought he and laid hold of a long iron bellpull the thing came down reluctant and leapt sullenly from his grasp and the clank of its answer called up a whole mob of echoes the door was opened by an unliveried young fellowa mere peasant of the fields by his appearance m de st denys but yes monsieur would be at home to receiveunless indeed he were not yet out of bed ned recalled a figure prostrate on the wreck of a guitar convey this letter to your master said he and show me where i may wait he entered a high resounding hall a boars head set at him from above a door in a petrified snarl opposite a great dark picturefruit flowers gameby jan de heem made a slumberous core of richness in the gloom these with a heavy chair or two were the only furniture the man conducted him to a waitingroom near as desert and illappointed as the vestibule the whole house seemed a vast and melancholy barrowan imprisoned vacancy containing only the personal harness and appointments of some lordly dead its equipments would appear to have conformed themselves to its service and that was reduced to a minimum ned heard the sound of a listed footfall and turned to meet the master of mricourt m de st denys came in with the visitors letter in his hand he was in a yellow morning wrapper that was in cheerful contrast with his sombre surroundings and a tentative small smile was on his lips he wore his own hair bright brown and unpowdered and tied into a neck ribbon a little artificial bloom like the meal on a butterflys wing was laid upon his cheeks to hide the ravages of dissipation but the injected eyes above were significant of fever he was nevertheless a pretty creature of his inches and they might have run to seventy or soexhilarating forcible convincing as a man only as to that his mouth was the hyperbolic expression justifying his sex rather by force of appetite than of combativeness m le vicomte murk said he raising his eyebrows prospective monsieur said ned but as yet ah ha broke in the other showing his teeth liberally you wait to step into old shoes it was my case oncefive years ago i had not the pleasure to know your uncle m le vicomte pardon monsieur i am a plain gentleman truly we order things otherwise herefor the present monsieurfor the present obviously he had no least recollection of the contretemps of the previous evening and you are travelling for experience he referred lightly to the letter in his hand and lightly laughed possibly you shall acquire that of a kind in little rustic mricourt we are in advance of our times herelocusts of the apocalypse monsieur having orders to respect only the seal of god we generically monsieur would say oh i include myself he made a comprehensive gesture with his hand behold the monastic earnest of my renunciation i am vowed to a religion of socialism that takes no account of superfluous frippery i devote my pen and he laughed again dissipate my fortune to the cause of universal happiness yourself thereby i presume securing the lions share of happiness truly i think i have hit upon the right creed for a spendthrift but my conscience is the real motive power monsieur though you may be cynical of its methods he spoke with an undernote of some ambiguity it might have signified deprecation or the merest suggestion of mockery and how shall the sacrifice of your fortune promote the common happiness said ned plainly monsieur answered st denys by scattering one at least of the worlds heaps of accumulated corruption wealth is like a stack of manure a festering load that is the magnet to any wandering fly of disease distribute it and it becomes a blessing that in fertilising the soil loses its own noxious properties but i would go further and ask what advantages have accrued from that system of barter that turns upon a medium of exchange has it not cumbered the free earth with these stacks till there has come to be no outlook save through aisles and alleys of abomination that may be true said the other curiously wondering that so much disputation should be launched upon him at this outset of his introduction but civilisation during some thousands of years has evolved none better m de st denys shrugged his shoulders civilisation he cried but you retain no faith in that exposed fetish is not civilisation indeed one voice of lamentation over its own disenchantment can any condition be worse than that of today when the ultimate expression of the social code reveals itself a shameless despotism do you ever quite realiseyou monsieur that through all this compound multiplication of the worlds figures its destinies remain the monopoly of a little clique of private families one seems to awaken suddenly to a comical amazement over mans agelong subscription to so stupendous a paradox let us soothe our amour propre by submitting that it was an experiment that has proved itself a failure nevertheless monsieur said ned gravely i think that in rejecting this civilisation by which you profitin encouraging rebellion against the established forms that necessity has evolved out of chaos and wisdom included in its codexyou to say the least of it are moved to drop the substance for the shadow he spoke with some unconscious asperity he could not bring himself to admit the entire earnestness of one of whose selfindulgent character he had had such recent proof this metal he fancied was plated i cannot believe he added that so complex a fabric could have triumphed over the ages had it not been founded upon truth but successive architects cried st denys may have deviated from the original plan still it holds and it rises and i for one am content to go up with itto reorder its chambers perhaps but never to quarrel with the main design and i for one would descend and leave it ah bah one may mount to the topmost branch of a tree and yet be no nearer escaping from the forest i find myself here in interminable thickets monsieur i see the poor leafblinded denizens of them nosing passionlessly for roots and acorns in a loveless gloom and i know the long green fields of light and pleasure to stretch all round this core of melancholy if only these could find the way to win to them is selfdiscipline necessary to existence surely our very butterflies of fashion prove the contrary now what thought ned is the goad to this inexplicable character does monsieur then said he advocate a creed of hedonism why not cried the other shall not man enlarge develop and become more habitually one with his amiable instincts under the influence of pleasure than he ever has done in his bondage to a religion of selfdenial to deny oneself is to deny god after whose image one is made a pretty conceit said ned but it spells degeneracy ay monsieur and to the very foundationsas far back as the garden of paradise what you would revert to primitive conditions to the very naked and unashamedbut applying to that state the influence of long traditions of gentle manners we will admit the happiness of the community to be the first consideration and reconstruct upon a basis of nature a spot of colour came to his cheek his eyes kindled with a light of febrile enthusiasm to be free to enjoy in a world of yielding generosities he cried to be cast from restrictions designed to the selfish aggrandisement of infinitely less than a moiety of our race to strip indulgence of the shamefulness that centurylong cant has credited it withalthat is the el dorado i give my efforts and my substance to attain there thought ned is confessed the animalism to which the other is but a blind but this is halfeffeminate vapouring he had no sympathy indeed with theories so untenable this lickerish unconstructive paganism was far from being the lodestar to his own revolutionary cockboat yet he could not but marvel over m de st denys extremely practical expression of extremely frothy sentiments involuntarily he glanced round the room yes cried the other observant of the look i am not one of those doctors who refuse their own medicine a thought of surprise seemed to strike him but i run ahead of my manners cried he with a quick laugh you charge me with a letter and i return you a volley of exposition i have not even offered you a seat pray accommodate yourself with one and you knew my father sir i had not the honour he was a friend of my lord viscount who gave you a letter to him there is figured out the value of the social relations he has been dead sir since five years he left two sons of whom i am the younger my brother lucien a sailor who held his commission to the west indies under de grasse perished there in in an explosion of powder the estate devolved upon me we have not your laws of primogeniture and had poor lucien returned we should have shared the burden and the joy of inheritance he had been leaning carelessly back against a table while he talked he now came erect and added with a queer look on his face and the pleasure of welcoming to mricourt the nephew of our fathers friend you are very good sir said ned i would fain believe it monsieur i have the pleasure to offer you the use of the chateau as an hotel for just so long as you care to stay ned taken momentarily aback hesitated over the right construction of so enigmatical an offer ah said the other it is to be considered literally in the business aspect monsieur assuredly you must understand i have waived the privileges of my class amongst which is to be numbered the right to acquit the wealthy of taxation the ponds must feed the rivulets monsieur seeing his visitor lost in introspection enfin he cried with a musical laugh that is the practical side it is not based believe me upon a system of profits for the social i take you to my heart monsieur with all enthusiasm and so ned became a guest at the chateau at cost price chapter v monsieur the master of mricourt would seal that queer compact of entertainment with the nephew of his fathers friend over a bottle of niersteiner which he had up from the cellar there and then tis a rare brand quoth he his eyes responding with a flick to the drawing of the cork and we will share both bottle and expense like sworn brothers ned sipped a single glass reluctant so much the better for the other i am your debtor he cried as he drained the flask draw upon me for the balance when you will his face was flushed he talked a good deal and not in an intelligent vein the visitor accepted him as an enigma that time should solve there seemed so much firmness of purpose so wanton an infirmity of performance in his composition certainly having the courage of his convictions in one way and the consequent right to expound them literally in another he might lay claim to consistency in flooding himself with wine before eleven oclock in the morning still to ned this implied a certain contradiction inasmuch as no creed of right hedonism could include excess with its penalties monsieur mon ami cried st denys on a wavering jovial key you will oblige me by indulging while here your easiest caprices come and go as you will i desire to put no restraint on you you shall pay only for your clean linen and for your food and drink the first two you will find at least wholesome for the last behold the proof if you want luxury you must seek elsewhere my socialism is eminently practical the free expression of naturethat is the creed we seek to give effect to in this little corner of the world but we are no sybarites nor i said ned but for youyou are a man of strong convictions monsieur st denys laughed sprawling back in his chair and waved his hand significantly to the empty walls just so said ned but i am a very chiffonnier for raking in the dust for hidden motives the frenchman cocked a sleepy lid scrutinising his guest with a little arrogance of humour they are here no doubt these motives said he perhaps i am astute perhaps i have the seers eye if i foretold you a deluge what would you do invest my money in an ark a floating capital to be sure but you could never realise on it if you weathered the storm and you monsieur and i monsieuri should endeavour very likely to extract the essence of twenty years from one i should at least spare no expense to that end were i foredoomed to founder i would make myself a wreck that i might sink the more easily he came scrambling to his feet do you like music he cried i will canvass you in the prophetic vein i see the rising of the waters he was looking about vaguely as he spoke what the devil is become of it he muttered are you hunting for your guitar you will find it flat beyond tuning i am afraid how do you say m de st denys you fell asleep literally on it last night in the landlust landlust oh dieu du ciel i am beginning to remember why he chuckled with hazy inspiration your veritable figure monsieur stands out of the fog indeed it was thick enough to stand on and little boppard and the gross old lambertine who is father to our village aspasia the fat old man but i must introduce you to throigne lambertine monsieur to add one beat a minute to your politic pulses indeed i think i have already introduced myself the deuce you have and is she your aspasia and who is her pericles harkee monsieur said st denys with a fall to particular gravity that will never do then he broke into a great laugh the father he cried is the bulwark of paradox see that you never strive to take him by storm he is of those who would undermine the church while confessing to the priest he clings to the old formul of honour that in others he pronounces out of date he advocates free thought as a eunuch might advocate free love without an idea of what it implies his advance is all within his own ringfenceround and round like a squirrel in its cage he will go any distance you like there only he must not be ousted from his patrimony the world for all men thinks he but his farm for jack lambertine popped into his pet seedcrusher he would bleed a vat of oil but he is an estimable husbandman oh yes he is that certainly he gives you a better character it seems than you him why what have i said to his discredit he has made the whole human race his debtor in one respect what for example m murk mon ami he has produced a throigne ned paintbox in hand presented himself at the lodgedoor a sound of low singing led him through a very lavenderblown passage to the rear of the cottage here he came upon nicette in a little bricked dairy dashed cool with recent water she was skimming cream from a broad pan with her fingers the tips of these budded through the white like nibs of rhubarb through melting snow behold her as she stands said the intruder here is the milkwashed madonna for my picture he put down his box and approached the maid she stood startled her hands poised above their work ned took her by the wrists and conducting his captive with speechless decorum to a sink pumped water over the sheathed buds till they flushed pink with the cold now said he dry your hands on that jacktowel nicette and we will get to work the girls eyes floated in a little backwater of tears crescents of hot colour showed under them on her cheekbones monsieur will make a jest of me she said in a rather drowned whisper i will make a madonna of you nicette if you will pose yourself as i wish her lips quivered she looked down twiddling her wet thumbs i am established at the chateau nicette i am a friend of m de st denys who would have me dispose of my time to my best entertainment and that monsieur seeks of the poor lodgekeeper truly for i am an artist above all things this cold fellow had a coaxing way with him after not so long an interval he was busily at work with the girl seated to his satisfaction the sweet coolness of the dairy received through a wideflung window the scent of innumerable flowers that thronged the little garden without to look thereon was like gazing on the blazing square of a stage from the sequestered gloom of an auditorium there was an orchestra moreover all made up of queer olian harmonics what is that voice nicette that never ceases to moan and quarrel it tells the wind monsieur what does it tell a story without an end i think he rose and looked through the window a little complaining horn pivoted on the top of a long pole swung to the lightest breeze and caught and passed it on in waves of protest upon a slack wire or two that like tent ropes held the pole secure lower currents of air fluttered with the sound of a knife sharpening on a tinkers grindstone ned grunted and resumed his seat it would drive me silly to have that for ever in my ears how can you stand it nicette it speaks to me of many things monsieur what for instance monsieur will laugh no i will not the whispering of the flower spirits then the steps and the low voices that come from beyond the dawn before even the shepherds are awake sometimes the noise of the sea you have travelled ah no monsieur but i have heard how the great waters mutter all their secrets to their shells and i like to think that my airshell up there is in the confidence of the strange people one cannot see ned paused in his work and dwelt musingly on his companions face so said he you are a halfsaint on the strength of these little odd ecstasies indeed i am no part of a saint now nicette you must put no restraint on your speech whenever i am with you you interest me more i think than anybody i have ever seen do you know i have no imaginative faculty like this of yours i am too inquisitive to dream nicely i like to get to the bottom of things obviously there was some lure about him that drew the girl in tentative advances from her reserve i do not think there is a bottom to things she said looking up a little breathless at her own daring some day perhaps when monsieur thinks he has reached it he will fall through and find himself flying shall i said ned abstractedly for he was wrestling with a difficulty then he went on with a quick change of subjectare you very fond of your cow nicettes eyes opened in wonder of madeleine oh yes monsieur how often do you feed her but twice in the day of green meat that you gather it is the fashion with us is it not so to stall the cattle in the country of monsieur only at night and how often do you feed your little brother the unexpected question completely dumfounded the girl ned laughed put his brush in his mouth and fetched a louisdor from his pocket will you take this now nicette something to his consternation she rose hurriedly from her seat made as if to leave the room and broke into a little fit of weeping he went up and spoke to her soothingly silly pretty child are you ashamed you are none the worse in my eyes for showing some inconsistency think only you are in the confidence of one of your strange people here take it nicette she threw his hand away the coin rang on the floor i will not i will not she cried oh please to go monsieur how can i sit for the madonna any more when you make me out so wicked chapter vi m de st denys said ned are you not here the children so to speak of an ecclesiastical benefice we are in the circle of westphalia monsieurchildren certainly of the duc de bouillon who is suffragan of the archbishop of cologne and how does his lordship accept this moral emancipation of little rustic mricourt the other laughed carelessly as he would accept the antics of children perhaps it does not trouble me in a few years all livings will be in the gift of the people you are serious in thinking so why not because i cannot interpret you or comprehend for what reason you run riot on a road of selfabnegation perhaps it is the war of the spirit with the flesh monsieur who knows were a man of vigour not to reasonably indulge his senses if his senses would not maliciously lead his judgment astray shall an anchorite prescribe for the hot fevers of life i like to test the passions i would legislate on and you foresee the triumph of the races over their rulers i foresee the bursting of the dam of humourthe mad earthwide guffaw in the sudden realisation of a preposterous anachronism i see all the old landmarks swept away in a roar of laughterthe idols the frippery the traditions of respect for what is essentially mean and false the egregious monkeys of convention solemnly dictating the laws of society to their own reflections in lookingglasses and what then the reign of reason monsieur the earth with its flowers for the children of its soil the commonage of pastures of woods and of valleys the adjustment of the relations of love and increase to the developments of nature the death of shame of artificiality of ignoble sophistries ned shook his head was the man sincere in all this did he seek to adapt himself with and in spite of his weaknesses to what he considered the inevitably right or were his repudiation of caste his sacrifice of fortune a mere wholesale bid for the notoriety that is so frantically sought of melodramatic souls his voice was vibrant with enthusiasm he seemed to lash himself into great utterances to feel conviction through force of sound and then in a moment he would figuratively swagger to the wings cock his hat and bury his face in a foaming tankard the two young men were strolling through a twilight of woodland they had dined at four oclock had sat an hour or so over their bottle and were then by arrangement of st denys to present themselves at a certain rendezvous of local esprits forts thou shalt handle promethean fire said the lord of mricourt and shalt kindle in the glance of a goddess very well answered ned i will come by all means but she will not find me touchwood they had mounted from the back of the village at the turning into the road of the chateau a few hundreds of yards had brought them to the fringe of the dense forest that rolled in terraces of high green down to the very outskirts of the hamlet thence they had passed by tracks of huddled leafiness into deeps and profounder deeps of stillness the silence about them was as the silence of a peopled selfconsciousnessas the underclang of voices to a dreamer whose heart works in his breast like a mole every birds song was an echo the germ of new life under every pinecone seemed stirring audibly in its little womb if a squirrel scampered unseen if a rush of wings went by unidentified the sound became a memory before it was past nothing of all beauty was material the thurible of the sun trailing clouds of smoke was withdrawn into the sacristy of the hills the music of the vesper hour fled in receding harmonics under a roof of boughs long aisles of arborescence dim with slowdrifting incense held solitude close as a returned prodigal here was the neutral ground of soul and body thronged with unrealities to either full of secret expectancies that massed or withdrew to the shutting and opening of ones eyes the dusk formed like troops in the bushy hollows still m de st denys led his companion on suddenly he stayed him with a hand on his sleeve a sound like the rubbing cheep of a polishingcloth on wood came to their ears from somewhere hard by stepping very softly the two men stole into a clearing dominated by a single huge beechtreean old shorn lear of the forest at its roots a young boar was engaged whetting its tushes that curled up like the mustachios of a swingebuckler the muscular sides of the beast palpitated as it swung to and fro now st denys with meaningless bravado left his friend and walked up to the brute that cocked its ears and was still in a moment ned caught the porcelain glint of its eye slewed backwardsand then st denys flogged out at the bristling flanks with a little ridingswitch he carried in his hand the pig fetched round the young man uttered a shrill whoop and lashed it in the face and at that the animal plunged for the thicket and disappeared ned went on to the tree he thought all this a particularly thrasonical display and would not appear to subscribe by so much as referring to it a mammoth in its day said he looking up at the vast wreck of timber that writhed enormous arms against the darkening sky ay said st denys assuming indifference of the slight that has been a long one too i can scarce remember it but as it is now and i am rising twentyseven it held itself royal and unapproachable you see defined the commonalty of the forest its limits of approximation to it like a celestial mogul the girth of this clearing in which it stands is the girth of its former greatness no sapling even now dare set foot in the sanctum sanctorum these forests have their traditions as men have perhaps modelled on ours perhaps we shall see come here again in a yeartwo years and if thou tellst me this charmed circle has been broken into by the thicket i will answer that elsewhere the people stand on the dases of kings again there seemed the theatrical posing the speaker put a hand on the trunk of the great tree here is the very biensance of vanity he saidthe archetype of society withered denuded wormeaten to a shell it yet decks its cap with a plume of green wraps its palsy in a cloak of stars and stands aloof like something desirable but not to be attained a shell you say it looks solid as marble it is a king monsieur without a heart some day when the storm rises it shall fall in upon itself i know its hollowness from a boy i have climbed fifty times this drooping bough herewhich you may do now if you will up there where the branches strike from the main stem one may look down into a deep well of decay he caught his hand away with a repelling exclamation bah it sprouts fungus at less than a mans height it is rotting to the roots it shall take but a little heave of the tempests shoulder to send it sprawling ned humoured the allegory with some contempt thrones do not crash down so easily said he their roots extend over the continents st denys came from the tree slid his arm under his guests and drew his gentleman down an obscure track that ran into the thicket so you love kings said he i neither love nor decry them i wish to walk independent like a visitor from another star availing myself of every opportunity of observation i shall not swerve from my convictions when they are formed and as far as you have got at present i see more evil rising from the depths than descending from the heights i see the peaks of volcanoes held responsible for the eruptions that are hatched by turbulent forces far down belowcompelled to be their mouthpiece indeed kings are what their people make them let the forces subside and the very cones in time will come to pasture quiet flocks or let the lava overflow overwhelm and obliteratedistribute itself and grow cool so shall the pasturage be infinitely more extended oh inglorious conclusion to justify individual evil on the score that it has no choice i do not said ned calmly i recognise only the right of the individual to an independent expression of self to secure this he must conform to a social code that excludes the processes of tyranny and that code must read equality no for men are not equal the world must always exhibit a slidingscale of intellect and capacity the unit a perpetual aspiration materially there must be a desideratuman ultima ratio to ambition call it king consul dictator whatever its name it is merely the crystallisation of a peoples character and energythe highest effect given to a national tendency but all this my friend is not compatible with hereditary titles no and there i pause it is gracious of you a little further and you will recognise the impossibility of patching up old fustian to wear like new cloth better to commit all to the fire than to spare the sorry stuff because a bit here and there is less decayed than the rest as he spoke a square of mellow radiance met them at a turning of their path the light proceeded from the window of a wooden hut or shantya toolshed it might have been or at the best a little disused hunters lodge it was sunk in a bosket of evergreens built of lufferboards that gaped in many places and its roof of flaking tiles was all sown with buttons of moss the headquarters of the brotherhood said st denys with a laugh and he pushed open a creaking door and drew his visitor within hol basile came in a triple note of greeting ned found himselfwondering somewhatin a bare small room furnished only with a table and plain benches of chestnutwood at this table were seated the exiguous sizar of the landlust and a couple of rather truculentlooking gentryfarmers of small holdings by reasonable surmise an oillamp burned against the wall and its light swayed wooingly on the face of the fourth member of the companythroigne lambertine whom the young man had foreguessed to be the goddess she sat raised a little above the others at the head of the board a smile on her lips her eyes awake with daring her hair was loosely caught under a scarlet handkerchief about her bosom a white fichu was only too slackly knotted ned had never seen a living creature so richly secure in the defensive and aggressive qualities of beauty she looked at him with a little defiance of recognition mes amis said st denys i have the pleasure to introduce to you a visitor whom you will know as edouard he is all i may tell you for reforming society that is a discipline thou shalt not wield here edouard cried one of the loobies with an insolent laugh ned faced the speaker gravely not even for the whipping of a jackass said he there answered a cackle of derision st denys caught his friend by the arm it is unfair it is unfair he cried merrily i have brought him hither without a word of explanation then he took his captive by the lapels of his coat monsieur or edouard said he this is the one spot within the compass of the nations where a man is entirely welcome for himself so long as he is it here we throw off every unnatural restriction say what we will do what we willprovided no evil consequence is entailed thereby we are the club of natures gentry founded upon and governed by that solitary comprehensive rule we neither give nor take offence for where absolute freedom of speech is permitted all may be said that there is to say cast from the prohibitions of conventions truthful beyond conceits we restrain ourselves in nothing that is of happy impulse deny ourselves no indulgence but that of doing hurt to our neighbour basile has spoken said throigne in her full voice basile is very great and thou thou tall staidness come and pay thy homage to natures queen ned turned swiftly walked up to the girl and kissed her cheek what the devil cried st denys hoarsely have i done hurt to my neighbour said ned facing round the belgian laughed on a false note you are immense said he the brotherhood takes you to its heart see that you on your part resent nothing he turned with rather a frowning brow to the table throigne flushed but unabashed by the englishmans boldness watched her predial lord covertly a small gathering tonight he said but what of that when the queen presides he fancied himself conscious of a new startled intelligence in the eyes of two at least of his company this stranger the look expressed how had he appropriated to himself what they had never dreamed but to respect as unattainable truly it had been for him to rightly interpret to them their own law st denys stamped his foot impatiently why do you blink here like moping owls he said the air is balm the moon walks up the sky there is not a bank but breathes out a sweet invitation they bustled to their feet at his words one man pulled from under the table a hamper loaded with wineflasks and horns we revel in the open said st denys to ned we give our words flight like fairies under the stars nothing remains to rankle or to generate mischief as in the close atmosphere of rooms very well said ned the open for me and he stepped out accompanied by three others into the sweetblown wood the moment he found himself alone with her st denys turned upon throigne mademoiselle coquette said he showing his teeth i could very easily strike you on the face and why she said quietly her eyes glittering at him oh do you not understand little mother of god she cried low her nostrils dilating but here is a consistent president did not the stranger conform to rule would you have had me give you the lie by repulsing him to the devil with the rule cried the other in suppressed passion you know it for a blindnot as an excuse for licence this folly this ridiculous club is it not designed but to enable us to indulge a passion of romanceunder the very gis of m lambertine too when he chooses to leave his tavern and his pipe the girl in a swift transition of mood came from her seat and put up her hands caressingly to the young mans shoulders basile mon ami she murmured it is ridiculous i know but it is an excitement in this little dull world of ours thou sportst with professions of opinion that are not the truth of thy soul thou knowest as i know dearest that these wild theories spell disaster that through all the waste of the ages honour is the pilot star that it is never but safe to steer by oh do you not basile surely said st denys impatiently what have i said to disprove it but honour will not dispel the fog through which these ships of state are driving to their doom i who prophesy the crashgod of heaven throigne dost thou think my ambition surfeits on this scurvy junto of clodhoppers it is play my beautifuljust play to pass away the time and i too play soul of my soulbut i will no more this englishman if he dares again he shall suffer thy honour shall be mine as thou hast sworn to save me from myselfoh basile darling remember how thou hast sworn it chapter vii mr murk sat on a bank solemnly preparing for an idyll but i cannot subscribe to it in one respect thought he for if i persist in being myself i shall look upon all this as the most idiotic fooling little boppard said he what will society do now you have severed yourself from it monsieur said the student angrily i am not to be laughed at how then of this freedom of speech you are an interloper you do not understand but i am eager to learn oh little boppard i am so eager to learn i will not be called so it is infamous but it was thus m de st denys named you to me it is different i am nothing to you oh mon pauvret it is not so bad you are at least a little man to me one of the hobnails broke into a guffaw listen to him this stranger is a droll good it is much noise about nothing boppard you most happily cap me sir said ned with great gravity may i have the pleasure of taking wine with you but a bucketful edouard cried the fellow boisterously he brimmed the horns as he spoke a vinous pigment already freckled his cheeks i see here nothing but an excuse for an orgy thought the visitor the company sprawled over a bank to one side of the clearing where the great tree stood the wineflasks lay cool in moss the two countrymen had thrown off their coats and bared their shaggy chests to the night overhead the moon was already of a power to strew the forest lanes with travelling blots of shadow like dead leaves moving on a languid stream a cricket chirruped here and there in spasms as if irresistibly tickled by the recollection of some pleasantry from time to time across the dim perspective of a glade a momentary indiscernible shape would steal and vanish ned pondered over the enchantmentas moving less prosaic soulsof moonlit haunted woods now i wonder thought he if i could put myself en rapport with the undefinable in less philistine company as if in reply what would not nicette interpret of these fairy solitudes said a dreamy voice at his back he turned his head throigne had come softly and was seated with st denys a little above him on the bank she is not of the club then said ned the student laughed truculently throwing back his head with a noise as if he were gargling little boppard is beyond himself said ned we shall make a man of him yet the two potwallopers hooted richly at that monsieur is quick to launch insults said mademoiselle lambertine frigidly why what have i said the young man looked piously bewildered st denys sniggeredeven ned could have thought with a little note of vexation friend edouard said he in mricourt the portire legrand stands precanonised understand chuckled a bumpkin she is portire and a virginsave that she bears the sins of the community beast cried throigne then she went on sarcasticallyto belong to us oh yes but it is likely is it not she who communes with the blessed virgin like a dear familiar it is so said st denys that is her reputation he was himself for all his jeanjacques pyrrhonism an evident subscriber to a local superstition now said the perplexed englishman i perceive that to be oneself is to invite resentment not to give or take offence said throigne with fine impartiality both of which have been done mademoiselle so let us cry quits and what would mademoiselle legrand make of all this how can i tell she is the saint of dear conceits she has the inward eye for things invisible to us where do the threads of rain disappear to throigne says she oh mon dieu nicette am i a cagliostro i think she says they are pulled into the earth by goblins working at great looms of water each thread draws like spun glass from the crucible of the clouds and so underfoot is woven the network of springs and channels ciel the quaint sweet child whither come her fancies they are there in the morning like drops of dew st denys broke in with a rippling snatch of song mignonne allons voir si la rose qui ce matin avoit desclose sa robe de pourpre au soleil a point perdu ceste vespre les plis de sa robe pourpre et son teint au vostre pareil he stopped sing on my heart whispered throigne monsieur the englishman does not approve my music monsieur began the girl in great scorn but to stay her st denys lifted up his voice a second time when cllia proved obdurate to phdons fond advances repaid with scorn his woful state with flout his utterances forego he cried this acrid strain from such sweet lips a schism and dumbly quit me of my pain by posy symbolism for hope a white rose for despair a red pluck to thy bosom he turned then lookedthe wilful fair had donned a crimson blossom but so it chanced within the cup a cupid honeytipsy in rage at being woken up thrust out and stung the gipsy then all compunction for his deed for cap to the disaster rubbed phdons lips with honeymead to serve the wound for plaster is it pretty or not monsieur asked throigne mockingly advancing her foot and giving ned a little peck in the back with it it suits the occasion mademoiselle and no doubt the company st denys laughed out hear the grudging ascetic he cried it is martial music that shall fire this temperate blood ho boppard mon petit chiffon give him a taste of thy quality he will laugh at me basile nevertheless the sizar got upon his legs it brought him three feet nearer the stars his voice was a protesting little organ but the spirit that inspired it was many degrees above proof he sang decorous ways though mammon praise with selfprotective art weve learnt through ruth the damnd truth why he affects the part courage then courage my children virtue is all gammon imposed on us by mammon not to spoil the fashion giving him monopolyhatefully improperly of the sweets of passion monsieur i will not be laughed at a thousand pardons said ned i thought from your expression you were going to be sick but never mind go on i will go on or not as i please i protest at least i can crow as well as monsieur like a bantam cock on a dunghill little boppard you hail the awaking of the proletariat and are the verses your own i will not tell you i will not tell you anything i have never been so insulted he seemed to sob plumped down and drank off a horn of wine in resounding gulps the two rustics rolled to their feet and began to fling an uncouth dance together they had canvassed the bottle freely and were grown very true to themselves they spun they hooted their moonlit shadows writhed on the ground like wounded snakes wilder and more abandoned waxed their congyrations till at length one flung the other upon the bank at the very feet of throigne now this fellow potulent and potvaliant and taking his cue from sobriety scrambled to his knees threw himself upon the girl and crying no hurt to my neighbour endeavoured to salute her after an example set him his reception was something more than damning throigne with a cry of rage met the impact tooth and nail and following on the rebound became in her turn the furious aggressor a devil possessed her fierce mouth and vigorous young arms her victim wailing with terror tried to protect his face from which the blood ran in rivulets for a moment or two she had everything to herself the others stood paralysed about her where they had got to their feet then st denys seized and struggled to draw her away even at that she resisted worrying her prey and gabbling like a thing demented leave the brute his life cried m le prsident it is not he after all that is most to blame do you hear throigne i will twist your arm out of its socket but you shall come she uttered a shriek of physical pain and releasing her hold stood panting on the grass the wretched creature nursed his wounds and sobbed and wriggled his comrade sobered beyond belief dumbly glowered in the background ned took off his hat in a shameless manner of politeness these fraternal orgies said he are a little difficult of digestion to a stomach prescriptive on the whole i think i prefer the despotism of savoirvivre with monsieurs permission i will een back to mricourt we must bear in mind that he is an englishman said the sizar his traditions are not of the licence of goodfellowship chapter viii it was characteristic enough of m de st denys to bear his guest no grudge for the fiasco chiefly brought about it must be admitted by that guests malfeasance with no man was the evil of the day more sufficient to itself and he would be the last to insist upon that discipline of conscience that burdens each successive dawn with a new heritage of regrets moreover the dog had the right humour when he was restored to it to properly appreciate neds immediate comprehension of rule one and only of the brotherhood and on his way home with throigne the comedy of the situation did gradually so slake the turmoil of his soul as that he must try to win over his companion to regard the matter from anything but a tragic standpoint in this he was but partly successful for woman has a cast in her humorous perceptives that deprives her of the sense of proportion is it so little a thing she said hotly but it was thy honour i fought to maintain and no wonder then that men will take sport of that in us which they hold so cheap in themselves however his mended view of the affair impressed her so far as that meeting with the englishman by the village fountain on the morning following the orgy she condescended to some distant notice of and speech with him for indeed with her sex to punish with silence is to wield a scourge of handstinging adders ned serenely undisturbed by if not unconscious of a certain toneless hauteur greeted mademoiselle lambertine with his usual politeness he was not in truth greatly interested in this fine animal he recognised in her no original quality that set her apart from her fellows beauty of an astonishing order was hers indeedbeauty as much of promise as of fulfilment the little remaining gaucherie of the hoyden dwelt with her only like a lingering brogue on the tongue of an expatriated irishman it was roughandtumble budding into a manner of caress but beauty save as it might contribute to the motif of a picture was no fire to raise this young mans temperature and in throignes presence he seemed only to breathe an opulent atmosphere of commonplace she was glowing passion interpreted through coloursiennas and leafy browns and golds like the reflection of sunsets a dryad a pagan a liberallimbed tetonnire if she were ever to find herself a soul he could imagine her standing out richly as a rembrandt portrait against torn dark backgrounds but at present she seemed to lack the setting that occasion might procure her why do you toil this long way for water said he for the reason that monsieur travels she answered coldly do i comprehend i loiter up the channels of life seeking the springheads whence the waters gush sweet and clear down in the dull homesteads one draws only stagnation from the ground or from the barrels underground mricourt would do well i think to make this fountain its rendezvous oh monsieur one need not drink much wine i see to yield oneself to insolence well you are angry over that kiss but it was a jest throigne my heart was as cold as this basin did this improve matters no doubt she said flushing up you only lack the opportunity to be a judas and is it so they treat women in your barbarous island they treat them as they elect to be treated we have a saying that as one makes ones bed so one must lie on it it is a noble creed cried the girl derisively it is the pharisee speaking in english nay mademoiselle it is to be vertebrate that is all to condone evil on the score of provocation to evil to excuse it on the ground of constitutional tendencythat is the first infirmity of declining races she looked at him mockingly then fell into a little musing fit perhaps it is the right point of view she murmured but for usmon dieu our eyes will get bloodshot and our vision obscured andyes i would rather die of fire than of frost she turned upon him still pondering it is strange they say you are a great lord in your own country i am nephew to one and his heir and is he like you ned permitted himself a snigger he is very unlike me he is the doyen perhaps of lotharios an old man yes old and you travel like a commis voyageurfor experience says the gross van roon there must be something of courage in you englishmen after all though you will run before us where you are fewer than ten to one ned changed the subject why were you so hurt last night by my reference to nicette she is a saint how do you know how does a blind man know when some one sits at an open window by which he passes he feels the presencethat is all that is all then no but thisnicette cried lustily till the waters of baptism redeemed her and thereafter never again so early was the devil expelled from that sweet shrine and the little brotheris he a saint too throigne laughed contemptuously baptiste oh to be sure the little unregenerate he is the devils imp rather they are orphans since three years the girl mothers him the graceless rogue i wronged her in ignorance you see that club of goodfellowshipit was all so concordant so much in harmony with its own laws of frolic giveandtake why should a very saint be superior to so genial a fraternity we are a fraternity as monsieur says extending the hand of brotherhood to she broke off uttering a sharp exclamation as of terror or disgust and shrunk back against the well rim a figure had come into viewby way of the meadow path up which nicette had borne her load of fodderand had paused over against the fountain where it stood obsequiously bowing and gesticulating it was that of a tall largeboned man fairhaired applefaced with a mild deprecating expression in its big blue eyes its head was crowned with a greasy cloth cap shaped like the half of a tomato its shirt of undesirable fustian was strangely decorated over the left breast with a yellow badge cut into something the shape of a ducks foot its full smallclothesthat came pretty high to the waist and were braced over the shoulders with leather bands yoked to others running horizontally across chest and backseemed in their every stereotyped crease the worn expression of humility what is it my friend said ned throigne put a hand on his arm do not speak to him save to bid him return whither he came god in heaven i can see the grass withering under his feet monsieur monsieur for ned was walking towards the man it is one of the accursed race the creature fawned like a celestial as the young man approached monseigneur for the love of god a drink of water said he his dry thick lips seemed to grate on the words why not said ned you have only to help yourself let him dare shrieked throigne monsieur do you hear it is a cagot a cagot i say the man looked up with a despairing forlorn gesture and drooped again like one to whom long experience had taught the hopelessness of selfvindication is that so asked ned alas monseigneur it is so what do you do it for then and what the deuce is it herehave you a cup or vessel of your own with a hurried manner compound of supplication and triumph the creature fumbling in its shirt brought forth an iron mug ned received and carried it to the well throigne sprang from him you are not to be warned it will poison the blessed spring nonsense said ned but recognising her real agitation and alarm he offered her a compromise he would carry the mug to a little distance and there she standing back from it should drop in water from her pitcher to this she consented after some demur and the cagot had his drink that makes a man of you said ned watching the poor fellow take all down in reviving gulps the other shrugged his shoulders despondingly monseigneur i can never be that it is forbidden to us to stand apart from the beasts we had hoped in these days of he broke off shook his head and only repeated i can never be that monseigneur then i would not come among men to be so treated nor should i but that my one pig had strayed and i dared to seek it monseigneurif monseigneur would soil his tongue with the wordhas he i have seen no pig no doubt it will be returned to you if found returned hlas but a poor return indeed it will not be the lights the entrailsa little of the coarser meat perhaps how is that then where we squat monseigneur thither come the authorised of the pure blood these are your bounds say they and they signify arbitrarily any limit that occurs woe then to the cagot sheep or pig that strays without the visionary cordon whoever finds it may kill reserving to himself the good and returning to the unhappy owner the inferior parts only of the meat it is of a piece with all i see here more than elsewherethe grossest inconsistency where the senses seek gratification truly i think the emancipation of the race is to be from selfdenial he gave the man a piece of moneyrather peremptorily checking the fulsome benedictions his act called forthand saw him slink off the way he had come for all its show of servility there had appeared something indescribably noble in the poor creatures rendering of an ignoble part it was as if on the stage of life he were willing to sacrifice his individuality to the success of the piece not all scapegoats could so triumph physically through long traditions and experiences of suffering these cagotsthey might have come from the loins of the wandering jew he walked back to throigne his heart even a little less than before inclined to her she held away from him somewhat as if he were contaminated a fraternity extending the hand of brotherhood he saidrepeating some words of hers uttered before the cagot had intervenedto whom was mademoiselle about to say to all without exception she looked at him half fearful half defiant this man is of the accursed race she cried low a jew a cagot and what is that you do not know they come from france where she sits with her feet in the mountainsoutcasts pariahs with blood so hot that an apple will wrinkle in their hands as if it had been roasted i should have fancied that a recommendation to you of mricourt ah grace of god with them it is nothing but the emitting of a pestilent miasma these people are brutes they would even have tails but that their mothers are cunning to bite them off when they are newly born ned went into a fit of laughter it is true monsieur it is at least easily proved and they come from the south from the south and from the west it is not often we see them here but this new spirit that is in the airmon dieuit stirs in them i suppose with a hope of better timesof release from the restrictions imposed upon them for the safety of the community and now they will sometimes wander far afield and what are these restrictions they are manyas to the isolation of their camps as to their tenure of land or carrying of weapons as to buying or selling food as to their right to enter a church by the common door to take the middle of the street to touch a passerby to remain in any village of the pure after sundown they must grow their own flesh find their own springs wear each man woman and child the duckfoot badge that they may be known and shunned indeed i cannot tell a tithe of the laws that control them but for what reason are they set apart little mother of god how can i say they are cagots they are accursedthat is all i know even as she spoke an angry brabble of voices came to them from the direction of the path by which the outcast had retreated and in a moment the man himself reappeared scuttling along in a stooping posture and hauling by the ear his recovered pig that squeaked passionately as it was urged forward but now in his wake came a posse of loutsyoung chawbacons drawn from the fieldswho pelted the poor wretch with clods of clay and were for baiting him it seemed in a crueller manner ned ran down and placed himself between victim and pursuers the former bruised and breathless pattered out a hurried fire of explanation and entreaty the young gentleman faced the little mobhalfadozen or sothat had closed upon itselfcompact claypolism what do you want with this man he said his demand evoked a clamour of vituperation what is that to you it is the law the mongrel is accursedlme damnele tison denfer down with this insolent the stranger he is a cagot himself ned waited calmly for the tumult to subside i ask you what this man has done said he cannot you tell the heretic by his smell ohaeh here is a fine catholic nose out of our waythe pig is forfeit they hissed and yelped and raised a shrill chorus of baas at the unfortunate curiously he seemed to feel this last form of insult more acutely than any suddenly a clod of earth aimed presumably at the poor creature hurtled through the air and struck neds shoulder in passing it might have rebounded on the assailant so immediate was the retribution that followed the erstcalm paladin went for the vermin like a terrier and like a terrier repaid his own punishment with interest the great chuff howled and blubbered and wriggled under the blows that rained upon him presently ned exhausted swung his victim in a hysteric heap upon the ground and stood to breathe himself then it was that the reserve withdrawn in affright seeing his momentary fatigue gathered heart of numbers and came down upon him in phalanx he received them nothing dismayed and accounted for the first with a giveuponthenose and for another with a poached eye he was patently tired howeverenervated by the heat of the dayand his adversaries recognising this were encouraging one another to annihilate him when all in a moment a volume of water slapped into their faces and quenched their ardour for ever a new champion had come upon the field and that was no other than mademoiselle throigne with her pitcher she laughed volubly on a menacing note in the washed and streaming countenances beasts pigs cowards she shrilled for one englishmanname of godfor one trumpery englishman to lay you out flat as linen on a bleachinggreen get backhide yourselves in your furrows or play bully to the little rabbits in the field corners not to the bucksthat were too bold she made as if to follow up the water with the vessel ned cried out you will break the earthenware sooner than their heads mademoiselle in agony lest she should blaze beyond selfextinguishment as on the previous evening but she only stiffened her claws like a cat and prepared to spring it was enough the swamped and demoralised crew gathered up its wreckage and fled incontinent and was in a moment out of sight round the curve ned took off his hat to his tutelary divinitythis athena to his achilles your weapons were better than mine he said but your task was harder for you had to fight against prejudice as well the cagot still holding his pig by the ear crept up to the young man and caught and ravenously kissed his hand then he looked wistfully at a brownhaired goddess oh mon dieu no said throigne you must not touch me or come near me she turned and addressed ned almost with an entreating sound in her voice you have courage of every sort monsieur but for meyes it is as you say my heart warms to such valour but i cannot forget in a moment these long traditionsthis fear and this abhorrence do not let him approach me she stepped back as if to escape a very radiated influence but she spoke softly to the englishman and with the manner of one who in giving help has wrought a little conscious bond of sympathy bid the man go hence by the lige road she said so will he evade his persecutors but a few toises out he can enter the woods and work round to his lair i will see him on his way mademoiselle he bade her good morning quite respectfully and drove the cagot before him from the village it was slow progress for the recalcitrant pig must be humoured the man looked back from time to time his face full of the most human gratitude a little way on he paused by an outlying cottage until his benefactor was come up with him then smiling brightly he stayed ned with a significant gesture and went on tiptoe to the door that stood open a loaf lay on a table within this the cagot seized with a muttered word and so came forth again hugging his prize what the devil cried ned he had seen a woman within the hut she had shrunk crying out from the intruder but had made no effort to defend her property a thief exclaimed the englishman nenni said the man in a deprecatory voice it is one of our poor little privileges i appropriated the bread that monseigneur might see the deuce you did we may take itbut yes we may enter and take wherever we see it a cut loaf turned upsidedown with the sliced part to the door i will return it if monseigneur wills no said ned this privilege is on a par with all the rest let the fool pay toll to his own inconsequence lead on my friend very shortly they turned into a forest track plunging amongst trees for a half mile or more here ned pushed up to his humble wayfellow why are you accursed said he god help us monseigneur i know not thus they hold and keep us wheresoever in our wanderings we alight we must report our names and habitations to the bailli of the nearest jurisdiction that no loophole may be left us to escape from ourselves for it is forbidden to us to intermarry with the pure of blood lest we thereby merging into the community lose our unhappy distinction but whence come you and what have you done to merit thisthis monseigneur we are accursed it is not given to us to know more than that was there a faint note of stubbornness a suggestion of some conscious secret withheld in this abject reiteration of abasement ned was in doubt but at least it seemed these strange people carried horror with them like a hidden plaguespot tell me said he why did you cower when the louts cried baa to you the man looked up furtively it is our ears he muttered they will call them sheeps ears monseigneur certainly it would appear they are not designed for rings that is a progressive evolution my friend the cagot did not answer a few steps farther brought them into a little dell traversed by a brook here by the waterside was stretched a single tent of tattered brown canvas alone said ned surprised alone monseigneur save for the woman and the little bien fils de son pre in these days the tribes are much broken up they wander piecemeal there are rumours abroadhopes prospects as if it were prelude to the advent of a messiah i think perhaps i have seen today a harbingeran angel bearing tidings he gazed at the young man with large solemn eyes his face was full of a wistful patiencenot brutalised but mild and intelligent oh truly i am the devil of an angel said ned and he waved his hand and turned monseigneur i will never forget said the cagot chapter ix in nicettes little lodge doors and windows stood all open even then the languid air that entered fell fainting almost on the threshold the heat of many preceding days seemed accumulated in vast bales of clouds piled up from the horizon it scintillated livid and coppery through its enormous envelopes eating its way forth with menace of a flood of fire obviously the dairy was the nearest approach to a temperate zone and thither ned bent his steps carrying his paintbox and canvas he found the girl there as he had expected she was seated knitting near the flung casement wherethrough came a hot scent of geranium flowers in the blinding garden without silence panted like a drouthy dog only the horn high on its perch found breath to bemoan itself gathering up the folds of muteness with an attenuated thread of complaint mademoiselle legrand looked cool and fragrant for all the house was an oven but a little bloom of damp was on her face like dew on a rose in a corner standing with his hands behind his back and his front to the wall baptiste the sadeyed child did penance for some transgression it would appear i must not lose my madonna for a misunderstanding said ned nicette rose to her feet flushing vividly to her brow the weary white face of the boy was turned in astonishment to the intruder monsieur said the portire in a little agitated voice you must not ask me for one you hold so cheap to represent the stainless mother it cannot be monsieur ned deposited his paraphernalia on a chair went up to his whilom model and took her hands in his with gentle force nicette he murmured so that the child should not hear him i refuse you know to accept this responsibility it is your own consciousness of justification or otherwise that is in question the mother had a human as well as a divine side i will use you for the first use me she whispered monsieur she drooped her headtried to withdraw her hands her lips faltered desperately on the word tell me the truth little nicette may not a saint love guava jelly it is a fruit of the sweet earthperhaps the very manna of the israelites he held her young soft wrists in hostage for an answermuch concerned for an exchange of confidence the girl making a lac damour of her fingers suddenly came to her decision i am very wicked she said in a small voice between eagerness and tears i am not a saint at all monsieur may do with me as he will now surely this young man had the fairy temperance to his godmother when he was christened his point gained he disposed his model with a very pretty eye to business and was soon at work nicette said he how has this youthful whippersnapper misconducted himself baptiste monsieur he was dainty with his food andthe day was hot and perhaps i was ever so little cross she accepted the understanding it will be seenthrilled perhaps over the secret ecstasy implied in this prospect of a lay confessor well ma chrie said ned you may relax discipline now may you not it worries me to have this inconversable ape criticising me from his corner baptiste said nicette you may go and playin the shadow baptiste the child went out dully with a lifeless step it would seem he recognised no enticing novelty in the form of words now we will have a comfortable coze said ned how monsieur that means we will exchange confidences girl nicette smiled you do not love children monsieur she asked truly i think not they know i fancy so much more than they will tell i feel nervous in their company as if they might blackmail me if they would it is no use to be conscious of my own innocence vague terrors assail me that they may be in possession of dark secrets that i have forgotten for them they never forget it is so indeed with little doubt is it not they inherit the ages one must admit they are like eggs full of the concentrated meat of wisdom and as such it is right to sit upon them it is a selfprotective instinct thus to hurry their development for so their abnormal precocity distributes itself over an everincreasing area and weakens in its acuteness and they have cunning monsieur without doubtthe cunning to evoke and trade upon sympathy with sufferings that they pretend to but are physically incapable of feeling the girl looked up her eyes expressive of some strangeness of emotion are they not able to feel then monsieur not as we do nicette their nervous organism has not yet come to tyrannise over the spiritual in them turn thy head as before babouine the light falls crooked on thy mouth no i wish never to be burdened with a child either my own or anothers a low boom of thunder rolled up the sky nicette started and drove her chair back a little distance from the window that is vexatious of you you pullet are you afraid of thunder oh yesdear motherwhen it is close but that is yet far away it will advanceit is the diligence of the skies bringing inhuman company mon dieu when one hears the driver crack his whip and the horses plunge forward and there follows the rumbling of the wheels talk on i love to hear thee but take courage first to resume thy pose monsieur i am frightened what with me for thy quixote i have conquered windmills before now therethat is to be a good child do you find it hard to understand my chatter monsieur on the contrary is an adept at our language this is nothing to how i speak it when i have a cold still do you know i have never quite got over the feeling that it is very clever of a frenchman to talk french and so it is throigne would say but you will not nicette have you ever heard speak of the club of natures gentry what a question is it not but i like to hear you laugh like little bells monsieur it is a very dull club which is the reason you are not a member a member oh mon dieu that is not my notion of enjoyment great heaven here is an astonishing shift of the point of view how monsieur never mind so freedom of speech is not to your fancy it is not freedom but an excuse for silly licence those clowns and the grotesque small boppardit is to discuss wine not politics that they assemble a full mug is the only challenge they invite and the larger the measure the greater that of their courage but they talk so much into empty pots that their voices sound very big to them not boppard mademoiselle he at least hath this justificationthat he is a poet has monsieur discovered it then monsieur is cleverer than all mricourt we must make monsieur the student a crown of vine leaves nicette dost thou think i will suffer a pullet to cackle at me what then if not a poet but a maker of charades impossible to interpret by monsieurs permission my permission you jade here is the measure of your courage i think and have you no fear that i shall make m de st denys acquainted with your opinion of his club none monsieur the thunder rolled again the girl starting and clasping her hands cried monsieur let me come from the window oh monsieur let me and i will light a blest candle a little longerjust a little longer i foresee a darkness presently and then lest my madonna be blotted from my sight the candle shall burn the girl looked out fearfully at the advancing van of the storm it was still brilliant sunshine in the garden but with an effect as if the outposts of noon were falling back upon their centre already halfdemoralised in prospect of an overwhelming charge the wind too beginning to move like that that precedes an avalanche was scouting through the shrubberies with a distant noise of innumerable tramping feet and the fitful moaning of the horn rose to a prolonged scream that drew upon the heart with a point of indescribable anguish why however said ned have you no apprehension that i shall tell tales to m de st denys i said i had no fear monsieur would he not resent this so unflattering opinion of his satellites what is his own of them does monsieur thinkthat a tipsy boor assists the cause of freedom monsieur my master is not blind save perhaps in thinking others so saint sacrement the sun has gone out it was as if a wave of cloud extinguished it never mind that in thinking others blind to what girl i must not sayindeed i must not say is this to be a saintto damn with innuendo fie then nicette monsieur do not be angry oh i will tell you whatever you will this club then it is a pretext one cannot but assumea veil to hide perilous sentiments not of politics but of but of what the girl hung her head the increasing gloom without lent its shadow to her face monsieur has no mercy she whispered but of what nicette tell me monsieurof intrigue as if the very word completed an electric circuit and discharged the battery a flash answered it followed almost immediately by a splintering shock of thunder the girl uttered a shriek started to her feet and ran to the middle of the room holding her hands to her eyes i am blind she wailedoh i am blind ned hurried to hergripped her shoulder nonsense he cried it will pass in a moment let me look he could hardly hear his own voice the lightning might have been a bursting shell that had rent a dam the thunder of the rain outroared that of the cloudsoverbore the struggling wind and pinned it to the earthsmote upon the roof in tearing volleys and made of all the atmospheric envelope a crashing loom of water nicette cried the young man frightened to see the girl yet hide her face from him he was conscious of something crouching at her feet and looking down saw that terror had driven baptiste the little boy to the refuge of their company in his panic ned impulsively seized the maid into his arms you are not hurt he implored i kept you by the window my god if you should be injured through my fault she was not at least so stunned but that his impassioned selfreproach could inform her cheeks with a rose of fire the stain of it could he have seen soaked to the very white nape of her neck hold me she whimpered dont let me go or i shall die she strained to him patently and without any thought of dissimulation palpitating with terror as the rain roared and the frequent detonations shook the house in the first of his apprehension he thought of nothing compromising in the situationof nothing but his own concern and the girls pitiful state presently in a lull he heard her exclaiming mother of god if i were to go blind dont suggest such a thing he cried in anguish would you be sorryeven for poor nicette monsieur sorry child look up in gods name she raised her face her lids flickered and opened can you see he asked distraught and eager isomethinga little murmured the unconscionable gipsy i can see monsieurs facefar or nearwhich is it she put up a timid hand her fingers fluttered like a moth against his temple i dont think i am blind monsieur my eyes in his jubilation he took her head between his palms and with a boyish laugh kissed each of the blue flowersto make them open he said no i am not blind said she chapter x mr murk recalling on the morning after the storm certain ultrafervid expressions of remorse into which during it he had been betrayed and realising possibly how of a saint and a sinner the latter had proved the blinder turned the searchlight of his recovered vision inwards and examined his conscience like the most ruthlessly introspective catholic he worked out the sum of argument very coolly and carefully and the result condensed from many germinant postulates showed itself arithmetically inevitable if i intrigue i sacrifice my independence my free outlook my peace of mind my position in relation to my artcomprehensively my principles enfinon the other hand i gain a very stomachy little white powder in a spoonful of jam taking one from four therefore i find myself debited with three charges that it is ridiculous to incur love in short is a creditor i have no desire to be called upon to compound with i will cut my visit a little finer than i had intended and go on to paris at once perhapsfor i have not finished my madonna and the model curiously interests mei will return to mricourt byandby when this shadow of a romance has drifted away with the cloud that threw it thus far only he temporised with his inclinations for the rest it appeared he likened that which most men feel as a flame to an amorphous blot of darkness travelling across his sunlight the point of view of the girl did not enter into his calculations possiblymost probably indeedhe could not conceive himself inspiring a devouring passion he knew innately he thought his limitsthe length of his tether moral intellectual and physicaland had never the least wish to affect for the sake of selfglorification a condition of mind or body that he was unable to recognise as his own this led him to that serene appreciation of his personal capabilities that passes in the eye of the world for insufferable conceit for to boast of knowing oneself is to assume a social importance on the strength of an indifferent introduction public opinion will never take one at ones own valuation it must be educated up to the point of ones highest achievement to say out i know i can do this thing is to deprive it public opinion of the right to exercise and justify itself ned however would not overestimate nor would he even nominally cheapen himself as a bid to any mans favour and that no doubt would be sound equity in the impossible absence of inherent prejudice but a judgmentin any world but a world of definite aurelian transitionsthat holds itself infallible may err in the face of fifty precedents and neds founded in this instance upon the selfprecedent of sobriety took no account of emotions that were completely foreign to his nature in short very honestly repudiating for himself any power of attraction he failed to see that this very artlessness of repudiation was per se an attractive quality now he put his resolution into force without compromise and informed his host during the second djeuner that he was on the prick of departure st denys expressed no surprise no concern very little interest most certainly said he i applaud your attitude towards life it exhibits what one may call an admirable cold cleanness probably at this point you are putting to your visit that period that most strictly conforms to the rules of moral punctuation i have too complete a belief in the rectitude of your judgment to question that of your withdrawing yourself from mricourt without superfluous ceremony i envy you indeed your power of applying without offence to the oblique turns of circumstance that simple directness which is your very engaging characteristic we less fortunately endowed by nature are for ever seeking those short cuts to a goal that delay us unconscionably in everything but theory you monsieur recognise instinctively that to fly straight for your mark is to reach your destination by the nearest route i am conscious of no particular coldness in my manner of regard said ned goodhumouredly he did not resent the implied sarcasm nor did he allow it to affect his point of view if he had given offence it was simply by his literal construction of views he had been invited to share and he could not admit the right of the dispenser of such views to put any arbitrary limit to anothers application of them unless indeed he went on it argues a constitutional sangfroid to have decided at the thinking outset of life against the despotism of passion and for a republic of senses material ethical and intellectual assuredly not but even a republic must have a president i elect my heart monsieur to the honour and give it a casting vote there at least is a little core of fire in all this frost dieu du ciel thou shouldst command a future if thou wouldst in this paris to which thou journeyest it is such as thou that have their way and keep it while we poor hotheaded impressionables take wrong turnings and fetch up struggling and sweating and trampling our friends under in villainous blind alleys to discipline your senses and keep your heart god of heaven that is a state to be envied of angels who sometimes falleven they i understand you to speak ironically i protest i do not monsieur i covet your power of unswerving fidelity to truth what would it not be worth to me in the hot days that are coming i shall go underi shall go under i feel it and know itbecause i must fight with the crooked creese of dissimulation if a straighter weapon fails me he spoke obviously with considerable emotionwith a sincerity moreover that rather than the other appealed to the englishman it appears monsieur said the latter that you predict a very serious disruption of the social order it appears indeed there is a caldron always kept seething in that unlovely kitchen of the isle de francea stockpot that for long ages has boiled down the blood and bones of the people into the thick soup affected of the beau monde but at last other things go to feed itthis reeking kettle monseigneur in his fine palace will pull a face over the flavour yet he must sup of it or starve there makes itself recognised something metallic to the taste perhaps as if the latest victims had been dropped in with their knives and pistols unremoved from their pockets maybe also there precipitates itself a thick sediment of coins to which i may claim to have contributedas also possibly i have added my mite to the combustible materialthe inflammatory pages with which a waking generation of agitators fuels this kitchen fire monsieur may live to see the pot boil may live to see it boil over even and scald the toes of the cooks but i do not believe in this pass monsieur and regret only that you should from whatever motives seek to give a sinister turn to reforms that could be more effectively compassed by a bloodless revolution monsieur were a senate of edward murks an electoral possibility i would hope to accomplish the millennium while the world slept ned looked at his host with some instinct of repulsion so here in the guise of a scatterling aristocrat was one of those seedling firebrands that were beginning to sprout all over the soil of europe like the little bickering flames that patch the high slopes of vesuvius advocates holding briefs in the indictment of society licentious pamphleteers unscrupulous journalistic hacks seizing their opportunity in the fashion for heterodoxsubordinate contributors some of them to the contumacious encyclopedia irresponsible agents all to a force they could not measure or justify to themselves by any scheme of afterreconstruction but what in heavens name induced this man to a mutinous attitude towards a social system of which by reason of his position he need take nothing but profit his opportunities of selfish gratification would not be multiplied by the sacrifice of caste and fortune he was not ned felt convinced a reformer by conviction unless the itch for cheap notoriety was the taproot of his character what was to account for this astonishing paradox what indeed yet a motiveless losel is no uncommon sight to be born with a silver spoon in ones mouth is to be endowed with what it is obviously difficult to retain it is to be awarded the prize before the race is run and that is no encouragement to sound morality or healthy effort easily acquired is soon dissipated what wonder then if fortunatus shedding wealth as naturally as he sheds his milkteeth looks to nature for a renewal of all in kind well said st denys you are going to paris it is the beaconlight about which the storm birds circle if you seek experience you will there gain it if noveltymon dieuyou will have the opportunity to see some strange puppets dance byandby and doubtless those who would hold the strings are in the clouds not so monsieur these marionettesthey will move on a different principle by trackers like an organ it may even be possible to make one or two skip touching a note here in this quiet corner of lige but i do not know when the time comes for the performance this puppetman himself may be in paris you allude to m de st denys do i but after all he is very small beer nicette sang like a bee in a flower her cot was the veritable summerhouse to a gardenvillageluxuriously cool as an eveningprimrose blossom with a ladybird and a crystal of dew in the heart of it she was always selfcontained always tranquil always fragrant her reputation like that of some other saints was founded perhaps upon her constitutional insensibility to small irritations cause and effect in her were temperament and digestionread either wayinfluencing one another serenely that sensitiveness of the moral cuticle that with the most of us finds intentional aggravations in habits and opinions that are not ours she would appear to be innocent of she never complained of nailpoints in her shoes or crumbs in her bed and that was to be bird of rare enough feather to merit distinction indifference to pain is considered none the less worshipful because it proceeds from insusceptibility to it the name of sanctity may attach itself to the most selfenjoying impassibility the moral is objective for how many dyspepticssufferersare there turning an habitual brave face to their colourless world who would be other than damned incontinent by a whole posse of devilsadvocates were a claim advanced to dub them so much as blessed this refreshing maid however was not of cloisteral aloofness all compact she had a wit for merry days and no doubt a calid spot in her heart that needed only to be blown upon by sympathetic lips to raise a heat in her that should make an intolerable burden of the very veil of modesty for such heloses an abelard is generally on the road now she was busy in her sequestered cot touching rather than putting things into order she had a gift for cleanliness her hands winnowed the dust like the fluttering wings of butterflies baptiste ostensibly occupied with his catechismbook watched her from his corner unwinking like a squatting toad he saw her pause once with her fingers stroking the back of the chair on which the stranger artist had sat yesterday a smile was on her lips then she moved into the little closet that was her sleepingplace and made her bed patting the sheets caressingly as if some child of her fancy lay underneath she will punish me if she sees me looking at her now thought the sad sharp child and he bent over his task tiens little monkey here is a biscotin for thee said mademoiselle lambertine at the door the child caught and began to devour the cake ravenously that will give thee a better relish for the food of the soul said throigne she came in languorous and flushed fanning herself with a spray of largeflowered syringa the heavy scent of it floated over the room penetrating to nicette in her retreat oh the sweet orangeblossom cried the portire is it a bride to visit me throigne stopped the action of her hand her teeth bit upon her under lip orangeblossom she exclaimed she passed into the closet dropped listlessly upon a joint stool that is not for menot yet she said it is only syringa see little minette i see throigne why do thine eyes appear to rebuke me thou little cold woman yet i think i come to visit thee for coolness sake i am so hot and dull this lodge it is like a woodland chapel and here where we sit is the confessional and art thou come into it to confess to thee to la sainte nicette i should expect her to shrink and close like a sensitive leaf to my mere approach tell mewhat is the utmost wickedness thou hast confided to thy pillow here i wager my littlest peccadillo would overcrow it it is for me to confess then it seems only thine own sweetness child this bed of thineit is planted in a garden of the soul and what grows in it little saintwhite lilies gentle pansies stainless ladysmocks not loveliesbleeding ill warrant fie throigne what nonsense thou talkest do i my head is light and my heart heavy mortality weighs upon me this morningoh nicette it weighsit weighs hast thou done wrong much and every day of my life confess to me and i will give thee absolution absolution to a woman from a woman never i think or at least saddled with such a penance as would take all savour from the grace well as thou hast made thy bed so must i lie on it what thou knowst the strangers motto little holy mother but it is true and i have made my bed nicette and it is not a bed of flowers at all ae how the world swarms with pitfalls yet at least there is today an evil the less in mricourt what evil the englishman he is gone he is gone i met him yesternoon on the lige road he had a staff in his hand and a knapsack on his shoulders nicette was at the tiny casement delicately coaxing its curtains into folds that pleased her she was too fastidious with her task to speak for a moment well she said at length it is an evil i suppose that only withdraws itself for a day or two better than that little saint he goes all the way to paris but mademoiselle throigne says he i leave my heart behind me i will come back to reclaim it in the spring in the meantime do me the favour to keep it on ice for i think mricourt is very near the tropics bah is he not an imbecile we are well quit of him in the spring nicette came round with a face like hard ivory throignewhy did he speak to you like that it is not wise or good of you to court so insolent a familiarity i did not court it and i am not wise or good mademoiselle lambertine looked startled and displeased what has come to thee nicette it is not like thee to rebuke poor sinners save by thy better example and that is a negative virtue is it not now were time perhaps that you give me the pretext to end a struggle that my heart has long maintained with my conscience throigne rose breathing a little quickly her bent forefinger to her lips nicette she cried faintly i must say it throigne this clubthis thin dust thrown into the eyes of mricourt the other went hurriedly to the door i had better go she said i cannot listen and not cry not now nicette not now i have no strengthi think the englishman has left a blight upon the place her footsteps retreated down the garden pathdied away nicette listening with a line sprung between her eyes came swiftly from her bedroom close by the door of itcrept from his stoolbaptiste his mouth agape had been eavesdropping it seemed she seized him with a raging clinch of her fingers little detestable coward she cried in a suppressed voicelittle sneak mouchard to spy like a woman how have i deserved to be for ever burdened with this millstone you hurt me whimpered the child struggling to escape not so much as the black dogs will when they come out of the well in the yard to carry you to the fire little beast i have a mind to call them now they might take you instead i will assure them you are wicked toothat i heard you say so to monsieur the englishman she shook him so that his heels knocked on the floor for the moment she was beside herself the englishman she hissedand choked estce bien possible sang dieuo sang dieu and if it were not for theehe hates childrenhe might be now she checked herself with a desperate effort she tightened her grip the boy screamed with pain be quiet she cried furiously if some one should hear thee i want them to i want them all to come in that i may tell how you pretended to be blind that monsieur might kiss you she recognised in a moment that he was goaded at last to terrible revolt she cried hush in a panic and without avail the child continued to shriek and to revile herrepeating himself hysterically in the lack of a sufficient vocabulary changing front it was only after long and frantic effort that she could coax and bribe him into silence and when at length she had induced him to a reasonable mood and could trust herself away from him she went and threw herself upon her bed and perhaps for the first time in her adult life cried empty the fountains of her wrath and her terror chapter xi consistent in his theories of selfdiscipline ned took lodgings in a poor quarter of paris with the widow gamelle madame a fruiterer in a small way of business owned a little shop of semicircular frontage that standing like a river promontory at the northwest corner of the rue beautreilliswhere that tributary ditch of humanity ran into and fed the muddy channel of the rue st antoineseemed to have rounded from sharper outline in the agelong wash of traffic wheeling by its walls from his window on the second floor the englishman thus commanded a view of two streets and indeed of three for across the main thoroughfare the rue beautreillis become now the rue royale was continued until it discharged itself into a great houseenclosed place as into a mighty reservoir of decorum built for the defecation of neighbouring vulgarities looking east moreover between the belfry towers of the convents of st marie and la croix neds vision might reach without strain the very twilight mass of the bastille so that as he congratulated himself his situation was such asbarring adventitious and unprofitable luxuriesa blood prince with any imagination might have envied him for thence often watching speculative he would see the sceneshifters of the early revolutioncome out in front of the high mute screen of the prison that closed his vista eastwards as if it were a stagecurtainbusy as bees on the alightingboard of a hive thence he would mark in real ignorance of the plot of the forthcoming piece or cycle of pieces the motley companies gathering for rehearsalthe barnstormers the heavy leads the slighted tragedians foreseeing their opportunity for the fiftieth time the inflated supers canvassing the favour of phantom houses with imagined gems of inspiration with new lamps for old in the shape of misenlightened renderings of traditional rles he would mark the gas so to speak the artificial light that informed the garish scene with spurious vitality but the prompter he could never as yet find in his place nor could he gather the true import of the play to which it must be presumed all this pretentious gallimaufry was a prelude theorists agitators pamphleteersthe open clamorous expression of that that had been suggested only to him during his hitherto wanderingsall these and all this were present to his eyes and his ears passionlessly alert at their vantagepoint on the second floor of the corner house in the rue beautreillis daily he sought to piece from the struttings and the disconnected vapourings the puzzle of present circumstance the political significance of so much apparently aimless rhetoric daily he listened for the prompters bell daily looked for the appearance of the confident author who should discipline all this swagger and rhodomontade then byandby the fancy did so master him as that he would see a veritable curtain rounding into slumberous folds in this silent west wall of the bastille a curtainwith skyarched convent buildings for prosceniumwhose every sombre crease he seemed to watch with a curious moved expectancy of the unnameable that should be revealed in its lifting for so an impression deepened in him unaccountably that beyond that voiceless veil was shaping itself the real drama of which this outer ranting was but as the wind that precedes an avalanche that suddenly and all in a moment the screen would be rent like a sullen cloud by lightning and the import of an ominous foregathering find expression in some withering organisation to which the surface turmoil had been but a blind he thought himself propheticen rapport with the imps of a national destiny but nevertheless the curtain delayed to rise while he waited though it was to go up presently to a roar that shook the world still from his window ned could enjoy to look as from a box in a theatre of varieties upon a scene of possibilities infinite to an artist he had flown from green pastures and drowsy woodswhere revolutionary propagandism however violently uttered must waste itself on remote echosurfacesstraight into a resounding city of narrow ways a paris of blusterers and mgres of controversialists and tractarians of winged treatises and fluttering pandects the streets were as full of the latter as if paperchase were the daily pastime of the populace only the hounds it seemed never ran the hares to earth and the hares themselves were march ones by every token of incoherence and surely thought the young man it is to be needlessly alarmist to read upheaval in this yeasty ferment let the bastille fall and there behind shall show nothing more formidable than the blank brick wall of the theatre but at least all his perspectives teemed with colour the national complexion he could have thought revealed itself in its hottest dyes in this quarter of the town here were no subdued tones of speech or apparel no powdered flunkeyism

appetite for un and redress was always far readier to hang a man than a joint of beefinstinctively perhaps to make him that was hard tender and to this unposturing attitude ned felt his sympathies extend here at the smallest was nakedness unashamedmaterial not as st denys would have it for indulgence but for the reordering of a world that had confusedly strayed not so far from the paths of truth to itself moreover the light the life the movement had their many appeals to his artistic perceptives these latter greatly stimulated in little mricourt found themselves ten times awake to this second dawn of experience he had never been in paris before and it was now his fate to alight and sojourn in it during an epochmaking period he did not forget his late company that indeed was for ever shadowed in the background of his mindst denys and throigne and most of all the strange little lodgekeeper whose portrait he had left unfinished but here in the very midthrong of vivid life the present so taxed his every faculty of observation so drained the inadequate resources of his skill and of his paintbox that interests foreign to the moment must not be allowed to contribute to the pressure on his time like an author in actual harness who keeps from reading books for fear of assimilating anothers style so ned forbade a thought of nicette to come between him and his canvas and assuredly his business in hand was not to paint madonnas at the same time paris wrought upon him something beneficially its numerical vastnessmore forcibly expressed by reason of the intenseness of its individual feeling than that of londonamused him with a sense of his own insignificance the conviction driven home into his mind as he turned bewildered in a snow of pamphlets that his profound theories of government were but childish essays in a craft in the complicated ramifications of which there was not a street orator but left him miles behind taught him a modesty to which he had been hitherto a part stranger but he grew in selfreliance as he dwindled in selfsufficiency and that was like exchanging fat for musclean admirable quid pro quo in a city of gauntest shadows to all the concentration of his faculties upon a seething pandemonium to all his earnest efforts to record armies of fugitive impressions and to interpret of their sumtotal the nature of the force that set them in motion madame gamelle acted in unconscious humour the part of chorus but yes she would say the philosophers have proved the world misgoverned and these that you see are the agents of the philosophers they are travellers who trade in the article of truth they teach the people to know themselves that every one may have liberty of speech that licence shall no longer be the privilege of aristocrats and you would know yourself licentious mother as to thatdo not ask me i recognise it only for an admirable creed my zole would call it so he looked to the time when he would be legally entitled to ignore the marriage vow the poor blondin he was a fine man monsieur but always unlucky he died in the heyday of his hopes leaving me the one precious pledge of his affection then she would poke the little frowzy baby on her arm with a stunted finger and nod to and address it in a strain of superfluous banter eh mon ptit godichon thou wouldst teach me to know myself in thy little dirty face fie then hast thou been seeking for my image or thine own in the basin of fine gravy soup i set aside for monsieur the lodgers dinner so it was ever with this gruesome infant its presentment or that of some part of it haunted ned through every course of an attenuated cuisine the butter would exhibit a mould of its features the milkjug a print of its lips the rolls appeared indented with suspicious crescents in the crusty parts the omelettes confessed a flavour and often an impression of a small sticky hand the creature itself moreover was a shockingly ubiquitous puck it was always being mislaid as was everything portable in the house its shrill waking cry would issue from the depths of the lodgers bed into which it had burrowed with a precocious sense of the humour of appropriation its red face rise suddenly like an october moon from behind a cloud of sacking on the floor it was brought up with the fagots and ran some narrow risks of premature cremation it was included in the weeks washing and its little fat stomach menaced with a flatiron sometimes when one opened a cupboard it would fall out in company with halfadozen plates sometimes madame would deposit it on a table and forgetting that she had done so would heap it with casual litter as she transacted her domestic business no doubt ned thought it is destined to eventual immolation in a pasty indeed his nerves were always on the jump when there was cooking forwarda lively knowledge of which fact he could by no means evade for the process being conducted on the floor above his head and it being customary with madame to let everything boil over it became a familiar experience with him to see successive samples of his menu appear and hang in sebaceous drops from a certain seasoned patch on the ceiling whence in time they would contribute their quota of peril to a perfect little slide of grease that had formed on the boards below then at such a stage it would be not unusual for his landlady to come into view pledgeonarm at the door her born face irradiated with some eagerness of triumph but only think monsieur she would begin pardon ned would interpose but is it well for the child to be gnawing that great lump of cheese cheese oh mon dieu i must have put it on the trencher thinking it was bread and he has taken it the thief then the lodger must discipline his impatience while the comestible changed hands to a shrill clamour the infant finally being deposited outside the door like boots to be cleaned only think monsieur cries the lady again the delicate compote i could have sworn to having prepared for monsieurs dinner a week ago when monsieur nevertheless had to go fasting for an entremet i was right it was made and it was not stolen this morning i find it thrust to the very back of the ovenbaked for a week and no more eatable than a brigadiers wig well all this provoked master ned into no desire to change his quarters he was a genially stoic rascal and one that could wring interest out of investments that would have repelled less imperturbable natures so through that autumn and winter and deep into the spring of he stuck to his corner of the rue beautreillis going little into the more fashionable centres of the town seeking artistic adventure like a knighterrant of the pencil and doubtless elaborately misreading in common with many thousands about him the signs that came and went like a moaning wind in the channels of the rushing life of st antoine chapter xii looking on a certain afternoon it was that of the th of november from his high perch ned saw the people of the streets to be in a more than usual state of excitement and commotion once or twice latterly it had occurred to him that the ferment of national affairs was not subsiding as he had expected it to do under the tonic treatment of the national comptrollersthat the people were bent on levying on their taxmasters a tax more stringent than any they had themselves groaned under sometimes turning as he rarely did into the palais royal and marking how in that garden of public sedition the very veil had been torn from innuendo how furious agitators each with his knot of eager listeners found applause proportionate to the daring of their vituperation how struggling hordes fought from door to counter of deseins bookshop that they might feed their revolutionary hunger with any cagmag of radicalism provided it were dressed to look raw and bloodyhe would fall curiously grave over a thought of the impotence of any known principle to precipitate passions held in such intricate solution curiously speculative as to the drifting of a rudderless bark of state for himself he was conscious of having been shouldered from all his little snug standpoints of legislative philosophy of the treadingunder of his protoplasmic theories by innumerable vigorous feet of his inadmissible claim to be allotted a portfolio in any government whatsoever of man by man he was become indeed quite humble and yet largersouled than before by reason of his content to act the part of insignificant unit in a drama the goodly developments of which he was nevertheless still confident enough to foretell and surely at this point he would have criedand that despite the augursas mirabeau cried ecstatically at a later date how honourable will it be for france that this great revolution has cost humanity neither offences nor crimes to see it brought about by the mere union of enlightened minds with patriotic intentions our battles mere discussions our enemies only prejudices that may well be forgiven our victories our triumphs so far from being cruel blessed by the very conquered themselves and indeed thought ned what reforms were ever compelled without pressure and what pressure that was considerate of the pressed was ever effective now he ran downstairs in haste to inquire of madame gamelle the reason of the popular excitement he found the good woman herself fluttered by it to an uncommon degree she put the pledge into a halfempty tub of potatoes a something despised vegetable in the france of that date that she might gesticulate the more comprehensively it is news she cried a fine facer to the notables how they will squirm the rascals we are to have the double representation it is decreed by louis the good king rather by sieyes and m dentraigues is it not oh that is the way to talk but you forget the minister of finance who shall go into the calendar of saints cheek by jowl with st antoine himself on the very noon following that of the declaration respecting the tiers etat lo there was new commotion in the streets and holiday faces and footsteps hurrying westward again ned descended and again inquired madame received him with a shrill cackle oh yes it is excitement and all excitement as you say but what infamy that i am chained to my kennel like a vicious dog what is to do then madame but this monsieur a gasballoon is to ascend from the garden of the thuilleries at two oclock ned sniggered the hubbub is extreme beyond that of yesterday and madame is cut from the enjoyment supposing then i were to take her place as fruitire that is impossible what fly has stung you but you can go yourself and report to me of the proceedings well said ned i think i will that i may learn to differentiate between the emotions of triumph and of pleasure he saw over the trees as he turned into the gardens the soft blue dome of the great envelope stretching its creases to the sunan opaline mound that glistered high and lonely as an untrodden hill summit but about the show spot itself when he reached it he could have thought twothirds of all paris collected in one vast circlewheelfely and hubthis enormous hoop of onlookers enclosed the centre of attraction on its white facesurface upturned as on the surface of a boiling geyser bubbles of myriad talk seethed and broke filling the air with reverberation winds of laughter ruffled it a sun of merriment caught the facets of its countless eyes it was a wheel of jovial fortuneof a jewelled triumphal car that had yesterday been a warchariot scythed and menacing compact of solid humanity throughout its circumference its edge was nevertheless frayed like the exterior of a clustered swarm of bees into a flitting and buzzing superficies of placeseekers thesescurrying crisscrossing sometimes settling upon and becoming part of the main body sometimes affecting a cynical indifference to a show from view of the inner processes of which their position debarred them in their formless excitement their hysteric and unmannered hunt for points of vantage their magnifying of occasion into epoch their utter lack of the sense of moral proportion of the sense to distinguish appreciably between affairs of moment and affairs of the momentexhibited as the typical traveller exhibits those national characteristics that seem as little accommodating to revolution in principle as to revolution in habit only here thought ned they are not discreditable exceptions to the national rule but fair samples of the whole a couple pausing within earshot of him engaged his attention at the instant one of these a lord of clinquant selfsatisfied arrogantlooking and dressed one might have fancied to the top bent of bourgeoisie saluted the other as a skipjack humours in himself a holiday mood of affability with an air of tolerant condescension eh indeed m david said he you profit yourself of this occasion but if i were in your position i should seize it to lie abed the person addressed stood a half minute at acrid gazehis shoulders humped and his hands gripped on the ebony crutch of his canebefore he replied he was a man of a somewhat formidable expression with redbrown hair all writhed into little curls as if a certain inner heat had warped it his eyes were hard as flints and the natural causticity and determination of his face took yet more sinister emphasis from a permanent distortion of the upper jaw whereon an accidental blow had caused a swelling that impaired his right speech and made of his very smile a wickedness his figure square and firm if inclined to embonpoint set off to advantage his suit of dark blue cloth very plain and neat with silver buttons his handkerchief and simple ruffles were spotless and about the whole man was an appearance of cold selfcontainment that was full of the conscious pride of intellectual caste my good reveillon he said at length yesterday it was decreed that the deputies of the third state should equal in number those of the nobility and of the clergy put together that was a momentous concession was it not also the eligibility for election into the second order of curs and into the tiers etat of protestants was made knowntruly all subjects for popular rejoicing doubtless then your employs leaning out of the windows of the paper factory in the rue st antoine they could not thought ned i know the place every window is barred tossed their caps into the street into the airanywhere but into your face crying vive necker and a bas les notables it is always for you to claim the privilege to speak as you paint enigmas said the other with a certain excited insolence of tone he was flushed with aggravation under the hard inquisition of the eyes that had so deliberately taken his measure true enough the rascals showed enthusiasm he cried and what then m david why you would drive them to work again would you not when the effervescence was subsided assuredly what is any effervescence but bubbles that break and vanish their business is not to discuss politics but to roll paper as it is yours to cover the sheets with hieroglyphics that i confess i do not understand when prepared well monsieur you get your price and they theirs does yours satisfy you but it might not if i charged the stuff you buy of me with the interest of time lost over irresponsible chatter on the part of my employs surely my friend here is a little spark to produce an explosion oh monsieur i can read between the lines and i am not ignorant of what may be implied in a sneer you are peintre du roi m david you have chambers at the louvre m david that is very well and it is also very well to subordinate your convictions to your prosperity so long as the sun of royalty shines on you be very careful to pick your words my pleasant reveillon said the painter already in some emotion of selfsuppression articulating with difficulty why said the papermaker waning cool as the other gathered heat is it not true then that you are a democrat what has that to do with the question it has everything monsieur if i am to understand your innuendoes it signifies of course your dogmatic advocacy of the labour as opposed to the capital side of industrial economy it signifies that in your opinion it is tyranny to enforce discipline upon any body of men who congregate for other than belligerent purposes and that any popular demonstration may serve jack smith as excuse for neglecting his work but not jack smiths master for docking the absentees wages they are always little enough said m david still very indistinct and i throw the word in your teeth cried the papermaker hotly in his turn the dispute aroused small interest amongst the near bystanders whose attention was otherwise engaged one or two however gave a pricked ear to it i am a kind master continued the angry manufacturer i dare any one to refute it how many hands do i employ monsieur do you think not a few monsieur not a few and of them all twothirds are here this afternoonhere in these gardens with permission though i suffer by it to attend the fte of the balloon he spoke the last words uncommonly loudly the painter burst into a louder laugh that distorted his face horribly my exquisite reveillon he said advancing and endeavouring to take the others arm only to be peevishly repulsed my dear soul you are admirable i see crystallised in you every chief characteristic of the latterday parisian very well said the sieur reveillon sullen and glowering see what you like i do not care to lay down ones work a moment to applaud the emancipation of a people to make a national fte of a balloon ascent he tried to affect an air of humorous dilemma but the part was beyond him oh he cried savagely paraphrasing la fontaine and stamping his foot on the ground on fit parler les morts personne ne smut by a strong effort he controlled himself good m reveillon he said understand that my wits are my employs if following your edifying example i give them an outing i must accompany them like a schoolmaster thus your penetration may divine the reason why i do not lie abed on this rare occasion of a holiday which as your plutocratship suggests should be an excuse for rest to all poor devils of workmen a young mechanic in his squalor and hungering leanness simply typical of his class hurried by at the moment eagerly seeking a place to view his roving eyes catching those of the paper manufacturer took a hostile halfanxious expression as he went on his way with a louting salutation one of the twothirds asked david a testimony indeed to the fostering kindness of the sieur papetier bah cried reveillon it is the cant the successful must always be held responsible for the ineptitude of the improvident he that passed was a journeyman and a journeyman may live very handsomely on fifteen sous aday if he is sober and prudent i have been through it and i know i have no false pride monsieur le peintre du roi i was apprenticejourneyman myselfbefore i was master as he spoke a great seething roar issued from the crowd ned who had been sketching desultorily as he listened raised his face a huge bulge of grey went up into the skya mystery of bellying silk and intricate ropes straining at a little cockleshell of a car to the explosion of guns to the frantic waving of flags and handkerchiefs to the jubilant vociferating of half a city the quasiscientific toy rose and was reflected as it sprang aloft in the pupils of ten thousand eyes the circle of the mob dilated as its components yielded a pace or so to secure the better view and the act brought the two disputants into neds close neighbourhood m reveillon for all his late colloquy was now no less hysterical than the rest of the company voil he shouted clutching at the young fellows arm spasmodically is it not a sight the very acme of sublimity behold the unconquerable enterprise of man thus committed to victory or destruction there is no middle course he is to triumph or to die his excited grasp tightened on the sleeve he held his glance travelled swiftly to and from the sketchbook on a page of which ned was endeavouring to hastily record some impression of the buoyant monster above the englishman marvelled to see this sudden eruption from so flat and commonplace a surface you can discipline yourself to draw in the face of this stupendous fascination cried the papermaker mon dieu that you had been with me at boulogne in when roziers montgolfier took fire at the height of a thousand mtres and he and romain were precipitated to the earth he never removed his hungry gaze from the mounting balloon while he talked fifteen sous aday ejaculated m davids voice to the other side of ned it was like the bursting of a shell said reveillon in a sort of rapturous retrospection we were lookingour vivats still echoed in the air the smiles with which they had parted from us were yet reflected on our faces there came a spout of flame very mean and small against the blue and little black things shot from it and fled earthwards it was fearfulheartthrilling that sound of a man falling through twothirds of a mile and the finishthe settling vibration mon dieu but i have never since missed an ascent fifteen sous aday exclaimed david but ned instinctively withdrew himself from a touch that had grown unpleasant to him the cloven hoof he thought and is to be without bowels the secret of every plutocrats success fifteen sous aday repeated david monotonously reveillon came back to earth a moment and made him an ironic bow certainly he said it is the wages of a good journeyman and more than those of many an artist who disdains to be a timeserver the disintegrated crowd swarming abroad like a disturbed knot of newly hatched spiders surrounded and absorbed him m le peintre du roi summoned neds attention peering over his shoulder it is an insolent parvenu he said a philistine double damned for grinding the faces of the poor permit me the privilege to look monsieur an artist is known by his performance there is a severity here that entirely commends itself to me chapter xiii neds chance meeting with the painter whose art was then much exciting in a characteristic freak of perversity the enthusiasm of his fellowcitizens was the prelude to a strange little camaraderie between the two that so long as it held was full of positive and negative instruction to the younger man it came about in this way that absorbed in the discussion of a topic of common interest the gentlemen left the thuilleries gardens together m david accompanying ned eventually to the rue beautreillis at the door of the fruiterers shop the famous artist held out his hand bluntly you have the right religion he said in an artificial world the cleanest art shall prevail we can have no standard of truth but what we set ourselves strip the model then of all meretricious adornments monsieur i shall take the liberty to call upon you he came indeednot once but often walking over from his studio in the louvre dropping in at unexpected times criticising the methods the actual performance of the englishman and even condescending now and again to add to a sketch or canvas a few touchestechnical mastery without imaginationthat resolved in a moment a difficulty long contended with through all he would never cease to expound his views on right art and governmentto him inseparable words in the condition of national sanity and both drawn in their purity from the fountainhead of the spqr at its strictest period most often he would discourse gazing his hands behind his back from the window and sometimes quite aptly illustrating his homilies with types drawn from the human mosaic of the st antoine below him m david was at this time some forty years of age an academician the acknowledged and popular leader of classic revivalism he was fashionable moreover and had just completed mettant la main sur sa conscience a royal commission for a brutus courted prosperous and respected some moral myosis must still distort to his inner vision all the admiration he evoked he would make his profit of patronage secretly raging over the opulent condescension that his cupidity would not let him be without he would see double entendre in the applause of the social lite yet hunger for it cursing himself that the vital flame of his selfconfidence must be dependent on such fuel for its warmth for in truth he was the tumid bug of vanity bursting with the very scarlet adulation that his instinct told him was inimical to the artistic life and other than its natural food contributing to or proceeding from this insane desire of selfaggrandisement his professional and political convictions he could not disassociate the two ran in a restricted channel but who shall distinguish in any complaint that is accompanied by an unnatural condition of the nerves between cause and effect so m davids resentment of patronage may have inclined him to a creed of classic socialism or his classic proclivities may have prejudiced him against the presumptions of selfqualified rank in any case he had twisted his theories artistic and political into one thin cord to discipline or hang mankind withal and was as narrow a fanatic as was ever prepared to crucify the disputant that ventured to question his infallibility now at the outset ned fell into some fascination of regard for this casual acquaintance of his his credo social and technical would appear to jumpits first paces at leastwith m davids moreover the glamour that naturally informed the presentment of a notable personality condescending to the regard of a tyro who could boast no actual claim to its notice induced him no doubtunder this influence of a flattery indirectly conveyedto an attitude of respectful consideration towards certain foibles in the stranger that on the face of them seemed irreconcilable with the highest principles of morality it was not so long however before his mind began to misgive him that his halfgod was clayfootedthat here indeed was but another inevitable example of that subjective inconsistency that seems so integral a condition of the gallic temperament then it is a fact he thought that one can never start to conjugate a frenchman but one finds him an irregular verb where universal exceptions are to prove the rule what rule is possible anarchy and nothing else is the logical outcome of it all for m david would cry to him in a republic of truth every unit must be content to contribute itself unaffectedly to the full design yet as ned came to know was no man more greedy than this academician for vulgar notorietynone more sensitive to criticism or more resentful of a personal slight so he m david would preach not plausibly but wholemindedly a religion of purity and cleanlinessa religion of beauty material and intellectual whose very ritual should be gregorian in its sweet austerity such were his professions and nevertheless in the height of his revolutionary popularity he did not scruple to introduce into his pictures details that pandered to the most sordid lusts for the grotesque and the horribleto generally indeed stultify his own declarations of belief by acts that no ethics but those of brutality could justify finally it was in the disgust engendered of a flagrant illustration of such inconsistency that the young englishman after some months of gradual disenchantment cut the kings painter fled for solace of a haunting experience eastwards again and snuffing with some new emotion of relish the frankincense of green woods hugged himself over a thought of his seasonable escape from that national sphinx of caprice to symbolise whom in a word one must draw upon modern times for the cussedness of wall street yet even then had he but foreseen it he was backing while dodging scylla into the very deadly attraction of charybdis in the meanwhile autumn stole footsore like a loveless wife in the track of summer she was swart and powdered not la mode de versailles drouthy too yet with a cry to shrill piercingly in every street of every town of france the dust of her going rose and penetrated through chinks and doorways it overlay the pavements so thickly that one might have thought it the accumulation of that that agelong ministers had thrown in the eyes of the people the very precipitate of tyranny it clung hot and acrid to the walls of all living palaces of all princely monuments to the dead as if it were the expression of that proletariat censorship that would obliterate the very records of a hateful past it was the condensed breath of destruction settling in a stringent dew and it might have been exhaled from the ten thousand brassy throats that made clamour in the highways ten thousandfold great because they were the resonant throats of starved and empty vessels for the elections were on and what if bread were dearer than money if his chosen representative was in every mans mouth so through broil and famine the city of paris echoed to its blazing roofs with jangle jubilant and acclamatory inasmuch as the noproperty qualification gave every honest man a chance of being governed by a rogue and what prospect in a nation of contrarieties could be more humorously enticing then upon this drouth and this uproar ned saw the steel glaive of winter smite with a clang that brought ironic echoes from the hollow granaries it fell swift and sudden and the clamour under the lashing of the blade took a new tone of terror the wail of despairing souls defrauded of their right atmosphere of hope for who could look beyond the present with the thermometer below zero with the prospect blotted out by freezing mists with the thin shadows of pining women and children always coming between one and the light with ones own brain clouded with the fumes of dearth yet the elections went on but now in a sterner spirit of desperationof insistent watchfulness too that no hardwrung concession should be juggled to misuses under cover of mistifying skies of much misery that neighboured on the wretchedest quarters of a wretched city ned was from his position cognisant the sight shook his stoicism and greatly contributed to the disruption st denys and m david negatively helping of a certain baseless little house of toy bricks that his boyish vanity had conceived to be an endurable system builded by himself i have been a philosophe not a wise man he thought life is not a chessboard its each next step plain to the clean thinker now it was the sight of the children that secretly wrung his heart these poor sad babies disciplined on a primary code of naughtiness and retribution merit and reward marvelling from sunken eyes that they should be so punished for no conscious misbehaviour patiently nevertheless retaining their faith in god and man and making a playball of the bitter earth that stung their hands and shrivelled under their feet well they died perhaps by hundreds when the snow was in the streets and let them go said m david there shall be others to follow byandby as to these warped and demoralised they would not prosper the regeneration of the earth we want a clean race and no encumbrances that was his philosophyadmirably roman as he intended it to be it did not suit ned there is more to be learnt from a cripple than an athlete said that person boldly i would sooner for my own sake study in this school of st antoine than in yours of the louvre m david truly every artist to his taste said the academician with an unsightly grin and it was neds taste to give of his substance royally and pityingly when a voice cried in his ear of cold and famine ah le genereux anglais wept madame gamelle he has kept the wolf from my door would that all mothers could secure to their dear rogues such a fairy godfather as he has been to my cherished one without doubt said m david he has preserved to you for your virtues the blessing of an encumbrance that byandby shall devour you madame must laugh and protest against this inhuman sarcasm for the great painter despite his austerity had a masterfully admiring way with women that derived from the serpent in eden here then to prove it no sarcasm is my contribution to the cause he says and places a sou in the pledges fat hand but ned went his way uninfluenced of sardonic counsels when this horror relaxes he thought in the spring i will go back to mricourt i shall be able then perhaps to paint a madonna with a human soul the spring came the ice melted on the seine but it did not melt in the breasts of an electorate hardened by suffering consolidated in the very winter of its discontent but now at least ned could sometimes watch from his window without dread of having his soul harrowed by the desolation and misery of its prospectcould watch the fire of the sun burning up a little and a little more each day with the rekindled fuel of hope now it happened that thus observing he was many times aware of m david mingling with the throng below going with it or against it strolling his hands behind his back with the air of an architect who cons the effect of his own shaping work this may have been a fancy yet it was one that dwelt insistently with the onlooker that haunted and disturbed him with presentiment of evil as month succeeded month and the vision fitfully repeated itself what attraction so spasmodically drew the man to this quarter of the town not mr murk himself for now the little regard of each for each was severed by some trifling outspokenness on the part of the englishman and the painter had long ceased of his visits to the fruiterers shop in the rue beautreillis ned for some unexplainable reason was troubled once he was aware of m david moved from his accustomed deliberation walking very rapidly in the wake of a man who sped unconscious of the chase before him ned identified the stranger as he turned off down a bystreet it was reveillon the prosperous paper merchant he had happened on on the day of the balloon ascent m lacadmicien follows the man like his shadow he thought pondering this was in april when the shadows indeed were beginning to strengthen in darkness then one morning he started awake to the sound of huge uproar in the streets the curtain of the bastille had not risen but it had been pulled aside a little as it were to make passage to the forestage of the revolution for certain supers who were to represent the opening chorus these came swarming through in extraordinary numbers an earnest of what should be revealed in the complete withdrawal of the screen they seemed violently inspired but most imperfectly drilled and the weapons they handled were not stage properties by any means and their object was just thisto pull about his ears the factory of a certain m reveillon who had been heard to say that a journeyman could live very comfortably on fifteen sous aday the execrated building was not so far from the rue beautreillis but that the hubbub in the air shook the very glass of neds windows he dressed hastily and ran out into the street turning into the rue st antoine that was half choked with a chattering hooting mob hurrying westwards he stumbled over the heels of a man who immediately preceded him with an apology on his lips he hesitated and cried aloud st denys even when the stranger disclaimed the title with a wonder in his eyes unmistakably genuine ned could hardly bring himself to realisation of his mistake true his acquaintance with the belgian had been brief enough to admit of subsequent events clouding its details in his memory yet that he could have thought was vivid to recall characteristics of feature and complexion quite impressive in their way here were the bright bold colouring the girlish contour of face the brown eyes and the rough crisp gold of unpowdered hair here were the shapely stature the little fopperies of dress even the actual confidence of expression only as to the latter perhaps a certain soul of sobriety an earnestness of purpose revealed themselves in the present instancea distinction to justify a world of difference a thousand apologies said ned i can hardly convince myself even now i will presume you flatter me monsieur said the other with a blithe smile my name is suleau at your service pardon me i must hurry on ned detained him a moment let me entreat you monsieurthis heat this uproar what is it all about what indeed monsieur france i think rolls on its back with its feet in the air a manufacturer of paper says that his hands can live very well if they choose on fifteen sous aday hhe ought to know but they wish to gut his premises nevertheless these new evilsmelling apostles of liberty pardon will you come with me i cannot wait i am a reporter a journalist a scribbler against time and my own interests you are not of the popular party ah monsieur mon dieu monsieur but i have a sense of humour remaining to me for all that is serious i am a feuillant he spoke the last to deaf ears ned had fallen behind blackly pondering this david he muttered that heard reveillon say the words and that has haunted the st antoine of latethis david and with the thought there was the man himself coming slowly on with the crowd past him the englishman planted his shoulder against the torrent and managed to sidle alongside the painter hem jacqueslouis davidcarried a very enigmatical smile on his face the physical malformation of which however served him for conscious misinterpreter of many moods now it expressed no disturbance over his contact with a person who had offended him good day said he m david said ned i do not forget what enraged you with m reveillon in the thuilleries gardens i think you are a scoundrel m david the other did not even start much less did he condescend to refute the sudden charge but he cocked his head evilly as he walked have you considered he said that if what you imply be true which i do not admit you are insulting a general in the presence of his bodyguard if what i imply be true retorted ned hotly i can understand your indulging any brutal and contemptible vindictiveness perhaps in his strenuous indignation he might have struck at the vicious creature beside him but the crowd at that moment violently surging forward swept him anywhere from his place and saved him the consequences of a foolish impulse now he would fain have turned and escaped from the press lest by any selfmisconception his conscience should accuse him of lending his countenance to an iniquity for he saw that such was planned and determined on and for the first time there awoke in his heart some shadowy realisation of the true import of certain monthslong signs and significances he would have turned he could not he was wedged in carried forward rushed to the very outer core of the congested block of frowsy humanity that stormed and spat and shrieked under the high dull walls of the factory here perhaps his national selfsufficiency was his somewhat arrogant counsellor what has this man done he cried to those about him but exemplify that right to liberty of speech which you all demand a dozen loathing glances were turned upon him savage oaths and ejaculations contested the opportuneness of so reasonable a sentiment but it was not st antoines way now or at any time to approve counsel for the defence only a cry a sinister one then first beginning to be heard in the streets broke out here and there down with the aristocrat there was threat of a concentric movement upon the englishman he felt it as a moral pressure even before his immediate neighbours began to close inwards one of the latter had a similar consciousness apparently she was a coarse fat poissarde and the shallow groove that was her waist seemed moulded of the very habit of her truculent arms folded in front of her eh my little radishes she cried in a voice like a corncrakes advance you come thencome here is a cat shall strip you of your breeches if you venture within her reach ned felt and the crowd looked astonishment over this unexpected championship in the momentary proximate silence that befell the shattering explosion of many of m reveillons windows bursting under volleys of stones was a significantly acute accent the fishwife nodded her head a great number of times h my little rats you will not come that is well for your whiskers indeed and do we not demand liberty of speech as monsieur says and are we not taking it to denounce one that would deprive us of the liberty to live how you would raise the devil against monsieur she waxed furious in an instantmonsieur langlais that all the hard winter has lived like a jacobin friar that he might give of his substance to the cold and the starving monsieur langlais that lodges at the fruiterers and without whose help fanchon and her brat had been rotting now in st plagie oh san dieu i knowi know pigs beasts ingrates it will be well in truth for the first that comes within my reach a rolling laugh that swelled to a roar took up the very echo of madames surprising tirade vive langlais the friend of the poor the apostle of liberty shrieked twenty voices too amazed by this sudden rightabout of a national weathercock to protest against its misrepresentation of the direction of his own little breeze of righteousness ned made no resistance when all in a moment he felt himself tossed up on billowing shoulders and conveyed helplessly from the thick centre of operations the clamour of hairy throats exhaling winey fustian about him staggered his brain he had not even that selfpossession left him to blush to find his stealthy goodness famous and when the escort landed him at madame gamelles door and with hurried vivats testified to his immediate popularity he could think of no more appropriate remark to make to them than i protest messieurs that i have never travelled so high in others or so low in my own opinion before which inasmuch as it was fortunately spoken in english and accompanied by a profoundly ironical bow served the occasion as gracefully as much compliment would have done feeling at first something like a venturesome infant that had strayed beyond bounds only to be caught back and kissed ned mounted to his room to await events they came thick and swift enough to half induce him to a redescent upon the scene of action that temptation he overcame but all day long and far into the evening he wandered restless and apprehensive in the rue st antoine watching its turbulent course at the flood feeling a sympathetic attraction to the electricity of its moods conscious of the shock of something enacting or threatening to enact about that congregated spot where the tumult was heaviest still with the passing of day came no abatement of the popular fury but rather an accumulating of menace and thereupon m le baron besenval commandant of paris having arrived at his decision down swooped upon the scene a little company of thirty bronzed and brazen french guards in their royal chevrons and military coxcombs which company clearing intestinal congestion by measures laxative readjusted the order of affairs and persuaded exhausted patriots to their burrows to his bed also went ned reassured and slept profoundly and confidently as a rescued castaway but waking on the morrow lo there was renewal of the uproar shaking his windows but now as if it would splinter the very glass in its frames the cause when he came to examine was not far to seek st antoine a very confraternity of weasels baulked but not baffled was returned to the attack and at this last it was evident that the papermakers premises were damned indeed the complaint of democracy had suffered a violent relapse during the night and now in the new dawn it blazed and crackled like a furnace the streets the roofs the windows were massed with writhing shapes the whole quarter jangled in a thunder of voices a pelt of indifferent missiles deadly only in the context rained without ceasing upon the accursed walls ned paused a moment swirled like a straw in the current of rushing humanity to take stock of possibilities if it is so they resent a hasty word thought he god save paris in the hour of reprisal he felt a little sick at heart he would look no more i will spend an idle day in the fields of passy he assured himself and forget it all and return in the evening to find the storm blown over he went out by way of the place st paul walking along the line of quays and watching something with the tender feeling of a convalescent the golden frost of sunlight that gemmed the waters of the seine it was a fair sweet morning too innocent it seemed to take account of human passions and byandby its influence so far wrought upon him as that he was able to commit himself to it with some confidence of enjoyment all about him moreover life seemed pleasurably normalnot significant of fear and apprehension as his soul had dreaded to find it but with the approach of dusk his innate misgivings must once more gather force till they knocked like steam in his arteries and so dreading he lingered over his return until deep dark had closed upon the town at the barrier he heard enough to confirm his disquiet though the reports of what had happened were so formless and contradictory as to decide him to refer inquiry to the evidence of his own senses therefore in silence and heartquaking he made his way eastwards and presently turned into the dark intricacy of squares that led up to the rue beautreillis the street when he reached it seemed given over to the desolation of night the taller houses slept pregnant with austerity as vast assyrian images the lamps rocking drowsily in their slings blinked one could have thought to squeeze the slumber from their eyes distant sounds there were but none proceeding from points nearer in suggestion than the far side of dawn byandby however onea little gurgling noise like the sob of a gutterslid into neds consciousness as speeding forward his footsteps rang out a very chime of echoes almost in the same moment he was upon it or upon its place of issuea ragged huddle of shapes pulled into the shadow of a buttress a clawing figure gaunt and unclean rose at himrecognised him in the same instant apparently and gave out a bestial cry she is going monsieur may god wither the hand that beat her down and may the soul of him that directed it scream in everlasting hell he seized the young mans sleeve and drew him reluctant forward the huddle of frowzy things parted that he might see the coarse large poissarde the ally who had yesterday cherished his cause and sung his praises the great breathing truculent woman with the defiant voice here was the gross material of so much vigour collapsed mangled and flung aside the little choking noise was accounted for there was a crimson rent in the womans throat she died while ned was looking down upon her and this mad thing that spat at the sky doubtless he was her husband and he might have been a royal duke from the freedom of his language what does it mean cried ned hoarsely one of the groping shapes snarled up at him it is an instance of monseigneurs paternal kindness to his people there was nothing to be answered or done the englishman emptied his purse to the group and hurried on his worst apprehensions were realised this was but a sample of what was to followa vision to be repeated again and yet again in indefinite forms rebellion had broken and suppurated away during his absence there were some four or five hundred dead bodies shot and stabbed as earnest of its drastic treatment by the national physicians there might have been more but that the mob had finally given before m besenvals switzers with their grapeshotted cannon then it retired pretty satisfied however to have justified democratic frenzy by so practical an illustration of the tyranny of class hatred satisfied also as to the moral of its own retreat m reveillon was become a selfconstituted prisoner in the bastille his factory was a shapeless and clinkerous medley of rubbish ned turning the corner of the rue beautreillis saw the ruins dusking and glowing fitfully at a little distance and how he thought with a shuddering emotion did he that was so fascinated by the man roziers fate regard the burning of his own ark of security the streetso it seemed in the expiring red glimmer and the small dull radiance of bracketed lampswas a very dismantled graveyard of broken stones and scattered corpses amongst the latter moved detached groups of searchers languidly official swinging ghostly lanterns with a groan of lamentation ned turned about and beat frantically on the closed shutters of the fruiterers shop the door was opened after a weary interval by madame gamelle the womans eyes were febrile she dragged her lodger over the threshold and snapped the lock behind him a couple of rushlights burned dimly on the counter the pledge in holiday antic was stuffing a bloody cartouchebox with onions from a basket they killed him at the street corner said madame gloatingly he shall never murder againthe accursed garde franaise they had for knives only the sharp tiles from the roofs but it was easy to willing arms she was transfigured this meek vendor of cabbages anywhere to scratch st antoine was to find a devil madame said ned wearily it is all quite right without doubt but tomorrow i must tell you i am to take my leave of paris chapter xiv mr murk was suffering from a toujours perdrix of politics he needed he felt a prolonged constitutional both to clear his brain of a certain bloodweb that confused its vision and to enable him to sort in fair communion with the republic of nature his own somewhat scattered theories of government he was really unnerved indeed by what he had seen and experienced and the prospect of quiet woods and pastures was become dear to his soul he would return to mricourt as he had promised himself he would do in the sweet spring weatherto mricourt where the play of machiavelism was but a pastoral comedy after all he would return to mricourt and paint into the unfinished eyes of his madonna the fathomless living sorrow of doubtthe son being deadas to their own divinity of the two hundred miles to traverse he walked the greater numbersometimes in leisurely sometimes in hurried fashion as the chasing dogs of memory slept or tracked him but tramp as he would he could not regain that elasticity of heart that once so communicated itself to the spirit in his feet he had gone to paris blithe and curious he was returning as the idiom expresses it with a foot of nose in eight months the spouting grass seemed to have lost its spring may with all its voices could not charm him from foul recollections the gloom of slumbering forests was full of murder now for the first time he realised how the great peace he often paused to wistfully look upon was natures not his how flatter his soul as he might with a pretence of its partnership in all the noble restfulness that encompassed it it stood really an alien isolateda suffering selfconscious inessential having no kinship with this material sweet tranquillityseparated from it in fact by just the traverseless width of that very conscious ego he felt like satan alighted for the first time in view of eden only to recognise by what plumbless moat of knowledge he was excluded from its silent lawns and orchards this feeling came to him in his worst moods in his best he could take artistic joy of those effects of cloud and country that called for no elaborate detail in the delineatingthat were distant only proportionately less than the distant unrealities of the stars in the sky for the impression of outlawry in a world that was only mans by conquest was bitten into his soul for all time and never again since that night spent in the shambles of st antoine should he recover and indulge that ancient sense of irresponsibility towards his share in the conduct of mans usurped estate we are he thought squatters disputing with one another the possession of land to which we have each and all no title neverthelesstherefore ratherhis soul acknowledged the opposite to disenchantment in its review of nature unconverted to misuse not before had pathos so sung to him in the warm throatnotes of birds so chimed to him in the tumble of weirs so looked up into his face from the fallen blossom on the grass he might have found his healing of all things at the time had love appeared to him in sympathetic guise over the last stages of his journey he took diligence to lige and at the end of a long weeks ramble set foot once more in the old sunbaked town thence on a gentle evening he turned his face to mricourt and in a mood half humour half sadness retraversed the hills and dingles of a pleasant experience somehow he felt as if he were returning a confident prodigal to ancient haunts of beauty and kindliness he had proceeded so far as to have come within a half mile of the village when in thridding his way through a sombre wedge of woodland he was suddenly aware of a figurea womansflitting before him round a bend in the path there was that in his momentary glimpse of the form that led him to double his pace so as to overtake it this he had no difficulty in doing though for a minute it seemed as if the other were anxious to elude him but finding no doubt the task beyond her she stopped and turned of a sudden into a leafy embrasure set in the trackedge and stood there awaiting his coming her head drooped and her back to a green beechtrunk throigne cried ned nearly breathless throigne lambertine why do you stop me she said panting and in a low voice you know the way to mricourt monsieur he felt some wonder over her tone dont you wish me to speak to you then have you already forgotten me she did not answer or raise her face throigne he protested pleading like an aggrieved boy and little as i saw of you i have felt in returning to mricourt as if i were coming back to old friends i have had enough of paris and its horrors throigne at that she looked up at him for the first time he was amazed and all concerned the glowing rich defiant beauty he had last seen and thiswhite fallen and desolatethe face of a haunted creature what is the matter he whispered what has happened to you paris she said in a febrile voice ah yes monsieuryou come from paris and did you see there she checked herself struck her own mouth savagely with her palm then suddenly gripped at the young mans wrist what are they doing in paris is it there as he prophesiedthe reign of honour and reason the reign of pleasure the emancipation of the wretched and oppressed he will be a fine recruit to the cause of so much republican virtue she breathed quickly a smouldering fire blazed up in her her very voice that had seemed to ned starved like her beauty gathered to something the remembered volume he who said he she took no notice of the question but went on in great excitement what are these horrors that you speak of have you seen them what are they i say do they tear aristocrats limb from limb this truth that he used to preachmy god there is no hope for the world until they massacre them each one that who used to preach said ned quite shocked and bewildered liars liars liars cried the girl striking hand into hand then suddenly she had flung herself round against the tree and in a storm of tears had buried her head in her arms go she cried in a muffled voice why do you come back with the other memories why do you notice or speak to me can you not see that i am accursedan outcast he would have essayed to comfort to reassure her her wayward passion took his breath away even while he hesitated she turned upon him once more are you not also of the haute noblesse what truth or honour or courage can be in you then yes courage monsieur you have fled because you were afraid they would kill you as he fled before his pursuing conscience you will not tell me the truth because you are shamed in its revelation my god what cowards are you all but only say to me that he is deadstabbed to the heartand i will fall down and kiss your feet to ned standing there dumfoundered came an inkling of a tragedy that suleau he was thinking half mazed did he jockey me and was it st denys after all he looked at the stressed and wildwrought creature before him in sombre pity so m de st denys has left mricourt he said gravely at that mademoiselle lambertine broke into a shrill laugh m de st denys but who spoke of m de st denys it was he was it not that waived his privileges of honour that he might be on a level with us that have none and why should he leave mricourt where he was ever a model and an example of all that he preached it cannot have been he then that i saw in paris the girl gasped stared and took a forward step you saw him and he was amongst the killed throigne monsieur monsieur we have heard how the people rose we are not here at the bounds of the earth but it was no slaughter of aristocrats she gazed at him dumbly with feverish eyes then sighed heavily shook her head and moved out into the open so you come again to mricourt she said you will find it wonderfully changed in these few months now we are possessed by a devil and now we are under the dominion of a saint there is an idol deposed and a holy image raised in its place will you be walking monsieur or shall i go first we will go together she laughed again with a shrill mocking sound mother of god what an admirable persuasiveness have these aristocrats i had thought myself beneath his notice and behold he would make me his companionand in the face of the village too come then monsieur will you take your paillarde on your arm he listened to her with some compassion for all her wild speech he thought her heart was choked with accumulated tears then moved forward and walked along the woodland path by her side to his few questions she returned but monosyllabic answers presently howeverwhen they were come out within view of the village fountain where neds first meeting with her had taken placeshe stayed him with a hand upon his sleeve as she makes her bed so must she lie on it you see i remember your words monsieur and if she has made her bed as the virtuous disapprove in england she may yet lie soft on it without doubt in england or elsewhere so long as she lives only for the present ah little mother of god but how natural to these aristocrats comes the preachingcant all in a moment her eyes and her speech softened most wooingly and she put up her hands in a characteristic coaxing manner to the young mans breast i am ill and weary now she said it is not good to suffer long the hatred of ones kinsfolk the gibes of ones familiars but in another atmosphere i should learn to resume myselfat least to resume all that of me that concerns the regard of men the result would be worth the possessing monsieur monsieur when you return to england will you take me with you as she spoke a light step sounded coming up the meadowpath before mentioned that ran into the head of the woodland it approached throigne with a conscious look fell back a little and immediately moving staid and decorous over the young grass the white lodgekeeper of the chateau came into view she suffered ned could see one momentary shock of indecision as her eyes encountered his then she advanced and without a word went on her way into the wood but as she passed she acknowledged neds salutation with a grave little inclination of her head and with the act was not forgetful to withdraw her skirts from contact with those of mademoiselle lambertine who for her part shrank back and made not the least show of protest or resentment ned however regarded with some twinkle of amusement the slowpacing figure till it was out of sight and then he only turned to throigne with a questioning look the girl came up to him again but doubtfully now it seemed and with a certain wide awe in her eyes you must not say it monsieur she whispered you must not say what i can read on your lips she has seen the blessed virgin since you were last herehas seen and spoken with her god forgive me for a scoffer and that is why she is all in blue i suppose and why her blue skirt must not touch hems with your red one throigne hung her head when does monsieur return to england she said only ned clasped his hands behind his head and stretched vigorously very soon i think mademoiselle throigne i am tired of you all very soon i think she made as if she would have touched him again but he gently put her away from him at that she looked up in his eyes very forlorn and pleading mademoiselle throigne said he i do not know or ask you your story here since i left all flowers seem to have run to a seed that is best not scattered abroad i cannot of course prevent your going to london if you choose only for myself i must tell you that myself is at present as much as i can undertake to direct and govern besides it is not at all likely that you would find him there in an instant she was again all scorn and passion her lip lifted and showed her teeth she humped her shoulders her hands clinched in front of her not to understand she cried that that is my very reason for desiring the refuge of your barbarous land to escape from myself and the murder in me but why leave mricourt at all the blight of her fury was as sudden as the blast that springs from a glacier may you know what it is to roll in a trough of spikes and find no release in your agony cold passionless insolent lazarus to refuse to dip your finger in water but i will go in spite of you i will go monsieur and laugh and snap my fingers in your face permit me to say said ned coolly that this is a very foolish and unnecessary exhibition of temper but she flounced round her shoulder and ran from him storming and crying out and disappeared down the track leading to her home and as for himhe went on to the landlust chapter xv during the course of his short journey from the woodskirt to the inhospitable hostelry of his former acquaintance ned could have thought himself conscious of an atmosphere vaguely unfamiliar to his recollections of mricourt these were not at fault he felt convinced because of climatic changes because of an aspect of seasonable reinvigoration in a place that he had last seen sunk in lethargy because of an increase in the number of people he saw moving in the street even they recognised themselves astray rather over a spirit of demure gravitya chosen tribe smugness of expression so to speakthat seemed to inform with pharisaic minauderie the faces of many of those he passed by and even he fancied he could distinguishin the absence of this selfimportant mienstrangers of whom there were not a few from those that were native to the hamlet there seemed in short an air of wandering expectancy abroadalmost as if the unregarded village committed hitherto to a serene isolation were become suddenly a field for prospectors ready to exploit anything from a threelegged calf to a sainte nitouche conversing couples hushed their voices as he went by their eyes stealthily scanning him as one that had ventured without justification within a consecrated sanctuary a berline stood drawn up by the greenside its occupants two fashionable ladies from lige converted from the latest fashion in hats to the last in emotionalism the blacksmith in his little shop under the walnuttree familiarly rallied his creator from stentorian lungs as he clanked upon his anvil across the place the ineffective cur was to be seen escorting a party towards the church and over allvisitors and inhabitantswent the sweet laugh of may blowing abroad the scent of woods and blossoms ned turned into the landlust feeling somehow that his dream of rest was resolved into a droll nor once within was he to be agreeably disillusioned in this respect the van roon seemed to positively resent his recursionto regard him in the light of an insistent patient returning on trifling provocation to a hospital from which he had been discharged as cured what you again she cried sourly one would think moogsieur had no object in life but to canvass the favour of mricourt ned the yet imperturbable answered with unruffled gallantry indeed in all the course of my travels i have never seen anything to admire so much as madame in the conduct of her business whichever way i have looked since my departure it was always she that filled my perspective if that is the same as your stomach said madame rudely you will have found me hard of digestion at least i am hungry now that is a pity you shall pick lenten fare in the landlust in these days is it not rather a question of payment madame no it is not she snapped out viciously moogsieur imposes his custom on me he may take or refuse what do i care then we have nowadays other things to think of than to pamper the gross appetites of worldlings a thousand pardons is not that a strange confession from an innkeeper you may think so if you like it makes no difference to charge an egg with the price of a full mealwhere one is willing to pay itit simplifies matters does it not anyhow to be served by one of the elect it is i that speak to youthat is a privilege your betters appreciate at its value well said ned i am at sea and i have a mariners appetite give me what you will madame she accepted him as once before with a sort of surly mistrust a former unregenerate friend of his she said was seated in the common kitchen he had best join this person while his meal was preparing thither much marvelling over all he had heard and been witness of ned consequently bent his steps he had not expected much of the landlust but this exceeded his devoutest hopes it had the effect also of arousing in him something of a wicked mood of indocility entering the long room the first object to meet his eyes was the sizar of lige university the little round man sat at the table a glass of eau sucre by his elbow a pipe held languidly between his teeth an expression of profound melancholy was settled on his features he looked as forlorn as a tropic monkey cuddling itself in an east wind at the sight of mr murk he started and half rose to his feet the devil he muttered and addednot so inconsequently as it appearedyou are welcome to mricourt monsieur ned laughed is it so bad as that said he and has he become such a stranger here in these months the other beckoned his old enemy quite eagerly to a seat you have not heard monsieur it is improbable without doubt yet mricourt is at the present moment the centre of much reverent attraction is it you shall tell me about it little boppard yet you yourself are reprobate i hear and you will have your debauch of sugar and water in reply the poor body whispered in quite a chapfallen and deprecating manner i am of nature a thirsty soul monsieur i must take my smoke like the turk through bubbles of liquid what then this is not my choice but it is expected of us in these days of spiritual elevation to drink at the fountain of life or not at all there are different interpretations as to the character of the fountain each is a schism to all others no doubt mine i confess is not of sweet water ned spoke and rapped peremptorily on the table m boppards little eyes glinting with prospicience took an expression of nervous admiration of this daring alien ah monsieur he cried in fearful enthusiasm do not go too far this is not the joyous landlust of your former knowledge the type of extravagant hospitality the club of excellent fellowship things have happened since you were here now we drink eau sucre or worse still the clear water of regeneration itself cordials and cordiality are dreams of the past his voice broke on a falling key a scared look came over his face the cowlike girl had opened the door and stood on the threshold mutely waiting a bottle of maon said ned and giving his order saw with the tail of his eye the students countenance change a half bottle he corrected himself and also a double dose of cognac the girl stood as stolid on end as a pocket of hops do you hear said ned she blinked and lifted her eyelids a sort of drowsy exaltation appeared in these days the very accent to her large inertiaits selfjustification in fact before some visionary consistory of saints do you hear said ned again with particular emphasis it is not permitted to get tipsy in the landlust said she like one talking in her sleep ned jumped to his feet quite violently take my order he shouted or ill come and kiss every woman in the house beginning with madame van roon she vanished suddenly terrified in a whisk of skirts and the door clapped behind her the young gentleman laughed and resumed his seat so mricourt has found grace said he and grace is not necessarily to be gracious it seems yet you still come here and why m boppard the student shook his head his face had grown much happier in a certain prospect why do i monsieur can i say of a truth it ceases to be the place of my affections yeti do not know the bird will visit and revisit its robbed nest will sit on the familiar twig and call up perhaps a vision of the little blue eggs in the moss i have been content here i cling doubtless to the old illusions that are vanished amongst which is the club of natures gentry hush the wine was brought in as he spoke for what reason soever neds argument had prevailed probably decorum would not risk a scene dangerous to its reputation hush murmured the sizar twinkling and portentous in one when they were left alone again it is vanished as monsieur says it ceased morally and practically with the disappearance of m de st denys whither has he gone then it is supposed to paris and may the curse of god follow him ned paused in the act of drinking what do you say m boppard he was a liar monsieur he used us to his purpose and when that was accomplished he flung us aside and his purpose the sizar dropped his voice to a whisper our queen monsieur he said our queen that represented to us the beautiful ideal of all our most passionate aspirations he seemed to avow in his attitude towards her the sincerity of his code of honourable socialism he lied to us all he converted her nobility to the uses of a common intrigue and from the consequences of his crime he fled like a coward and left her to bear the curses of her people and the sneers of the community yes said ned and he took a long draught for he was thirsty indeed he had foreseen all this the students eyes filled with tears she was much to usto me this mademoiselle lambertine he said pitifully if there were mercy in the world she should have been allowed to bury her dishonour with her dead child in the church yonder ned reached across and patted his companions arm you are a very amiable little boppard he said monsieur answered the student for whatever you may observe in me that is better than the commonplace she is responsible it shall go to her credit some day be assured and now what is this other matter it is not only the fall of its idol the discovery of monseigneurs baseness that has sobered the community of mricourt by no means the student pulled at his pipe vehemently coaxing it from the sulking mood his expression relaxed and he breathed forth jets of smoke that he dissipated with his hand by no means said he the moral debility that ensued however may have rendered us i will not say it did peculiarly susceptible to the complaint of godliness at any rate monsieur we were chosen for a high honour and he paused sighed and shook his head pathetically it is true then that the virgin revealed herself to the lodgekeeper said ned and he added boppard my boppard i believe you are not in spite of all weaned from the fleshpots the student smiled foolishly and a little anxiously let me tell you how it began monsieur said he the bitter scandal of monseigneur andand of our poor demoiselle was yet hot in womens mouths ah monsieur what secret gratification will it not give them that fall of an envied sister when an interest of a different kind withdrew these cankers from feeding on their rose baptiste the little brother of nicette legrand disappeared and has never been heard of since the child but who monsieur it was the cagots stole him did they confess to it confess the pariahs the accursed it is not in nature that wretches so vile should incriminate themselves but there had been evidence of them in the neighbourhood one indeed had been employed by draonwhose farm abuts on the lower grounds of the chateauto roof a shed with tiles this cagot nicette had seen upon many occasions covertly regarding the childconversing with him even and doubtless with devilish astuteness corrupting his mind two days after the job was completed and the man disappeared the unhappy infant was nowhere to be found they sought him far and wide nicette was prostrateinconsolable she had been foremost in the denunciation of throigne now she herself desolated defrauded of him to whom she had been as a motherwell god must judge monsieur at last the strange gloating of that sinister creature recurred to her and she spoke of it with oaths of frenzy the villagers armed themselves and broke into the woods where the miscreants were known to sojourn their camp was deserted they were fled none knew whither and none to this day has set eyes on them or the little legrand or questioned ill swear the unconscionable flimsiness of such evidence and nicette m boppard she wandered like a ghost in the woodsalways in the woods as if she maddened to somewhere find hidden under the fern and moss the mutilated body of her little fanfan you recall monsieur the old eaten tree the despoiled samson of the forest that held the moon in its withered arms on a memorable night of jest and revel mon dieu but the ravishing times the tree my boppard of a surety i remember the tree it became the nucleus monsieurthe clearing in which it stands the headquarters as it were of her operations of search there appeared no reason for this but surely a divine intuition compelled her at all periods she haunted the spot oftentimes was she to be secretly observed kneeling and praying there in an ecstasy of emotion to the blessed virgin she directed her petitions restore to me she wept my darling baptiste and i swear to dedicate myself for evermore a maid to thy service one day by preconcerted plan a body of villagers armed with billhooks and axes with the cur at their head surprised her at her post it is not for nothing we are convinced said the good father that you are led to frequent these thickets hence we will not proceed until we have laid bare the ground to the limit of ten perches and by the grace of god revealed the mystery well m boppard now monsieur was confessed the wonder at the priests words the girl leapt to her feet her eyes it is said by those that were there burned like the lamp before the little altar of our lady of succour her face was as white as cardaminestransparent spiritual like a phantoms against the dark leaves you must do nothing she saidnothingnothing here but now at the foot of the tree the blessed virgin revealed herself to me as i kneeled and wept her heel was on the head of a serpent whose every scale different in colour to the next was a gleaming agate and in her hand she held a purple globe that was liquid and did not break but round whose surface travelled without ceasing the firmament of white worlds in miniature nicette she said in a voice that seemed to have gathered the sweetness of all the sainted dead weep and search no more my child for some day thy brother shall be restored to thee i the mother of christ promise thee this boppard said ned quietly is the description yours or mademoiselle legrands it is as i heard it monsieur i have not wittingly intruded myself yet you are a poet but this is prose i speak true the prose of a nimble imagination and moreover you are a student and a philosopher and you believe this thing boppard nodded his deprecatory poll perhaps because i am also a poet as monsieur says it is probable and nicette is a poet which is why she walks as i understand in the odour of sanctity i do not comprehend monsieur why should you wish to this vision this revelationit has proved profitable to mricourt again i do not comprehend monsieur with the words on his lips he pricked his ears to a murmuring sound that came subdued through the closed lattice he rose and instinctively reverential tiptoed to the window ned followed him across the sunny green her eyes turned to the ground her hands clasped to her mouth her whole manner significant of a wrapt introspection passed m de st denys little pale lodgekeeper and as she went on her way men bowed as at the passing of the host children caught at their mothers skirts and looked from covert wondereyed the fashionable ladies scuttled from their berline and knelt in the dust and snatched at and kissed the hem of the dvotes garment she paid no heed but glided on decorously and vanished from neds field of observation she is a poet repeated that young man calmly the student crossed himself she is a priestess monsieur said he she reads in the breviary of her white soul such mysteries as man has never guessed at that i can quite understand and it will be an auspicious day for mricourt when they start to build a commemorative chapel it is even now discussed already they have the sacred tree fenced in and the ground about it consecrated already the spot is an object of pilgrimage to the pious as once to the club of natures gentrythe ravishing club oh my poor boppard alas the whirligig of time but one thing i should like to know to what did mademoiselle legrand look for a livelihood when her master ran away doubtless to god monsieur and now the faithful shower gifts at her feet chapter xvi pretty early on the morning following his arrival in mricourt ned strolled up the easy slope leading to the lodge of the chateau and found himself lingering over against the embowered gates with a queer barm of humour working upon a commixture of emotions in his breast now it seemed that his very neighbourhood to the madonna of his memory was effecting a climatic change both within and without him for the first little runnels of irresponsible gaiety gushed in his veins for the second the weather that had been indifferent fine during his journey appeared to have broken all at once into full promise of summer it was not indeed that his sympathies enlarged in the near presence of one who might hold herself as a little moon of desire it was rather perhaps because in the onetime surrender of her very soul to his inspection she had made of him a confederate in certain unspoken secrets the knowledge of which was to him like a sense of proprietorship in a picturesque little countryseat yet here it may be acknowledged he indulged something a dangerous mood he stood a minute before passing through the gates the warmth of a windless night still slept in the velvety eyes of the roadside flowers morning was heaping off its bedlinen of glistening clouds from a chestnuttree came the drowsy drawl of a yellowhammer a robinsmall fashionable idler of birdsabandoned the problem of a fibrous seed and flickering to a stump discussed the stranger impertinently and with infinite society relish only the swifts were alert and busy flashing poising diving under the eaves thridding neds brain as they passed with a receding sound like that made by pebbles hopping over ice seeming in their flight of warp and woof to be mending the pace set by the loitering day feeling their activity a rebuke the visitor passed through the open gate within all was yet more pretty orderliness than that he had once admired the lodge stood sequestered trimness between the luminous green of its porch and the high rearward trees that spouted up into the sky full fountains of tumbling young leaves the little paths were swept the little long beds bordered with triquemadame and planted with lusty perennials were combed orderly as the hair of their mistress and weeded to the least vulgar seedling white curtains hung in the cottage windows and everywhere was an added refinement of daintinessa suggestion of increased prosperity now mademoiselle legrand thought ned has shown herself a little person of resource he could hear the moan of the horn coming familiarly to him from the back garden the sweet complaining cry woke some queer memories in him he went forward a few paces up the drivewalking straight into weediness and the tangle of neglectthat he might get glimpse of the chateau the place when he saw it glowered from an encroaching thicket even these few months seemed to have confirmed the ruin that had before only threatened its dusty upper windows were viscous he could have thought with the tracks of snails grass had made good its footing on the roof it looked a forgotten old history of the past with a toppling chimney half dislodged in some gale for dogsear ned turned his back on the desolate sight and lo there was the bright patch of brick and flower like a garden redeemed from the desert it appeared to point the very moral of the times but in its ethical not its savage significance he went to seek the priestess of this little temple of peace as he turned into the garden a peasant woman was coming out at the lodge door she had an empty basket lined with a clean napkin on her arm que la sainte virge vous bniss par sa servante she murmured as she passed by the visitor nicette was nowhere visible ned stole into the house and along the passage a strip of thick matting where had formerly been naked flags deadened the sound of his footfalls laughter but laughter a little thrilling tingled in his veins a certain apprehension that time might not have dealt as drastically as he had desired it would with a misconstructive fancy was lifted from his mind since yesterday he felt there could be small doubt but that his own image had been deposed and replaced by a very idol of vanitya selfconscious adaiah that must find its supremest gratification in proving its consistency with the character assigned it indeed his moderate faith in himself as an attractive quantity inclined him perhaps to underrate his moral influence he had not yet learned that to many women there is no chase so captivating as that of incarnate diffidence he came softly upon nicette in the dairy that was a little endeared to him by remembrance perhaps he would not have ventured unannounced to seek her in the more inner privacy of her own nest but the cool dairy was good for a neutral ground she stood with her back to him the sunlight reflected from vivid leafiness through the window made a soft luminosity of the curve of her cheek that was like the pale underside of a peach it ruffled the rebellious tendrils of hair on her forehead into a mist of green it stained her white chaperon with tender vert and discoloured the straight blue folds of her dress was she he thought a halfconverted dryad or a lapsing saint nicette he said aloud she gave a strangled gasp and faced about her eyes scared a hand upon her bosom she had been disposing on a slab a little gift of spring chickens and some household preserves did i startle you said ned but you knew i was returned and must surely come and see you monsieur you steal upon me like a ghost she muttered of what girl of no regret i hope her cheek was gathering a little dawn of colour all ghosts of the past are sorrowful she said low true he answered seriously and gently i did not mean to awaken sad memories and thou hast never had news of the little one never monsieur it is lamentable her eyes were watching him intently you commiserate me monsieur she said how can you doubt it nicette yet you do not love children dont i but their cunning and their vindictiveness monsieur what of them what indeed it is monsieurs own words i recall nicette can you think me such a brute i hold myself abashed in the presence of the innocents if i have ever decried them it was only because their truthfulness rebuked my scepticism they have shown me how to die since i saw you last nicette i shall try to remember when my hour comes she passed a hand across her eyes as though she were bewildered but this inconsistency she began murmuring suddenly she straightened herself and came forward truly i knew you were arrived monsieur and you reintroduce yourself to good company on your return to mricourt and truly i do not take my cue from a scandalous world to coldshoulder an old friend he came sternly into the dairy and sat himself down on the slab by the chickens his legs dangling sit there he said and dragged a chair with his foot to his near neighbourhood the girl hesitated shrugged her shoulders and obeyed monsieur it is evident has not learned she was beginning he caught the sentence from her that you are a saint no i have not learned it in these few minutesunless innuendo is the prerogative of sanctity i a sinner met a fallen woman yesterday and i pitied her mademoiselle legrand hung her head ned recovered his goodhumour and laughed oh little sainte nicette he said why do you let me talk to you like this because you are a saint then i will not take a base advantage of your condition but shall i finish the portrait madonna i have been brought face to face in paris with the divine suffering of mothers i have discovered the secret of the eyes shall i finish the portrait nicette she shook her head but think how you could instruct me girl the lineamentsthe very form and expression for you have seen them hush she exclaimed in a terrified whisper oh monsieur hush it is blasphemy it is terrible i to pose for the divinity revealed to me surely you are mad he leaned down to her as he sat nicette he murmured there is an old confidence between us you know and i recall your fine gift of imagination confess that it is all an invention that what is an invention do you not know this vision in the woods then she sprang to her feet a line of red came across her forehead you mock me she cried i might have known that you would but it is none the less hateful and cruel believe or not as you will she was enraged as he had never seen her before but these offerings he said quite coolly the chickens and the little pots of jam nicetteor is it guava jelly one may make a good investment of the imagination i see it was not pleasant of him but he could be merciless to what he considered a bad example of escamoterie for a moment the girl looked like a very harpy her fingers crooked on the bosom of her dress as if she would have liked to lacerate her heart in desperate despite of its assailant then suddenly she dropped back upon her chair and covering her face with her hands broke into a very pitiful convulsion of weeping qui se fait brebis le loup le mange assuredly ned had invited his own discomfiture he had thought to operate upon this tender conscience without any right knowledge of the position of its arteries of emotion he had bungled and let loose the flood and straightway he was scared over the result of his own recklessness he let mademoiselle legrand cry a little while not knowing how to compromise with his convictions he loved truth but was not competent to cope with its erring handmaid at last nicette he whispered and put his hand timidly on the girls shoulder she wriggled under his touch no no she sobbed in a drowned voice it is terrible to be so hated and despised i do not hate you little fool he said you beg the question for what reason nicette are you afraid or at a loss to describe to me this vision she seemed to check her weeping and to listen though her bosom was still heavy with sobs i am afraid she whispered of me nicette shall i not finish the portrait no no but you have seen the mother and know what she is like you would not believe at least put my credulity to the test a long pause succeeded the sobs died into silence byandby the girl looked upnot at her inquisitor but vaguely apart from him and away as if her gaze were introspective she clasped her hands together holding them thus in reverential attitude against her throat nicette murmured ned tell mewhat is the mother like it was a mist monsieur out of which a face grew like a sweetbriar blossoma face and then all down to her pink feet that trod the windflowers of the wood within her hair were little nests of light glowing green and violet that came and went or broke and were shattered into a rain of golden strands they were the tears she had shed beneath the cross she wore the wounds a fivepointed star upon her breast and i saw the rising and falling of her heart as it were the glowing of fire behind wood ashes all about her and about me was a low thick murmur of voices that i could not understand but sometimes i thought i saw the brown fearful eyes of the little people look from under the hanging fronds of fern imploring to put their lips to the white buds of her feet then her eyes gathered me to their embrace and i sailed on a blue sea and was taken into the arms of the wind and kissed so that i seemed to swoon she paused breathing softly truly said ned this was the very pagan queen of love she is the queen of love monsieur else had my eyes never been opened to see the little folk of the greenwoods for to be queen of love is to be queen of nature and both titles hath she from le bon dieu suddenly the girl edged a little nearer her companion looked up in his face appealingly and put her clasped hands upon his knee as he sat god made nature monsieur she whispered god is love oh i read in the sweet eyes many things that were strange to my traditionseven that human side of the mother that monsieur has sought to disclose god is love and he hath given us passion not forbidding us passions cure neds brows took a startled frown and he made as if to rise nicette stole her hand quickly to his monsieur it cannot be wrong to loveit cannot be that he would lend himself as a subtle lure to the very sin his code denounces it is the codeit is the church that has misconstrued him something in the young mans face gave her pause in the midst of her panting eagerness she drew back immediately with a little artificial laugh la sainte marie was all in white she said with a blue cloak the colour of the skies and what is the fashion with the fine ladies in london monsieur mr murk had got to his feet mademoiselle legrand he said you are all of helose i think without the erudition now i am not orthodox yet i think your description of the virgin very prettily blasphemous and what has become of the serpent and the globe of liquid purple you can explain your picture i see to accommodate the views of its critics i admire you very much and i bid you good day he was going she leapt across his path and stayed him a bright spot of colour had sprung to her cheek you will leave me she cried hoarsely you shall not go thinking me a liar no more than the author of julie he said drily and stubbornly you have the fine gift of romance but i dont like your vision it is the truth i give you but one of the hundred impressions it made upon me very well it is a bad selection so far as i am concerned how could i knowyou that have traded upon my confidence you tempt me and throw me aside i will not be so shamedi that am no longer obscurewhose every word is worth as much as one of m voltaires no doubt he may value his commercially at ten sous or fifty what then you have the popular ear do you want to make your profit of me also she twined her fingers together and held them backwards against her bosom whither are you going she panted i am on my way back to england she took a quick step forward you shall not leave me like this you have made me what i am monsieurmonsieur in a moment the storm broke once more she was drowned in tears she threw herself upon him and her arms about his neck it is love she cried you are my god and my desire i have followed you in my heart these long monthsoh how piteously do anything with me you will disbelieve me spurn me stamp on meonly let me love you these monthsoh these desolate sick months she clung to him entreating and caressing though he muttered for shame and strove to disentangle her fingers she would not be denied in this first convulsive selfconsciousness of her surrender i will give myself the lie invite the hatred and scorn of the world swear my soul to damnation by acknowledging myself an impostor if that will make you merciful and kindno not even kind but to take me with you i will admit i am vile in all but my love that you tempted me unwittingly that you had no thought of being cruelof being anything but your own gracious self to whom a foolish maidens heart fled crying because it could not help it catching glimpse in her passion of the stony impassibility of his face she fell upon her knees clasping her arms about him and sobbing you must speakyou must speak or i shall die you dont know what binds me to you not your love or your respect or pity only a little mercyjust enough one finger held out to save me from falling into the abyss look here and here am i not white and sweet i have cherished myself ever since you went and my heart nearly broke i have thought all day and all night what bar to his approach can i remove if some day he shall come again and when at last i saw you were returned i would have given all the vain months of adulation for one glad word of welcome from your lips she grovelled lower writhing her face down into her arms only to be yours she moaned to do with as you will at that at last he stooped and dragged her forcibly to her feet she stood before him trembling and dishevelled and he glared at her breathing heavily like one that had run a race before god i never knew he said but you shame me and yourself i will believe your story if you wish it and what does that lead tothat i hear you abusing the high choice of heavenmisapplying gods truth to the abominable sophistries of passion not love but the foulestthere i wont shame you more i think i have never heard such subtle blasphemy to hope to influence me by casuistry so crooked if you ever awakened my interest you have lost the power for ever mercy the utmost i can show you is by passing here and now out of your life she broke in with an agonised cry mon dieu oh my god not so to stultify all i have suffered and done for your sake what you have done he cried fiercely i am no party to the vile chicanery for your sufferingsthey will cease when the fuel of this passion is withdrawn such fires blaze up and out in a day he was cruel no doubtcrueller than he meant to be but his heart was wrathful over the baseness of the snare set for it on the echo of his voice there came the sound of approaching steps up the road he recovered his composure on the instant you will have visitors he said you had best go and make yourself fit to meet them you will know where your interests lie for me the most i can do is to treat all this as a mad confidence he was going but she pressed upon him panting and desperate dont leave me like this thereinto the bedroom till they are gone monsieur for pitys sake you put too much upon me i will explain for gods sake monsieur he drove past herhurried down the passage as he neared the door he saw the light obscured by a couple of entering figuresa complacentsmiling cur who ushered in a fashionable pilgrim exhaling musk and tinkling with gewgaws exortum est in tenebris lumen rectis murmured the priest as he gave place with a slight bow exactly so said ned and made his way to the road there he stood a moment blinking and gulping down the fresh spring air chapter xvii mr murk walked straight from the lodge of the chateau out of the village stopping only on his way to take up his knapsack at the landlust he moved very haughty and inflexible with a high soul of offence at the attempt manifested to subject him to the charge of collusion in what he considered a particularly unpleasant species of fraud it was that more than the outrage to his continent selfrespect that angered and insulted himthat he could under any circumstances be deemed approachable by imposture even though it should solicit in ravishing guise he had never as yet indeed through any phases of fortune regarded himself as other than a philosophic alien to his race a disinterested spectator of its wars of creeds and senses perched out of the battle on a little cloudy eminence of spiritual reserve whence it was his humour to analyse the details of the contest for the gratifying of a curious intellectual cosmopolitanism and even when for nearer view of some party struggle he had descendedor condescendedso far as that he had felt upon his face the very bloody sprinkle of the strife he had chosen to read in the emotions excited in his breast an instinctive revolt against the injustice of pain rather than a sympathy with the sufferings of which he was witness now however he seemed to have realised in a moment by what common means nature is able to impeach this treason of aloofness he had held himself a thing altogether apart in that conflict of blurred indefinite forms he had been like a spectator watching an illuminated sheet at an entertainment when to adopt a modern image there had sounded in an instant the click of the cinematograph snapping the blur into focus and lo he beheld his own figure active amongst the crowd a constituent atom travelling through or with it a mean small condition of its gregariousnessrepellent attractive infinitesimally influential according to the common degree of his kind holding his soul as he fancied veracious and remote he had seen it magnetic in its supposed isolation to another that in its essential guile in its infirmity and untruth would seem to be his spirits actual antithesis yet whose destinies rebel as he might must henceforth for evermore be associated with his he was no amateur counsel to a recording angel in fact but just a human organism subject to the influences of neighbour temperaments now the considerable but lesser pang in this shock to his pride of solitariness was felt in the realisation of his impotence to claim exemption from the ordinary vulgar taxes imposed by the gods upon vulgar animal instincts he must be sought if he would not seek nor could he by any means escape the penalties of his manly attributes he was a thing of desire therefore he represented the one moiety of the race to which he would have fain considered himself an alien but he did not regard with any present sentiment but that of anger the woman who had thus been the means to his proper understanding of his own personal insignificance for her sex indeed he had no natural liking but that negatively conveyed in a sort of chivalrous contempt for its inconsequence wherebythough he did not know ithe may have offered himself an unconscious bertram to a score of helenas now to find his austere particular self made the object of a sacrifice of utter truth and decency both alarmed and disgusted him the very jar of the discovery tumbled him from cloud to earth yet be it said if it brought him with a run from his removed heights he was to fall into that garden of the world where the loves their thighs yellow with pollen flutter from flower to flower for byandby in the very glow and fever of his indignation he startled to sudden consciousness of the fact that it was the implied insult to his honesty rather than that actual one to his sense of modesty that most offended him that his heart was indulging a little rebellious memory of a late dream it appeared that was full of a strange pressure of tenderness he caught himself sharply from the weakness yet it would recur he began to question the propriety of his attitude towards women generally serenely selfcentred perhaps he had never realised the necessity of being in a world of artificiality other than himself now he faintly gathered how poor a policy of virtue might be implied therebyhow under certain conditions virtue might be held its own justification for assuming an alias and thereat came the first reaction in a pretty series of moral rallies and relapses bah he muttered the girl is a little lying cocottea lamia from whose snares i am fortunate to have escaped without a wound in the meantime his heart turned towards home with a strange heat of yearningtowards his england of stolid factions and sober unemotional sympathies of regulated hate and the liberal schooling of love he had submitted himself to much physical and mental suffering in order to the acquirement of a right understanding of men and at the last a woman had upset and scattered his classified collection of principles with a whisk of her skirt he felt it was useless to attempt to rearrange his specimens unless in an atmosphere not inimical to sobriety i will go home he thought as he stepped rapidly forward and at any rate i am here at length out of the wood and straightway poor rogue he fell into a second ambush by the roadside for coming to a sudden turn in his path when he was breaking from the copses a half mile out of the village he was suddenly aware of a shrill cackle of vituperation of such particular import to him at the present crisis as to constrain him to stop where he was and listen oh valentin hooted a booby voice a twist and thou hast secured it oh bring it away and we will look let go panted another voice in a heat of jeering violence i will have it i say then ned heard throigne pleading and tearful valentin thou shalt not it is mine what right hast thou to rob and insult me the right that thou art a putaina snake in the grass of a virgin community give it me or i will break thy arm right indeed but every welldoer has a right to act the executive thou shalt not take it you will prevent me oh the strength of this conscious virtue and does not thy refusal damn thee pull across charlot i will wrench her arms out it is another accursed whelp that she has strangled and would bury in the wood you vile cruel beast cried the girl oh hscream then panted the other while charlot sniggered throatily there is no riggish lord now to justify thee in thy assaults on decent landholders i will look if only for the sake of that memory thou wert the prospective fine lady wert thou oh mon dieu and what ploughboy has ministered to thee for this in the bundle mr murk indignant but embarrassed had stood so far uncertain as to his wise course of action now however a shriek of obvious pain that came from the girl decided him he hurried round the intercepting corner and saw mademoiselle lambertine blowsed and weeping flung amongst the roots of a tree hard by where the trunks opened out to the roadtrack a couple of clowns bent eagerly over a bundle they had torn from their victim were discussing the contents of their prizea few poor toilet affairs some bright trinketry of lace and ribbons a dozen apples and a loaf of white cocketbread all three lifted their heads startled at the sound of his approach throigne sat up the boors got clumsily to their feet in one of these loobies ned had a sure thought that he recognised the fellow whose face had once been scored by those very feminine fingers that were now so desperately clutching and pulling at the grass amongst the treeroots he could see the red cheeks he fancied still chased with the marks of that reprehensible onset the other rogue he was equally certain was of those that had baited a wretched cagot on a morning nine months ago here then was the right irony of eventa huntress acton torn by her own hounds ned stepped forward deliberately but with every muscle of his body screwed tight as a fiddlestring come over against the clodpoles you are pigs and cowards said he and he gave the farmer an explosive smack on the jaw the assault was so violent and unexpected the will that inspired it was so obviously set in the prologue of vicious possibilities that the victim collapsed where he stood bellowing like a bullfrog it is true that he lacked a familiar stimulus to his courage now said ned return those goods to the bundle and fasten them in or by the holy virgin of mricourt ill lay an information against you for brigands before m le maire there was an ominous stress in his very chords of speech they may have recognised him or not in any case this change of fortune might unsheathe the terrific claws of a hitherto unallied enemy charlot dropped upon his knees and with shaking fingers began to manipulate the bundle it is enough said ned between his teeth now go the two scurried off amongst the trees glancing over their shoulders as they went with scared faces the next moment ned was aware that mademoiselle lambertine had crept up to him and was holding out her hands in an entreating manner monsieur she whispered he faced about the girl was arrayed for a journey it seemed a cloak was clasped about her neck from her brown hair hung over her shoulders like the targe of a highlander a round straw hat with an ungainly width of brim stout shoes and a foot of homespun stocking showed under her short skirt nevertheless the glowing ardour of her face and form triumphed over all disabilities they are brutes and cowards said ned gravely i dont think they will trouble you again here is your property she did not take it at once he shrugged his shoulders and laid it on the ground at her feet monsieur pleaded the girl something seemed to choke her from proceeding at length i have been waiting in the woods since dawn said she in a sudden soft outburst hoping for you to pass for me i came out into the track now and again dreading that you had gone by while i watched elsewhere and once these discovered me andand ah monsieur you see now what i have to endure truly i seemore than i would wish to you are leaving mricourt then she looked at him defiant and imploring at once you would not condemn me to it you would not even say it is possible for me to stay here the young man did for him an unaccustomed thing he sworeunder his breath it might have been the devil of a particular little crisis essaying to speak for him it might have been the cry of a momentary conflict between sense and spirit the appeal addressed to either was indeed as mournful and seductive as the minor play of a pathetic voice could make it if he gazed irritably at the woman facing him still he gazed at all because he was stirred to some emotion the sadness of wet unhappy eyes of parted lips of hands clasped upon the dumb utterance of an impassioned bosomall in their single offer and plea to him were no doubt such a temptation to an abuse of that consistency with his theories that his temperament so encouraged him to cherish as he had never before felt but he was still so little sensitive to one form of witchery that it needed only a tickle of humour to restore his moral balance he laughed on a certain note of aggravation mricourt is all moonstruck i believe said he this is too absurdly flattering to my vanity firstbut there mademoiselle lambertine i will not pretend to misread you yet you do not love me i think she shook her head drooping her eyes to him patently she had elected to stake her chances on white candour as the better policy with this joseph well said he it is as it should be and you are equally convinced i am indifferent to you but at that she came forwardso close to him indeed as to make her every word an invitation now thought ned inured to such appeals she will throw her arms round my neck in a minute but he did throigne indifferent justice you think yourself so she murmured it will be only a little while already in the prospect of freedom i begin to renew myself since yesterday what if my soul is torn and crippled the blood will glow in my veins no less hotly than beforea fire to melt even this cold iron of thy resolve oh look on melook on me i can feel all power and beauty moving within me like a child that i should be scorned of clowns and yet the chance gives me to you monsieur if you but put out your hand it is not love that thou hast not nor i nor is the power longer to me or the gift to you but i am grateful for that thou hast helped me under sore insult ah it avails nothing to plead accidentto say it was the outrage i avenged for manliness not the womans sake what then thou hast wrought the bond of sympathy and thou canst never forge it apart perhaps even didst thou strike hard thou mightst some day hit out the spark of love take me and thou wilt desire to i swear it do i not breathe and live am i not one to vindicate in prosperity the choice of her protector thou hast a nobility of manliness that is higher than any rank but if in thine own country thou art great thou shalt be greater through me i will minister to thy ambition no less than to thy senses i will she paused breathing quickly and watchful of the steady immobility of his face monsieur she whispered most movingly if you see in me now only a lost unhappy girl who in her misery would seem to seek the confirmation of her dishonour believeoh monsieur believe that it is only to escape the worser degradation that threatens her through the relentless persecution she suffers on account of her trust in one that was monsieurs friend no friend of mine muttered ned and stopped he must collect his thoughtsendeavour to answer this sductrice according to her guile instinctively he stepped back a pace as though to elude the enchantment of a very low sweet voice listen to me he said distinctly mademoiselle lambertine i pity you profoundly and if i have anything more to say it is only upon my honour to marvel that one of such intelligence as yourself should ever have submitted her honour to the handling of so exceedingly meretricious a gentleman as m de st denys you see i repay your confidence with plainspeaking for the rest i can assure you it is not my ambition to be beholden for whatever the future may have in store for me to a she stayed him with a soft hand put upon his mouth do not say it she said quite quietly it is enough that you reject my offer that you may repent when you find your fiercer manhoodwhen you realise what you have lost well you have been good to me though if i have suffered here in the wood while i waited for you it was not because my heart was other than a stone then for shame cried ned so to sell yourself ah said throigne in the same quiet voice but i have made my bed according to monsieurs proverb and it is a double onethat is all and is it not gallant when a woman falls to help her to her feet it is not gallant to help her the victim of one lie to enact another surely and monsieur is the soul of truth she adjusted her cloak and hat stooped and took up her bundle i am distasteful to monsieur she said very well for some reason ned was moved to immediate anger your hat is anyhow he snapped i think it quite preposterously ugly but she only laughed and waved her hand you will think better of me in england she cried he was moving away he stopped abruptly and faced about you are still determined to go then she nodded her head without another word he turned on his heel and strode off down the road chapter xviii beforehurrying like a weaponless man through sinister thicketsned had come to within a mile of lige the memory of the rather grim comedy he had been forced to play a part in was tickling him under the ribs in provocative fashion that his vanityno unreasonable quantityshould have received as it were in a breath a kiss so resounding a buffet so swingeing set his very soul of risibility bubbling and dancing like champagne and ought i to be gratified or offended he thought that i am chosen the flame about which these moths circle but it is all one to such insects whether it be wax or rushlight so long as it burns thats where i missed fire so to speak the flutter of their poor little feverish wings put me out i am a cold taper i fancy i have never yet felt the draught that would blow me into a roar what breath is wasted upon me in good truth some detail of his path gave him pause he sat down on a knoll had out his book and pencil and began to sketch now his blood ran temperately again if he had been ever momentarily agitated in thought as to his ideals of conduct the little disturbed silt of animalism was precipitated very soon and the waters of his soul ran clear as heretofore he laughed to himself as he sat i believe if i had stayed another day the van roon would have made overtures to me byandby he fell into a pondering fit he rested his chin upon his clenched hand and gazing into the distance dreamed abstractedly have i a constitutional frost in my blood as my uncle believes is my every relation with my fellows to be for ever unimpulsive and coldly analytical that should lead me at least to a nice selection in pairingtime and to what elsea career stately sober colourless a faultless reputation all the virtues ranked upon my tombstone byandby for gaping cits to spell over and perhaps if i am very good for a verger to expound and my widow that is to bemy fair decent relict that shall have never known me condescend to a weakness or perpetrate an injustice that shall never have felt the frost melt in her arms he jumped suddenly to his feet his teethvery even and white onesshowing in a queer little smile he stretched he took off his rather battered hat and passed a hand through the crisp umber stubble of his hair his solemn eyes shone out as blue as lazulite from the sunburn of his face he seemed indeed from his appearance no fitting catechumen in a religion of everlasting continence there must be underwarmth somewhere for the surface so to flower into colour she would marry within six months of my death he cried probably a libertine who would dissipate her estates and break her heart and die and be mourned by her long after my memory was drier than a pinch of dust to all who had known me he laughed again on a note that sighed a little in the fall am i like that do i build all this time with dry dust for mortar am i a loveless anchorite because my sympathies will not answer to the coarseness of an appeal that my taste rejects is it quite human to be very fastidious in so warm a respect or do i only wait the instant of divine inspiration to recognise that other self that seems hidden from me by an impenetrable veil he shook his head despondently collected his traps and went on his way to lige there he remained no longer than was necessary to a settlement in the matter of certain bills of credit and to the chartering of a vehicle for his onward stages he was to return to the coast by way of namur lille and calais for the time he was all out of humour with a nomadic philosophy and desired only to reach england by as short a route as possible he set sail in the fanny crowther packet and had a taste of channel weather that was as good as a constitutional after a debauch he was two days at sea beating forth and back at the caprice of squabbling winds and when at last he landed in dover it was with the drenched whitewashed feeling of a convalescent from fever he was setting foot on the jetty discomfortable in the conviction that his present demoralisation was offering itself the target to a hail of local wit when a thin neigh of a laugh that issued from a yellow curricle drawn up near at hand drew his peevish attention immediately he fetched his nausea under control and stepped towards the carriage with a fine assumption of coolness there may have appeared that in his attitude to induce a respectable manservant to jump from the dickey and offer to bar his progress all right jepps said he im not one of peg nicholsons knights with a petition the man bowed and made way for him im sure i beg your pardon mr edward said he and added in an accommodating voice id little call to know you sir eh what ned gasped one of the occupants of the curricle no other than the right honourable the viscount murk indeed his lordship sat on and forward of a great cloak lined with silver foxskin a luxurious cave into which he could withdraw whenever a draught nosed his old sapless limbs the neckclasp of which he had unhooked for the display of a diamond brooch that gathered voluminous lawn about the sagging of his throat in every detail of his condition he was the bowelless and mummified coxcomb packed prematurely into exquisite cerements predestined to a corner in the museums of limbo and topping his finished refinements of costume his beaver was tilted like an acute accent to so distinguished an expression of hyperdynamic foppery you are surprised to see me sir said ned he glanced as he spoke with something like astonishment at my lords companion nor i much less to find you here as for myself i have gleaned such a harvest of experience in a few months that i must needs come home to store it his uncle stared at him but with a rallying expression of implacable distaste rat me he said candidly id hoped to hear of you a martyr to your theories and that manstrous encyclopedia set up for your tombstone he turned indolently to his companion this is the heir to stowling and the viscounty and all the rest of the beggarly show if he can be induced to candescend to it he said viciously and gathered up the reins in his lemongloved hands the other nodded with a pretty display of white teeth and a shifting affectation that was extravagantly feminine a dainty threecornered hat was perched on her powdered hair that was pulled up plainly and rolled over each temple in a silken ringlet she had on a richly embroidered jacket with wide lapels a rug was over her knees and seated on it fastened to her left wrist by a tiny golden chain was a red monkey that chattered at the newcomer monsieur edouard said she caressing the insular barbarity of speech with her tongue and her pet with fluttering fingertips who have sold himself the birtheright to a dish of potage oh que si mais si jeunesse savait but i have heard of monsieur edouard and also i have heard of monsieur paine her voice was as artificial as her manner playing on the alto it would squeak occasionally like a greasy fiddlebow and her age despite the smooth and rather expressionless contour of her features might have been anything from thirtyfive to sixty but she has not wrinkles to cement and overlay thought ned else would she never dare to laugh so boldly he did not like the truculence of her eyes nor indeed the whole air of rather professional effrontery that characterised her nevertheless there was that about her about the atmosphere she seemed to exhale that curiously confounded him i have not the honour of an introduction he said a little perplexed nor the right to return madames complimentif indeed it was meant for one not in the least she said with an insolent laugh i have no applause for the hritier lgitime that is a traitor to his trust she sank back toying with her little redfurred beast my lord laughed acidly but made no offer to enlighten or question his nephew so you have returned he said only all the devil of it lies in that and he scanned his young relative affrontingly in your unconverted vanity of blackguardism get up jepps ned laughed in perfect goodhumour as the curricle sped away after all thought he perhaps it is hard to be claimed for uncle by a ragpicker i will resume my decorative self find out where my lord lodges and wait upon him in form and civility he had his insignificant baggage removed to temporary quarters ransacked the mean little town for what moderately becoming outfit it could yield shaved rested and refreshed himself and issued forth once more on dutys quest and what is the old man doing here he thought and who is the enigmatical cyprianwhereby it will be observed he jumped to baseless conclusions but he gave himself no great concern about the matter admitting that the probable explanation of his uncles presence in the seaport town lay in that flotsam and jetsam of the palais royal bagnios that many tides washed up on the coast he may be acting the part of a noble and unvenerable wrecker thought heit must be confessed consistently with the common estimate of his kinsman my lord had rooms in one of the fine mansions then first beginning to sprout over against the harbour for the accommodation of wealthy seabathers he was dressedwith all the force of the expression as applied to himfor dinner and received his nephew in a fine withdrawingroom overlooking the bay he snarled out an ungracious welcome he was as ever wrapped and embalmed in costly linen smelling of amberseed and was with allso it seemed to the nephewa touch nearer actual comminution than when he had last seen him to strip him of cartonage and bandages would be it appeared to commit him to dust but the maggot of vanity still found sustenance in the old wood of his brain i am honoured he said that you give my table the preference over a tavern ordinary have you learned to equip yourself with a palate in these months at least ill promise to do justice to your fare sir will you you shall be made lord chancellor if you do no no ned to know beef from matton is the measure of your gastranamy aint you hungry now ravenous sir il ny en a pas de doute you dress like a chairman im your humble debtor egad that youve recommitted the rags you landed in to the dunghill and youll eat like one a gentlemans never hungry he appraises his viands sir tis for flunkeys to devour one must not yield oneself to a condition of emptiness that implies a dozen of little disadvantages that are inimical to bonton but you know me hopeless of ever convincing you in these matters he rose with a slight yawn and walking to the window looked out into the darkening evening the old limbs might have creaked but for their perpetual lubrications not an inquiry as to the course of his travels did he address to his undesirable heir it was more than enough for him that he had returned at all if not that you have discovered a palate said he with a sour grin then i suppose i am to attribute this visit to your high sense of duty a carriage drew up on the stones below as he spoke enfin mon chermon aimable chevalier he muttered to himself with relief you have company sir said ned you can stop for all that said the uncle tartly madame as you have seen knows how to take her entertainment of a monkey madame was ushered in as he spoke neds only wonder upon identifying her as the lady of the curricle was over the fact of her separate lodging he had expected to find her in my lords suite she came into the candlelight an amazing figure of elegance rouged plastered and befeathered but even surprisingly decorous in attire she wore long mittens on her arms the upper exposed inches of which flickered with a curious muscularity when she fanned herself so she said making exaggerated play with her eyes over the rim of the toy we shall have the fatted calf to dinner and did you find the husks of democracy to your liking sir i found them tough said ned she laughed like an actress she shook her finger at him archly of a truth she replied they cannot have been to your stomach at all you asked for bread was it not and they gave you a shower of stones one does not desire ones high convictions to be set up for a mark to violence and so you turned the tail and came home to our dear monseigneur i have come home to england said ned as to this my happening on my lord it is a simple accident he spoke with some coldness of reserve he had no idea whom he addressed his kinsman had disdained to introduce him or to give him the least clue to madames identity the lady laughed again but do not call it a contretemps she cried it is a dispensation of providence that milord though a very bayard of courage is detained by sentiments of chivalry we were to have journeyed to paris together had news of the riots not reached us and hence arrives this so amiable meeting i was there said ned shortly i saw m reveillons factory gutted she paused in her fanning she looked strangely at the young man a moment you were there then she resumed her bantering tone and found what bad bedfellows are theory and practice perhaps it shall reconcile you to milord here whose rle of orthodox muscadin you shall for the henceforth make your own egad cried the viscount who it seemed accepted the revolutionary muscadin for better than it was worth but i had my fill of riots in when the cursed rabble took me for a papist and singed my coattails madame nodded her head brightly her dark eyes contrasted as startlingly with her overlaid cheeks as might the eyes in a face of wax so you were wise and came away she said still addressing the young man but milord was wiser he would not help to inflame a popular prejudice the majesty of the people must be respectedwhen it takes to singeing ones coattails well thought ned i must be right this is madame cocotte from the palais royal or elsei wonder if she is in the pay of a very neighbouring government a thought or twoof madames manner of presenting her little sarcasmsquickened his curiosity to countermine the supposed agencies of pitt the inflexible and reserved the bottomless pittwas it unreasonable to suppose that france was employing some very engaging decoyducks to the corruption of an aristocracy that might be fifthcousins to state secrets true monseigneur the viscounts confidence was of little worth but to his valet yet the first rung of the ladder may be used for the secondary purpose of scraping ones boots on before climbing madame was the only guest she had brought her monkey with her and the little brute was carried screeching to a chair by her side at the dinnertable where it sat sucking its thumb like a vindictive baby and snatching at the dishes of fruit fi donc fi donc de querchy she would cry to it she had named the beast it presently appeared after an enemy of hers m le comte of that title cest ainsi que tu donnes une leon de politesse ces barbares nos amis my lord murk laughed at all her insolenceespecially when her sallies were directed at his nephew she spared the young man no more than she did her hosts wine to which ned was confounded to observe she resorted with a freedom that was entirely shameless indeed she drank glass for glass with the elder of the gentlemen and indulged herself with a corresponding licence of speech that quite confirmed the younger in his estimate of her character but he was hardly prepared for the upshot of it all as directed against himself monsieur edouard she once said it was after the servants had left the room have i not your language in perfection indeed madame he answered stiffly even to a peculiar choice in words she laughed arrogantly i accept your insult she saidand flung the glass she was drinking from full at him l l l she shrieked you threw up your arm it is only the coward that has the instinct to throw up his arm to a woman my lord laughed like an old demon ned was on his feet white and furious you are a woman he cried and the more shame to you she jumped from her chair as she did so the monkey sprang to her left shoulder on which it seated itself gibbering and quarrelling i claim for the only privilege of my sex to despise the joseph she cried for the rest i can fight for my honour monsieur as you shall see she skipped for accent to the paradox in great apparent excitement hurried to a window embrasure stooped and faced about with a naked rapier in her hand draw she cried and running over to the door turned the key in the lock and feinted at the amazed young man all the while the monkey clung to her adapting its position to her every movement is this a snare said ned coldly he looked at his uncle his hand clenched at his hip but he wore no weapon but his recovered composure the old villain drew his own blade and flung it across the table to his nephew fight you dog he sputtered and mumbled he was deplorably drunk fight he shrieked and take a lesson to your cursed selfimportance he threw his glass in a frenzy into the fireplace and screeched out two to one in ponies on madame the lady cried ahbah he tink me of the fancy for all her assumed heat she was really selfpossessed ned understood her to be playing a part but he could not yet comprehend how he was concerned in it he took up his uncles sword these he said coolly are dangerous toys but if madame will play with them i must prevent her from doing harm to herself or me she gave a little staccato shriek of mockery and attacked him without hesitation the monkey still perched on her shoulder with her third pass ned felt that his life was in the hands of a consummate tireuse her fourth took him clean through the fleshy part of the right shoulder madame withdrew and lowered the red lance that dropped a little crimson on the carpet like an overcharged pen the tipsy old lord had scrambled to his feet his inflamed eyes seemed to gutter like expiring dips he yelled out oaths and blasphemy kill him he shrieked i hate himdo you hear kill him ned reeling a little and clutching at a chairback dimly wondered if this were indeed but a villainous plot to rid his kinsman of a detested incubus he felt powerless and sick but madames voice reassured him bah she cried gruffly you are very tipsy indeed hold your tongue and drink some more wine he was conscious then of her near neighbourhood of the fact that she was binding up his arm it is leetlebut enough he heard her mutter then she looked over to where my lord sat glowering and collapsed a coach if you please she said peremptorily it must not arrive that he pass the night heere in your house the uncle laughed inanely what he said dye think i should finish him and put the blame onon another take him to the devil if you will no said she but i weel conveya heem to his lodgings out of the devils way chapter xix of so wanton and inexplicable a nature had been the assault committed on him that for some three days succeeding it ned could have fancied himself lying rather in a stupor of amazement than in the semiconsciousness engendered of a certain degree of pain and fever his contretemps with his uncle the latters more than usually uncompromising attitude of offence towards him most of all the strange vision of madame with her obvious intention to insult and disable himall this in the retrospect inclined him to consider himself the late victim of a delirium that was reflex to the hideous pictures painted in paris upon his brain but on the fourth morning of his retirement finding himself awake to the humour of the situation he knew that his distemper was retreating and that he might claim himself for a convalescent astonishment is a good febrifuge he thought how long have i lain in it as in a cooling bath and it is indeed strange how blessed an exorcist of pain is absorbing wonder not knowledge of drugs for the body but of drugs for the mind shall some day perhaps redeem the world from suffering the theatre of variety not of the hospital be the avalon of the maimed and the smitten he had no memory as to whoif anybodyhad visited him during the course of his fever but no doubt he thought this moderate bloodletting has very timely rectified a bad effusion to my brain and madame is my unconscious physician he got out of bed feeling ridiculously weak and emaciated but with a luminous blot of wonder still floating in the background of his mind this globe of soothing radiance so made apparent the near details of his past and present as that he had no difficulty in remembering where he was or what had detained him there he felt no uneasiness over his condition or any present desire to have it ended for the moment he was blissfully content to gaze out of his windowthat commanded obliquely an engaging little prospect of sunny sand and strolling figuresand to pleasantly scrutinise the picture as it passed in silent cameraobscura over the tables of his brain pain emotion and thirst were all absorbed in an enjoying indefinite curiosity but byandby as he gazed there wanderedor appeared to wanderinto and across his perspective a couple of figures whose mere presence there in company seemed to sadly shake his confidence in the assurance of his own convalescence apart he might have admitted their reality it was their conjunction that hipped his halfrecovered sanity for how should madamethat enigmatical tireusepair herself out of all the little crowd with throigne lambertine whom he had left in belgium moreover this was a transformed throignea throigne not of ungainly skirts and preposterous hat but one that had at length acquired the first adventitious means to an expression of her wonderful beauty a throigne of lawn and paduasoy of waking airs and graces of defiance still but of the defiance that had superbly trodden persecution underfoot then in a moment the vision vanished from his ken i will go to bed again he thought i have something yet to sleep off presently he reached out and rang a bell that stood on a table beside him simultaneously with the jangle of it olian sounds ceased somewhere down below a slow step came up the stairs and a heavy man entered the room consciously as if it were a confessionalbox good morning said ned i think im better the heavy man noddeda salutation compound of respect and satisfactionpaused an embarrassed minute turned round and made as if to retreat hallo exclaimed ned the man faced about what day is it said ned sunday answered the man you are my landlord aye your wife is out aye at church aye and you are keeping house oh aye has any one called on me duringeh the lady what lady her wi the parly name what name never cud say well what did she come for for to dress your arm my arm ned fell back in astonishment the heavy man immediately made for the door here cried ned the man slewed himself round rebellious was that you playing down below aye harp aye this time he got fairly outside shut himself on to the landing apparently dwelt there a minute and secure in his retreat opened the door again and thrust in his head servant sir said he oh all right said ned youll be adry belike said the man whats that drythe youll call it for a glass of hale certainly not answered the convalescent snappishly tis a very good substitoot for the stomach said the man and vanished hi shrieked ned again the face reappeared why dont you bring your harp and play up here confound you the eyes opened and withdrew like phantasmagoria presently the man was to be heard stumbling upstairs with a burdenin fact he brought in his instrument and seated himself at it play said he and ned nodded and now the young gentleman was to read in that book of revelations that treats of the incongruous partiality of divinity in its giving moods the man beside him was to appearance a dull enough fellow a plodding leatherpalmed labouring man of smoky intelligence yet for all their horny cuticle his fingers seemed to burn as luminous as those of the troll in the fairy tale they spouted music the fire of inspiration ran out of their tips along the strings till the ceiling of the common little room vibrated deliciously as the dome of an elfin bell and he extemporised it would appear he wove a web of chords about himself as it were a cocoon out of which he should one day burst and be acknowledged glorious surely thought ned if it isnt necessary to be a fool to be a musician at least the majority of born musicians are fools that was his opinion and he held it in common with a good many people the musical more than any other form of temperament would appear to be selfsufficient its stream may flow and harp like an iceland river through a woefully barren country the heavy man played on and on enraptured exalted till his wife came home from church then she flew like an angry bee to the sweet twang of his instrument and opened on him wideeyed and mouthed saving your honours presence she began or my life said ned he hath built me up my constitution as amphion built the walls of thebes i asked him to come and play and he hath finished me my cure well now fegs said the woman dubiously and they call him pethery john said she tis his fancy to confide himself to his harp once in the week the stroke of his chisel the taste of his bacon the cry of the seaevery thought and act of the six days will he work into them wires on the seventh an honest sober man sir werent t for his sabbath folly and what is his business asked ned for the husband had shouldered his harp and disappeared a stonemasons she answered and none to come anigh him she added with pride hes a foreman at the excavating over to the cliffs yonder oh said ned and what are they excavating for lord save your honour she cried dont ye know as were afortifying against the coming of they bloody french no said ned well she answered we be then she recalled her manners but im gansinggay to see your honour so brave she said with a curtsey and im vastly obliged to you maam said ned and nobody has come near me in my sickness i understand but the lady only the lady sir and now who is the lady but madame deon sir at your sairveece said a voice at the door ned fell flat on his back a formless suspicion that had rankled in him like an unextracted thorn ever since he had received that prick in the shoulder suddenly revealed itself a definite shape after a minute or two he raised his head from the pillow and looked cautiously around oh he exclaimed and dropped it again husband and wife were gone the room door was closed and at his bedside monkey on wrist sat the strange lady who had been the very active cause of his discomfiture deon did you say he murmured veritably she replied serenely oh the exactly the chevalire charlottegenevievelouiseaugustaandretimothe deon de beaumont the chevalire said ned faintly or chevalier she answered with a very pleasant laugh he raised himself determinedly on his elbow and scrutinised his visitor he saw beside him a comfortable motherly looking creature apparently some sixty years of age with a sort of dutchcap on her head topped by a falling hat and fat white curls rolled forward from the nape of her neck her face sloping down from the forehead and up from the throat came as it were to a sharpish prow at the tip of the nose its expression was of a rather mechanical humour and the eyes seemed deliberately unspeculative only the mouth looking lipless as a lizards was a determined feature for the rest in dress and manner she appeared the very antithesis of the loud and truculent trollop who had thrust a quarrel upon and a sword into him three nights ago and this was the famous chevalier the enigma the epicene upon the question of whose sex the accumulated erudition of a kings bench had once been brought to bearwith indefinite result this was the hermaphrodite dragoon and ladyinwaiting the author the plenipotentiary and at the last in this year of grace the astonishing tireusedarmes who had excelled on their own ground the professors st george and m angelo and who now replenished one pocket of her purse by giving lessons in the admirable art of fencing and at this point of his cogitations mr murk said the chevalier is at least a wonderful actress thereat madame chirred out a little indulgent laugh it is well said she cried monsieur is un homme desprit and i take no shame said ned to have let her in under my guard she looked at the young man seriously the shame was mine mon petitthe shame of the necessity was mine to wound you at all you had not intended to kill me then it was not plotted with my lord she flushed actuallythis player of many parts milord she cried his hired bravo well said ned you must admit i have some excuse for thinking it so she answered recovering herself with a longdrawn breath it is true she smiled upon him had i chalkmarked you at the first mon cher i could not have hit you nearer where i intended when i desire to keel i keel when i weesh for to place one horsdecombatpour citer un exemple she touched his shoulder delicately with her fingertips you intended to put me on the shelf said ned surprised she nodded on my uncles behalf ah she cried you weesh too many answer i will tell you it was all arrange by me it was only when the old man smell blood he get beside of himself you come in my way i must remove you that is it but i have never seen you in my life till three days ago madame nor i you what then ned lay back thinking things over and presently he talked aloud my lord comes to dover en route for paris he is accompanied by a friendthe chevalier deon this chevalier is a diplomatist and something more heshehas servedpossibly does servea royal master at this juncture it is to be conceived that her talents for espionnage are being urgently summoned to exercise themselves he paused a moment glancing askew at his companion she did not look at nor answer him but her face expressed some curious concern a little covert smile twitched his mouth as he continued there are whispers i have heard them and of them in more than one city of the world that a certain notable prime minister gives his secret endorsement to the revolutionary propaganda of the palais royal would it not be a daring thing on the part of a spy and a thing grateful to his employers to endeavour to prove this of the exalted englishman but the englishman is selfcontainedalmost inaccessible if he is to be approached it must be with an elaborate circumspectionby starting say the process of undermining so far from official centres as the very suburban quarters where he takes his little relaxation during the parliamentary recesses pausing consciously in his abstract review murmured as if he were seeking to convince himself ned was aware that the chevalier had leaned herself back against the wall at the bedhead and was softly caressing the monkey a tight little smile was on her lips she caught his glance and nodded to him cest bien cela she whispered he went on echoing her cest bien cela madame and i may be altogether a fool and a fanciful one but here recognising now the significance of reports that have reached me is where i trace a connection between the fact of my lord murk and the chevalier deon becoming suddenly acquainted and the fact that the notable englishman and my lord are villaneighbours at putney where each has his holiday establishment and wherealtogether apart from politicsboth meet on the social grounds of a common appetite for gossip for port wine madame la chevalire broke out into a sudden violent laugh for the first time her voice seemed to contradict her sex oh mon dieu cest une fine mouche she cried she think to make catspaw of our tipsy monseigneur i undurestand mon dieu it is excellent this contained this inscrutable this machiavel that but wash his head in the bottle as it were to cool it to yield his confidence to a paillard a tossthepot an old old ptitmatre that have nevaire earn in his life one title to respect say no more it is a penetration the most admirable that you reveal oh mon dieu avec tant de finesse on nous crdit ned waited till her merriment had jangled itself into silence not to constitute my lord a spy said he quietly but to equip him with one comment said madame i do not undurestand i dont say you do it is a hypothetical case i put i assume for instance that the chevalier is perfectly aware of my lords propensities and is even willing to act the part of his conciliatrice madame jumped to her feet breathing heavily why did i not keel you she muttered her eyes were awake with fury little coalblack imps seemed to battle in them as in pools of gall ned sat up on his bed i assume he went on coolly that the chevalier looking about her for her instrument marked down this dissolute nobleman with a villa at putney and decided to accommodate him with a french mistressa cressida whom she should coach to act the part of spy to a spy cest bien a whispered madame again the chevalier then has we will say made my lords acquaintance has excited the libidinous old man has proposed a trip to paris the two travel to dover and here an unforeseen difficulty supervenes my lord hears of the reveillon riots he refuses to proceed the chevalier is in despair she is however let us conclude taking advantage of her position to note the disposition of the new fortifications when chance puts into her hands the very opportunity for which she has vainly manuvred one day there lands from the packet a countrywoman of hersa beautiful peasantgirl of lige whose seduction and abandonment by a rascal aristocrat have made her amenable to any unscrupulous design upon the class that is responsible for her ruin to the protection of my lord the viscount the chevalierby whatever rusedeguerreis happy to commit the demoiselle throigne lambertine who poor fool chances into her hands at the crucial moment madame uttering what sounded like a blazing oath dashed in an uncontrollable fit of passion the little beast she held in her arms upon the ground the poor wretch whipped across the fender and lay screaming with its back broken she ran and trod upon it with a heavy foot stilling its cries it is a de querchy she shrieked it is so i crush my enemies then she came towards the bed her mouth mumbling and mowing as if the ghost of the departed brute were entered into her you are the devil she hissed and you will tell me how you shall use your knowledge in no way said ned his throat drummed with nausea his whole nature rose in revolt against this exhibition of infernal cruelty but he kept command of himself and of his cold aloofness in no way she said thickly her jaw seemed to drop she stared at him you will do noting no more than you he said you are welcome to your plot for me her eyes rather than her lips questioned him because said he i am convinced there is nothing to find out and you will be occupied in hunting a chimera when you might be more mischievously engaged elsewhere she nodded a great number of times the sweat stood on her forehead you had no thought to interfere she said vous tes plaindre i might have left you alone after all but i dreaded you would stand by and comprehend and upset my plans did i find a sujet fitting to my purepus indeed you had no reason to fear madame i am not so attached to my uncles company as that i should have been tempted to linger in it beyond the term prescribed by etiquette and this time be assured i found in it no additional attraction she made a deprecating motion with her shoulders then seated herself againbut away from the bedas if in exhaustion at least she murmured i have been your camarade de chambre and it seem i have nurse a viper in my bosom ned could only bow to this quite typically french example of moral obliquity you think the devil hath instructed me or that i am the devil he said it is not so madame i have lately been in paris i have kept my eyes and my ears open moreover i happen to have come across mademoiselle lambertineto have heard her storyto have known how she contemplated a descent on england add to this that looking from the window some hours ago i saw the girl parmi dautres paons tout fier se panadayou know the fable madame walking in your company add that the public generally hath an interest in the chevalier deons reputation and i at least in that of my uncle add perhaps that a sick mans brain is abnormally acute especially when exercised over the causes predisposing to his malady add that i have revolved these matters in my head as i lay here and pieced them together in the manner presented to you and upon my honour i think i have afforded you the full explanation the chevalier rose she had round her throat a thin band of black velvet that looked stretched almost to the snappingpoint je crois bien she said and you have missed your vocationyou are lost to the secret sairveece monsieur certainly said ned i am quite unable to lie she answered unaffected and with recovered gaiety i take then monsieur his word that he shall not interfere she added shaking her finger at him nevaretheless it is not all as you say but it is a good guess of half measures very well said ned with entire composure and that being understood perhaps madame will take up the one victim to her ardour and leave the other to his convalescence he bowed very politely and lay down with his face to the wall she gazed at him a moment with an expression compound of perplexity and lively detestation then reclaiming de querchy went from the room fondling the little broken corpse chapter xx during the short course of his restoration to vigour mr murk indulging that power of selfabstraction that was constitutionally at his command gave himself no further concern about his uncles affairs paramorous or political his resolving of the chevalier deons little riddle of intrigue was perhaps an achievement less remarkable than it appeared to be his own knowledge of my lords partial booncompanionship with the prime minister at putney and the notoriety of a particular kind that attached to the chevaliers name coupled with the more or less perilous gossip he had heard abroad had winged the shaft that hadsomething to his surprisestruck so near home now having proved to his satisfaction his own percipience in the conviction that the artifice of this intrigante was destined to procure of itself nothing but a political abortion he rested tranquilly and devoted his sparewhich was all but his mealtime to trying to play the harp this was a mournful misapplication of energy he had never known but one tunethe young shepherd by love sore opprest which he would intone in moments of exaltation now he could not reconcile it to the practical intervals of performance but was fain to introduce crippling variations in his hunt for the befitting string it was the merest game of disharmonic spillikins the contemplation of which affected his landlord almost to tears and to any such enigmatical protest as the following youve noought to make such a noration about nothing very well ned would answer but the spheres you know wrought harmony out of chaos nevertheless he took his characteristic place in the hearts of the simple folk with whom he lodged when byandby he was in a condition to stroll out into the living world once more it was agreeable to him to learn that the old seaport place had been quit for some days of all that connection that had been the cause of his detention in it his uncle was returned to town carrying presumably mademoiselle lambertine with him and the chevalier also had disappeared he dozed out his second week thereforeyielding his brain to the droning story of the seaon the mattress of the sands and at last revivified braced up his energies and turned his face to the london that had grown unfamiliar to him in accusing his nephew of inhabiting at some beggarly cockandpye tavern my lord murk had uttered a vexatious anachronism that testified to little but his own antiquity in the noblemans youth indeed the fields called after this hostelry though then occupied by the seven recently laidout fashionable streets that made a star from a doric pillar placd in the middle of a circular area abrg seven dials though the capital of the column was in fact a hexagon only were a traditional byword for lowlife frivolity their character however was now long redeemed or at least altered but though ned might not so far condescend to a philosophic vagrancy as to consort with beggars and mealmen it was certainly much his humour at this period of his life to rove from old inn to inn having any historic associations of his native city while during long intervals his chambers knew him not thus his uncle was so far near the mark as that for months antecedent to his continental excursion traces of him were only occasionally forthcoming from amongst the ancient hostelries that neighboured on the st giles quarter of the town the rose on holborn hill made memorable by the waterpoet the castle tavern where later tom spring threw up the sponge to death the george and blue boar ever famous in history as the scene of cromwell and iretons interception of that damning letter that the poor royal wren who hovered between hawk and buzzard was sending to his mate the venerable maidenhead with its vast porch and ghostly atticsin all of these antique shells and in many others had the young man buried himself for days or weeks according to his whim until periodically his uncle would be moved to exult over the probability of his having been knocked on the head in some lowbrowed rookery his very detested eccentricities serving for the means to his removal then suddenly ned would put in an appearance at the house in cavendish square and all the old rascals dreams would be shattered at a blow now upon his return our solemn young vagabond had no thought but to resume this motley habit of existence new alleys of interest he would explore adapting his moral eyesight to a focus that late experience had taught him the value of feeding his philosophy and humanity with a single spoon he disappeared and remote in his retreats was little tempted to emerge therefrom by the reports that were occasionally wafted to him of his uncles scandalous liaison with a beautiful belgian girl who had come to rule the viscounty thenwhen he had been for some six weeks serving the interests of his own education in the character of a sort of spiritual commercial travellerone day he happened upon throigne herself on this occasion chance had taken him westward and he was walking meditatively under the trees bordering the piccadilly side of the green park when a voice the low sound of which gave him an irresistible thrill hailed him in french from a carriage that drew up at the moment in the road hard by this carriage was a yellow tilbury glossy with new paint and varnish with the murk arms on the panels and a foaming bright chestnut to draw it and a very selfconscious tiger held the chestnut in while a lady jumped to the pavement i congratulate you said ned doffing his hat in the calmest astonishment you have made a slave of opportunity indeed she had the right selective faculty her schooling might have extended through a couple of months and here she was a queen of inimitable charms she had suffered no illusions of caste but recognising herself as to the purple of beauty born she had simply allowed her instincts for style to develop themselves in a congenial atmosphere and thereto a present air of pride and defiance lent its grace she made no secret to herself of what she was and yet that was merely the glorified accent to what she had been the brilliant dyes of the tigermoth are only the hues of the caterpillar intensified thisthe brilliancy the bright loveliness and the soft consciousness of it allhad been embryo in her from the first she took neds hands into hers in a wooing manner a scent of heliotrope like an unsaintly aureola sweetened her very neighbourhood where have you been she said and why hast thou never come near me why should you want me to he answered in genuine amazement you have made your bed mademoiselle lambertine i have not made it no it is not true she looked about her hurriedly it is for you to advise meto make it yourselfto lie in it if thou wilt hush monsieur we cannot talk here come and see mecome it will be well for you well for me but i have no private shame to traffic in nothing to accuse myself of mademoiselle ah mon dieu but byandby yes if you refuse me ned hesitated perhaps we may have observed that curiosity is a constituent of philosophy well he said where and when do you want me to come so she whispered eagerly jen suis bien aise to the house of the lord your uncle come this evening when dinner is served and done with i will receive you alone she gave him her hand with a rallying smile played to the gods in the person of the tiger and accepted his to her carriage ome she said to the boy unconscious irony muttered ned to himself as the tilbury sped away and how the dear fool has caught the trick of it somethinga rare sentiment of pride or humourpersuaded him to appear before her in the right trappings of his station he could look a very pretty gentleman when he condescended to the masquerade of frippery and silk and embroidery with a subscription to conventions in the shape of a light dust of powder on the wholesome tan of his cheeks revealed him a desirable youth still mademoiselle throigne though obviously taken aback before this presentment of an unrealised distinction was immediate in adapting herself to the altered relations implied thereby the perceptible imperiousness of her attitude towards him showed itself finely tempered by admiration as to her exercise of the softer influences she had graduated in these with honours while yet a child she welcomed him in a little boudoir that had been fitted up for her on the ground floor lace and buhlwork crystal and dainty china were all about her on the walls were sombre amorous pictures winking in the glassy shine from girandoles a decanter and goblets stood on a gilded whisp of a table under a mirror and hard by a tiny brown spaniel lay asleep on a cushion she might have been own sister to this whelp from the curl and colour of her hair on this she wore no powder but only a diamond star and loop in emphasis of its loveliness she was dressed without ostentation yet every knot and frill were disposed in a manner to suggest the liberal beauty of her figure but she had in truth no need of artifice to show her radiant in the eyes of gods and men now looking at her ned thought how in this short time has she renewed herself from that haunting ghost that possessed me on the lige road there is something uncanny in this resurrection i apprehend the seven devils must have entered into her and he felt a little discomfortable as if he were at last brought into acute antagonism with a force that he had hitherto despised for the vanity of its pretensions she took his hands and looked into his face there was a strange yearning inquiry in her eyes this very licence of touch so inappropriate to their cold relations one with the other put him on his guard though he would not at the moment resent it you knew i was there at dover she said ah i sorrowed for your wound mon ami but i could not come monseigneur would not let me the chevalier would not let me never mind that said ned withdrawing his hands it only concerns me that you have been consistent to your promise and that my lord attaches in your person another scandal to his record but that is not true she said shrugging her shoulders and even though it were will not your philosophy condone it little holy mother is it that such as you and hethat other of mricourtwould use liberty only as your pander disowning her when she has served her purpose she was all too young in vice as yet to play without some real emotion the part she had elected to fill he taught me from his devils gospels she cried and you saw and would not interfere because your faith was the same as his i was in mricourtfor how many days said ned and is this all your confidence mademoiselle she flushed and bit her lips the tears were in her eyes you are always cold she said you do not pity me or make allowance to be wooed to worship an ideal to be wooed through the hunger in ones soul for the truth that god seemed to withhold when he taught me that religion of equality he became my god i saw the disorder of the world resolve itself into love and innocence how was i inexperienced to know how a libertine will spend years if need be in undermining a trust that he may indulge a minutes happiness she had spoken so far with selfrestraint now suddenly she flashed out superbly you would not do the sameoh mon dieu no but you will condone his wickednessyes that is it liberty to you all is the liberty to act as you like to use the state and abuse it to use the woman and throw her aside hush said ned a little startled and concerned your liberty i take it you have committed to the keeping of my lord he may curtail it if you talk so loud she drew back imperiously the old tipsy man she cried in a pregnant voice i decoy and i repulse and i madden him i have learnt my lesson monsieur hark then she held up her hand from the diningroom adjacent came a quavering chauntthe maudlin singsong of ancient inebriety i know said ned he is halfway through his second bottle is it the music cried the girl that i have bartered my honour to listen to there are greater voices in the airthe thunder of cannon the roar of an emancipated people certainly it is true by report said ned that the french bastille is fallen into the hands of the moba consummation remotely influenced no doubt by the club of natures gentry into the hands of liberty monsieur the reign of falsehood is dead the ideal triumphs however far its wicked apostles may have sought to misconstrue it and i am of the people i am of the peoplethe people she gazed upas if in a sudden inspired ecstasythen buried her face in her hands her full bosom heaved she was beyond all control overwrought throigne exclaimed ned moved out of and despite himself she looked up again with flashing wet eyes my love is sworn to liberty she cried my hate to those who would make of her a pander to their own base desires so much of his teaching remains and let him abide by its consequences it is for me to drive the moral home to reveal him for the thing he isthe thing he is then ned holding no brief for st denys was tempted to an inexcusable utterance he was the father of your child throigne the girl started as if she had been struck she raised her eyes and clasped her hands and she said in a quivering voice i thank godoh i thank god he is dead the little poor infant and what would he have made of his babyhe that had the heart to disinherit and condemn to lifelong torture his own brother that he had played with as a child ned stood amazed his brother he criedthe sailor that perished in the west indies but monsieur himself told me of his brothers fate she gazed at him intensely during some moments the evidences of a hard mental struggle were in her face then she gave out a deep sigh he lied as always she said in a low voice lucien is at this day a wretched prisoner in the salptrire the madmans hospital of paris throigne what do you say cried ned it is true she went on he was disfigureddriven insane by the explosion but he was not killed he returned in his ship to cherbourg and there basile received him of the surgeon and conveyed him to paris he was never heard of again basile brought to their father the news that lucien was dead of his wounds and buried at sea monseigneur was old and childish and paris was far away that was seven years ago but it was only recently that sure of my loyalty and careless of the respect of the right to which he had deprived me he boasted to me of his ancient crime justifying it too on the score that a reconstituted society must to be effective be pruned of all disease moral and physical he should have hanged himself such inhuman villainy mademoiselle lambertine you have every reason to hate this man ah you think i colour the truth my god it is black enough why else himself like a reckless madman did he squander his double inheritance he foresaw the redistribution of property he was ever prophesying it he must drink deeply of pleasure if he would empty the cup before flinging it into the meltingpot moreover lucien had been the old mans favourite and ah he hated him for that she stopped a moment panting then went on her voice lower yet with hoarseness say at the best it was remorse made him a spendthrift and his conscience that salved itself with a lying pretext does that condone his perfidy to me yet i swear that he so blinded my eyes and my heart that while he was close to me i could not despite his confession of wickedness see him for the wretch he was now she came suddenly quite close up to the young man edouard she whispered in a voice so wooing that it seemed to stroke his cheek he should have leapt away but for the first time the fragrant sweet sensuousness of her presence bewitched him she put her hands timidly up to his shoulders and let her gaze melt into his the motion of her bosom communicated to his heart a soft slow throbbing in the pause that ensued the voice of the old drunken debauchee sounded fitfully from the diningroom now she murmured i see the truth stripped of all that passion that so falsely adorned it i see it in you as in myself a generous principle that owes nothing to selfindulgence thou couldst use this in me thou cold beautiful manthou couldst use me to such ends and never fail of thy selfrespect she slipped her hands a thought closer about his neck this evil magnificence she saidso strange and so terrible to the poor country girl every evening the old lord gets tipsy over his wine every evening he prays to me on his knees tonight i thought he would have diedthe passion so enraged him i swear that is all oh i have something cries in me for action some voice too summons me to that dark city where is being born in agony and travail the child of our hopesyours and mine not his nowedouard not his i pray only to meet him there that i may denounce him before the liberty he has outraged take me hence i am weary of the vile display weary of being sought the tool to designing men take me away to paris where the era of the new life is beginning in a paroxysm of entreaty emboldened by her little success she so tightened the soft embrace of her arms as to bring her lips almost into touch with his have i not proved myself as i promised a possession to covet she whispered now upon that ned came to himself at a leap he loosened her hands he repulsed and backed from her what shameless thing are you he criedthe more violently from a consciousness of his late perilthat you persist in the face of such rejection as you have already forced from me i do not desire your favour madame to offer it to me here in this place is nothing but an insult nor believe me do i covet the possession of one who hush she cried peremptorily she stood away from him panting heavily her face glowed with a veritable inner fire it is for the last time monsieurbe assured it is for the last time she breathed out then she blazed into uncontrollable passion senseless and a fool i would have given you a soul to dare and to do this is not a man but a block it is right monsieur you would freeze the hot life in memake it of your lead this poor gold of my humanity that other was better than youhe was better for after all he could lie bravely my god to be so scorned and flouted but there you shall learnah just a little lesson you are very proud and high yet i also shall be high if i choose she checked herself came up to and dared him in a rage of mockery tomorrow we go to putney it is all arranged and i have but to say the word the little word and i am lady murk you twitted me with the childmy god the man you are what now if his ghosthis imagewere to thrust itself in between you and the door was flung openpushed that is to say with a respectful violence nicely significant of emergency jepps stood on the threshold my lord will your lordship please to come at once so said this admirable man and what need was to say more ned in a moment was in the diningroom mademoiselle throigne had presumed a trifle too far on her desirability at least consulting her own interest she should have withheld one way or the other from the beast of her ambition that incitement to feed passion with fire the viscount murk lay amongst the glasses on the table dead of a rushing apoplexy that is all that it is necessary to say about him when later ned could somewhat collect his faculties he recalled dimly how a white face crowned with a mass of beautiful hair had seemed to hang staringlybefore it suddenly vanishedin the doorway of the fatal room but when he came to question jepps about mademoiselle lambertine he heard that the ladyafter returning to her own apartments for a brief whilehad quitted the house without sign or message yet one other visitor disturbed that night the house of deaththe chevalier deon she came in a chair from the theatre and ned going forth to her saw her startled old face twisting with chagrin as he thought in the light of the flambeaux she had heard the news from a linkboy in the square i can do nothing by coming in i suppose she said nothing whatever answered ned passionlessly he is quite beyond your influence book ii chapter i edward lord murknow three years enjoying the viscountywas established during the summer of at stowling his lordships seat near bury st edmunds since his uncles death he had spent the greater part of his time hereperhaps because his associations with the place were less of the disreputable old peer than of the traditions and the personnel that had made it dear to him in his youth he had sold both the cavendish square property and the villa at putney and was consequently no doubt very meanly equipped with domicile for a gentleman of his position that maybe to him was a term little else than synonymous with opportunity position at its best enabled him to realise on some ethical speculations of his earlier educational period his paris experiences had given to these their final direction and though he was theoretically as convinced as ever that men should be made virtuous by act of parliament the tablets of his soul bitten into by the acid of human suffering were come nowadays to exhibit the expression of a very human sympathy he gave with a large discriminating nobility yet no doubt he was little popular in the neighbourhood because in his benefactions he was discerning and because in indulging his liberality he would forego any display of the wealth that he was ever passing on to others already for a peer he was poor and had he chosen he might have cited in favour of his conception of a mechanical morality the fact that an emotional morality secretly despised in him that poverty by which it profited but he did not choose the spirit of philosophy still dwelt in him very sweet and sound in all these three years he had not once been abroad followingas keenly as it was possible for him to do in those days of crippled international communicationthe progress of the great revolution perhaps even contributing at its fair outset to the sinews of war he had yet no inducement whatever further to embroil himself an inconsiderable theorist with a distracted people between a turbulent chamber of his history and the halls of tranquillity in which he now sojourned had clappedto a very sombre door of death and this he had not the inclination to open again still often in his daydreams he would be back at madame gamelles watching all that life scintillating against the curtain of the bastille and now this curtain had in truth gone up revealing not as he himself had prophesied the blank brick wall of the theatre but democratic force represented in a vast perspectivea procession so endless that it seemed drawn out of the very brain of the north where all mystery is concentrated that now was an old story three subsequent years of planting and levelling had changed the face of the worlds garden of conventions and during all that time the world itself had stood round outside the railings peering in amazed upon a ruthless grubbing up and carting away of its pinkest flowers of propriety that was an old story nor less so to ned was the tale of his little sojourn in mricourt and thereon for all his rebelling his thoughts would sometimes dwell sweetly the very quaintness of his reception unflattering though it had been had still an odd thrill for him the memory of a happy period put to long wanderings by serried dykes of the old hamlet basking in the ferny bed of its hills of all the ridiculous and the tragic that blended made of the little episode in his life a sore that it was yet ticklingly pleasant to rub overthese the shadows of a momentary experience would rise before him not often yet so persistently that he came to attach almost a superstitious significance to their visitings for why else he thought should the ghost of one haunt the galleries of a thousand pictures some connection not yet severed must surely link him to that time yet during all this period of his responsibility no whisper to suggest that to his shadows he was become other than a shadow himself reached him it may have been breathed inaudibly nevertheless through the keyhole of that closed door of throigne he had heard no word after her flight from the house of death nor had he desired to hear or to do else than free himself of the dust of a scandal that for months after his succession had clung to him as the legitimate inheritor of a villainous reputation and this desire he had held by no means in order to the conciliation of mrs grundy but only that he might be early quit of the hampering impertinences of commiseration and criticism once it is true he had almost persuaded himself that it was his duty to seek for either verification or disproof of the girls almost incredible statement about the man lucien de st denys the conviction however that the story as related was incredible that it was revealed to him under the stress of passion and of immeasurable grievance that no manleast of all an astute rascalwould be likely to put into the hands of a womanthe baser sequel to whose ruin he was even then contemplatinga weapon so tipped with menace to himselfthis growing upon him he was decided in the end to forego the resolving of all problems but those that were incidental to his own affairs therefore he settled down with admirable decorum to the righteous lording of his acres still occasionally a restless spiritthat harlequin bastard of ariel and the earthborn crasiswould whisper in his ear of vast worldtracts unexplored of the meanness of social restrictions and of the early staleness that overtakes the daily bread of conventions of the harmonics of phantom delights that may be heard in the undervoices of flying winds of life as it might be lived did men serve nature with honesty instead of deceit then a longing would arise in him to be up and away again to throw off the shackles of formality and pursue his more liberal education through the fairs of the nations then his days would show themselves empty records strangely fed from some darker reservoir of emptiness the source of whose supply would be a weary enigma to him and in such moods it was that the gardens of the past blossomed through his dreams and figures sweet and spectral would be seen walking in themthroigne sometimes sometimes nicette and again othersyet these two most persistently the demesne of stowling was situate a long mile from bury st edmunds against the lynn road all about the grounds relics of an ancient grandeur were in evidence though the house itself a graceful jacobean block with projecting wings and stone eyebrows to its windows was a structure significant of a quite moderate condition of fortune the property in point of fact had been flung at hazard into the lap of that same hilary lord brindle own potcompanion to steele and to dick savage of the wandererwith whom indeed he had often cast at robinsons coffeehouse near charing cross where the broil occurred in which lady macclesfields bastard stabbed mr sinclair to death who was wont to justify his own viciousness by the aphorism whatever we are here for we are not here for good very few of the murks it must be confessed had been here for good though none had endeavoured to disprove one side of the mot with more pertinacity than the late viscount yet at last a successor was to the front who would inform with gravity and decorum the family seat that had been acquired rebuilt and maintained by the wild lord in a manner so questionable for ned the house was big enough to him its grounds presented a retreat that had all the melancholy charm of a cloister to its monks nameless antiquity dreamed in its clumps of mossy ruins in its fragment of a norman gateway in its tumbled wodehouse mensightless crippled giants with clubs shattered against the skull of time in its wolfish gurgoyles snarling up from the grass hereabouts could he wander a summers day and never regret the world not often was he to be seen in the old town hard by yet from time to time he would walk over on a sunny day and loiter away an hour or so in its venerable streets and therein one morning it was breathing kind july weather he saw a vision that seemed to typify to him the very sweet seventeen of the year now neds knowledge of women had been mostly of the emotional side and a certain constitutional causticity in him had been wrought out of all patience by the attentions to which he had been subjected in the respect of one order of passion it is true his innate sense of humour rejected for himself the plea of excessive attractiveness and indeed any explanation of the pursuit save that he had happened coincidently into the scentarea of a couple of questing creatures of prey still built as he was the experience was so far to his distaste as to incline him always a little thenceforth to an unreasonable hatred of the dulcetly sentimental in and indeed to a shyness of the sex altogether upon this however the little julywinged visionwhich blossomed into his sight as he turned the corner into a quiet streethe looked with that inspired premier coup dil that aurelians direct to a rare living specimen of what they have hitherto only known in unapproachable cabinets he looked and saw her spotless as recently emerged from some horny chrysalis of his own late incubating fancy this is ipsa qu the whichthere is none but only she he looked and the desire of acquisition gripped his heartif only he had had a net in his hand she had bright brown hair and chinablue eyes and her hair curled very daintily and her eyelashes dropped little butterfly kissesas the children call themon her own pretty cheeks she was of an appealing expression a thought coy and spirituelle and she was indescribably french too in her tricks of gesture and the very roguish tilt of her hat that was by the way to this travelled cymon emigrants nowadays were commoner than signboards in the streets of bury what concerned him was that the girl appeared to be in trouble she rested one hand on the sill of a low window in the wall her forehead had a pained line in it she sucked in her lower lip as if something hurt her from time to time an extraordinary little spasm seemed to waver up her frame at least one reprehensible suggestion as to the cause of this convulsion might have offered itself to a vulgar intelligencethe tyranny to put it sweetly of oversmall shoes my lord murk leaving his fine prudence and philosophy squabbling in the background walked up to and accosted the sufferer in deadly earnest and quite courtly french mademoiselle is in distress i am at her service and command the lady gave an irrepressible start and shuddered herself rigid certainly she was abominably prettystraightnosed wondereyed as a mousing kitten but she answered with unmistakable petulance and in a winning manner of english i am beholden to monsieur but it is nothingnothing at all i beg monsieur to proceed on his way ned bowed and withdrew the dismissal was peremptory he had no choice but daring to glance back as he was about to take another turning out of the empty street he was moved to pause again in a veritable little panic of curiosity for on the instant of his espial a clearing spasm it seemed was in process of bedevilling the angelic form and immediately the form repossessed itself of the nerves of motion skedaddled round a corner and disappeared now sudden inspiration came to master ned gossip he perceived that the lady had been standing upon a grating like a thief in good earnest he stole back to the scene of the contretemps and went into a silent fit of laughter two little high red heels bristling with nails were firmly wedged between the bars of the grille with a guilty roundabout glance he squatted and dug and beat them out with a sharp stone then observe the embryonic crudeness of romance in the shell he put themnails and allinto his tailpocket chapter ii had lord murk been of a present inclination less reserved and withdrawing he had months before found easy access to the presence of the merry maid whose little red heels seemed now as it were to have taken his misogamy by the tail for indeed when at last he sought he found this young ladys identity established in a word she was neither more nor less with a reservation in respect to the gossips than the adopted daughter of a very notable gouvernante to a royal family and she happened to have already sojourned in bury some six months during which he the hermitcrab had chosen to tuck himself away apathetic into his shell ned had of course heard of the not altogether peaceful invasion of the drowsy little town by one particularly hybrid company of emigrants that was in fact the travelling suite of mademoiselle dorlans whom the duke her father had for safety shipped to england towards the latter end of the previous year the importance of mademoiselles advent was signified rather in her rank than her maturity which presented her as a lymphatic little body some fifteen years of age with pink eyeplaces and a somewhat pathetic trick of expression but if her title proclaimed her nominal suzerainty over the valetaille that in its habits of volubility and swagger was to inflame the popular sense of decorum byandby to a rather feverish pitch of resentment the very practical conduct of the expedition was in the hands of that wonderful woman whom an irreverent virtuosity had entitled rousseaus hen ned had not in the least desired to make the acquaintance of this madame de genlis his position in the neighbourhood rather entailed upon him the courtesy of a welcome to the royal little redeyed stranger at his gates yet adapting his unsociability to popular rumour of the formidable basbleu that dragoned her he delayed a duty until its fulfilment became an impossibility and even a chance report or so that had reached him of the beauty of madames adopted childthe flowerfaced pamela notre petit bijou in praise of whose name abbreviated a dozen local squireens were flogging their tuneless brains for any rhyme less natural to the effort than damnmoved him only to some sardonic reflections on the uncomplimentary significance of a gift that seemed designed in principle for a stimulant to fools to fools had been his thought and now here he was having for the first time happened upon this actual pamela not only awake of a sudden to a glaring sense of the social solecism he had committed but awake also to a sentiment much less intimate as he thought to the world of ordinary emotions it was astounding it was humiliating so to truckle to the thrall of a couple of blue eyes that for all purposes of vision were no better than his own he stood astonished he rebelledbut he pursued he felt his very amourpropre giving before the incursion of a force stranger yet akin to it so the big brown rat oh vile analogy usurped the kingdom of his little black cousin why then did the unfortunate young man not reject and cast forth the spell that seemed to drain him of all the ichor of independence why did he wantonly stimulate in himself a fancy that his calm judgment pronounced hysterical how can these things be answered how could any sober reason analyse the motives of a person who kept in his tailpocket and frequently sat upon a charm that absolutely bristled with spikes it is the way of love when the mystic bolt flies the philosopher apart must take his chance of a wound with the man who lives in a street anyhow it must be recorded how ned took to hauntingwith the persistent casualness of one whose unattainable mistress is as suggested by his preoccupied manner the thing farthest from his thoughtsthe neighbourhood of a certain house in bury st edmunds this housea dignified twostoreyed redbrick building with a stiff white porch standing out into the road and on the floor above the porch five tall windows looking arrogantly down from behind a green balcony at the lesser lights in the barbers and fruiterers shops oppositewas situate about the middle of the town on a slope known as abbey hill and had for actual neighbour a chief hotel the angel then pretty newly built it facedacross that sort of homely place or town quadrangle that is so usual a feature in english old market boroughsa flaked and hoary norman tower that had once been the gateway to a graveyard long since passed with its dead into the limbo of memories madame la gouvernante could see the solemn eyebrows of this very doyen of antiquity bent upon her as she sat at the second djeuner and it made her nervous sometimes even she would send a servant to half close the blinds of the window over against her one cannot evade oneself of its senile addresses she said on a certain occasion to a florid gentleman in black who had come down from london to be her particular guest for a while i feel like vesta being made the courted of an old time it is always heere the mummy at the feast the gentleman laughed egad said he it is to illustrate how time stands still with madame the countess of genlis and as to the mummy why a mummy is but dust and dust is easy to layand he took a great pull from a bumper beside him he drank brandyandwater with his meat tis this country appetite he would say violent diseases need violent remedies but byandby he would take his share of the port and madeira with the rest now he looked across the table to a little shy lady and says he but speaking in very bad french mademoiselle the princess as i dissipate myself of this shadow so may you as readily of that that magnifies itself to the eyes of madame the countess he opened his own eyes as he spoke comically to imply some imaginary vision of terror he was very proud of these orbs that were large and liquid indeed he never allowed the well that replenished them to run dry estce bien possible fie then mr sherreeden put in a very little voicenot of the lady addressedfrom farther down the table but mademoiselle takes water with her wine madame tapped on her plate with her fan uttering an exclamation of reproval but the gentleman only laughed again miss rogue miss pamela said he being by this time secure of his priming i will compliment you and your wit on making a very pretty couple we are twins said the girl saucily we were found together on a doorstep taistoi coquine cried madame sharply the pair of you had been well committed to the foundling she treated with vast indulgence generally this pretty child of her adoption it seemed only that this particular subject was fraught with alarm to her byandby when the queer meal was ended there had been present at it besides the ladies and mr sheridan three silent botiansconcordia discors practical scientists attached to the household and now admitted legalit to a share in its social rites madame conducted her guest to her boudoir over the front porch and opened upon him with the matter momentarily nearest her heart does it magnify itself to my eyes thisthe shadow of the tower she said i do not know it was not so at barse where we arrive first but heereheere the place oppresses me its antiquity is a rebuke to the frothy dynasties every whisper is from a ghost of the past bidding us of the new mode to begone we are hated tracked and watched i see faces behind trees i heere mutterings through the walls what have we to do in this haunted town it is the buryingplace of kings said mr sheridan it should be to your taste madame la comtesse had no echo for levity she seemed quite genuinely agitated her trick pronounced eternal by one that detested her of advertising the beauty of her hand and arm by toying while she conversed with a fillet of packthread as if it were a harp string was exchanged now for an incessant nervous handling of a little miniature bastille carved from a fallen stone of the original that hung upon her bosom her facepretty yet though narrowing down to an oversmall chinseemed even yellow drawn and affrayed this appearance was partly due no doubt to the fact that she wore no rouge she had once made a vow to quit its use at the age of thirty and now at fortyfive she was yet true to her word indeed she was the very dvote of minervaworship she sighed that i whom nature intended for the cloister should have to fight always against the snares and the wickedness i sink was there evaire the time when my flesh not preek to the fright oh yes once when i was vain it is vanity that make the good armure i had no thought but levity when i marry m de genlisand afterwards during the years of passy of villerscotterets of the rue de richelieu then i have no fear of the morrow i have no fear at all but of the tooardent lover it must have been an everpresent fear said mr sheridan gravely she shook her head with hardly a laugh i am an old sad woman my armure is crumbled from me i play now only one partin those times it was many from cupid to a cuisinire i had the gift to make each character appear natural to present it nevairtheless of the most charming grace i was adored and adorable but it was vanity i would not exchange the present for the past i could perform on seven eight instruments monsieur i could dance to shame the unapproachable vestris i knew corneille by heart mirabeau himself was not cleverer in organising a comedy for the living than i for the artificial stage my rle was to promote the healthy condition of amiability to teach people how to be happy though innocent that rle yet remains to me the rest is gone when vanity has taught its lesson the pupil may become teacher i leave since many years the theatre of emotions for the theatre of life it would be good for some of your countrywomen to follow my example when i sink of your congreve your vanbrugh and of the young ladies at barse that listen wisout a blush eh bien on peut esprer que lhabit ne fait pas le moine faith its horrible said mr sheridan and he remembered how assiduously madame and her charges had frequented the theatres during their two months stay at that questionable wateringplace before they came to bury but the morals of belle chasse have not penetrated to england says he with a little roguish bow to the lady madame uttered a selfindulgent sigh she looked round on the frippery of fancyworkmossbaskets appliqu embroidery wax flowers illustrations of science in the shape of tiny trees formed from lead precipitate illustrations of art in the collections of little moony landscapes engraved on smoked cards illustrations of practical mechanics in the binding of a sticky volume or sothat lay about the room these were all so many evidences of her systeminstruction in the pleasant gardens of manual toil she was possessed of the little knowledge of a hundred little crafts she could have written a girls own book without the help of one collaborator i have eschewed all the frivolity she said it is only now that i desire for others to taste sweetly of the fruits of my experience i am like a nun wishing to dictate the high morality from her cell the world passes before my window in review and i applaud or condemn is it that i am to be accused of selfinterest of intrigue because i would convert my hardwrung knowledge to the profit of my fellows yet they pursue me with hate and menace my reputation is the sport of calumny my life hangs by a thread i write to monseigneur and he aggravates while seeking to allay my fears i write to m fox and he laugh politely in my face my friends heere that i thought turn against mesir gage madame young also that is prejudice of that mees burrnee you all love so and she is a tower of strength the little fanneeoh yes but steef like the tower there that is the same wis you all one must evaire conform to your tradeetions or you look asquint i think you exaggerate the danger said mr sheridan soberly but whatever it be here am i come down from london to your counsel and command madame rose from her seat and rested her long fingers caressingly on the speakers shoulder mon chevalier mon trs cher ami she said some real emotion in her voice forrgeeve me it would be good of you at any time but now now the pretty bird the sweet rossignol that cried into the night and was hearkened of an angel ah she has no longer of the desolation of the song that must hush itself weeping upon the heart she pressed her other hand to her bosom her companion leaned down a moment his fingers shading his eyes the desolation he muttered yes yes but for us now there is a deeper silence in the woods they spoke of his wife who had died but a few months previously perhaps the great man had been as faithful to her as it was the fashion for men great and little to be in those days to their partners at any rate he had loved her to the endin his own way a propos of which it may be recorded as richly characteristic of him how while this same wife lay adying he had been known to ease his heart of sorrow by scribbling verses to pamela then living in bath in whose beauty he had found or professed to find a reflection of his delias oldtime fairness now fortuitously the little sentimental passage was put an abrupt end to for as she leaned madame all of a sudden started violently and uttered a staccato shriek le voil the triste dark stranger he come again he come always you tell me now there is no purrepus in this devilish haunting she retreated backing into the room shrinking without the malignant focus of any stealthy glance directed at her from the road outside mr sheridan jumped to his feet and looked from the window strolling past in the sunlight with an air of studied preoccupation upon his face strolled a melancholy young man of enigmatical aspect madame withdrawn into the shade of a screen stood panting hysterically it is evaire so he come by morning and by noonthus hurrying not at all but watchful watchful from the blinkers of his eyes why am i so hated and pursued is he agent of m de liancourt do you think ah but it is worthy of a runagate so to war on a woman she squealed out in a sudden nervepanic to hear her companion laugh he ran to the door of the room faith he cried jovially im in the way to resolve this riddle at least and he pulled at the handle and vanished she cried after him to come backnot to leave her alonethat she would lose her reason were anything to happen to him his descending heels clattered an only reply then at a thought she ran to the window and peeped from the covert of curtains the stranger was wheeled about at the moment and returning as he had come she saw mr sheridan run forth bareheaded accost and seize him by both of his hands he seemed to return the greeting he madame the countess sank into a chair as mentally paralysed as though the end were upon her her chevalier was conducting the spy to the door of the house chapter iii a muchstricken young gentlemanvery undeservedly released from the onus of a social embarrassment for which he was alone responsiblestood gravely bowing before the lady of the house his face was quite white i am vastly pleased said mr sheridan to be the means of presenting to madame the countess of genlis a neighbour the lord viscount murk i have the honour of a slight acquaintance with his lordship i was even more intimate with his predecessor in the title but at least i can disabuse madames mind madame who up to the moment had seemed halfamort rose hurriedly all at once and swept her stranger a magnificent courtsey i feel already that i have known monsieur for years she said hard winter in her voice mr sheridan burst out laughing come come he cried a mistake isnt malice there was never one yet that sinned against nature zounds madame when the respite arrives we bear no grudge against the executioner i can vouch for my lord that he had no thought of offending ned looked enormously amazed none whatever he said why should i when i have not even the honour of madames acquaintance this was certainly ambiguous mr sheridan laughed again like a very groundling without affront said he let me ask your lordship a question why have you haunted madame who is plaguily afeared of ghosts haunted exclaimed ned haunted replied the other or is it perhaps one of madames sacred charges that is the object of your visitations madame de genlis who included in her rpertoire of accomplishments the art of reading character here after gazing intently at the young man a few moments permitted herself an immediate relaxation from severity to the most charming indulgence dieu du ciel she cried what an old old foolish woman it is nussing monsieur i see you pass and come back and come again one hundred time like a opegoblin and i sinki sinkah no matter what i sink i not know you less than nobodynot until mr sherreeden come and espy you and say do not fear thees poor eenocent and now i see it is not the old woman that attracts ned was by this up to the ears in a very slough of selfconsciousness to stand detected before the authority he had manuvred to hoodwinkso much of the innuendo he understood for the first time perhaps he realised how in lending himself to some traditional tactics he had advertised himself of the common clay he felt very hot and a little angry and his anger whipped his sense of personal dignity to a creamlike stiffness he was sorry he said he had been the cause of the least uneasiness to madame la comtesse he was a man of a rambling dispositionof a peripatetic philosophy often he had no doubt absorbed in some train of reflection he would unconsciously haunt a locality that associating itself with the prolegomena of his meditations would seem to supply the atmosphere most conducive to their regular progression he and here the door opened and a young lady ran into the room a thousand pardons cried this young person she did not know madame was engaged other than with mr sheridan and he counted for nothing but mademoiselle and she were learning to make artificial birdsnests with painted sugarplums for the eggs and they looked to madame la gouvernante to advise them she curtseyed to my lord with a little pert toss of her head like a windblown iceland poppyflower when he was made known to her she had no recollection of him it was evident all that play he had rehearsed to himself according to fifty different readings of the return of the red heels to their owner became impossible of performance the moment he found his audience a reality there and then he foresaw and prepared himself heroically to meet his martyrdom now all the glory and tragedy of neds life came to crowd themselves into a few monthsinto a few days indeed so far as his connection with the strange household at bury was concerned hereinno less on account of his magnetic leaning towards a bright particular star than because he had made his entre under the gis of mr sheridanhe was accepted and discussed pitied by some unsophisticated young hearts weighed in the balance of a maturer brain and found perhaps deficient he has the grand air said madame he is noble and sedate and of amiable principles buthlas quoi sert tout celaif one so gives effect to the gospel of distribution as to deprive oneself of the means to honourably perpetuate ones race i have always admired madames little ornament of the bastille said mr sheridan ah cried the lady smiling monsieur is varee arch but beauty is not the common property and the little pamela shall ask a fair return for hers well said mr sheridan tis notorious that damon hath squandered his inheritance on a very virtuous hobby and lives meanly in the result and that be assured is a pity for he seems a young gentleman of parts it was thus he played the devils advocate to neds beatification early he began to harp upon the one string behind the poor fellows back he professed to be in love with pamela himself and the intrusion of this most serious suitor interfered with his amusement he trifled no doubt in a very july mood he loved the girl for her prettiness and her saucy manner of speech he was humorously flattered by the familiar deference accorded him in a house of which he was claimed the dear friend and protector and on this account and because he was nothing if not unscrupulous in affairs of gallantry he condescended to acknowledge himself neds rival for the favour of mademoiselle ne sims that was pamela and to make good his suit with arguments of wit and brilliancy that threw poor damons solid virtues into the shade perhaps madame de genlis may have been the more inclined to besprinkle with cold water the ardour of the young lord in that she took the other with a rather confounding seriousness mr sheridan indeed offered himself at this period a particularly desirable match for a nameless young woman of inconsiderable fortune he was only a little past the zenith of his reputation and the glamour of his best work yet went always an atmosphere of greatness with him at fortyone years of age he was equipped with such a personality of wit eloquence and riches presumable in proportion as combined made him a very alluring parti in addition to this he could claim the advantages of a tall wellproportioned figure of a striking though not handsome face of an education in the most liberal modishness of the age his expression was frank his manner cordial and free from arrogance from first to last he was a formidable rival now on the very day the little comedy was all a matter of days following neds introduction by him to the family heseeing how the wind blew and at once regretting his complaisancebegan some petty tactics for the stultifying of a possible antagonist he drove the ladies uninvited over to lunch at stowling on the chance of taking master ned unawares and so of exposing the intrinsic poverty of a specious wooer nor was his astuteness miscalculated my lord viscount in the act of sitting down to a muttonchop was overwhelmed in fathomless waters of confusion he hastily organisedeven personally commandeda raid on the larders but their yield was inadequate to the occasion he apologised with desperate dignity a merry enough meal ensued but throughout hatred of his own selfsacrificing principles dwelt in him like a jaundice and he could have pronounced fearful anathema on all the fools of philanthropy who omitted to stock their cellars with nectar and ambrosia against the casual coming of angels mr sheridan supplied a feast of wit however and ned was grateful to him for it he even revived so far at the end as to beg the honour of providing the ladies with invitations to an assembly ball that was to be holden in bury on the thursday of that same week rather to his surprise they accepted with alacrity and so the matter was arranged and then at mr sheridans request but unwillingly he played cicerone to his own domain and thought at every turn he recognised a conscious pity for his indigent condition to underlie the fair compliments of his guests when these were gone he sent straightway for his steward and surprised the good man by an extraordinary jeremiad on the maladministration of a trust that fattened the dependants of a starving lord he himself he said was expected to dress like a bagman and feed like a kennelscraper in order that his household might gorge itself disgustingly in silken raiment he would have reforms he would have money he would have the house victualled as for a siege and grind the faces of the poor did they question his right to drink like cleopatra of dissolved pearls and then he burst out laughing and shook the honest man by the hand and turned him out of the room after which he sat down by the window and gnawed his thumbnails now it will be understood this unfortunate youth was fairly in the grip of that demoralising but evasive demon that is the sworn foe to philosophy he was entered of the amorous germ and the procreative atom multiplying was with amazing quickness to convert to misuse all the sound humours of his constitution he could not seek to exercise a normal faculty but it confused and routed what he had always recognised for the plain logic of existence he was ready to discount facts to magnify trifles to attach an unwarranted significance to specious vacuities to fathom a deep meaning with the very plumb he used for the sounding of a shallow artifice sometimes in a recrudescence of reason he would think like any calmsouled rationalist to analyse his own symptoms to annotate the course of his disease for the benefit of future victims to a like morbosity it was of no use his moral vision was so out of focus as to distort to him not only his present condition but all the processes that had conduced thereto he was humiliated and he writhed under and gloried in his humiliation to him as to many in like circumstance it seemed preposterous that he should have come unscathed through many battles to be outfenced by a child with a sword of lath so feels the warrior of a hundred fights when he is run in by a street constable for brawling ned dressed for the ball with particular care he was to constitute himself of madames party and for that purpose had engaged to dine with it before the event the meal was a desultory one the ladies toilettes serving as excuse for an unpunctuality that was generally opposed to the principles of la gouvernante but one by one all took their places at the tablemademoiselle dorlans in a finepowdered headdress having a single feather in it like a cockade and with her little plaintive rabbit eyes looking from a soft mist of fur pamela sweet and roguish wearing her own brown curls filleted with a double ribbon of yellow and mademoiselle sercey another young relative of madames and an inconsiderable item of the household at bury there were also accommodated with places three or four of the botians before referred tosilent awkward men painfully conscious of their quasielevation who sat below the salt and talked together in whispers mr sheridan came in late he had compromised with his grief so far as to exchange his black stockings for white and to wear a diamond brooch in his breast linen his hair was powdered and tied into a black ribbon ned must acknowledge to himself that he looked a very engaging gentleman he sparkled with fun and frolic and he fed the sparkle liberally from the long glass that stood beside him mademoiselle he said to the princess your hair is very pretty love hath nested in it and is hidden all but his wing but is it not illmanners to keep him whispering into your ear in company he talk only of the folly of flattery monsieur said the little lady simpering and bashful a ruse cried the other that he learned when he played the monk beware of him most when he preaches mademoiselle is told to beware of you monsieur said pamela to a gravely ecstatic young gentleman who sat next to her of me are you not then the monk the airmeet and is it not mademoiselles ear you seek no said ned brusquely he looked at the pretty insolent face at the toss of brown curls the little straight saucy nose the lowered lids he thought he had never seen anything so wonderful and so fair as this human flower the neck of her frock was cut down to a point she seemed the very bud of white womanhood breaking from its sheath did she gauge the admiration of his soul he was not a boisterous wooer or a talkative for days he had purposed lightening the conscious gravity of his suit by springing her lost heels upon his inamorata he could never however make up his mind as to the right wisdom of the course a dozen considerations kept him undecidedas to the possibility of giving offence of appearing a buffoon of failing out of the depths of his infatuation to introduce into the conduct of the jest a necessary barm of gaiety without this how little might the result justify the venture it was an anxious dilemma the thought of it threw into the shade all questions of a merely national character in which he had once taken an interest and in the meantime he continued to carry the ridiculous baubles about in his pocket now is it not one of loves ironies to depress a wooer by the very circumstance that should exalt him to make him so fearful of his own inadequacy as that he seeks to stultify in himself the very qualities that nature has amiably gifted him withal thus ned naturally a quite lovable youth when he had no thought of love was no sooner come under its spell than he was moved to forego that pretty selfconfident deportment that was his particular charm for an uncommunicative diffidence that appeared to present him as a hobbledehoy he lived in the constant dread indeed of procuring his own discomfiture by an assumption of assurance you know it is not he saiddaring greatly as it seemed to him i know monsieur the blue eyes were lifted a moment to his perhaps they recognised a latency of meaning in the gaze they encountered madame de genlis had once summed up the character of this sweet protge of hers idle witty vivacious she called her a person the least capable of reflection idle without doubt she was in the nurserymaids acceptance of the terma child full of caprice and mischief sure sir she added with a sudden thrilling demureness you must know me for a lowborn maid she was a little startled into the halfconscious navet by the dumb demand of the look fastened upon her besides she was certainly movedin despite of mreadoptive and some significant warnings received from herby the submission to her thrall of a seigneur whose ancient nobility no present penury could impeach but she had no sooner spoken than she recollected herself do you think me like mademoiselle dorlans she said hurriedly stopping one question with another it is some that say we might be surs consanguines what did the child mean had she any secret theory as to her own origin and if so was she subtly intent upon discounting her first avowal she may have wished to imply that no real necessity was for her selfdepreciation she may have wished only to divert the course of her neighbours thoughts he was about to answer in some astonishment ridiculing the suggestion when mr sheridan hailed pamela from his place opposite a nosegay he cried tapping his own flushed cheek in illustration give me a rose to wear for a favour it is easy said the girl her eyes sparkled she turned to a servant go fetch for mr sherreeden my rouge in the little box she said fie then naughty child cried madame it merits you rather to receive the little box on the ear but the great orator chuckled with laughter pigwidgeon pigwidgeon he said nodding his head at the culprit not for youth and health are rouge and enamel and all the vestments of vanity not eiser for youth or age said madame severely but only for ugliness said sheridan no said madamenor for zat it is all immoral immoral he cried immoral to put a good face on misfortune he looked only across the table over the brim of his glass when he had uttered his mot he delighted to make the girl laugh his own wonderful eyes would seem to ripple with merriment when he saw the light of glee spring forward in hers pigwidgeon he called her and she answered to the name with all the sprightliness it expressed pigwidgeon says he when you come to the age of crows foot you shall know tis a lying proverb that preacheth whats done cannot be undone or as a pedantic fellow writes it what cannot be repaired is not to be regretted and it is vary true says madame stifflywhosoever the pedant well says sheridan twas no other than him that writ rasselas for which work let us hope that god by this time hath damned himwith faint praise he checked himself immediately that were better left unnoticed says he with great soberness tis only the fool that uses the sacred name in flippancy he fell suddenly quiet and a momentary surprised silence depressed the company it did not last long all were shortly in a final bustle of preparation for the ball the ladies were bowed the botians melted from the room the two gentlemen were left to their wine the elders eyes twinkled back the ruddy glow of the decanters come my lord says he you are staid company i vow a toast or two before we leave the table heres to the widow of fifty cries ned adapting from the great man himself and raising his glass the other laughed i drink her he said a full bumper to mrs sims twas madame de genlis i meant and i meant the mother of pamela you take it so then i take the child at least said sheridan evasively to be the queen of curds and cream ned was of course not ignorant of the scandal attaching to this little waif of royalty it made no difference in his regard for her though perhaps the other wished it might mr sheridan maybe had shot a tiny bolt of jealousya tentative hint as to the vulgar origin of the pigwidgeon it missed fire and that gave him a thrill of annoyance he was conscious of some actual resentment against this solemn suitor who had come into his field of enamoured observation he did not fear him but he wished him out of the way that he might flirt in peace at the same time he may have possibly undervalued the determination of his reticent adversary well said ned heres to the mother of pamela whoever she be with all my heart cried sheridan and to the father by the same token ned turned his calm eyes so as to look into the injected orbs of his companion what manner of presence hath monsieur the duke of orleans said he it was never my fortune to happen on him in paris he is a friend of mine sir said sheridan from what point of view am i to describe him his enemiesof whom there are many in englandsay that the fruit of evil buds in his face egad i was near seeing it break into flower once twas at vauxhall when the company turned him its back he would have thought like a caligula then i warrant a prince sir something superior to the worst in him which is all that men will recognise but his personal appearance said ned the other returned the young mans gaze with a thought of insolence am i to smoke you he said mademoiselle dorlans is a little like her father in expression but our pamela is not at all like mademoiselle dorlans ned came to an immediate resolution mr sheridan said he i would crave your indulgence for a word in season you have advantages in this house that are not mine you are a great person and a welcome guest while i am only herei know iton sufferance you may turn your exceptional position to the profit of your amusement if it is to do no more it is asking you little to beg you to forego so trifling a sport if you are serious then let us in heavens name come to a candid understanding he set his lips to suppress any show of emotion but he was moved and it was not for the other however dumfoundered to put a jesting construction on the fact my lord said he pretty coldly though his words seemed to belie the tone in which they were spoken it would ill beseem a feeling heart at any juncturemine particularly at the presentto refuse its sympathy to an appeal of so nice a nature i will not pretend to misapprehend your lordship nor will i fail to respond in kind to your lordships frankness then you relieve me of the awkward necessity of an explanation said ned heaven knows there is no question of any right of mine to fall foul of your attitude towards one who may be your debtor for fifty benefactions heaven knows also that i never intended to imply that my most humble suit towards a certain lady was conditional on any information i might receive as to her actual parentage born in honour or out of iti tell you sir so far as she is concerned tis all one to me i speak straight to the point you may claim priority of acquaintance you may be able to advance twenty reasons why my taking you to task is an impertinence yet when all is saidif you are not serious it is just that you should yield the situation to one who is mr sheridan had sat through all this twirling his glass with a rather lowering smile on his face yield the situation he said but you take me by the throat sir i must assure you there is no situation of my contriving indeed said ned i am rejoiced to hear you say so and do desire to convince you that i find nothing more than a very engaging playfulness in your treatment of the young lady then why the plague said mr sheridan opening his eyes all this exception to my attitude because you chooselet me be plain sirto constitute yourself my rival in her favour mr sheridan exploded into irrepressible laughter zounds he cried here if i will not be something other than myself i shall have my throat cut is it said ned firmlypardon me siris it to be other than yourself to refrain from indulging a whim that is obviously another mans distress my lord said mr sheridan twinkling into sudden gravity and replenishing his glass this aspect of the case is such a one as i really had not considered but let me assure you that you were one of the direct causes of my coming down here at all i you most certainly he crossed his arms on the table and leaned forward madame by her own assertion was being watched and shadowed she claimed the protection of our laws she appealed to our government in the person of mr fox the gracious office of succouring the afflicted he deputed to me i hurried down to bury st edmunds and the first suspicious character pointed out to me was my lord viscount murk ridiculous of course but the situation you see is none of my handling he drank down his glassful and fell suddenly grave i have no wish nec cupias nec metuas to constitute myself your rival this mourning suit my lord is of a recent cut his tone was so dignified the illusion so sorrowfully significant that ned was smitten in a moment how were his ears startled then to hear a rallying laugh for anticlimax my dear fellow believe me i am not of those who imagine a bond in every light exchange of glances my dear fellow all we who are not turks are shareholders in a womans beauty there may be a managing director who has the right to a more intimate knowledge of it what care we who speculate in the open market so long as it flatters us with the soundness of our investment we draw the interest without responsibility and are always ready to commit the conduct of the business to him that hath the acknowledged right to control it he got to his feet hush he said we are summoned elect yourself to be this managing director if you will i am quite content to rest drawing my modest dividend that you have no right to begrudge me the advent of so distinguished a party in the assembly rooms created quite a little furore of excitement amongst the honest burgesses of bury my lord the reserved and almost inaccessible the illustrious parliamentarian whose very presence seemed to secure to all in the place a sort of reversionary interest in those glories of carlton house with which he was notoriously familiar the little stranger princess whose sojourn in the remote english town was so eloquent of the tragedy that even then was threatening to foreclose upon her housethese were the nucleus of such a coruscation of stars of the first magnitude as had never within living memory added its lustre to the congregated social lights of the borough but when madame la comtesse adapting her conduct of the expedition to those principles of which she was the present representative permitted her royal young charge the unconventional licence of dancing with any and all who had the high good fortune to procure themselves an introduction to her local opinion underwent a gradual transformation that culminated it is to be feared in actual scandalisation it transcends was the pronunciation in a deep voice of mrs prodmore anything so unblushingly shameless i had not dreamed could be i protest we are threatened with a gomorrah she was so very dcollete as to figure for the type of selfrenunciation offering to strip itself of all that it possessed that was much and much in little yet much in evidence her bodicewhat there was of itwas sewn with gems indeed her judgment of the newcomers may have been tainted by the fact that madame had declined to be introduced to herto her the richest woman in the room she was already fat yet she swelled with righteousness she suggested a little a meat pudding bulging from its basin perhaps said timid mrs lawless whom she addressed the french adhere to a standard of propriety that is only different from ours in degree she may not mean any harm she spoke with anxious diffidence conscious of the fact that at that very moment her son squire bob lawless was dancing with pamela thank you maam said mrs prodmore loftily but whether she means harm or not i prefer with my traditions to consider such behaviour an outrage ignorance does not condone indelicacy in the meanwhile the dance having come to an end pamela and her partner were strolled to within earshot of a saturnine young gentleman who stood glowering in a corner ecod mr lawless was saying twas the finest sport miss two broke collarbones and a splintered wrist and all for the sake of experiment as you might call it pamela looked up with her soft eyes it is cruel she said i do not like foxhunting at allso many giants riding down the one little poor pigmy why said the other in a surprised voice youre wilful miss wasnt the point of it all that twas nought but a drag hunt comment said pamela with a herring explained the squire well said pamela that is just as cruel to the herring she turned round on the instant to the sound of a little explosion of laughter my lord she exclaimed she dropped her companions arm bowed graciously to him i commit myself to this escort she said a thousand thanks for the dance monsieur poor nimrod had no choice but to accept his dismissal he had crowed over his fellowsquireens he must come down now a humbled cockerel he walked away sulkily enough monsieur said pamela to ned i am glad to have amused you it is for the first time this evening said his lordship grimly she was beginning in a little sputter of fire and pray what right have you when the expression in his face stopped her a woman no doubt has some spiritual probe for testing the presence of love as a butterfly feels for honey in a flower none whatever said ned it is my unhappiness she looked at him quite kindly the sweetest babies of pity sat in the blue flowers of her eyes why have you not ask me to dance she said poor pamela is flouted of all of whom she had the hope to be honoured you do not desire my hand no nor mr sherreeden eiser i am not to lead you out ma chrie he say it is because i am ask to drop the sobstance for the shadow i request of him what he mean tis only the fable of the dog and the piece of meat says he and how do that concern itself of the question i ask why he answer i am the dog and you are the piece of meat and that is to say that pamela is food for reflectionand then he laugh and bid me ask of monsieur murk to interpret me the fable her voice was full of tenderness and appeal ned despite some emotion consequent on the mention of his rival felt as remorseful as if he had wantonly crushed a rose in which lay a sleeping cupid he knew he had not asked the girl to dance with him for only the reason that a morbid sensitiveness impelled him to selfmartyrdomdrove his pride and his jealousy to battle the one ready to resent that an obvious preference was not shown by her for him out of all the world ready always to fold a wing of pretended indifference over the bleeding wound in his breast the other ready on the least provocation to make a shameless confession of the corroding secrets of its inmost soul certainly providence may be assumed to have its own reason for constituting a disease to be its highest ethical expression truth and love how have these inoculated one another with the virus drawn from ages of misfaith till each seems to have become an inextricable constituent of the common plague of jealousy and am i also the piece of meat to you says mistress pam that you will have nussing to speak with me i will not drop you for the shadow at least cries the other ferventlyno not as long as i have a tooth in my head so love glorifies bathos the two stood up together for the next set thenceforth ned moved on air breathed all the evening the intoxicating oxygen of idolatry the girl alternately flattered and flouted wounded and caressed him he must draw what consolation he could from the fact that mr sheridan at least left him a fair field now and then he would chance upon view of this gentleman and always it seemed to him that as the evening progressed the convivial face waxed steadily more rubicund the fine eyes more unspeculative once the party came together over the refreshment traysthe sweetmeats and negus that preceded the final breakup do not eat so much cake child says madame la gouvernante to pamela it will lie heavy on your chest happy cake murmurs sheridan so that the ladies might not hear him but my lord did and he might have been moved to some resentment had it not been for the others obvious condition ned after parting from the ladies would walk his long mile home by the solitary echoing road he needed loneliness he needed the illimitable graciousness of the open world within those shining walls it seemed to him he had not been able to think collectedly whither was he hurrying and in what perplexity of mission at one moment exalted at another depressed he could have thought himself the waif of a destiny in which his reason had no voice he looked up at the sky through an overhead tracery of leaves the blown branches of trees made a tinsel glitter of the brilliant moon some roadside aspens pattered with phantom rain a sense of unreality stole into his mind half drugging it the sound of his footsteps was echoed back from a wall he passed the echo appeared to double and redouble upon itself the footsteps to come thicker thronging fast and ever faster till he fancied an army of shadows must be going by on the opposite side of the way his brain grew full of the whisper and rustle of their march the spectral noise became accented by the far clang of voicesthe shout across half a world of some vast human force struggling upon a tide of agony the long wall ended he pulled himself together and shook out the ghost of a laugh whither he thought again as he strode on to the goal to which his every desire seemed to be compelling him but he had no will in the matter that had been sappedsnappeddeposed in a moment he was nothing but a log the stump of a mast in the surfnow rolled upon the shore now dragged back and committed to fresh voyagings his erect philosophy that had helped him so long over multitudinous waters was become nothing but a broken wastrel of the sea for fate to play at pitchandtoss with should he ever again be in the position to recover and splice it to set sail and escape from the fog and welter of the spindrift in which he now tumbled as he reached his gates he looked up once more at the sky the moon waded through a stream of cloud she will sink he muttered her glitter is already half quenched am i in love or only sickening for a scarlet fever chapter iv pretty early on the morning after the ball ned rode over to pay his respects to and inquire after the health of the ladies none apparently was as yet in evidence but mr sheridan having information of his coming sent down a message inviting him up to his bedroom and thither the young gentleman bent his steps not loath to avail himself of any excuse for remaining he found the viveur of the previous night propped up on his pillows a towel round his shaven head a pencil and paper on the counterpane before him at the dressingtable stood a little common man in a scratch wig and with a very blue chin who mixed some powders with smallbeer in a tumbler you wont thank me for introducing you said sheridan to ned monsieur has not le haut rang spare thy concern nor any word of our tongue who is he said ned my physician the deuce he is ah i am under the influence here of a democratic atmosphere no handmuffs and silverheaded canes in the economics of egalit in rome as rome monsieur is in fact a beastleech attached to the household to teach mesdemoiselles how to put pompons tail in splints when it has been caught in the parlour door he can bleed rowel and drench shoe a horse or salt a pig and egad now i think ont there is his right use to me for when a man has made a hog of himself what better physician does he need than him that hath the knowledge how to cure bacon deprecatory of the applause that he waited a moment to secure he called over to the little man by the table dpchetoi monsieur ma gorge est en feu attendez monsieur attendez replied the leech in a thin hoarse voice ayez encore un peu de patience je vous prie he brought the cup over in a moment sheridan sent the liquid hissing down his throat he gave a sigh of pleasure ah he said smallbeer and absolution were invented by the devil to tempt men to sin for the sake of the ecstasy of relief they bring he looked at ned his fevered eyes watering in the strong glare of sunlight that shot under the halfclosed blind you have an enviable complexion my lord said he did you ever in all your life experience the need to dose yourself with so much as a mug of tarwater ned laughed i refuse to lend myself to point a moral said he palate is a matter of temperament and temperament is a cause not a consequence mr sheridan may find in wine the very stimulant i borrow from country air and exercise oh the country said the other with a groan from tweed to channel nothing but the marketgarden to london so you think and yet you stay on here mr sheridan shrugged his shoulders his face seemed to have fallen quite sick and peevish by my own wish said he but at least i scent liberty at last madame i am abusing no confidence in telling you contemplates changing her quarters very shortly ned was conscious that his heart gave a somersault indeed said he reiningin his emotion and for what others i cant say monseigneur is i believe at brussels that is all i know and when is the removal to take place said ned sinkingly faith it cant be too soon for me madame the dear creature hath spy writ large upon her brain her tremors and her apprehensions would be ridiculous were they not tiresome there is no listening to reason with her she is convinced she is surrounded by secret agents of the royalty she hath provoked she lives in hourly fear of assassination for herself and abduction for her sacred charge one day she will do this another that bury herself and hers in the caves of staffa return to the protection of her illustrious protector that i warrant will be the end ot but there is some difficulty in the waysome imperative necessity as i understand that forewarning of her return be conveyed to monsieur the duke and she hath no messenger that she can trust to the taskno prodromos to signal her approach so day by day she grows more distraught until i know not what to say for counsel or comfort there was some odd quality in the stealth with which he regarded the young man as he spoke he saw his words had so far taken effect that ned was fallen into a musing fit where he sat by the bed he was too finished an artist in practical joking to ruin the promise of a situation by overhaste he would drop a suggestion on kind soil and leave it to germinate he knew that a seed thumbed in too deep is often choked from sprouting so having deposited his grain he took means to dismiss his subjectin the double sense well he said and that is all thats to remark ont but i was to have put you twenty questions when i asked you to come up as to the ball and your enjoyment of it and as to how far you was satisfied i had held to my share of the compact sir i claim you responsible at least for the state of my head this morning he turned over on his pillow with a moan zounds said he smallbeer i find is like smalltalk for deadening ones faculties i must commit myself to good mr pigcurer if i would save my bacon ned secretly thought this a poor capping of a fairly respectable witticism he would have valued the joke even less as a spontaneous effusion could he have examined its essays scribbled over the scrap of paper on which mr sheridan had been writing before he entered physicians and porkbutchers both cure by killing like all butchers they must kill to cure and so on and so on however he got to his feet immediately and apologising for his intrusion made his adieux and left the invalid to his aching cogitations these were perhaps more characteristic than praiseworthy mr sheridans social ethics would always extend a plenary indulgence to practical joking it was a practical joke to rid oneself of a rival by whatever ruse his ruse had been to grossly misrepresent to madame the young lords financial condition quite indefinitely he had succeeded in investing ned with the character of a needy adventurer local evidence as to the reckless philanthropy visual proof of the inner poverty of stowling helped him to the fraud madame may have been ambitious for the child of her adoption she may have become cognisant of the fact that a little tendresse was beginning to show itself in the girls attitude towards her grave young suitor she may have been anxious only to accommodate herself to the wishes of her distinguished guest whom she fervently admired and upon whom at this juncture she was greatly dependent for advice and assistance at any rate she lent herself to his plans the two devised a little plot of which she was to be the ingenuous agent and my lord the poor viscount the victim perhaps the understanding between the conspirators was sympathetic rather than verbal of whatever nature it was a certain method of procedure was adopted by bothdiplomatically to conciliate effectively to get rid of madame it must be said was not attracted to his lordship her volatility recoiled from his solemnity conscious of the most lofty principles she could never when in his company free herself of the impression that she was being found out she had a shrewd idea that neds respectful subscription to her opinions was in the nature of a moral bribe to secure her favourable consideration of his suitthat secretly he valued her at that cheaper estimate that she secretly knew represented her real moral solvency when one has a grudge against the superior understanding of a person it is a thing dear to ones amour propre to convert that understanding to ones own uses as ned descended the stairs madame came suddenly upon him and welcoming him with quite cordial effusion drew him into a side room she hoped he was not fatigued after the late festivities as for the members of her own household they were one and all the victims of a migraine she here looked forth a moment and issued a sharp order to some one to close a little door that led from the back hall into the garden yes all were enervatedovercome mademoiselle was in bed pamela was in bed mr sherreeden was in bed as for herself no such desirable indulgence was possible a ceaseless vigilance was entailed upon her during such moments of relaxation as she permitted herself she was constrained to wear a mask of gaiety over the shocking anxiety of her soul she was surrounded by menace and intrigue there was scarce one she could rely upononly mr sherreeden and he could little longer afford to be parted from his duties there was not a soul even she could entrust at this time with a letter it was imperative should be conveyed abroad by a confident hand she had no hesitation in informing monsieur of its direction it was to monseigneur the father of the young princess at present sojourning in brussels it was to acquaint monseigneur of the pitiable anxiety of the refugees and to beg him to order their return at once but it would be necessary for the messenger to back up the substance of the letter by arguments deduced from a personal knowledge of the condition of the victims and who in all her forlorn state could she find meet to so delicate a mission she wept she clasped her hands convulsively she apostrophised heaven was this the brilliant selfconfident rather aggressive chaperon of the night before ned listened in something like amazement he could never have misdoubted the obvious suggestion of her lamentation as to her sincerity it is very possible he was completely duped he was not at all in the plot against himself and madame had been a notable actress from the days when at eleven years old she played the title part in racines iphignie en aulide ah monsieur cried she but the joy all troubles past of welcoming in our land the amiable friend who should be the means to our returning thither if now the idea of offering himself to the mission first began to take root in neds mind it was because his jealousy would not tolerate the thought that failing him another might be found to serve his mistress with a less questioning devotion still he would not yet commit himself definitely to a course that not onlyin the present state of continental fermententailed a certain personal risk but entailed a risk that in the result might effectively separate him from that very fair lady it was his principal wish to serve in the matter moreover it was certainly in his interest to ascertain if it was this same ladys desire to be so served by him when does madame wish this letter conveyed he said gravely after some moments of deep pondering oh indeed cried madame but varee soonin twotree days and the messenger is to be a sort of outrider to your party an outriderbut in truth yet how far an outrider shall depend upon his influence with monseigneur ned bowed i should like to think the matter over said he it is possible at least i may be able to serve madame with an avantcoureur madame seized his hands in an emotional grasp my friend my dear friend she murmured and now said ned with madames permission i will take a turn in the garden had madame again the impression that she was found out of this unconscionable joseph she certainly flushed the little flush of shamefulness and for the moment had not a plausible word at her command for indeed she knew and what was worse believed that my lord knew that pamela was at that very time seated by herself in the little boxarbour amongst the jerusalem artichokes the girls figure had been plainly visible through the doorway which madame had ordered overlate to be closed and the sudden realisation of the situation was like a cold douche to her selfconfidence to deny this cavalier on whatever pretext the substance of his request was assuredly to convict herself of having lied as to pamelas whereabouts was to dismiss him at a critical moment was possibly to deprive him of that actual inducement to serve her which an interview with the young lady might confirm on the other hand the girl herself may have profited by some indefinite warnings as to the folly of effecting a msalliance as to the ineffectiveness of a coronet when it is in pledge to the jews madame after a scarcely appreciable moment of hesitation came to her decision with a charming smile it was entirely at monsieurs disposition she said there was not a soul in it and she would see that monsieur was not disturbed for herself the contemplation of flowers resolved many problems that the subtlest sophistries were unable to disentangle ned set foot on the long boxbordered path with his mind in a condition of strange ferment the glamour of the previous night the sweet glory of this new bidding to the side of his mistress over which his soul laughed as over its own humorous strategy in the hoodwinking of a credulous guardian the thought that it was in his power to assist to its welfare the very dear object of his solicitude and by so assisting to convert what might otherwise seem a pursuit into a welcomesuch fancies combined made of his brain a house of pleasant dreams all down the bedrows the scent of blossoming mignonette accompanied him to the arbour at the end of the garden to his dying day this gentle green flower remained the asphodel of his heaven great ships of cloud carrying freightage of hidden stars sailed slowly across the sky to ports beyond the vision of the world yet there did not seem enough wind to discrown a thistlehead the lark rose straight as the smoke from the town chimneys dropping a clew of song into the very gaping throats of his own nestlings in the field the rattle of a horses headstall the drowsy thunder of rolling skittleballs came over the wall from the neighbouring inn as distinct in their every vibration as though the silence of night in a motionless atmosphere had merged itself imperceptibly in the life of a day but half awake and behold at the end of the garden was the crystallised expression of all this peace and beauty the breathing spirit of the roses and of the mignonette ned as he looked down upon her had a thought that if she woke the wind would rise the roseleaves scatter and the cloud argosies dash themselves shapeless on rocks of air how pretty she was great god how pretty and how innocent to him who had fronted stubbornly the storms of passion who had been sought a sacrifice to the misconsecrated heats of a love whose name in consequence he had learned to loathe this new power of reverence was most wonderful and most dear he could have worshipped had he not loved so humanly mademoiselle was sunk a little back into the leafage of the arbour her eyes were closed her lips a trifle parted she was cuddled into a pink nglig everything she wore seemed to caress her an open book lay upon her lap one slender finger serving for listless marker in it suddenly a tiny smile the ghostliest throb of laughter flickered at the corners of her mouth ned leapt hot all over oh monsieur murmured the unconscionable witch as if talking in her sleep but are you the doctor yes said ned she put out a languid hand never raising her eyelids madamemaman says it is the cake but i think it is the englishman that lies heavy on me what englishman said ned my lord the englishman monsieur is he not the heaviest of all in bury ned touched the young healthy pulse as if he handled a wax flower if that is the trouble said he it is soon dealt with but how monsieur and would you not first see my tongue and she put out the tip of a supremely pink organ it is as red as a capsicum said ned pamela burst out laughing she sat up her cheeks flushed her brown hair ruffled on her forehead oh she cried you do not say pretty things at all you are not like mr sherreeden no said the young man sadly and because i have not his readiness i must lack his good fortune is that the moral of it but i could be a willing pupil if you would be my tutor is it so i should punish and punish till you wearied of me say then like mr sherreeden oh mon bontmoi he does not you know speak varee good french but here is a poor little sick fairy crumpled in a rose petal hlas you could not have said that you solemn man i could not indeed but i should have taken the poor little sick fairy and nursed her upon my heart she looked up at him kindlily and suddenly pathetically but i am not sick at all she said and you must not take my play to your heart thereat foolish ned reading her words literally missed his small chance i never did he only answered stoutly i knew you were not asleep mademoiselle pouted i do not act so badly nevertheless she said when i may have an appreciative audience and i at least am that she shrugged her shoulders yawned a tiny yawn well she said i must not keep monsieur from his business and monsieur the doctor shall not persuade me to cure too much cake with more she rose smoothing her rumpled plumes ned smiled i will not since you bid me take it to heart he said had you found me as heavy as you say you would not last night have voluntarily elected to bear so much of the weight of my company i sacrificed myself monsieur according to my principles to the good of the community pamela cried my lord suddenly pained my business is to go on a journey only for the reason that i may serve you she would have resented without any real feeling of resentment his familiar use of her name had not his tone found the sympathetic chord in her that his words could not reach has madame asked you then she said with some wonder some gentleness in her voice i have resolved to offer myself if you will give me the one end of a clue of hope to bear along with me of what hope monsieur your bargain should be with madame not with me he would not take her by storm the aggravating noodle no doubt that erst fulsome experience of his had distorted his sense of proportion in such matters tis no bargain of course he cried in great distress to give me hope is to hand me nothing but a promissory note without a signature but i would kiss it none the less for the sake of the name that might be there but why did he not kiss the jade herself mon ami she said very kindly you must not concern yourself so of the favour of a poor foolish maid who could return you ah so little for the noble trust you place in her who is not even the mistress of herself pamela he cried in sudden agony you are not bound to another i am bound only to those who have protected and cared for me she answered it is no time this when danger threatens to think of separating myself from our common fortune her young bosom heaved her eyes even filled with tears ah she murmured there is nothing invites me but the peace of the cloister to escape from the turmoil and the menaceto know no interest of love or fortune in the company of gods dear prisoners perhaps she only quoted from the commonplace book of mre adoptive at least the picture she conjured up seemed so real as to fetch a little sob from her neds heart was rent by the sound my dear he said simply i would not persuade you against your conscience god knows in any bargain between us i should be the only gainer i have nothing to offer you that is worth the offer but my love dear that is for you in stress or sunshine whenever you care to whistle for it now i will say no more but i will cross the channel at the very bidding of madame la comtesse and pave the way as i can for your return and i shall carry hope with me pamela it is the beggars scrip and what am i but a beggar for the first time he forgot the little red heels that were still in his pocket they were often to prove a sharp reminder of themselves however did the girl read his figurative speech in a too literal sense let us hope she was never influenced by a consideration so worldly she held out her hand to him her blue eyes swam with tears perhaps in happier times to come she saidand so they parted chapter v twice again only before he started for the continentas he persisted in thinking at her sole behestwas ned vouchsafed the partial company of his mistress in each instance he must forego the desire of his heart for a personal interview such by accident or design was denied him but he had the satisfaction of being received by madame with an ease and a familiarity that were significant of a quite particular confidence on the first occasion he happened upon the ladies out walking in a country lane they were botanising under the tutorship of a botian new to hima thin clericallooking individual with a little head appropriately like an anther the house at bury was indeed a perfect surprisetub for the uncommon personalities it seemed to have an endless capacity for turning out its staff was perhaps twenty all told yet this number in view of its omniferous faculties would often appear as selfreproductive as a stage dozen of soldiers walking itself round a rock into a company madame who was engaged in receiving from monsieur her stickinwaiting the names of dbutantes hedgeflowers presented to her waved a gracious end to the ceremony and greeting my lord as if he were a dear friend invited him to pace beside her it is well timed she said monsieur has received my letter and will friday suit our so generous cavalier to depart ned bowed with his neverfailing gravity yes he said simply the lady clasped her hands mon dieu she exclaimed with a quite melodramatic fervour it is the passing of the cloud after all the tempesttossing to see the shore in sightand she hastily lifted her skirts from contact with a roadside puddle monsieur said a little voice almost at neds ear do you know what is a corolle and what a nectaire in some mood of impudence or mischief pamela was come to give her company unbidden she would pretend not to see the warning gestures of la gouvernante she held in her hand the parts of a dismembered flower and she looked up at the young man as she stepped light as his own sudden thoughts at his side she felt a little warmth a little pity towards him he was going far away and to serve her that she knew it was in the nature of a tiny confidence between them her glance was appealing as a childs asking not to be left and as for ned the sight of this sweet face close to him so inflamed his heart that his formal speech took fire i know when i look at you he said they are mademoiselles cheek and mouth classified in the near prospect of his banishment he spoke out reckless of consequences perhaps the unexpected answer took the girl herself by surprise she hung her head and fell back a little mademoiselle cried ned if i might take thence a rose to wear for a favour oh fie she answered that is not even original it is to repeat mr sherreedens foolishness and they are not roses at all nor rouge said ned though you once implied it no she said with a pert glance at her gouvernante madamemaman does not approve but sometimes to rub them with a geranium petalthat is not immoral is it i dont know cried the young man but the geranium shall be my queen of flowers from this time pamela cried madame in desperate chagrin over every word that passed between the two yet impotent under existing circumstances to give expression to her annoyance but she ventured to summon the child pretty peremptorily to come and walk beside her and only in this order was my lord destined to enjoy for an hour a divided pleasure but on the second and final occasion of his meeting her chance and the girl were even less favourable to him he was to start for belgium on the friday morning and on the thursday evening he walked over to bury to receive his instructions he found signs of confusion in the houseboxes choking the passages personal litter of all kinds brought together as if for removal and in the drawingroom a little concertsuch as madame loved to extemporisewas in process of performance with mr sheridan in mighty boisterous spirits for only listener he invited ned to a seat beside him and clapped him on the shoulder tis admirable said he not concert but concertation there is no conductor but a lightningconductor could direct these warring elements madame indeed set the time on her harp but it was the time that waits for no man a botianof whom there were a halfdozen in the orchestramight pant a mere winded laggard into his flute another might toilfully climb the last bars on his fiddle as if it were a gate a third might pound up the long hill of his doublebass and cross its very bridge with a shriek like a viewholloa the issue was the samenone was in at the death pamela in the meantime tinkled on a triangle mademoiselle sercey shook a little panic cluster of sledgebells whenever madame glanced her way mademoiselle dorlans played on the sidedrum amiably and with all the execution of a toyrabbit it was all very merry and the girls giggled famously and ned closed his eyes and tried to think that the mellow ring of the steel was from the forging by love of his bolts on a tiny anvil byandby the piece ended amidst laughter and madame came from her place and conducted her cavalier into another room it is to prove yourself the most disinterested she said how can i acquit myself of gratitude to my friendto my knighterrant ned in the hot longing of his soul was near stumbling upon a suggestion as to the reward it was in her power if not to bestow at least to influence but he remembered his promise to pamela and was fain to let the opportunity pass then madame to some fine play of emotion produced a couple of letters under sealthe first to monsieur le duc the second to her own soninlaw m becelaer de lawoestine to the latter gentlemans address in brussels she begged my lord to proceed in the first instance the belgian nobleman would give him honourable welcome no less for her sake than for monsieurs most obvious merits moreover de lawoestine would furnish him with precise directions as to where monseigneur was at the moment to be found if indeed monseigneur was not at the very time the others guest in brussels these were neds simple instructions there were tender messages to madames daughter suggestions as to the attitude most effective to be assumed towards monseigneur by madames plenipotentiary references to the agony of suspense madame must suffer until she should learn the result of her envoys mission madame in truth either acted her part so well or lived in it so naturally as to half convince herself we must believe that she was not acting at all we are ready as you see to start the moment monseigneurs command shall reach us she said we pray monsieur for the prosperous termination to your voyage her eyes were moist she impulsively extended her hand which his lordship less impulsively kissed his lips indeed unpractised in gallantry were in pledge to a dream his understanding also had it not been he might have inclined to the question how comes it that madame in direct communication with the duke of orleans is unable to acquaint me certainly as to that princes present address ned returned to the drawingroom prepared to repudiate any suggestion of the glamour that might be held to attach itself to a mild form of heroism his modesty was not put to the test the company accepted him in a frolic mood it was full of laughter and thoughtlessness he was rallied only on his serious mien pamela wilful and radiant would acknowledge him for no more than the means to a jest her affectation of indifference was secretly a stimulus to the spirits of two at least of the party for a household depressed by the gloom of impending misfortune the atmosphere was singularly volatile not to the end did ned receive one hint that his selfsacrifice was appreciated and applauded and at last he must make his adieux without the comfort of even a sympathetic glance from a certain direction to cheer him on his way he had put on his hat and coat had reached the very porch on his way forth when a light step sounded behind him goodbye monsieur god bless you pamela monsieur it is only the rose you asked for the door slammed behind him he held half stupidly in his hand a little sweetsmelling stalk with some crushed scarlet flowers my godoh my god he whispered it is part of herself chapter vi it was on a day of the last week of broiling july that ned knocked at the door of a house in the rue de ragule near the schaerbeck gate in brussels and desired to be shown into the presence of m le comte de lawoestine now it seemed at the outset that his mission was in vain for monsieur was and had been for many days away from home and it was impossible for one to say when he would return and whither had he gone ah that was known only to himself and possibly yes to madame la comtesse and was madame away also madame oh ctait une autre pair de manches madame it would appear was upstairs at that very moment ned sent up his letter of introduction andafter a rather tiresome interval of waitingwas shown into a room on the first floor here to his astonishment was the midday meal in progress at a long polished table two ladiesone seated at either sidecontinued eating with scarcely a look askance at the stranger a third placid and dbonnaire rose from her place at the head of the board and advancing a step or two held out her hand i have read mamans letter she said but speaking in french in a little drowsy voice and i have the pleasure to make you welcome monsieur she then returned to her seat and bidding a servant lay a cover for monsieur went on with her dinner the very antichthon of the galvanic genlis spirit seemed to slumber in her rosy cheeks she had settled down to a lifelong rest like an actress availing herself only of the art of her profession to play herself into a fortunate match monsieur le comte is away said ned as he took his seat by one of the silent ladies he is gone south to join his regiment he will be at lige for a few days to inspect the fortifications i do not know i what it all portends they say the air is full of hidden menace anyhow what does m lafayette purpose in bringing an army of ragamuffins to the frontier he is a nobleman and a gentleman i saw him once at bellechasse ah the dear industrious days but i prefer a life of ease monsieur do not you to gild baskets and work samplers with the sun on ones head in the hot white room mother of christ it is hot enough in brussels one may think one hears the sun drop grease upon the stones in the street when fanchon spits upon a flatiron in the kitchen have you ever known a summer so sultry the sky is packed with thunder like the hold of a ship then will come the rain one day and swell it and swell it and the decks will burst asunder and the ribs explode apart i do not like thunder monsieurdo you it is disturbing like the play of children yet we are to have thunder enough soon they say so she talked on in a tuneless soft voice and there seemed no particular reason why she should ever come to an end she never paused for an answer or for a word nor often for breath which long habit had taught her the art of nursing she asked no questions as to her mother did not indeed so much as allude to her until ned indirectly forced a reference and where is monsieur le duc said he cutting in during a momentary ellipsis that was caused by her indetermination in choosing between two dishes of vegetables she did not answer till she had decidedupon taking some of each then she turned her soft eyes on him in a little wonder monsieur she began as if she had not heard the duke of orleans said ned indeed i do not know he should be in paris he has left here then here brussels do you mean he has not to my knowledge been in brussels these six monthsno not since january when he came to meet the demoiselle throigne on her return from the austrian prisons and conducted her back to the capital throigne exclaimed ned in faint amazement so she is called i believe went on the placid creature oblivious of the little emotion she had caused monsieur has heard of her no doubt she is beautiful and of easy virtue they say at her house in the rue de rohan the most violent propagandists assemble nightly to discuss the overthrow of the present social conditions i wish they would leave them alone they are very reasonable i thinkto all at least who have assured incomes she is quite a force in paris this woman they sent her some time last year en mission to these netherlands to preach the new religion but she was arrested by the agents of the emperor and conveyed to vienna whence she was dismissed no later than last january monseigneur was hunting with m de lawoestine at the time and he heard somehow and came straight on to brussels and carried the demoiselle throigne away and that was the last you have seen of him yet your mother had no doubt but that he was in this neighbourhood oh maman cried madame with a tiny shrug of her shoulders but she is as full of fancies as this mushroom is of grubs indeed said ned quite dumfoundered i think you must be misinformed as to monsieur le duc very well she said indifferently it is possible of course m de lawoestine is not communicative nor am i curious there is no reason why they should not be in lige together at this very moment there was every reason however against such a meeting but madame had not the shadow of a diplomatic acumen i must follow your husband to lige then said ned you will at least lie here for the night monsieur a thousand pardons madame my business is of the most pressing and you yourself confess an ignorance as to the movements of monsieur le comte mon dieu i never trouble my head about them with madames permission i will bid her adieu at the end of the meal as you will monsieur and if you do not find monsieur le duc in lige then i shall go on to paris i hope then monsieurs passports are in order they take me into france by way of the low countries madame your mother is responsible for them she is at any rate a woman of business nevertheless the borders are disturbed i wish monsieur a very fair journey i trust he will not be struck by the lightning butmother of christ i think there is a storm coming such as we have never seen i shall take some peaches and some cake and sit in the cellars till it is over my lord reached lige on the morning of the twentyninth of julya day of sullen omen to france the early noon hours he spent in dully strolling through the streets of the antique city now grown so familiar to him he had called at m de lawoestines address as supplied him by the young madame only to find that the count was absent on some expedition and would not return till the morrow of the duke of orleanss presence in the town he could obtain no tittle of evidence now he was dull because misgivings were beginning to oppress him and because the weather made an atmosphere appropriate to the confusion in his brain certainly he did not actually face in the moral sense the question as to whether or no he had been intentionally committed to a fools errand he could not have conceived how so elaborate a jest should be planned and carried through without suspicion awaking in his heart naturally knowing the soundness of his own financial position he was not conscious of the supposed bar to his suit his uneasiness turned rather on his new conception of madame de genlis as a woman of that patchwork practicalness that leaves to chance the working out of its design she may have intended that monsieur le duc should be in brusselsit would doubtless have been convenient to her to find him thereand therefore she may have through ned acted upon her desire rather than upon her information but if this were so what a crazy perspective of possibilities was opened out to what an endless wildgoose chase might he not be sworn and in the meantime pamela and mr sheridan there was such anguish in the thought as to make him augment his pace till his forehead was wet with perspiration he had come out to escape the intolerable oppressiveness of confinement in an inn it was such weather as he had experienced upon his first visit to the towngood god how many years ago was that now yet there seemed fewer changes in it than in himself it was such weather but intensifiedand with that at least his own condition kept pace he had a warmer core in his breast than had been there before but the tall narrow streets the cool churches the blazing marketsthese had no longer the glamour of the past his thoughts were always in shadowy english lanes in fragrant english rooms a girls laugh in the street would make him lift his head as he paced a jingle of bells on the harness of some sleepy belgian horse would recall to him with a thrill the tinkle of a triangle and for the rest the sweet pungency of geranium flowers he carried always in his breast like a very garden of pleasant memories and in the meantime pamela and mr sheridan he looked up with a sudden start somethinghe could not describe whatlike the silence that succeeds the heavy slamming of a door seemed to have gripped the world the heat for days had been immense and cruel men roysterers and blasphemers were come to a mean inclination to expend what little breath was left to them in prayer a habit of stealthily examining the face of the heavens for signs significant of the approaching black death of the storm was common the water seemed to steam in the kennels the lead to crackle in the gutters some inhuman outcome it was predicted of these unnatural conditions must result and now at last had the plaguestroke fallen whatever it wasthis inexplicable turn of the wheelthe tension of existence drew to near snappingpoint under it poor souls crept for pools of shadow as if these were bethesdas here and there one dropped upon the pavement and was rescued as under fire by a companion the wail of halfstifled infants came through open windows the sun was a crown of thorns to the earth the streets at the flood of noon grew almost untenable nedperhaps from some vague association of ideas the result of his dreamings upon english lanesleft the town and with the desire for trees compelling him took halfunconsciously the mricourt road it may have been instinct merely that directed him he had thought since his cominghow could he help itof throigne of nicette of all his old connection with the strange little village but he had no desire to renew his acquaintance with the people of that ancient comedyso now it seemed to him and surely by this time a new piece must hold the stage the old masks must be crumbled away or repainted to other expressions it was so long ago he had leapt the boundaryriver of youth in the interval he could have no place at last in the life of the little hamlet by the woods it may have been the sudden realisation of this his grown emancipation that tempted him all in a moment and quite strangely to the desire to look once more upon the scenes that until within the last few minutes he had had no least wish to revisit it may have been that he was driven onward simply by the goad of his most haunting distressthat fancy of mr sheridan greatly profiting by a rivals absenceand by the thought of the intolerable period of mental suspense and bodily discomfort he must suffer down there in the town until his interview with m de lawoestine should give a direction one way or the other to his mission such considerations may have urged him orwith a bow of deference to the necessitariansno consideration at all but a fatality for indeed this storman historical onethat was to break seemed so inspired an invasion of order by the prophets of anarchy as that it appeared to impress under its banner as it advanced all predestined agents however individually insignificant of that social and religious havoc of which its ruinous course was to be typical ned as he toiled on the first of the hill looked up at the sky it was as the wall of a ninedays furnacehis eyes could not endure the terror of the light nor from his position could they see how far down on the horizon a mighty draft of cloud was slipping over the world like the sliding lid of a shallow box shutting into frightful darkness a panic host of souls here it was better than in the town but the heat still was terrific he was yet undecided as to whether to go on or rest where he had paused when a carter with a tilted waggon came up the road behind him for the weird opportuneness of it this might have been khleborn himself the man as it appeared was bound for the farther side of mricourt ned seeing the chance offered him to view from ambush accepted his unconscious destiny struck his bargain and slipped under the canvas khleborn cried up his team the sick day turned moaning among its distant trees like a delirious troll the lodestone to all this dark force of electricity that came up swiftly over the verge of the world rising from the caldron of the east where inhuman things are brewed was it an iron cross standing high in the roadway of a populous bridge a cross that seemed to crane its gaunt neck looking ever over a wandering concourse of heads to the horizon gazing like st genevive for the cloudy coming of an attila a cross held up as it were before the towers of parisa retro satanas to the menacing shapes that emerging from chaos threatened the ancient order the ancient dynasty the ancient religionthe cross indeed on the bridge of charenton for in charenton that day was pregnant conference was a famous banquet to marseillais and jacobin was sinister tolling of the deathknell of royal france and what if the bell swung without a clapper the very air it displaced reeling from its onset like foam from a prow caught the whisper of death in its passing and carried it on to the cross the death of royalty and of religion the desecration of the tabernacles the spilling of the kingly chrism and trampling of the host as night at last shut upon the boiling day concentrating the heat the cross on the now lonely bridge stiffened its back and stood awaiting the storm that must fly far before it could reach the pole of its attraction but it was approaching the cross could feel the very ribs of the world vibrating under the terrific trample of its march at present inaudible but there came byandby little vancouriers of sound moaning doves of dismay that fled on the wind as before a forest fire these flew faster and more furious fugitives in a moment before the distant explosion of artillery the rain began to fall in heavy drops like lifeblood from the lungs of the heavens the earth sighed once in its sleep in an instant a great glare licked the town hither and thither swayed bent but stubborn now shoulder to shoulder with the hurricane now clawing at the stones to save itself from being wrenched from its socket now stooping a little to let a flying charge overleap itthrough half the night the cross stood its ground barring the road to paris then at length a bolt struck and shivered it where it stood it is gone shrieked the storm the way to paris lies open the last of the symbols of an ancient reverence is broken and thrown aside to ned in the woods of mricourt was vouchsafed a foretaste of this tempest that rose and travelled so swiftly that having for its siderite the polestar of all revolution rushed across a continent in fire so rabid as that it expended ninetenths of its force before it might reach and charge with its remaining strength the electric citythe nervedrawn city that had shrilled into the night that encompassed it crying for reserves of dynamism lest at the last it should sink and succumb but if the storm brought small grist to the actual mill the morning when it broke voiceless and dripping revealed sufficient evidence of how deadly had been its threshing throughout the fields of its advance over the northeastern noon and flying a dull high monster up the valley of the meusefrom charleroi to maubeuge and across the border down with a swoop upon st quentin and on with a shriek and crash into and through the woods of soissons opening out at last from pantin to vitry as if to invest the city and slash at it with a reapinghook of fireso the force had come and passed like a tidal wave of flame leaving a broad wake of ruin and desolation on all the leaguelong roads converging to the central city were fragments of broken and twisted railings of riven trees of thatch and rick and chimney on many was the sterner wreckage of human beingspoor jacques and jacqueline struck down and torn by branch or flame as they drove their slow provision carts towards the capital through the furious darkness not a dying christ at a crosstrack but the storm demon had found and shattered on his blazing anvil the pitiful symbols of the old love of the old beliefone by one he had splintered and flung them as he swept on his road nor only the symbols of the old faith but of the new order for entering in the end the very gates of the city he had driven with a desperate rally of ferocity at certain sentinels ensconced dismally in their boxes against the railings of public buildings and consuming them had committed their ashes to the consideration of the anarchy to which he had rushed to subscribe such revelations were all for the morrow and in the meantime ned was become a little fateful waif of the first processes of the force the storm came upon him when alighted in the deep woods behind the chateau passing under cover through mricourt a few minutes earlier he had peeped through his tilt scanning the familiar scenes with a strange little emotion of memory feeling this he had almost regretted his venture perhaps the emotion was accountable he thought to the heatto the reenacting of an atmosphere that was charged with suggestion he couldand didrecall a vision by the village fountainthe vision of a girl all bold outline and colouring standing with her arms crooked backwards under her lifted hair he could recall another figure coming up the fieldpath hard bya face of pearly shadows and wondering blue eyes under a great fragrant load of grasses these blue eyes haunted him in the retrospect even while he shut his own angrily upon the little ghostly impression why could he not dismiss the thought of them from his mind why had he submitted himself to the influence of the place at all it was too late now to retreat his cartera sleepy ligeois attired appropriately in a hoqueton or smock like a nightgownled his team stolidly by fountain and landlust past church and smithy and so through the village into the forest road beyond ned in the darkness felt in his breast for his talisman his tiny packet of geranium flower and bringing out his hand scented kissed it then restored thereby to reason in the thick of the woods he hailed his jehu to a stop descended and paying liberally for his journey plunged amongst the trees at once the shadow of an impending fear took him in grip the earth he could have thought lay rigid in a dry fever of terror the shade he had so much coveted fell around him like a living shroud he had always an unreasonable dread of what lay behind the curtain of trunks before him he moved on purposeless and prickling with apprehension had it not been for very shame he would have turned and fled for the open daring any meeting in the village rather than this nameless dead solitude but he forced himself to proceed mentally assigning himself for goal that old withered leviathan in the clearing that was the centre of some strange associations he had been curious long ago he admitted to look upon this monster since the legend of divinity had attached to it he would go so far now and satisfy his eyes then turn and make for air and light suddenly he fancied he heard far away the rumble of the receding waggonwheels a numb stillness succeeded the earth seemed to breathe its last and a napkin of cloud was softly flung over the dead face of it the lungs of the day fell in a few large bitter drops slipped from the closed lids of the heavens straight and in a moment ned sprang alert to a sense of peril this ominous oppressiveness was nothing but the forereach of a swiftly advancing thunderstormbut the trees and every green spire toppling into cloud an invitation to its own destruction he must race for coverand whither the little hut beyond the clearing it presented itself to him in a flash he set off running the very enforced action was a tonic to his nerves as he sped the darkness gathered around him deep and deeper he ran in a livid twilight then on the quicker beat of a pulse the wood was torn with fire from hem to hem he was dazzled halfshocked to a pause for an instant but there had been a panic sound to drive him forward again directlya huge tearing noise within the monstrous slam that had trodden upon the heels of the blaze he could only guess what this portended at the very first explosion a tree of the forest had been struck and riven now he scurried so fast that the breath sobbed a little in his throat he had a feeling that the force was dodging him heading him off from reach of shelter not a soul did he meet but formless shadows seemed to cry him on from deep to lonelier deep of the maze then again a sudden glare took him in the face like a whip and at once the furies of the storm burst from restraint and danced upon the woods in fire and water rehearsing the very carmagnole of the terror all in a moment the fugitive broke into the clearing he sought but had dreaded he would miss even as he ranhalf deafened yet relieved by the uproar that had succeeded a silence as awful as it was inhumanhe must slacken his pace in view of the towering giant that dominated his every strange memory connected with the place suddenly he stopped altogether staring at the great tumorous trunk where had he read or heard that beechtrees were secure from stroke by lightning should he stand by here under shelter of the enormous withered arms in his trouble he might scarcely notice how the whole character of the isolated spot in which he stood was converted from that that figured in his memory yet he took it in vaguely by the sickly lightthe bluepainted iron railings having a locked wicket that fenced in the sacred bole the gleaming silver hearts hung here and there about the bark the cropped ribbon of sward that encircled the tree yet upon this green for all its cultivated trimness he could have thought the underwood was encroached and dimly he recalled st denyss prophecy if in years to come thou tellst me this charmed circle has been broken into by the thicket i will answer that elsewhere the people stand on the dases of kings surely the idle prediction was strangely verified even where he stood for all the little shelter of the high branches the tempest beat the breath out of his body every moment the crash and welter and uproar took a more hellish note and aspect he felt he could not stand it much longer suddenly twisting about from a vision of fierce light he caught a startled glimpse of something he had hitherto failed to notice the narrow track that had once led through the heart of the thicket to the hut amongst the trees was a narrow track no longer it had been opened out and greatly widened so as to give passage to a tiny chapel that stood at the close of a short vista of trunks with a gasp of relief ned raced for this unexpected refuge dashed up a step threw himself against the door and half stumbled into a void beyond it the door flapped to behind him he stood panting in a little crypt of scented gloom somewhere in front a single ruby star glowed unwaveringa core of utter peace and quiet chapter vii the thunder and the storm roared overhead with a deadened sound not a breath of all the turmoil could touch the serenity of the star it burned without a flutter diffusing even the slightest gentlest radiance throughout the tiny building ned from his position near the door could make out the whitewashed walls and ceiling the wee square windows glazed with twilight as sleek and dusky as oxydised silver the little litter of chairs about the floor the altar overhung by some indistinguishable dark picture most suggestively most spectrally the very painted statue at whose feet the star itself was glowing he stepped softly towards the shrine a dozen paces brought him almost within touch of itand of something else a woman was crouched against the pedestal of the image her hands clasped high on the stone her face buried in the curve of her left arm in the incessant throb and flash of the lightning through the little windows he could see the soft heave of her shoulders the shredded glints of light running up and down her hair as she drew quick breaths like one in terror something in the same moment convinced him that she was aware of his entrance that in the insane relief engendered of company she was struggling to present as spiritual preoccupation the appearances of extreme fear if this were so she fought in vain to save her selfrespect her collapse it was evident had been too abject to rally from it on the mere prick of pride was an impossibility here to her lost and foundered in hell had come a first presence of human sympathy it was sympathy in the dusk in the endless flash and roll and in the heavy roaring of the rain on the roof neds spirit reaching across a reeling abyss felt that this fellowcreature was in mortal terror too diffident nevertheless to make a first advance he compromised with his pity by seizing a chair and dragging it towards him that the very rough jar of its legs on the boards should be sound assurance to the other of a human neighbourhood the little instinctive act fraught with kindliness touched off the nerve of endurance as he dropped into the seat he had pulled forward the prostrate figure detaching itself from the pedestal came suddenly writhing and crouching over the few yards of floor that separated them and throwing itself at his feet put up a mad groping hand i am dying of fear it whispered ned caught the hand in a succouring grip he could see only the glimmer of a white face raised to his he was bending down to give it words of assurance when to a hellish crash the whole building seemed to leap into liquid fireto sink weltering into a black and humming void the shock the noise had been thickly stunning rather than earsplitting here in the chapel they were too close to the cause to suffer the sound perspective that shatters the brain they might have been the stone the kernel from which the force itself had burst on all sides by slow degrees neds eyes recovered their focus until he could make out once more the ghostly blotch of a face looking up into his neither of these two beyond an involuntary jerk of response to the enormous flame and detonation had stirred from the attitude into which it would almost appear they had been stricken the actual terror of the one the sympathy of the other seemed welded by the flash into a single expression of fatality in the lonely chapel amidst wrack and storm to each the spectre of a memory had suddenly materialised revealing itself amazingly significant i must go muttered ned all in a moment he spoke confusedly trying to withdraw his hand but the other soft clutch resisted the other halfdeafened ears could yet essay to catch the import of the murmur you wont leave mehere alone she said oh i shall die of the fear she could waive before him all pretence of her possessing the divine favour or protection it was her rapture that this manwho had again stepped across the years of darkness into her lifeknew her soul her rapture to woo him by the seduction of her surrender to his nobler understanding his spirit darkened yet knowing her fearfulness of old he could not in common humanity forsake her till the terror was past so they sat on in silence she flung at his feet holding his hand while the flame and fury expended themselves overhead once or twice he was conscious that her lips were helping the office of her fingers and he flushed shamefully in the darkness yet would not seem to condone her offenceher terrible sacrilege even under the circumstancesby so much as noticing it but he thought of the little flowerpacket in his breast and he cursed his bitter folly that after such a warning as he had already had he should have ventured himself wantonly within the charmed influence of this silkenskinned witch suddenly it might almost be said the tempest fled by it passed as rapidly as it had come travelling westwards on a flooded current of wind the noise the glare ceased light grew on the dimwashed walls the dark picture above the altar revealed itself a pious representation of the very subject that had founded the chapel there the saint stood in effigy for all the world to worship here she knelt selfconfessed at the feet of the one man for whose hot reprobation she yearned so long as it would kiss in pity where it had struck ned glanced down at the lifted face it may have suggested in its expression some secret halfunconscious triumph he tore away his handsprang to his feet as the clouds broke outside and sunshine came into the place you must let me go he said your saints will be enough to protect you now she rose hurriedly and stood beside him there was something new and indescribable in her air and appearanceit might have been the mere maturity of selflove whatever her stress of mind during these three years its effect had not been to warp and wither her physical beauty even the little angles of the past were rounded off she was developeda riper more perilous lamia hush she whispered pointing to the altar the tabernacle he gave a low little laugh what he said dropping his voice nevertheless is the presence more real to you than to me will you still pretend we are alone nicette alone the word was soft music to her no she said coming after him as he strode towards the door i will pretend to nothingnothing with you she put out a hand and gently detained him oh she said a very hunger in her voice and eyes to see you againto see you again why are you here you did not follow me no one knew i was in the wood and i was caught by the storm my god my god to be near it allin the midstand the curse of heaven awake it is folly is it not that talk of retributionthe folly of sinners and the opportunity of priests here was i alone for all hell to torture and instead you come upon me unawares he stood dumfoundered that she could thus bare her soul to him she had no shame it seemed but the sweet exalted shame of the seductress her eyes dwelt upon him in ecstasy whence do you come she went on in a soft panting voice but what does it matter since you are here i knew in the end you would return thisthis she put her hand upon her bosomoh it is a fierce magnet that would have drawn you across the world he pulled at the doorlet in a lance of brilliant light that struck full upon his face something in its expression appeared to startle her she leaned forward and uttered a sudden miserable cry where have you beenwhat have you done my god let me look the next instant she backed from him a little throwing her hands to her eyes as if she were blinded it is there she cried what i have longed and prayed for but it is not for me he recovered his voice in a fury prayed he cried are such prayers from such a source answered stand off for shame this meeting is all an accident i have neither sought nor desired to see you it is an accidentdo you hear he tore open the door jumped the step ran a few paces and stopped with an exclamation of sheer astonishment a huge ruin of trunk and branch closed his vista the old woodland monarch the type of stately quincentennial growth and decline was shattered where it stood at the last facing its thousandth tempest it had been wounded to death in the forefront of the battle the brand had struck its mightiest branch tearing it from its socket and the crashing limb in its downfall had wrenched apart the trunk revealing a great hollow heart of decay the quiet drip and fall from loaded leaves the faint rumble of the retreating storm the steam from the hotsoaked grassned was conscious of them all as he stood a moment in awe then he hurried forward againup to the very scene of the disaster the ruin was complete the silver hearts were fused or vanished the sacred fence was whirled abroad in twisted fantastic shapes so much for the immunity of beechtrees he could hardly dare to face the moral of his escape but he must face another as terrible if more impersonal it presented itself to him on the instanta little heart within the hearta poor decayed fragment of humanity sunk deep in the vegetable decay of the exposed hollow at first mentally stunned and confused moreover by this arabesque of ruin he failed to realise that what he looked upon was other than some accident of rubbish it rested down near the ground upon what had once been the bottom of a deep well of eaten timber it had strangely enough the appearance of a sleeping child he took a quick step forward his very heart seemed to gasp god in heaven it was a childnot sleeping but dead and mummified a soundsomething awful like the breathstruggle of one who had been winded by a blowfluttered in his ear he leapt aside from it staring behind him nicette was there gazinggazing but at him no longer her eyes were like stones in a hewn grey mask youth had shuddered from her cheeks suddenly she turned upon him stiffly her soul instinctively recognised the whole that was implied by his scarce voluntarily expressed terror of her neighbourhood i did not kill him she whispered it is baptiste then he was familiar at once with the stupendous horror of it all that was such and so appalling in the light or blackness of a construction that her immediate surrender of the situation made inevitable that his brain reeled under the shock he was an accessory to something namelessly hideous then in a moment she was prostrate at his feet clinging to him imploring his mercy his kindness urging him by his pity by her agony to withdraw her from vision of the terror to listen to and believe her take me away she screamed it was his own doing i did not kill him he repulsed her with a raging force still staring silently over and beyond her it seemed to him that some ghastly sacristan was lighting up a sacrificial altar in his memory candle by candle it flamed into dreadful illumination revealing the abominations that in the darkness he had been only innocently condoning he thought he understood now what had impelled her to that strange haunting of the neighbourhood of the tree what remorse had driven her to the prayers and prostrations that had aroused the curiosity of the village why panicstricken under that threat of search she had wrought in a moment of her imagination a fable that should serve her secret evermore for an ark doublecased he recalled in the ghastly light of a new interpretation almost the last words she had spoken to him in a time that he had thought was dead and forgotten oh my god not so to stultify all i have suffered and done for thy sake for his sakefor his sake was he so vile as this thenhe who had dared in dreams to mate with a purity like an angelsthat the incense of any noisome sacrifice if only offered up to himself he must be held to find grateful he broke without meaning it into a horrible laugh did shethe mothernot promise he shrieked to restore the little brother to youthe poor little murdered wretch she has kept to her word and youyou dont forget you are sworn under damnation to dedicate yourself a maid to her service can you do it god in heaven it is not your fault if you can she fell before him as he spurned her writhing and moaning amongst the sodden grass wont you listen to meoh wont you listen if you would only kill me and not speak he stood immediately rigid as justices own sentry yes i will listen he said and you shall condemn yourself she crept a thought nearer and feeling him keep aloof sat bowed upon the ground her fingers locked together in her lap i will tell you the truth she said low and broken after that first time he my brother was changed he became when you were gone a little devil insulting and defying me it was terriblehis precocity he held over my head ever a threatmonsieur it was that he would make exposure of the liaison between his sister and the englishman ned uttered an exclamation she entreated him with raised hands ah it is not always the truth one fears one day in the woodsoh my god monsieur hide mein the woodswhat was i saying mother of god it was herewe quarrelled and i was desperate he ran to escape me climbed the great branch that stooped to the grass he stood high up reviling me i made as if to fling a stone he threw up his arm stumbled and disappeared she crept towards him again yet another agonised appeal for the tiniest assurance that he had ceased to loathe her at least this time he stood his ground at first i was stunned she said he may have been killed at once for no sound reached me then all at once the wicked spirit put it into my head that here by doing nothing was a sure way out of my difficultieswas safety from that impish slanderer was the bar removed to my favour in the eyes of one who had confided to me his detestation of children ned sprang back almost striking at the crouching figure not me he raged i will have no responsibilitynot any for the inhuman deed thrust upon me and so you left him to his fate and went home and ate and drank feeding your beastly lusts and desires while heoh devil devil she scrambled to her feet and made as if she would run from this new terror of a hate more ghastly than all she had suffered hitherto dont kill me she whimpered did you not tell me you hated children and you said they could not feel as we do he glared at her like a maniac you left him what is the need to say more i did not she moaned wringing her hands as if to cleanse them of blood i came again on the third day and i called to him i prayed to him but he never cried back one word then i thought perhaps he has climbed out and fled away liar you are a liar why then did you seek to hide your crime by a blasphemous lie i have suffered she answered only like one before the judgmentseat he mastered himself by a wrenching effort he stood aside peremptorily motioning her to pass on her way not a word would he speak she went forward a few stepsa numb haggard spectre of beauty a soul paralysed under the immediate terror of its sentence suddenly she turned upon him awful in the last expression of despair they will tear me to pieces when they know let your virgin protect you he said without another word she left him going off amongst the trees the sunbeams peering through the leaves touched and fled from contact with her woodland things scurried from her path the cleansing rain even stringing the branches withheld itself from falling till she had gone something that he drove under forcibly struggled to rise and give voice from the watchers heart she looked so small so pitifully frail and small a vessel to carry that great load of sin the next moment she disappeared from his sight he turned with a groan to scrutinise the horror it was yet so far undecayed as that he was able for all his little memory of the living child to identify the poor remains but for a certain reason he would compel himself to a nauseous taskeven to touch the thing if necessary it was not there was actual evidence to his unaccustomed eyes that the boys neck had been dislocated by the fall he moved away giving out a sigh of fearful relief at least he would not be haunted by that anguish and should he follow and tell her no he thought sternlyfor love makes men cruel as she meant so shall she suffer the worst chapter viii the viscount murk received very gravely m becelaer de lawoestines assurance that monseigneur the duke of orleans was at the moment and had been for months past in paris enfin said this gentleman if report is to be believed it is the most timely place for him at least he will not put himself at the head of the emigrants he added with a husky little laugh he was plump and prosperously healthy like his wife they seemed admirably suited to one anothera pigeon pair indeed and like a pigeon was the little fat man in his white austrian uniform he strutted he preened himself he cooed his place should have been on a roofridge of his own happy courts ned had a melancholy desire to crumble some bread for him you are pale as a very ghost monsieur said this same ruddy count condescendingly it is not to be wondered at you have alighted upon us in stirring times not to speak of the storm yesterday that was enough to quell the stoutest courage i would give up hunting a chimera if i were you and return to the profitable peace of my own so prudent island without more adosans plus de faons if you were i monsieur said ned but being myself i run the chimera to earth in paris monsieur le comte shrugged his shoulders i will wish you success at least this chimera hath as many tracks as a mole but first you must get to paris ned had considered this side of the question lightly he found indeed the conditions of travel curiously changed since he had last crossed the netherlands border now the whole frontier from lille to metz swarmed with hostile demonstration the allies were in movement luckner and his ineffectives falling back before them amongst them all he hardly knew whom to claim for friends and whom for foes but he was wrought to a pitch of recklessness and providence shows the favouritism of a heathen goddess towards reckless men his grossly enlarging doubt of the bon fides of the mission to which he had been committed his terror of having been made in a moment accessory to a hideous crime which he could neither morally condone nor effectually denounce the feelingsombre heir to these twothat he was losing his hold of that new sweet sense of responsibility towards life the consciousness of which had been to him latterly like the talking in his ear of a witch of atlasa cicerone to the dear mysteries of the earth he had hitherto but half understoodthese emotions were a longrowelled spur to prick him forward through difficult places once in paris there should be no more temporising from the duke of orleanss own lips he would learn whether or no he had been bidden on a fools errand here in fact was the goading stab in his sidethe wound that sometimes so stung and rankled that almost he was tempted to have out madame la gouvernantes letter to her employer and resolve dishonourably his doubts through the anguish of these the piercing tooth of the recent horror sprung upon him might make itself felt only as a pain within the paina lesser torture the nature of which he would occasionally seek to analyse in order to a temporary forgetfulness of the greater then thinking of the holy maid of mricourt he would cry in his soul what is this gift of imagination but a promethean fire destroying whoever is informed with it better my system of a mechanical world with passion all eliminatedand he would think of how he had been once curiously interested in a poor lodgekeepers dreamings a faculty for which had been then to him so strange an anomaly and was it so stillto him who had learned through love to attune his ear to the under harmonics in every wind that blew upon the earth perhaps in truth it was this very gift of imagination that in greater or less degree was responsible for the irregularities one and all that misconverted the plain uses of life that made the picturesqueness of existence and its glory and tragedy and would he at this very last be without it and was not its possessiona common one now to him and nicettethe stimulus to unnatural deeds that were the outcome of supernatural thoughts he had at least the temptation to commit an act that would be an outrage on his traditional sense of honour he would resist the temptation because he had the tradition but conceive this nicette perhaps with no traditions and with an imagination infinitely more vivid than his what limit was to put to her foreseeings how should the normalsighted adjudge her monstrous for anticipating conclusions to which their vision could by no means penetrate he would catch himself away from the train of thought the indulgence of which seemed a certain condonation of a deed that his every instinct abhorred yet his mind took perhaps something the tone of the intricate close places in which it wandered and now and again a little thrill would run through him of halfsensuous pity for the poor misguided soul that by offering up its honour at the very shrine at which his worshipped had only estranged what it would have fain conciliated by way of fumaya little pretty town situate on a river holm and overhung by a group of stately rocks called the ladies of the meusened adopting the advice of the comte de lawoestine entered france at onceas if from easy gliding down a stream he had been drawn into and was rushing forward in the midst of rapidshis days became mere records of anxiety and turbulence that constantly intensified throughout every league of his approach towards paris at the very frontier indeed he had taken the plunge as exemplified in his change of postilions to the last village on the german side he had been driven by a taciturn barbariana cheesefeatured westphalian picturesque malodorous and imperturbably uncivil this certificated lout was dressed in a yellow jacket having black cuffs and cape and carried a saffron sash about his waist and a little bugle horn slung over his shoulderthe whole signifying the imperial livery of the road then as sacred from assault as is the uniform of a modern soldier of the fatherland tobacco trinkgeld and the unalienable right to keep his parts of speech locked up in the beercellar of his stomachthese appeared to be the three conditions of his service ned parted from him with a leaguelongelaborated anathema that sounded as ineffective in the delivery as the rap of a knuckle on a full hogshead and so on the farther side of the border committed himself to a first experience of the patriot postboy from the smooth and muddy into the broken water here was volubility proportionate with the others gross reticence jacques was no less picturesque and malodorous than was hans he had his private atmosphere like the german only it was eloquent of pipes and garlic rather than of pipes and beer he spat and gabbled all day and he was dressed like a stage pirate in a short brown coat with brass buttons and in striped pink and white pantaloons tucked into halfboots a sash went round his waist also and he wore on his head a scarlet cap having a cockade ned was feverishly interested in this his first introduction to a child of the new liberty but he would fain have found him inclined to a lesser verbosity however he was a cheerful rascal and a goodhumoured and his easy sangfroid helped the traveller out of an occasional tangle of the redtapeism that he found immeshing official processes rather more intricately under a republican than under an autocratic form of government neds journey to the capital was indeed a race a little perilous and full of excitement the common spirit or suggestion of suppressed effervescence that had been his former experience was revealed now a spouting tingling fountain light yet heady hissing with froth and bubbles the kennels of france ran as it were with sparkling wine and the very mayfly of moral intoxication was hatched from them in swarms thoughts words acts the habits of dress of motion of regardall were the characteristics of an hysteria the result of unaccustomed indulgencethe result of reckless drinking at the released spring one could never know if a chance expressioneither of speech or featurewould procure one a madly laughing or a madly resentful acknowledgment exultation and terror walked arminarm by the ways each trying stealthily to trip up the other it was an insane land and now verging on a paroxysm of mania for it was known that at last the kingthe man of shifty visionwas focussing his eyesight on the northeastern border of his kingdom whence loomed the shadow of foreign legions moving to his aid the northeastern border to enter the land of fury from such a direction was to invite ones own destruction not even luck recklessness and unexceptionable passports might perhaps have saved ned from the homicidal madness of a people wrought to fantastic fear had it not been for a quickwitted postboys genius in availing himself of the right occasions to apply them this was his real goodfortunethat his own innate charm of manner his patience and sweetness his characteristic unaffectedness in the matter of his rank and his healing sense of humour in everything found their response in the heart of the garrulous jacques and converted that amiable horseemmet from an indifferent employ into a very fraternal roadcompanion so through stress and danger ned sped on his journey andfollowing for fifty leagues from the frontier in the track of the wrecking stormwas enabled to enter paris by the great flanders road some four days after his parting with m le comte de lawoestine thena final difficulty at the temple barrier surmountedhe found himself once more a mean small condition of the life of that city to whose selfemancipatory throes he had once been a deeply concerned witness and he accepted the fact without uneasiness not knowing that before he should turn for the last time to quit the awful place of death and resurrection the tragedy of his own life in the midst of the thousands there enacting should be consummated chapter ix on the very day following that of his arrival the pendulum of neds particular destiny began its driving swing he had taken good lodgings in a house in the rue st honor less perhaps as a concession to his rank than to his hypothetical prospects and issuing thence after he had breakfasted he had but a hundred yards to walk to reach a certain revolutionary centre that was become the goal to his longdrawn hopes and apprehensions it was a morning in early august breathless and burning and he turned into the gardens of the palais royal that he might thus combine the opportunities to slake his thirst and to acquit himself of his commission to the royal proprietor of the adjoining palace he had seated himselfunaccountably loath now the moment was arrived to put his fears to the proofat a little caf table under a tree and was dreamily marvelling over the changed aspect of this plaisance of sedition how in three years the temper of its habitus seemed to have altered as it were from that of a beleaguered to that of a triumphant garrison when the familiar personality of one of three men who talking together strolled towards him caught his immediate attention ugly austere with his rowlandson paunch and unaffected neat clothes with his wry jaw and crippled scuffle of speechned saw here the unmistakable presentment of his whilom friend the kings painter between m david and anothera tall plebeiandressed man with a flawed supercilious face the blotched darkness of which something caricaturing that of the monarchs own belied the mechanical amiability of its featureswalked an individual of a very benignant and serene expression of countenance the nobility of which showed in agreeable contrast with the moodiness of its neighbours this manby many years the youngest of the threewas of the middle height with dark sleepy eyes and chestnut hair his face slightly marked by the smallpox was of a rather sensuous rather wistful expressionat once pitiful and determined with love the modellers fingermarks about the mouth and between the brows the little long scar cut by thought he was dressed in a very shabby and slovenly fashion with limp tattered wristbands and the seams of his coat burst at the shoulders and even the lapels of his vest were dogsearedaltogether a display of poverty a little ostentatious thought ned who nevertheless had reason byandby to correct his judgment yet for all his appearance here was the man of the three to whom the others it seemed paid deference for they hung upon his words their eyes bent to the ground while he walked between them frankly expounding and with a free aspect now suddenly m david glanced up and caught the englishmans gaze and immediately to neds surprise he had a vivid memory of their last rencontre detached himself from his fellows and came forward with extended hand surely said the painter monsieur my friend the artist of the thuilleries gardens at monsieurs service said ned rising with a complete lack of cordiality and of the rue beautreillis m david where a poor devil of a papetier had his factory gutted he drew a little away davids face showed villainously distorted that may be said he taken aback then he advanced again with an air of sudden frankness let sleeping dogs lie we do not in these days of realisation repudiate our responsibility for the acts that in those were tentative but a generous conqueror does not dwell on the humiliation of his adversaries the end justifies the means monsieur and you at least if i remember were no advocate of social tyranny but that was long ago yet not so long but that i can recall monsieur as a promising probationer in the art that is the most admirable in the world ned touched upon his unguarded side was standing at a loss for an answer when the painters two companions joined the group at the table citizen egalit said david addressing the superciliouslooking man let me have the pleasure of making known to you m murk an artist who would be a patriot were he not unfortunately for us an englishman ned started egalit he exclaimed cidevant duc dorlans said the tall man himself with a little mocking bow monseigneur began ned citizen said the other bowing again his eyes were dead stones of irony his expression was as of one hopeless of convalescence from the weary illness of life ned fetched his letter from his breast citizen egalitif so i am to call you said he i meet you in the good hour being on the road indeed to seek the citizen himself me sir you monsieuror the duke of orleans i have the honour to place in the hands of the duke a packet with the delivery of which i have been entrusted by an intimate correspondent of monsieur monsieur looking a little surprised received the missive and deliberately breaking the seal deliberately read through madame la gouvernantes letter ned must discipline his sick impatience the while and the two other men conversed apartdavid in some obvious wonder over the result of his introduction presently the duke carelessly returning the paper to its folds looked up ned strove but failed to read his sentence in the impassive face a moments silence succeeded it was a test beyond his endurance i undertook to acquaint monsieur le duc from my personal knowledge he blurted out of the causes of madames apprehensions madame said egalit is very fortunate in a courier whose discretion she informs me is only equalled by his disinterestedness madame has indeed always the faculty to find some one to pull her her chestnuts out of the fire he spoke so languidly so suggestively so insolently that ned despite his desperate anxiety fired up i fail to read into monsieurs implication said he but if it is meant to signify that madames peril is she in any then this letter merely informs me that she removes at once to london the confirmation of his dread had appeared somehow so foreshadowed in his reception that the blow fell upon ned with nothing more than a little stunning shock and that is all said he in quite a small stiff voice all that is essential indeed monsieur nothing of her terror that she is being watched and followedthat she moves within the sinister ken of the royalist emigrantsthat her nerve is shatteredthat she begs you to recall her nothing butheaven forgive her i recognise her style oh yes yes it is possible she has posted and dismissed you very effectively monsieur he went off for the first time into a real laugha harsh cachinnation that he checked as in mere disdain of it in its midcareer ned waited in rather an ugly manner of patience till he was finished then said he wishing to right himself with himself on all points has posted me as monsieur says and doubtless for all exigent purposes it was necessary only to post the letter to monsieur how then at least it would appear its delivery by a confidential messenger was not imperative ce quil parat said the duke grinning again at least such a commission exhibited an excess of caution all the bitterness of the poor young mans soul seemed suddenly to flush his veins it is thus then he cried that you requite the hospitality lavished upon you and yours that you take advantage of a generous sympathy extended to you to serve your own selfish purposes at the expense of your entertainers you deserve that no hand be put out to you but to strike you in the face as it is in my heart to treat you monsieur le duc he spoke loudly enough and all his muscles tightened to the prick of onset m david ran up tatata he exclaimed what the devil is here egalits cheeks showed mottled white like brawn be quiet he said this is m le vicomte murk who has put himself to inconvenience to deliver me a letter his lips trembled a little the wretched creature himself had a wretched nerve monsieur would seem to imply he said that i am a party to the circumstance of some discomfiture he has suffered it needs only a little reflection to disabuse himself of so extravagant a supposition ned made a violent effort to control his passion convinced now as he was that he had been used the victim of a practical joke he could not turn the situation effectively by adopting a tragic vein besides he was conscious of an inexplicable little feeling of rebellious attraction towards this mana sort of emotional deference such as that with which a despairing suitor courts the guardian of his inamorata if the light of his hope had fallen very low here was he that might if he would renew ithere was a possible friend at court that he could ill afforduntil that moment of the certain quenching of the lightto quarrel with or insult he did not put this to himself it affected him nevertheless i will acknowledge i was hasty he said in some miserable perplexity it is possible i have jumped to unjustified conclusions i have been a disinterested courier as monsieur suggests faithful to the service to which i was inducedunder false pretences it appears but i will take monsieurs word as to his innocence of any participation in the jest that has led me dancing over half a continent in search of monsieur he looked at egalit half piteously the latter scenting the reaction shrugged his shoulders with a relieved expression i am deeply sensible he said coolly of monsieurs kindness for the rest he tapped the paper in his hands the message that monsieur conveys to me is capable of only one construction that madame removes with her charge to london certainly and that is all precisely all monsieur ned fell back a pace and bowed frigidly the duke with a second shrug of his shoulders took m davids arm and made as if to withdraw suddenly he jerked himself free and returned to the hapless young man a much gentler look on his face ah monsieur he said in a low voice that is allyes that is all but i can read between the lines am i to hold myself to blame that madame took her own way to rid herself of an embarrassment i talk in the dark with only my knowledge of womenof this woman par excellenceto illuminate me she coaxed you to a confidential mission well there was no needbelieve me there was no need we must read between the lines he again made as if to go and again returned it is extremely probable nevertheless he said that we may see the dear emigrants back in paris before long with that he went off taking the painter with him ned watched the couple receding till the crowd absorbed them then sat himself down feeling benumbed and demoralised upon a chair so here was the endthe mocking means adopted to the rejection of his suit it was a vile cruel jest he thought a characteristic indulgence of selfishness inhuman for which presently he would take fierce delight in calling a certain statesman to account a statesman his stricken vanity yelled to itself a diplomatic buffoon who would sacrifice principle to a pun so he classified mr sheridan to whom he would attribute this ruin of his hopes but deeper emotions prevailed had the duke been or was he at this last despite his protestations a party to the fraud it mattered nothing at all there was a more intimate question to put to his heartthe sadder and more sombre inquiry was the girl herself a confederate and here he fell all amazed and overwhelmed plunged in a slough of the most sorrowful speculation struggling for footholdfor some memory at which he might clutch for the righting of his moral balance there should have been many memoriesof kind looks and words and touches all instinct with the tender humour of truth god in heaven it was conceivable that the elder woman the old practised strategist had played a consummate rle it was never inconsistent with the principles of such pantological professors to indulge the hypocritical as part of their universal equipment but pamela with not that of roguishness in her sweet eyes to justify a belief in anything but an innately honest soul behind them pamela in the sincerity of her heart in the womanliness of her nature in the cleanness of her lips craftily intriguing to indict loves passion of trust he could not believe it he could not but believe that some words some acts of hersmost haunting in the retrospecthad been designed to express her sympathy with that in him which she could only as yet recognise in herself for a mood and it had been then madame de genlis private policy to dismiss him before this moodthis budcould timely open out into a flower well she had succeededthanks to one selfinterested with whom the reckoning was to comeshe had succeeded and aptly no doubt to the sequel for it was not to be supposed that madames artifice would permit her to wean its subject from a fancy and fail to find the subject other food for a stimulated appetite my lord the viscount had possibly indeed but in the vernacular kept the place warm for another the sun of his passion may have only a little ripened the fruit for the delectation of lips more blest than his by this time it was probable the dream that had been his was a transferred rapture what should he dowhat should he do he sat dully his delicious sweet world of imagination shrunk to unsightly clinkers very mean and grotesque only the real world stretched about hima shoddy vulgarly formal affair a laugh a mere ironic chestnote came from him for to what glorified uses did not men seek to convert this intrinsically tawdry material they were always sensitive to the befooling holiday spirit the spirit that is persistently ready to accept specious commonplace at a fancy value for all the essential purposes of romantic passion he if he chose might take his pick he with his title his rich competence and his personal attributes from the human fair that tinkled and scintillated about him yet he must price all this opportunity at so much less worth than that of one set of features as to value it lying ready to his hand at a pinch of dust compared with the unattainable the glamour of the fair was not for him let him elect to give his philosophy licence without limit he did it will be observed madame la gouvernante who had been genuinely distraught something a little less than justice but after all his resentment in the first instance was against mr sheridan and in that no doubt he was justified for he must fail in the nature of things to understand what reason but a personal one could have moved that gentleman to manuvre to circumvent a suitor so frank and so admissible as himself he called for wine and while drinking for the first time in his life too much of it his mood underwent a dozen rallies and relapses passion exasperation and the most sick desire to possess what now seemed to have evaded him for everemotion upon emotion these wrought in his suffering mind more than once he was halfstirred to the decision to return immediately to england and instantly recalling the dukes enigmatical suggestion anent the ladies return to paris he would resolve to remain where he was preferring the problematical to the chances of hunting counter in the mazes of his own capital for he must see the girl againto that he was determined he must see her again and crashing at last through the reserve his own diffidence had created must seek to carry by storm that with which he had so mistakenly temporised and then suddenlya vision called up perhaps by the unwonted fever in his veinsthe figure of pamela as he had last seen it stood holding out to him in its hands the little crushed scarlet blossoms and he could see the wilful smile and hear the sweet voice offering him the rose of his desire and all in a moment his eyes were full of tears and he became shamefully conscious of his surroundings the very character of which profaned his thought he thrust his hand in an access of tenderness into his breast monsieur said a low grave voice in his ear is in need of sympathy he started and turned about angrily at his elbow was seated that third member of the late trio to whom the others had appeared to pay deference this man had not followed his companions it seemed but had remained behind when they walked away in the very motion of resenting the interference something in the nobility of the strangers manner gave ned pause the anger died from his features gradually in a little silence that succeeded very well monsieur he said at length quite gently you are very far from meaning impertinence i see i answer you all men need sympathy monsieur said the stranger that admission is the basis of our new religion of humanity he leaned forward smiling with a great sweetness his air somehow conveyed to ned the impression of a conscious strength that rather enjoyed indulging in itself a dormant condition of faculty sure that it could summon up at will mental forces irresistible to any opposed to it is it new said ned i seem to recall a hint of it in the gospels the man christ said the stranger was a virgin his partisanship was necessarily limited he was never blinded by but always to passion the passion of love of love in the erotic sense and what is that to signify in the present context only that it enables me to see deeper than christ the virgin you have more prospicience than christ in one direction assuredly you are confident monsieur so far i am confident christ was a divinei monsieur am a humanadvocate de causes perdues in this instance monsieur i believe but an advocate deals with proofs without doubt monsieur is unfortunate in an attachment to himself christ could have taught him that nevertheless he was amazed ah cried the other but i am literally an advocate and i heard monsieur le ducs final words and it is my business to read the souls confession in the face i perceive however that monsieur resents my presumption which is of a truth unwarrantable he rose as if to go his dark eyes still quick with a gentle unrebukeful sympathy ned was impelled to cry hastily it is my right at least monsieur to ask the title of my counsel i have none said the stranger simply my name is vergniaud ned sprang to his feet upsetting his chair vergniaud he cried and stood staring at the man whose utterancesechoed latterly to the very cliffs of englandhad seemed to him the first inspired interpretation of the revolution as a real breathing human emancipatory force now he understood why the others had shown such deference to this one of their party vergniaud he cried again faintly and so rallied himself truly said he i have entertained an angel unawares m vergniaudindeed i have a very unhappy attachment and i need counsel at this moment if ever man did chapter x pierrevictorin vergniaud the source of much present enthusiasm the full fountainhead of the gironde river of eloquence was alreadythough but a few months a citizen of paristhe director of a popular force having an admirable tendency in him it seemed possible to hail that political architect of the new era who should have the genius to reconcile warring creeds and shape of mens profound but formless aspirations an enduring temple of the ideal commonwealth poor yet never conceding a thought to the shame of poverty simpleminded to the extent that he could not err in justice hating corruption and loving truth a moving orator a large humanitarian he might have led a world undissenting to the worship of the right liberty had not his great gifts his large ideals been always subject to eclipse by an extreme constitutional indolence utterly ingenuous utterly impressionable depending upon the moment for inspiration and so little warped by selfconsciousness as never to know the moment to fail himit was yet often impossible to spur this vergniaud to necessary action madame roland the superior being to whom he was introduced by enthusiastic friends had no belief in his capacity as a leader distrusted and perhaps despised him nedthe poor degenerate to a very human typelearned on the other hand to love and admire him for in this mindas in the mirror of sweet clear waterhe found his own chastened theories shaping themselves taking such form and gentle significance as he had never hitherto but more than conceived to be theirs nor this only or chiefly he was able to forget something of his own hard unhappiness of his bitter sense of grievance in the familiar contemplation of a nature so serene so noble so unsolicitous of its selfaggrandisement from these closing days of darkness the little friendship that so queerly came to him to tide him opportunely over a period of wretched indecision remained an abiding pathetic memory citizen vergniaud lived in a shabby lodging near the tivoli gardens thither ned accompanied him on the morning of their meeting and thither many times he found his way again the little beggarly room became a haven of rest to his tormented spirita confessionalbox wherein he could always leave some part of his great weight of oppression and now and again even moved to waive his personal interest in that fine spirit and to repay some part of the healing advice so disinterestedly lavished upon himself he would play the pre spirituel in his turn and whip his penitent with a cobweb lash of rebuke my peter he would complain you dwell too long on the overture to your career it may be rich in all the suggested harmonies but it is time you set to work on the opera time would cry vergniaud with a smile he might be perhaps unpacking a very little parcel of cheap linen that had just reached him from his family his dear simpletons of bordeaux but time is no arbitrary measure to the man who hath studied to make his own says ned you may make it but you will always give it away to the first specious beggar that asks then i am only liberal with that that i do not value tis a poor habit of charity i admit but i could never keep it hark little edwardi could never keep time even when i danced so foolish heirs mortgage their reversions so alchemists squander their inexhaustible treasures you mean when time has done with me i shall be past caring maybe the spendthrift will have gilded a poor home or two in his world and had he economised he might have gilded the temples of an epoch oh thou art an elegant moraliser but i am more modest for myselfa fabian by sentiment not policy i tell thee an age so rich in opportunities invites to procrastination a multiplicity of choice is the last inducement to choose i loiter like a child in the fair with my silver livretournois in my pocket and until i spend it i am lord of a hundred prospective delights let me wait till the lights are burning low and then i will make my selectionthe crown to a pyramid of enjoyments and find that others before you have taken the pick of the fair while you ecstatically considered and that you have at the last paid full price for a discarded residue what then my friend i shall be richer than the prudent by measure of a whole feast of anticipationmore satisfied if less gorged the early bird eats his chicken in the egg corne de dieu there is a fine marriage of proverbs he has nothing to look forward to but a day of blank satiety i cannot at once have the dreams of youth and the sober retrospections of age so he would talk ex curia a dilatory lovable vagabond with a rare power of enchantment drawn from some hidden depths as from a ferncurtained well perhaps this sensuous personal charmwhereby he would appear to flatter with signal affectionate regard each in turn of his numerous acquaintanceswould of itself have failed after the first to win a poor lovestricken from prolonged contemplation of any but his own interests it was the mans spasmodic revelations of unexpected virile forces held in reserve that would suddenly convert in another a little growing sentiment of tolerant disdain to an eager desire to be acclaimed friend by this subject of his condescension so may be the force operated upon ned for succeeding his first gratification over an introduction to one in whom he had latterly prefigured the regenerator of france came a thought of dsagrment in his souls nominee a feeling of disillusionment in which he was prepared to recognise another example of fortunes wanton baiting of his personal cherished ideals then one day he heard this seeming waiter on providence this almost coatless landholder of utopia speak in the assembly and thenceforth he had nothing but reverence for the ardent soul whose misfortune only it was to be bounded by a love more human in its essence than divine he had seen the familiar figure sitting with its hand over its face he had next seen the face revealed from the tribune inspired transformed as if the hand itself consecrate as a priests had touched and wrought the priestly sacrament of confirmation and the sermon of high government that followed had taken wings of fire from the burning spirit that informed it and the hearts of men had kindled and glowed flaring at lengthalas too selfconsuminglyinto roaring flame well such moments were for neds holiday moods this present friendship and admiration saved him perhaps from hobnobbing with more harmfully potent spirits yet the one enthusiasm could galvanise him only fitfully into an interest in the passionate scenes amongst which he moved so negative a pole is lovewhen turned from the northstar of its hopesto all that in less misconverted circumstances would attract it here was he a spectator at last of the stupendous drama in the early rehearsals of which he had been so profoundly interested and he had nothing for it all but a lacklustre eye which he must always keep from turning inwards by an effort he lived in fact in a little miserable tub of his own choosing while the alexanders of a political renaissance made history around and unregarded of him much time he spent moodily gazing from the windows of his lodgings in the rue st honor thence looking his life seemed to become a dream of motley crowds always drifting by stolid tightbuttoned guards with brigand moustaches like dolls frowzy revolutionary conscripts swaggering to glory tattered deputations exhibiting the seals of their memorials in the shape of old bloodstains dried upon arms and faces and headed perhaps by some trimly arrogant sectional president with his sleek hair and tricolour sashvociferous or intent in noisome clouds they floated by and ned could seldom rescue so much curiosity from the heart of his selfcentred indifference as to inquire what was their destination or significance a shoddy parisa paris of gaudy fustian so far a certain general impression seemed bitten into him and desultorily moved by it he would rarely wake to a little rhapsodical song of lamentation over yet another shattered ideal this city and this people that he had loved and of which and whom he had expected and prophesied so noble a triumph of selfemancipation now the tangled mazes of party differences seemed designed only to render the central cause unattainable now he would think the history of their municipal government was always to be likened to the story of an iceberga story of topheaviness periodically recurringof base and summit exchanging positions again and again the depths replacing the head the head the depths and did it signify as in the iceberg a steady attenuation a bulk of force and grandeur constantly lessening god save france and exorcise the sluggard demon in pierrevictorin byandby sick at last of inaction the poor fellow took to the streets restlessly traversing all quarters of the cityits byelanes its loaded thoroughfaresboth by day and lamplight once he made his way to the now ancient ruins of the bastille and dully leaving them after a dull inspectionor rather retrospectionlooked half curiously up at his old lodgings yet had not the spirit to visit them and madame gamelle once a languid thrill penetrated his torpor upon his chancing upon view of an old acquaintance the chevalier deon so queerly associated with a certain episode in his vanished life he passed the strange creature in the thuilleries gardens whither he had come years ago to see a balloon ascend she stared him full in the face but without recognition as she went by her eyes bagged in their sockets she looked old and shabbyan improvident actress retired upon scant savings already her gaze had grown unspeculative the first menace of senility suggested itself in the drooping of her fat old jaw she had come over from england ned learned a year ago to petition the national assemblyin the days before its dissolutionfor leave to resume her helmet and her sabre and to serve in the army her request had received the double honour of applause and of relegation to the official minuteswhere it slept forgotten the poor chevalier must consign herself gracefully to oblivionwhich no actor or actress ever did she lived on at paris a few months longera decaying old body with a grievance then returned for the last time to england where dying byandby in poverty and being handed over to the final merciless inquisition of the mortuary she was adjudgeda male impostor and so committed to a dishonoured grave upon egalit but recently so designated ned happened from time to time yet only to understand that this wouldbe popular constituent was resolved upon cutting him a titled aristocrat from popular motives therefore despite the gnawing of the fox of anxiety at his ribs the young englishman in his pride would make no appeal to the man who alone could ease his torment but he endeavoured to ascertain through indirect report what were the chances of an early return to paris on the part of certain notable emigrants and in the meantime he must settle himself down with what remnants of philosophy he could command to a life of miserable inaction and irresolution then once upon a day behold into his field of vision the spectrum of a ghost more remotely haunting than any familiar to his recenter experience flashed throigne our lady of darkness the realised presentment of a destiny long foreshadowed and henceforth it was as if he had been hurled into one of those red arteries of fatality of which the justerected guillotine was as the throbbing heart that laced the city in all directions he was strolling with vergniaud again in the thuilleries gardens it was a day of lazy sunshine and the walks and grassplots were crowded paris must laugh and breathe though in the committee rooms yonder the whirring machinery of election to the new national convention was shaking the whole town though fortyseven out of the fortyeight sections with their tagrag and bobtail were howling for the kings abdication through all the courts of the city though the shadow of the brunswicker and his emigrants was already projecting itself like a devils searchlight from a contracting horizon though hate and terror and fanaticism were crouching in every corner with smouldering linstocks in their hands the babble was not less or less animated for this children sailed their boats on the ponds or played ball about the grass it was a scene of light and goodhumour against the terrace of the feuillans to the north of the gardens the strollers came upon the first sign of a serpent in this edena long broad tricolour ribbon stretched from tree to tree and bearing the inscription tyran notre colre tient un ruban ta couronne tient un fil it shall be excused or blamed for its wit said vergniaud and as he spoke there came uproar from a distance where some victim to mobresentment was being trailed through a horsepond a cloud shut out the sun the two men fallen suddenly moody made their way to a gate that led from the gardens into the rue du dauphin that was a tributary of the rue st honor vergniaud glanced up at the name of the former tient un fil he murmured and shook his head with a sigh on the moment of their emerging into the greater thoroughfare a discordant rabble came upon thema mouthing sweltering throng of patriots with a woman at their head banging a drum voil la prtresse habitue throigne de mricourt said vergniaud with a soft chuckle ned gasped and stared he had not alighted on this womanhad recalled her only fitfullysince the night when she fled from his uncles house even madame de lawoestines reference to her had affected him but indifferently if during his present sojourn in paris he absorbed in more introspective searchings had heard casual mention of the lige courtesan the coryphe of the orleanists the beloved according to the wits of les actes des aptres of the deputy populus who did not so much as know her a least desire to identify this reputation with the one of his experience had not overtaken him throignewere it indeed the throigne of his knowledgehad only followed the course he might have predicted for her to drain the rich for the benefit of the needythat were a noble form of solicitation to feed starving patriots and their cause with the fruits of her dishonour was a rendering of the theme that scarcely commended itself to other than parisian morals yet he had lost sight no doubt of the motive that induced her to wage war by whatever means upon the order patrician it was to be recalled to his memory for now suddenly he was face to face with the embodiment of a passion to whose early processes he had unwittingly contributed the girl saw halted her vociferous troupe and the next instant came towards him a fantastic figure a thing of shreds and gaudy tatters detached itself from the throng and followed at her heels corne de dieu muttered vergniaud the dog too throigne stopped in front of the englishmana presentment in flesh and clothing of vivid barbaric licence her eyes sparkled her cheeks glowed for four years the defier of god she had walked with her face to the sun she was and was to be mater tenebrarumthe mother of lunacies the suggestress of suicidesa flaming evolution from the scorned and abandoned village beauty she had on a little military jacket of darkblue over a white chemisette cut low to her swelling figure a tricolour sash in which was stuck a pistol went round her waist and from this fell to her ankles a short skirt of scarlet cocked daintily on her head was an elfin hat with feathers la henri iv and suspended from her shoulder by a red ribbon a little smart drum bobbed and tinkled at her side as she walked she clinched a hand upon her bosom scorning and daring in the fierce exultation of her beauty this possible critic of it we are well met she said dost thou know me citizen englishman i know you throigne thou liest thou thou takest me i can see it for some past poor victim of thy use and abuse or if not of thine of anothers i never was in mricourtdost thou hearunless it is a province of hell i never appealed to the honour of a class that knows no honour but in name vergniaud in some serene astonishment came forward citizeness he said you surely amaze my friend who is a child of the land of freedom she laughed in one breath do i amaze him i thought his looks claimed knowledge of me then she turned upon ned once more her furious disdain giving to the woman in her i heard thou wert in paris monsieur le vicomte believe me it is an evil place at this present for such as thou and from whom did you hear it mademoiselle lambertine of mricourt said ned with perfect coolness her eyes flashed her lips set at him ah she cried rage overmastering the scorn in her voice but it is pitiful is it not for one so particular in his reputation to be jilted by the bastard of orleans hearing her laugh the grotesque creature who stood still at her elbow began to chuckle and caper but yes he babbled in a wryed indistinct voice pamelayes yesthe bastard of orleans ned gone pale as a sheet took a fierce step forwards and at that the woman sprang and intercepted him putting her hand on her vile henchmans shoulder thou shalt not touch him she cried her fingers caught at the pistolstock in her belt menacing oaths came from the ragged group that awaited her return tell him lucien she said to the wretched creature who it is we are ever seeking through the streets of paris my brother basile answered the man his face was a fearful sightmelted featureless it seemed and with tangs of rusty hair dropping stiff from it in the unscarred patches for the rest he was nothing but a foulclad crippleidiotic distorted she turned upon ned again dost thou know me now she cried or am i still to thee the simple fool that could be wronged and insulted with impunity she bent forward and dropped her voice so that every word came from it distinct listen to me all these years i have sought and found him not now at last word comes to me that he is here in paris that he is identical with one that insults through the faction she represents the woman he has outraged beyond endurance she paused and drew herself up then raised her hand in a threatening attitude my star brightens first one and again one out of the past they are drawndrawn like night birds into a charcoalburners fire and they shall fall before me and my foot trample their necks she turned and struck her dog roughly on the shoulder is thy tooth sharp lucien are thy claws like a devils rake to rend and to scorch courage my friend the moment arrivesfor you and for me lucien the moment arrives she had fetched drumsticks from her sash and now brought them down with a little snapping roll and break forward she cried and she looked back significantly over her shoulder the crown of martyrdom to the devotee that would rather wed than make a bastard again the sticks alighted with a crash and roll cest nous quon ose mditer de rendre lantique esclavage she sang out shrilly and all the throaty mob took up the chorus aux armes citoyens so reeling and howling and drifting backwards a black smoke of menace towards the stranger whose name for any or no particular reason seemed to be written in the dark book of its cafchantant hippolyt the procession passed on its way the stragglers who had been drawn by curiosity to the neighbourhood of the interview dispersed and the two men were left alone vergniaud with a shrug of his shoulders looked at ned who seemed to be muttering to himself a very prcieuseridicule murmured the frenchman i would not have you take the little pretty rogue seriously ned seized him by the wrist did you hear her he exclaimed in a concentrated agony of voice vergniaud nodded his head about monsieur le ducs protge he answered uneasily how did she know of herof me mon ami cannot you tell was the compassionate evasive reply yes cried ned violently i can tell he lied about the letter the woman told him in it why she had wished to get rid of me and he lied about it come said vergniaud if it is so the lie acquitted him at least of a cruel discourtesy towards you ned laughed like a devil acquitted him he shrieked and while he reserved the jest to retail it to his brazen drab here oh i know that no road is too common for monsieur le duc dorlans and myand this that i have hugged to my soul and cherished as almost too sacred for my own thoughts to prey upon to be used to the foul purposes of a harlot and her lecher oh my godi will kill him vergniaud essayed a manner of soothing the shrine of love can only be desecrated from within these may storm at the closed windows of thy soul and the draught but make the sacred lamp of thy heart burn brighter hold up thy head my dear friend i have never lowered it muttered ned but he seemed hardly to hear what the other said tis a specious theatrical jade went on vergniaud and always alert for situations witness her babbling reunions in the rue de rohan where enough gas is brewed in a night to float ten balloons witness her habit of attire her drum her dogthe misbegotten maniac that she rescued months ago from the salptrire and hath devoted to some mission of devilry that is the crowning infirmity of his brain bah it is all affectation i believe she will certainly pose byandby before the judgmentseat chapter xi in the early morning of the th of august a young man wearing the uniform of the national guards was arrested in the champs elyses by a patrol of the very corps to which he presumably belonged this young manof a bright confident complexion crisp gold hair and a rather girlish turn of featuretook his mishap with an admirable sangfroid very well my friends he said and i am arrested on suspicionof what of being an accursed royalist in disguise answered the corporal gruffly the stranger nodded to the soldier when the good cause triumphs said he it shall be remembered to your credit that you could recognise a gentleman through the trappings of a brigand ahh sil ne tient qu a replied the corporal briefly with a sniff before this sun sets there will be perhaps some hundreds of you gentry the fewer my faith said the other and what a shortsighted policy to post a cloud of educated witnesses to the skies to testify in advance to your moral inefficiency they took him to the cour des feuillansa yard neighbouring on that very spot where ned a day or two earlier had had his contretemps with throigne and her satellites here thrust into an outbuilding that had been temporarily converted into a guardroom he alighted upon many acquaintances in a like predicament does it all read failure he whispered to a colossal creature beside him thisalso presumably a grenadier of the nationwas in fact the abb bougon an ecclesiastic of the court who wrote plays yet had never conceived a situation onehalf so dramatic as this in which he now found himself hush murmured the giant yes the worst is to be feared byandby the prisoners were summoned in order to examination in an adjoining room long however before it came to the cool young strangers turn a sound of growing uproar without the building had swelled to a thunder harsh and violent enough to ominously interfere one might have thought with the procsverbal within the deep diapason of massed voices the crisp clash of pikes the flying of furious ejaculationsstartling accents to the whole context of menaceassured him that here was evidence of such a counterbuff to palace intrigue as palace fatuity had never conceived might threaten it suddenly in the midst of the tumult he thought he heard his own name cried suleau and again sclrat imposteur he got upon a bench by a window that commanded a view of the court this he sawa wide enclosed spacewas full of bluecoated soldiers a posse of them made a present show of keeping the gates of the yard but the gates themselves significant to the true character of their defence they had neglected to close beyond in the road and extending at least so far over the thuilleries gardens as his view could compass a packed congregation of patriotsquite typical savagesrested for a moment on its weapons it listened it appeared to a commissary of the section who mounted on a tub by the gates counselled methods judicial a little space had been left about the orator and now into this in an instant broke a womana wild vivandire she seemed of the new religious service of blood and wineof the transubstantiation of liberty without a moments hesitation she caught the commissary by a leg and hurling him to the ground usurped his place an exultant roar of applause shook the air the poor deposed tribune rubbing his bones rose and bolted for shelter suleau chuckled now he did not know throigne but he had laughed consumedly at her and her pseudoclassical pretensions in more than one royalist print he laughed at many things did this suleaunot sparing the gloomdistilling jacobins nor in particular citizen philip egalit and his faction of whom was citizeness lambertine and he was so breezily headstrong so romantically sworn to a picturesque cause that he would not calculate the cost of pitting his wit against the vanity of a coryphe whose nod in this height of her popularity often confirmed a wavering sentence whose smile rarely franked an acquittal besides womeneven the most foolish of themlike to be taken seriously this woman it would seem spoke vigorously and entirely to the humour of her auditors only there appeared to prevail something rankly personal against himself of all the twentytwo arrested in her diatribe he caught the sound of his own name uttered again and again to an accompaniment of oaths and execrations this at least flattered him with the assurance that he had done something to earn the transcendent animosity of the manyheaded i present myself with an order of merit he murmured gratified and immediately he was summoned to his examination he was conducted between guards to the room of inquisition in it he recognised many of his preindicted comrades in misfortunetwentyone in allhuddled into a corner by a window the room was otherwise crammed with soldiers commissaries and a few of the breechless a thin man in a state of palpable nervous excitement sat behind a table this was the sieur bonjour first clerk of the marines and president of the section of the feuillans he opened upon the prisoner at once it is useless to deny that you are suleau the royalist pamphleteer indeed replied the captive with equal promptitude i would not so stultify monsieurs fine perspicacity in discovering what i have never concealed yet you disguise yourself in the garb of liberty no more than monsieur surely the president struck his hand on the table it is not for me to bandy words with you you were arrested when patrolling the champs elyses at an hour when all respectable men are in bed if said suleau at an hour when all respectable men are in bed where was monsieur enough cried bonjour angrily you are accused of conspiring with these to resist the will of the peopleby innuendo by direct insult to the peoples representativesfinally by banding yourself with others to inquire secretly into that you might successfully outmanuvre the processes of the movement having forfeiture for its object i congratulate monsieur said suleau irrelevantly upon his admirable manuvring for election to the ministership of marines the president scrambled to his feet with an oath the room broke into ferment i beg to inform monsieur cried the prisoner raising his voice that i am in possession of a municipal pass to the chateau of the thuilleries yes yesand we cried the huddle of captives by the window with the very echo of their words there came tumult in the vestibule a trample of feet and the head of a frowzy deputation burst into the room the young royalist turned about and folding his arms quietly faced the inrush a woman was to its frontshe he had seen mount the rough tribune in the yard to denounce him he saw her now marking him down with a triumphant fury in her eyesa strange beautiful creaturehis own enigmatical nemesis it seemed citizen president she cried in a full bold voice while st antoine awaits your decision st antoine is paralysed its cannon yawn in the faubourg its pikes stab only at the air to clear the ground of these outpostsbah here needs not the interminable civil processes mouchards all arrested armed in a state of belligerency they shall be subject to martial law in the name of the national fraternity that today shall be confirmed and cemented i demand that these prisoners be handed over to the people a murmur succeeded her outcry the president white to the ears stilled it with uplifted hand he looked a moment at the young royalist a bitter stiff smile on his lips it is just he cried in a sudden thin voice this is no time to dally as the demoiselle throigne informs us conduct all the prisoners into the yard the order had not passed his lips when there came a splintering crash and in an instant the whole room was in roaring racket and confusion some half of the prisoners forereading their certain doom had made a desperate plunge for escape through the rearward window by which they stood they got clear away their less prompt or fortunate companions were in the same moment surrounded and isolated each from each suleau lifted his voice above the din commit me my friends to the sacrifice perhaps my blood which it seems they most desire will appease their fury he struggled to throw himself towards the door his motive misunderstood a halfdozen sansculottes flung themselves upon and pinioned him in their arms at the same instant throigne leapt like a cat and seized him by his collar at last she hissed in his ear dost thou know me thou art throigne he panted he had caught the presidents words he understood now something of the reason of this womans violence ah she cried in a hurried fury of speech and has not my time come thou dog with a false name thou nameless cur so to slander and revile the woman thou drovest to ruin they were slowly edging him towards the door he could only shake his head at her why dost thou not speak she urged why dost thou not implore my mercy i could save thee if i would he still did not answer ah she sighed with a cruel feint of tenderness for the sake of the old days basile ask me by the memory of our embraces of thy child that i bore in my womb to pity and protect thee you are mad he cried i have never seen you in my life she struck him across the mouth the blow the sight of the little blood that sprang from the wound were a double provocation to the beasts of prey they bore him with a rush to the outer door through it into the yard beyond torn bleeding fighting every foot of his way but never protesting he would sell his life dearly to these mongrels the yelling crowd surged and rocked before him suddenlywith that exaltation of the perceptions that often seems to signify the first flightessay of the soulhe saw far back in the thick of the press of inhuman faces one face that he recognised as that of a man who years before on the morning of the reveillon riots had spoken to him mistaking him for another now from the expression of this one face he educed a desperate hope he gathered it from the anguish of its features from the conviction that its owner was frantically endeavouring to thrust and beat a passage towards him through the throng god he thought if he could only reach the face he would somehow be saved with a furious effort he tore himself free and snatched at and wrenched a sabre from a hand that threatened him here he shrieked to the face to meet me monsieurto meet me he had actually cut his way a halfdozen yards before a handthe womansseized him from the back and dragged him to the ground with a groan he fell trampled into a forest of tattered legs cry to me for mercy screamed the harlot no he answered faintly she yelled then beating a space about her with her hands lucien it is the moment that has come snarling and dribbling a hideous thing broke through the press and flung itself upon the fallen man torn and breathless ned shouldered his way at last into the little bloody arena a womanher foot upon the neck of something some bespattered creature that whimpered and prayed to herlooked stupidly down upon the dead and mangled body of the man she had destroyed accursed oh thou accursed panted the newcomer in terrible emotion it is not he st denys that thou hast murdered chapter xii from the day of the massacre in the cour des feuillans whena casual and involuntary witness of the opening deed of bloodhe had made a desperate attempt to save the life of the man who as he supposed was being sacrificed to a misconception ned had no thought but that he was fallen a second time and inextricably under the deadly spell of the city that was at once his horror and his attraction that he had not paid the penalty with his own life of so quixotic an interposition rather confirmed him in the sense of fatality that had overtaken him he could afterwards only recall vaguely the expression of terror with which throigne had accepted his furious impeachment of her barbarity the resentful rage of the mob over his denunciation of its idol his imminent peril and the immunity from personal harm suddenly and unexpectedly secured him at the hands of the very loathed object of his execration he had given her no thanks for her advocacy it had condemned him merely to prolonged struggle with an existence that had grown hateful to him defrauded of his love disenchanted with life his residue of the latter was not he felt worth the devils purchase and yet this sentiment carried with it a certain wild passion of personal irresponsibility that was not without its charm into the being of the people that had waived for the present it seemed all thought of consistent conduct he was absorbed without effort of his ownabsorbed so helplessly that even the wounding stab of a certain question once engrossingly poignant to himself dulled of its pain and could be borne it was as difficult to think collectedly indeed in the paris of those days as it is while rushing through a strong wind now in the thick of the events that followed fast and irresistible upon the heels of an overture to what was in truth a disguised anarchy he could not but feel himself something renewing that state of mind curious and fiercely pitiful that had been induced in him years before by his contemplation of the first scenes of a tragedy that was now labouring in its penultimate act and here the emotion of the moment seemed always significant of the trend of the plot untilpuff the dramatic weathercock would go round and the wind of applause blow from another quarter freezing or wet according to a rule that was just the regular absence of any but the food of excited conjecture never failed to save his heart from feeding upon its own tissues and was the sustenance to his starving hopes indeed at this last it seldom occurred to him a temporary sojourner in the city of doom that he was other than an unalienable minute condition of the citys life and he would no more than his friend pierrevictorin desire to repudiate his liabilities thereto the th of august had passed like a deathclouda ragged bastion fringed with firesweeping the streets with a storm of blood the king dethroned was a prisoner in the temple the mob occupied itself in the violent erasing of all symbols of royalty vergniaud and the gironde were in perilous protesting power the prisons were glutting the guillotine had begun to rise and fall like a forcepump draining the human marshes of throigne the militant priestess of st antoine ned heard only vaguely rumoured thatsated perhaps with her share in the events of the thuilleries massacreshe was inclining to the moderate policy of brissot and his following and was temporarily at least withdrawn from the influence of her earlier colleagues that she was moved to this course by any selfloathing for the deed of which he had been witness he detesting her would not believe but he had no wish to entertain one further thought of her in his mind so the month sped byits every succeeding hour fresh fuel to the popular wrath and terror over the rumoured advance of the allies upon the cityand on the last day of it a strange little rencontre took place between two of the minor actors in a very extraneous branch of the general tragedy ned aimlessly strolling through the faubourg of st marcel in the southeast quarter of the city had turned on the evening of this day into the boulevard that ran straight northward by the ancient city wall from the place mouffetard to the seine his way took him past the horsemarket andinevitably therefore to the contextpast an adjacent house of correction for blacklegs this ironically named hospitalan ironcased lazaretto in truth the prison of the salptrirewas situate upon a dismal wedge of waste land between the new and old enceintes of the city it was a brutal gloomy pile its walls exuding one might have thought the ichor of a thousand diseases moral and physical sooty unlovely as a factoryas indeed it was of the devils waresits noisome towers blotted on the sky decharmed the soft reflected burning of the sunset and made a vulgarity of their whole leafy neighbourhood from its grated windows high up in the foul air of its own exhaling behind which the gallowstree birds built their nests caws and screams issuing were evidences of a very swarming rookery here and there the white hairdraggled face of a strumpet stared from behind bars here and there an inward lightlike a wandering fen candlecould be seen travelling from story to story ned as he approached the building quickened in his walk for he was aware of a batch of fresh prisoners under escort being driven across the boulevard towards the central gate and with the instinct to spare misfortune the impertinence of unofficial inquest he would hurry to put himself beyond suspicion of prying in this good motive however he was baulked for a subsequent partya solitary culprit walking between guardsissued from the same direction and cut across and encountered him just as he approached the entrance he started and strangled an immediate inclination to exclaim aloud for in the lonely malefactor going by him with bent head and lowering preoccupied face he recognisedhe was sure of itbasile de st denys degraded vitiateda shameful ravaged personality as unlike in his existing condition the bright soul who had served unconsciously to them both for his scapegoathere was without question the unlicensed oncelord of mricourt and the woman his victim had erred only it seemed as to the direction of his presence in the cityhad erred perhaps because she could not realise that consistent to his nature he must be sought after all these years along the lower levels of existence the felons and their escort disappeared ned dwelling where he had paused came to himself presently with a shock as if out of a dream on an immediate impulse he turned into the prison yard and mounted a shallow flight of steps leading up to a great studded door that was pierced by an open wicket looking through this he saw the figure he sought receding down a dim long vestibule and at the moment he was faced by a turnkey what do you here exclaimed the man harshly that jules is a fine porter i thought i saw one i knew pass in it is like enough they have many of them a large acquaintanceand he offered to slam the wicket in the intruders face ned jingled and produced his tip that is another question said the man now said ned is the name of that last prisoner that entered basile de st denys i know nothing of the de what sort of citizen art thou but otherwiseyes and what is he accused of a common enough matter forging assignats chapter xiii citoyenne throigne had not it is to be supposed the wit of a mohl or the tact of a recamier but her sensuous and longpractised beauty so vindicated her sins of omission in these respects as to procure her reunions a social distinction than which none more catholic was accorded the salons of a later period at her rooms in the rue de rohan she held and had long held weekly sunday sances of a quasipolitical character at which revolutionary propagandists of such opposed principles as mirabeau brissot ption were in turn or out of it to be met thither sometimes came philip of orleans with his sick affable smile thither desmoulins galvanic and stuttering the attorneygeneral to the lantern thither the poet joseph chnier thither the younger sieyes eager to sniff the incense exhaled to his less accessible brother to whose exalted virtues throigne by some queer freak of contrariety consistently and reverently testified to what earlier condescensions on her part were due her present political intimacies it need not here be questioned one form of sympathetic largesse is part of the necessary equipment of women of a naturally assimilative character she had adaptability for four years her face and figure had brought her a succession of ardent ministers to it thus nourished on the unconsidered mental pabulum of manifold intellects she was become an omniparous vessel brazen and beautifulemitting such a medley of discordant sounds as had once the window bells to ned in the landlust of her native village yet through all whatever her inconsequent show of principles detestation of a social system to the abuse of which she attributed her early downfall abided within her unwaveringly and induced her to those deeds of violence that in the end alienated from her all those of her once familiars to whom reason figured as something higher than the goddess of licence but still she had a store of reflected light with which to illuminate her sunday reunions citoyenne said an acrid young patriot whose eyes were just cut apart by the mere blade of a nose and who wore a little silver guillotine for a seal whither wilt thou fly when the brunswicker enters to make good his manifesto at his throat pollio the company clapped its hands to hang round his neck ay like a millstone but indeed said the young man affecting to show trouble thou wilt surely be included amongst the proscribed there will be none cried the girl the capitol is saved the geese have begun to cackle pollio amidst the laughter shook his head in pretended distress it is all very well yet not paris but the world were lost to see our judith under a wall the mark to a platoon of dirty jgers throigne came to her feet her cheeks were flushed her thick brown curls were slumbrous shadows upon the pale slopes of her shoulders she was dressed quite simply in the suggestiveness something misread of virgin white but she was not at her ease radiant glowing voluptuous she always looked this woman as if she were but just risen from a warm bed there had yet been all the evening an unwonted rigidity in her manner a distraught expression in her face such as that with which one vouchsafes to another the shadow of an attention whose substance is given elsewhere she would break into feverish fits of merriment she would start and seem to listen as if to some tiny voice making itself heard within the compass of many voices it may have passed unregarded this spasmodic manner of distraction it may have been observed and accepted as a new accent to charms so manyhumoured the times took little note little surprise of unaccustomed tricks of speech or feature it was because men and women had so lost sight of what were their true selves that moods passed for convictions now she stood like a pythoness the light from above falling upon her head rounding and sleepily caressing all the fair curves of her figure of the smooth naked arm she raised as in inspiration it is not the brunswicker i fear she cried it is the enemy from withinfrom within she dropped her hand to her heart as if that were her secret foe citoyenne whispered a voice in her ear there is one waiting in the foyer that is peremptory to see thee she stared a moment with a lost expression then looked aside half in anger to see her country grisel regarding her appealingly what one little foollittle bona indeed i do not know he implored me by the love of god throigne laughed uneasily rather by the love that is gratuitous thou little grandbta hush go before and i will follow some one drew aside the portire she passed out with a smile that fled from her face as she descended the stairs under the dim oillamp in the hall a cloaked figure was standing as she came upon it she saw it was the english lord the warmth and fragrance of a remoter atmosphere that she brought with her shivered into frost on the instant that was inevitable yet she would always have foregone many plenary indulgences to draw this man into sin on her account he took a quick step forward made as if to seize her by the armbut checked the impulse you must come with me he whispered she exclaimed incredulous come with you then quickly bent forward and looked intensely into his face why does your voice break is it some trouble of your own and you seek meme out of all the world it is not of my own whose then yours mon dieu she cried with a little sharp laugh of mockery i know of noneof no trouble or pleasurethat is our mutual concern he clapped his hand roughly at that on her naked shoulder his fingers clawed angry marks in the flesh ah she cried you hurt me hurt he echoed do you know what they are doing tonight in this devils city of yours he caught only a faint protesting murmur from her lips god wither you if you do he said hoarsely they are murdering the prisoners do you hearin all the prisons they are murdering the prisoners and basile de st denys is one of them she sprang back from him her face was like a face seen in moonlightwhite round a black glare of eyes you lie she cried he at least is dead already he came at her againseized her in a very fiends grip is it a time to equivocate you know as i how your wicked hand miscarried on that day the man is in prison i myself saw him borne thither three days ago you must come and quickly to be of use there is no question but that she shook herself free standing back so that her face seemed to twitch and palpitate in the gusty sway of the lamplight you are imperious she muttered it must not be he cried violently this horrible thing you can save him if you will and can you so master your loathing of me as to ask it she said i sweardeny yourself this gratification of a lust so inhuman and i will think better of you than ever before that will be compensation for all i have suffered she said her voice seemed too toneless too passionless even for irony she stood without a movement before him the marks of his clutch slowly fading from her shoulder throigne he cried you have the chance to a little atone you will not so clinch your damnation in the name of god throigne this man was the father of your child true she said of my dead child i will come monsieur he gave a gasp of terrible relief hurry he said or it will be too late she had already seized a cloak from a recess in a moment they were speeding on their way together he talked to her as they hurried onhalf unconsciously almost hysterically he told of his chance encounter of basiles degradation of anything or nothing it was such emotional gabble as even reserved men vent during the first moments of respite from intolerable anguish his voice echoed back from the silent houses he did not even notice that the girl returned him never an answer so assured was he now of her sympathy the streets were curiously still and deserted the familiar life of them all shrunk and cowering behind a thousand lightless blinds now and again phantom cries seemed wafted to them from remote quarters now and again a glimmer of torches would flash from far perspectives and travel a moment on the blackness and vanish it was a weary way by which they must go the man led his companion through the place du carousel down to the river along the endless line of quays by the wash of nightbound waters over the isle stlouis and the street of the two bridges again along the gloomy quay of stbernard and so into the dark leafy boulevard that ran southwards to the thieves prison and here for the first time a spectral suggestion an attenuated wind of sounds began to take shape and body and here suddenly the girl gave a quick gasp and jerked to a stop the salptrire she muttered clutching her cloak to her throat the salptrire throigne she seemed to turn her head and look at him then on again she went and he followed the noise increased to their every onward step ambiguous sounds resolved themselves into sounds unnamable dim light seen phantomly ahead flared out in a moment across their path as if some hellish furnace were refuelling and then in an instantas it were stokers labouring at the mouth of flamea scurry of fantastic shapes grotesquely busy about the entrance to a lighted yard grew into their vision ned turned upon his companion take my arm he said in a ghastly voice she shrank from him not unless it is thou needst support she whispered he seized her hand and reached and drove into the thick of the bestial throng dragging her after him a horrible reek seemed to fasten upon his brain maldiction shrieked a filthy alsatian whom he had sent reeling with his elbow but i will teach thee the answer to that he swung up a bloody cleaver clearing a space about him the girl on the thought ran under his guard throigne screamed a womans voice across the yard it is la belle ligeoiseour little amazon her cloak had fallen apart she was revealed to these her friends at the word a roar went up from the mob the offending patriot was struck down trampled upon the girl herself stamped upon his face hither screamed the voice again to the best seats in all the theatre then at once ned felt himself urged forward he went dazed his feet slid on the stonesplashed once or twice he saw a great lightlight jumping from the brands held high by a lurid row of women stationed on the topmost step of the shallow flight that led to the great door he saw throigne seized and embraced by these harpies her skirt that had been all white bore a clownish fringe of crimson i cannot stay here she cried i have business within they answered clattering get it over and return little badine for the sight is good the next moment he and the girl were at the door a group of four issuing scrambled past almost upsetting them a patriot to each shoulder and one fastened on like a dog at the back it seemed an extravagant guard to one sick collapsed thing borne in the midst they ran it down the steps the torches fluttered and poised steady ned flung himself through the doorway crushing his hands against his ears somebody touched and led him forward as his brain cleared he saw that he was standingsomewhat apart from any otherin a large dimly lighted room a man of a fierce and sensual mould of feature was seated hard by at a table a great open register before him a tin box of tobacco and some bottles within his ready reach round about lolled on benches pulled away from the walls perhaps a dozen more or less tipsy judges saving the mark subordinate to the president a couple of men with redstained arms and in steaming shirts stood by the closed door an old dumbfaced turnkey held his hand to the lock a voicea name lately uttered still rang confusedly in his memory what did it signify he caught at his reeling faculties behold citizeness the man all in an instant it seemed the room sank into profound stillness he struck the film from his eyes and saw st denys the wretched creature stood before the table between guards he appeared utterly amazed and demoralised even in the moment of terror ned shrunk to see how the brute had come to predominate in that handsome debauched face then suddenly the harsh voice of the president shattered the silence your nameyour profession st denys by principle and practice a demagogue faltered the prisoner dost know of what thou art accused i am innocent m le prsidentbefore god i am innocent something white moved forwardstruck him on the shoulder and before me basile de st denys he whipped about and uttered a cry like a trapped hare it is enough said the judge with admirable intuition he was by this time so far sated with his feast of blood that a nicely balanced situation was like an olive to his wine he would not cheapen the flavour by unduly extending it the citoyenne throigne pronounces sentence he said i wash my hands of the matter let the prisoner be enlarged he took a gulp from a glass at his side and bent to write in his book his guards laid hands on their victim with a shriek st denys tore himself free and fell at the feet of the woman throigne he cried abasing himself before herclutching at her skirt dont let them take meme that have lain in your arms grovelling on the floor he turned his agonised face to the president she did not denounce me monsieur your generosity misinterpreted her motive he caught again at the dress writhing in his dreadful shame say you did not mean it give me a little time to repent i have wronged you throigne but i never ceased to love you in my heart give me time in mercy and i will explain you have not seen you dont know the foulness and the horror of itthroigne looking up he saw the stony impassibility of her face and sank upon the boards moaning pardonpardon she stood gazing down upon this poor revealed basenessthis idol selfdeposed pardon she said at last in a quiet even passionless voice and do you conceive monsieur the exorbitance of your demand but i will put the case to these citizens and take their verdict she raised her beautiful hard face addressing the board what price messieurs for an innocence ravished under pretext of a union of freewillsa union that was to be more indissoluble than marriage yet that lasted only a summers day what price for a broken contract when the shame threatened for the dastardly desertion of a wounded comrade for the bitter desolation of a heart doubly widowed and slandered through its trust what price for the ruined honour of a family for the curse of a father what price for exile from all the peace of life formy god what price for a faith that was so beautiful destroyed for a name that necessity has made infamous amongst men she paused and a loud murmur from her listeners eddied through the room she caught at her skirt seeking to release it from the clutch of him that held it it was doubtful if the dying wretch took in much of the significance of her words he crouched there only whimpering and swaying and entreating her half articulately thou wouldst always teach me the immortality of such a faith she cried in quick passionateness whilst thou wert giving me to an immortality of shame suddenly she threw her hands to her face oh me oh me she wailed in a broken voice for the first time some core of anguish in ned seemed to melt and weep itself away it is come at last his heart exulted she will pardon him as swiftly as it had seized her the emotion fled she held out her open palms as if in a devils blessing above the prostrate man they are soiled with blood she cried let the victims when my name is execrated testify against you not me she seemed to listen to the moaning entreaty that never ceased at her feet the president shifted in his chair and was restless with some papers this situationit was interesting tragic spiced with unexpected revelation but the occasion apart from it was peremptory the killers were clamorous outside over the unaccountable break in the programme my honour cried throigne my early innocence my faith and peace of mind if i name the return to me of these as the price of blood what is thy answer his moaning rose only like a wind of despair she drew herself erect and turned to the judges messieursthe price the whole company seemed to spring to its feet a roar went up from itand subsided it is answered said the president take m st denys away there was a scurrying forward of mena sudden stoopinga struggle shriek after shriek came from the ground ned leapt into the fray like a madman to subscribe he screamed to the revengeful fury of a wanton it is not liberty or justice why look at her look at her the beast that would murder twenty innocents to secure the destruction of one that had wounded her vanity gentlemen to be so governed by a harlotto be he choked as he fought there were savage hands at his throat do not harm him i would not have him harmed it was throigne that spoke she stood apart white and chill as a figure of ice he spat curses at her that mingled with the deadlier tumult monsieur le prsident made his voice heard above the din eject this person without hurt from the rear of the prison seized then despite his frantic struggles protesting striving for foothold conscious always of the desperate outcryfaint and fainterof the unhappy man he had sought to befriend ned felt himself hurried along corridors borne down steps and by way of echoing dank vaultsthrust violently into a world of spacious silence a door shut with a steely clang behind him before stretched a desolate waste tract of fields the moon was at its fullflood light and the whole world seemed to float quietly on a sea of peace he threw himself facedownwards amongst the tufts of coarse grass and cried upon the flood to overwhelm him chapter xiv at the end of november the young viscount murk was still a sojourner in paris always reserved and selfcontained he was become by then a creature of wilful and habitual loneliness with something indeed of the moral dyspepsia that is induced of the morbid appetite that leads one to feed upon ones own heart and when the heart is so inflamed of love as to be sensitive to the least imaginary slight assuredly the dyspepsia as in neds case shall be acute men of few or no friendships have a very undivided passion to bestow when at last the call comes to them at the same time such are wont to signalise the early stages of their complaint by a diffidence so exaggerated as that in the nature of nature it must degenerate in course into a desperately injured vanity it is to be feared that at this period of his ailing ned was horribly big with a sense of grievance generally against the social order that seemed so parsimonious of the favours as represented by one only favour in fact that his position entitled him to draw upon what was the good in short of being possessed of acres a lordship an agreeable personality if all could not procure him the single modest gift he had ever asked of fortune that was a sentiment for his bitterest moods in his more reasonable he would acknowledge to himself with a sorrowful rapture that no human desert could prove itself worthy of the hebegoddess at whose pretty feet he had worshipped so he waited on and onbecause irresolution also is a necessary concomitant of extreme diffidence he waited on remote from his natural state constantly on the prick of flight yet always fearing to move lest a vilely humorous destiny should take his sudden decision for the point to a game of crosspurposes he waited on shrinking ever more into his unwholesome self avoiding companycomradeship even but halfconscious of the screeching barbaric world about him hearing only distant echoes from the world overseas now and again it would occur to himupon his receipt of those periodic advices from his steward that made the almost sum of his communications with a life that had grown curiously shadowy to himto put his own native instruments in the person of this same steward to the use of ascertaining and reporting upon the movements of madame de genlis and her charges but always he was faced thereupon by a score ghosts of apprehensionthat such confidences might beget familiarities vulgarising to the aloofness of his passion that the necessary interval that must elapse before he could procure a reply must debar him from the independence of action that he still claimed without enjoying most that the coveted news itself when it should reach him might do no better than confirm a haunting fear and so he dwelt on passing at last it seemed into the very winter of his discontent shunningsince that september night of a tragedy that had stricken him for the time being halfdementedpersonal intercourse with anyeven the gentle vergniaudwhose precepts and practice of liberty seemed so grotesquely irreconcilable he lost something of his former feeling of a moral participation in the scenes enacting about him of the revengeful woman with whose destinies a joyless fatality had appeared to connect him he had seen nothing since the hour of his agonising experience at the salptrirehad heard only with a savage exultation that her latest connection with the moderate party was undermining her popularity with that more formidable class of which the linkwomen on the prison steps had been prominent representatives she will be devoured by her own dogs he would think and god in heaven he would cry in his soul to what an association with cutthroats and queans has providence thought fit to condemn meme whose heart burns always like a pure steadfast lamp before the shrine of its divinity one bitter evening ned found himself abroad in the streetsa mere waif of destiny hustled and jogged into the kennels by an arrogant wind the iciness of this dulled all his faculties blinded him as he struggled aimlessly on it must make the stones weep he thought or why should my eyes fill with water the lamps slung across the narrower gullies danced like boats at their moorings the very shop fronts seemed to flap their signboards like hands for warmth he had crossed the river and penetrated the faubourg st germain as far as the rue de vaurigard on his right the sombre towers of the luxembourg reeled into the night on his left a starry quiver of lamps shaped out the portico of the thtrefranais he was numb with cold the glow and movement about the theatre drew himas they often did nowadaysto a bid for temporary selfforgetfulness he ran up the steps entered a warm and lively vestibule and took a box ticket for the performance this when he came to view it opened with a oneact sketchallons a vaa very patriotic and warlike little piece he had seen it before and it did not greatly interest him he was in fact sitting in the covert of his retreat watching rather the house than the players when all in a moment his heart bounded and he shrank back into the shadow of the wallhangings opposite him he had seen a party enter a screened box a loge grillenothing very significant in itself but a minute later the grating had swung open revealingpamela she did not at first catch sight of him she sat to the front of the tiershe and the little pinkeyed daughter of orleans her cheeks her hair her eyes were all a soft glory under the radiance of the lamps he thought he had never seen her look so happy and so beautiful there were figures the indistinct forms of men standing behind the ladies but these he could not identify a great sigh of ecstasy half anguish escaped him he leaned forward and at that instant the girl raised her face and saw him under the shock of recognition he was conscious of nothing but that he had bowed across the housethat he had immediately leaned back in his seat his pulses drumming his eyes blinded with emotion when he dared to look againthe grille was closed a swerve of actual vertigo seemed to send him reeling the next moment thinkingthough indeed he had done had looked nothing to attract observationthat his condition must be patent to the audience to the stage he brought his reason by a huge effort under command the grille was shut the door of heaven had been slammed in his face now he must fight to ignore the fiends of wicked alarm that swarmed about his brain he would close all his avenues of intelligencerender himself a thing mute and dumb his faculties in abeyance until the moment of resolution should arrive there might be any explanation other than one personal to himself of the shutting of the grating should he flog his reason for a wherefore it would be like brutally coercing an innocent witness he must not in the name of sanity allow his soul to be drawn into profitless speculations upon the supreme ecstasy of knowing that here after all these sick months of waiting was the period to be put at last to his uncertainty he must concentrate his thoughts permitting none to side issues he triumphed by sheer force of willsitting out the end of the little play but the instant the curtain fell he rose to his feet swept the frost from his brain andwithout giving himself stay or pause in which to thinkleft his box and made his way round to the opposite side of the house his head now seemed full of heat and light he was not conscious of his lower limbs almost immediately he came upon two men stepping from the rear of a box into the passage one of these was the duke of orleans the other was a tallish young man a little older than himself of a fine intelligent expression both gentlemen were dressed to the prevailing taste in clothes that were something an ostentatious advertisement of bourgeoisie but the extravagance was vindicated in the younger of the two by the mournful spirit of romance that seemed to inhabit behind a pair of very soft grey eyes ned addressed egalit at once and in a manner unwittingly almost imperious for in this tender present sensitiveness of his condition he imagined he foreread in that persons stony regard a repudiation of his acquaintanceship and he was desperate to preoccupy the situation he had not indeed forgotten the confidential words uttered by the duke at the moment of their first and latest parting and now his heart went sick in the fear of what might be implied by egalits obvious intention to stultify by avoidance of him any significance such confidence might have been held to express i have the honour to reintroduce myself to monsieur le duc he said i congratulate monsieur le duc upon the safe return of those with the delivery of a letter referring to whose movements in england i some months ago had the pleasure to charge myself the princes eyes opened and shut like an owls his bilious face seemed to deprecate a peevish derision it could not withhold i do not recognise he began looking through mere slits between lids whom i have then suddenly he checked himself impatiently and turned to his companion with a shrug of his shoulders my lord he said let me make known to you m le vicomte murk who once was good enough to constitute himself hermes to your adorable pamela ned stood rigid under the shock of all that was implied in the insolence the dukes young companion stepped forward and shook him by the hand did this stranger know or intuitively guess something of the silent tragedy that was enacting before him his soft eyes were at least full of generosity and sympathy i know your lordship by name he said i am lord edward fitzgerald and i am sure pamela will like to thank you in person for your disinterested service ned drew himself up like a martial hero giving the signal for his own execution i will take my sentence from her lips he said to the kind eyes and passed into the box he was close to her at lastand for the last time she turned to glance at him and instantly away again with a pert tilt of her chin he saw her stealthily advance a hand in the shadow and twitch her companion by the skirt the little lady gave a start what is the matter coquine she exclaimed then she saw ned flushed pink and dropped the gentleman a shy bow she was happy to renew monsieurs acquaintance she said and had monsieur been in paris all these months since they last had the pleasure of seeing him in ntre cher bury yes monsieur had been in paris the whole time that was to say ever since in pursuit of monsieur le duc he had left belgium whither it would appear he had been despatched on a fools errand mademoiselle gave a little deprecating shrug of her shoulders and monsieur no doubt has justified us in our choice of a messenger murmured pamela from ambush of the box curtains ned turned upon the young voice his tongue was dry his very features seemed stiffened into a mechanical expression of suffering yes he said i have been as great a fool as uriah the girl gave a little laugh probably she understood only the vague inference she drew aside the curtain and looked upon the house her head budded from dusk into light standing out like an angels seen in a dream the soft moulding of her face and neck was painted in dim sweet eclipseviolet where it intensified in the deeper curves in her shadowy hairlike a dryads curled by moonlighta single diamonda very star of morningburned it was neds fatethe common irony of loveto find the prize figure never so desirable in his sight as at the moment of its bestowal on another his heart was sick with a very hunger as he looked down on her o dieuquelle horreur she exclaimed referring to some one of the audience she tapped her foot drew back her head suppressed a tiny yawn what has become of edward said she as if she were unconscious that their visitor were not withdrawn it is my name said ned she glanced at him disdainfully with the ghost of an insolent laugh you here still monsieur will you please go and tell the fiddles to begin and shall i dance to them to entertain you he said her attitude robbed his passion even of a redeeming dignity his devotion seemed comparable with the sick devotion of a schoolboy towards a holiday coquette mon dieu she cried you would at least entertain us more than now the catgut gave its first screech as she spoke i will go he said hurriedly but he yet lingered out the final anguish have i not already entertained you enough and i have not yet congratulated the prospective lady fitzgerald and what shall i do with the flower you gave me pamela when i accepted madames service because i loved you for the first time she flushed angrily you have no right to say it she cried and do you suppose i constitute myself the fairy godmother to every little weed i bestow mademoiselle dorlans half rose from her seat nay said pamela gently coaxing her to resume it for monsieur will see the wisdom i am sure of not further enlarging upon an error of his own he uttered a deep sigh an error he saidmy godyes an errorand he bowed low and left the box the little kind royalty uttered a sob as he vanished and such was the manner of the endno renunciation ennobled of chivalry on his part no compassion no sympathy on hers and he could blame no one but himself his imagination it seemed had clothed a skeleton with flesh unlike dreaming adam he had awakened and found his imagination a lie he walked from the tawdry gates of his fools paradise and felt the wind rattle in his bones outside he found the two men withdrawn he made his way into the street a strange numbness in his brain it was like exaltationthe mere mad ecstasy of selfobliteration for the time it seemed to carry him forwarda spirit disembodied shorn of every instinct but that of flight the wind thrust at the dust choked the jumping lamps mocked him he paid no heed to a malice that was powerless any longer to influence his movements pressing forward aimlessly he came out on the pont neuf few passengers were now abroad and these butting with a sense of personal grievance against the blast took no notice of the significant attitude of one who upon such a night could stop to dwell upon the river but presently a single pedestriana womangoing by uttered a stifled exclamation checked herself slunk into the angle of a buttress and stood watching him he was gazing upon the black swing of water below suddenly he rose returned a few paces the way he had come and went down into the gloom of the quay where it stooped under the bridges shadow the woman followed stealthily the wind had long ago taken his hat he unbuttoned and flung open his coat she came swiftly to him and seized him by the arm he turned upon herdragged himself free with a start of repulsion his face underwent a changeflashing into an expression of mad fury again he shrieked why do you pursue and haunt me i think you are my genius for all devilry for a moment it looked as if he would strike herher throigne she stood where he had thrust her without the shadow thrown by the bridge a dim glow falling upon her face from a far lamp above even in this tumult of his rage he was conscious of an inexplicable new meaning in her eyes they were like caves of darkness alive with a suggestive inner movement i called to find you she said stilly without emotion the citoyen propritaire told me you were abroadprobably at the theatre i followed on the chance and destiny it seems was my guide why did you call why did you followwe have nothing of a common interest i loathe youdo you hear i curse the day on which you came into my life she never moved is it not our common interest she said to wish to die he gasped and stood staring at her ah she went on but i had heard and wondered for the result they were betrothed no further back than yesterday they are to be man and wife in a few weeks he is an impatient loverthis handsome chasseur in a few weeks she will lie in his armsthe pretty loving babouine he lifted his hand again with a furious gesture and at that she cast back the hooded cloak which she had held clutched about her face and breast and coming swiftly to him dared him with her brilliant eyes strike she cried it is what i ask only thou shalt strike thyself through me what thou knowst now what it is to be trampled under by the feet thou worshipdst and thou shalt be haunted evermore by the shadow of another mans happiness strike i say and kill like me thy spectre of unfulfilment with despair she tore at her dress baring her white bosom to him strike she cried again then suddenly her hands dropped limp and she moaned to herself i dare not think i cannot sleep he is always there weeping and imploring but there is something betweena deep red pool with an undermotion if i were to wade inmy god she criedi am afraid even to die she held up her hands to the man before her as if in prayer take me with theethere into the water i will not struggle if thou holdst me tight thou wert his friend for a little while and thou also hast suffered thou wilt plead for me monsieur wilt thou notthou wilt plead her voice broke in a shiver for all its wretchedness the heart of her hearer was stricken anew thou throigne he said thou poor twiceabandoned fool wouldst thou urge upon me that a first error is to be atoned by a second oh thou womannot to understand how cheap that love must be held that would disprove itself to spite its object god knows what angel of light or darkness had been at his elbow a moment earlier now he put his hand into his breast as he spoke she looked at him lost and wild thou didst not come to throw thyself into the river she muttered no he saidbut only this he cast it from him with the wordssomething he had taken from his pocketa little spiked and scented parcel so ridiculous and so tender it had fulfilled its mission at last that was writ in water and the poor cherished heels stuck with a sprig of withered geranium went down to the seaor perhaps into the maw of some sentimental pike that would swallow it all as we mortals swallow any absurd lovestory now if the action was inspired by a despairing mans intuitive altruism on behalf of a despairing harlot we may not call it bathos suddenly the woman broke into a shrill laugh was it an unfruitful token better thou and i she cried and so thou still holdst love inviolable he answered with his eyes she came quite close to himlooked up into his face that is well come with me then now the madness is past with you he exclaimed scornfully all his repulsion of her was returning before the reclaimed devil in her eyes with me murderess and courtesan oh it is not for myself she said it is for anotherwhose confession to me an hour ago sent me to seek thee outthat i would carry thee he stared dumfounded muttering another what other one she said that hath pursued thee long months with bleeding feet and a broken heart one that i came upon today lost and wandering in the cold streets and that i being no man took home with me and comforted what other he murmured again but with a dreadful intuition of the truth nay she said love hath not done with thee only thou must run with the hare instead of hunting with the dogs what other he repeated dully a saint monsieur yet one that for all her chastity hath caught the infection of these liberal times she gazed into his face piercingly i swear i never guessed she murmured i swear i hold her the dearer and the purer that she is revealed human in the end the handmaid of god ah but so to testify to his choice by this long discipline of her heart and now directing her in this pursuit of thee he ratifies the new licence and she shall not be less the saint because her passion is sanctified of a human love it is a vile blasphemy said the man you speak of nicette legrand she clapped her hands but yes she cried in shrill triumph i speak of nicette legrand whose heart it seems thou stolestone of the common things that thou and such as thou would use to the profit of an idle hour whilst thy honour was pledged elsewhere but who enlists love in his service shall engage a parasite to devour him nicette he only murmured once more take thy fill of her name said the girl scornfully i tell thee love presumes upon his hire didst thou think he had discarded thee he shall prove a tyrant whom thou thoughtst to make thy servant he fell suddenly quite calm and cold well he said so nicette is in paris she answered in parisa months long journey by rock and briar for those poor patient feet oh she cried that i should ever have unwittingly wronged her by seeking to convert this blockthis stoneto my own passionate uses and so she hath explained it to you he said in the same even tone well she is a liar from first to last and at least it is fitting that a murderess should give sanctuary to a murderess she stared at him breathing softly am i to kill you she said he laughed without merriment listen to me throigne i never desired this woman or gave her one pretext for asserting that i did if she says otherwise she lies if she tells you that she left mricourt to follow me she lies she has fled because she has been discovered in a deception as vile a crime as inhuman as any that have blackened the world since the race began she still stared at him her lips moving but she did not speak i have been in mricourt since you he went on without a change of intonation and i was witness to what i say the bubble is burstthe superstition by this time a black memory the tree that she haunted she haunted because it contained in its hollow heart the dead body of baptiste her little brother whom she had murderedmorally before god whom she had murdered i sayout of her hatred of him she haunted the scene of her crime and when that was threatened with detection she invented the legend of the vision to cover it but retribution abided and when that threatened she fled for a moment silence fell between the two the wind shrilled in their ears the hollow wash and sweep of the river came up to them if it is true whispered throigne at lastif it is true it is true she seemed to gaze at without seeing him so worn and so pitiful she muttered and i took her in and clung to her and found my own religion justified in hers suddenly she was hurrying from him speeding upwards towards the bridge he stood paralysed an instant then sprang and overtook her walking by her side where are you going he cried to hurl her into hell she shrieked if it is as you say they drove on together across the river through the blown darkness presently she stopped and turned upon him once more why do you follow me to see that you do nothing that shall enable you before god to testify against me ah she cried with a most bitter derision you are not desperate you have never loved as i read itas nicette reads it you have never staked your soul against your heart and this is what she hath done for the sake of one little glimpse of her heavenof seeing you without being seen she sent you to tell me so you lie said the woman quietly i took her secret from her because she was worn and despairing and then she implored me only to show her where she might hidden look upon you once again and so die and rest forgotten she struck her palms together and nownow she muttered she fled on her way the man had some ado to keep up with her he went indeed at length with loaded steps on this wild sorrowful night to love and lose and to be so loved it was a stab of poignant anguish to his heart that what he had held so sacred in himself should be claimed of a vileness with which he had no sentiment in common but thissurely this the love that can exonerate even wickedness done for its sake the wretched woman loved himperhaps with a love as intrinsically pure as that he had given to pamela he groaned as he sped on they crossed the quays and hurried by the place of the three marys a frowzy tricoteuse coming from a wineshop recognised throigne and stood barring their path ame tratresse modratrice cried the creature in guttural fury and broke into a torrent of oaths the girl shrank against the wall proffering no retort her eyes wide with fear ned took her arm put the woman on one side and they scurried on their way pursued by a blatter of expletives the wind cut into their faces with blades of ice as they turned into the rue de rohan chapter xv in front of the fire a girl lay on the floor asleep she had placed herself on her side facing the glow and cuddled into it but in the relaxation of profound slumber her head had fallen back so that the light from a lamp on the wall illuminated her features these looked curiously pathetically childlike under the seal of a rest so deep that her bosom hardly rose and fell to accent it her lips were a little parted her cheeks a little hollow and quite colourless from every ruffle of her hairfine and pale golden as a rabbits furthat lay spilt about her head to the toetips of her white bare feet that nestled into one another despite some inflammatory wounds that scarred them as cruelly as if they had been bastinadoed she was so almost motionless as to seem like a figure in tinted porcelainking cophetuas beggarmaid it might have been for indeed her clothes were very stained and ragged the door opened and a woman came swiftly to her side and gazed down upon hera woman under the fierce glow and lust of whose beauty she seemed to shrink into the mere semblance of a doll thrown down by a passionate child the woman looked then suddenly fell upon her knees and stooped her lips to the ear of the sleeper nicette she cried low nicette the girl on the floor started then she stirred moaned put her hand restlessly to her forehead and again with a sigh dropped back into the pit of slumber but the moment of halfconsciousness seemed to have robbed her of the perfect weanling innocence now her respirations came harder every breath she exhaled proclaimed her woman still she dreamt happily and a smile trembled on her lips seeing it throigne turned and beckoned to the man to come close he approached from the door and stood behind her away from the sleepers range of vision the woman pointed down at the dreaming face dost thou still accuse it awakeyes he said she frowned and again bent to call into the girls ear nicette where is thy brother baptiste a shadow like that of a cloud that ruffles water went over the quiet face the regular breathing hitched and wavered some broken soft ejaculations came from the lips suddenly the lids flickeredthe eyes opened unspeculative for a moment then snatching the soul of them from unearthly sweet pastures in whose fragrance it had lovelily nested still they were full of the glamour of holiday remote in their vision coy of things material throigne she murmured happy and confident her halfrecovered self only the core of a little atmosphere of the most loving warmth of emotion and feeling the woman bent and lifted the otherup into her arms didst thou hear me call she said caressingly and what wert thou dreaming of dearest great god thought ned is this throigne in actual truth a fiend dreaming said the girl softly of what am i always dreaming throigne of what indeed of things lost and longed for perhaps sometimes of the little poor brother that was murdered and hidden in a tree a voice shrieked at her back damnation seize thee she let fall her burden and scrambling to her feet turned upon the voice what then so wanton cried nedso wanton and so cruel his fury leapt in a moment like a boiling spring he could not have explained or controlled itcould not even have traced its source to a deep incorruptible chivalry that was instinctive to his sex and beyond the understanding of the other cruel she exclaimed madly and am i not thy delegatethy informer not so to take advantage like a cursed mouchard of this poor drugged wretch he cried why god in heaven are you so much less foul you devil she cut inyou dog didst thou not thyself a minute ago slander her behind her back i accused her openly cried nedas i accuse her now a stifled scream of agony answered him he looked into a corner of the room whence from shadow the sound had come the dreamermomentarily half stupefied by her fallhad risen while they raged and stood shrunk into an angle of the wall throigne leapt upon herseized her by a wrist look she screeched upon him that thou wouldst give thy life to see not being seen to prevail with whom thou wouldst sacrifice thy honour and thy fame with heaven hear him nowhow he regards thy devotion tell himtell me ratherhe lies tell me thou art not a murderess and i will crush the slander back upon him till it tears like a splintered rib into his heart she stood quiveringglaringworrying the arm she held speak she panted brokenly and leave the rest to me a moments silence succeeded the terrible outcry it is true what he says then whispered nicette i murdered baptiste throigne dropped the wrist she clutched and swung back heavily against the wall my god she muttered my god then she mastered herself faintly like a weary creature it was my last hopethe queen the gentle mother to justify through her handmaid the passion of woman for man it is ended there is no good in the worldno truthno virtue oh my heart my heart she caught herself from the cry in a rally of quiet fury pointed to the door her arm extended along the wall you have killed my faith she said her gesture was crowningly significant without a word the girl stole fearfully from her shadowy coverthurried across the roompassed from it and was gone into the street she fled ran a few paces stopped and looked wildly about her snow had begun to fall the wind whipped her thin tattered skirts about her ankles in all the mad night there was no beacon towards which she might make for the little lightening of her despair she glanced once about her then crouched with a dying moan upon a doorstep her face was buried in her hands when an instant later ned silently came upon her he stood looking down once earlier in the evening he had thought she not the wretched girl at his feet might have dismissed me as effectually by gentler methods yet had he for his part shown more compassion towards this unhappy outcaststained though she waswho lay here so committed to his mercy he bent suddenly and put his hand upon her shoulder she did not even start now but she uncoiled herself with a shiver and gazed up at him without recognition it seemed what do you intend to do he said where will you go she only shook her head weakly and amazedly he stepped back looked up into a blinding gloom of darkness and spinning flakes the patterns these wrought seemed the very moral of heavens enactmentshieroglyphics drawn upon a slate of night he was not theologian enough to interpret them for himwith a sense of being enclosed and shut down within a very confined vault of human suffering with god maybe walking serene and unwitting high up on the sunny lifts of ether above the earththe issues of life were become brutally restricted he had had aspirations they had been crushed under by the heavy night that had dropped upon his world now in a moment he could feel only that he was alone with a woman who loved him without one thought of the meaning of the hieroglyphics that it lay with him unsupported to direct the destinies of two soulshis own and anothersthat fortune had isolated in tragic companionship and contrasted with the human piteousness of this otherthis soul that had claimed him in the darkness into which his own had fallenhow did not the shibboleth of convention suddenly confess itself a ridiculous fetish of strings and patchesa block for a fashionplate he had no plan of conduct at last but to driftand if by way of sunny pastures so much the less troubled would he be his heart was moved to a dull aching passion in this first realising of its emancipation from a wounding thrall get up he cried violently do you hear get up and come with me he turned away and going a few paces looked round to see if she were following ay like a dog she had risen and jumped to his order before it was well issued he strode on the fall already making a soft cold mat to his feet it was no great distance to his rooms the rue st honor was near deserted and he went down it swiftly once again only he turned to see that the girl was not lagging then he cursed himself and came to a stop under a lamp she was hobbling towards him as fast as her bleeding feet would permit her he had never given a thought to thisthat she had been driven half naked into the night as she came up she dumbly begged of him with a little pathetic smile timid and conciliatory not to be angry with her for halting he saw a trickle of blood flow into the white carpet where she waited now he stood to the struggle between his pride and his humanity she was slight and thinly clad he might have carried her in his arms the little remaining distance but a hard devil rasped his heartthat particular belial that tempts consciences to very wanton selfmutilations i had not thought he said coldly i should have been more considerate i will walk slowly the rest of the way i hardly feel itindeed monsieur indeed she answered brokenly and eagerly i will come faster he went on again and she crept behind him arrived at last at his door he rapped on it and stood away signing to her to enter the citizen theophilus although he was a good patriot bowed the gentleman and his companion into the sadly lit hall with a conscious elaboration of the bel air he was at different times cook and concierge and always proprietora man of admirable tact now he smiled and informed monsieur the englishman that there was a grateful hot fire in his room that the night was a disgrace to paris that a steaming potage could be served to the citoyenne in a moment did monsieur desire it he did not shrug his shoulders or appear to notice the bare raw feet set upon the mat or anything strange in this apparition of a dazed young woman standing there with the snow in her hair that was his delicacy for the rest reputations were not marred nowadays by any refusal to subscribe to such oldfashioned codes of propriety as were only practised if at all in the prisons where the remnants of a social hypocrisy awaited consignment to the ragtearing machine in the place louis xv citizen theophilus would have as little thought of bestowing a suggestive wink on the mating of a couple of swallows as on the foregathering of a young man and maid under his eaves i will do myself the honour he said to conduct monsieurs dear young friend to monsieurs apartments he skipped up the stairs in advance candle in hand like an ignis fatuus he was a little manalways dancingly restlesswith a lean face and irongrey corkscrew curls that he would keep well oiled as though they were the actual springs of his movements arrived in neds apartments they were in one suite sitting and bedrooms with a foldingdoor between he lit the candles poked the logs into a blaze and stood for orders the potage monsieur ned transmitted the inquiry with a look no pray monsieurnot for me murmured the girl very well said ned frigidly it will not be needed my thophile the landlord protested bowed and flirted himself from the room the two were left alone ned walked to the window lifted the blind a moment and looked out upon the dumb white whirling of the snow then suddenly he spoke over his shoulder go and warm yourself at the fire she crept to the hearth immediately and sat herself before the glow putting out to it her stiff frozen hands in token of obedience he took to pacing up and down the room not removing from his shoulders the thick redingote in which he was wrapped presently he came and stood near her his elbow resting upon the mantelshelf i want you to listen to me he said she uttered no sound but only looked up at him pathetically pliant to his will her prince for all her sins had come to her with the glass slipper would her poor swollen foot ever go into it her blue eyes like a childs sought his pity and forgiveness but he was resolute to blind his heart to the appeal an hour ago he saidslowly as if weighing his every word to himselfi could not have done this the interval has proved a fruitful one to us both she clasped her hands as she gazed at him a film seemed to come over her eyes she murmured in a tranced halffearful voice the warmth it seemed had drugged her brain what happened it was misty and shining but to be with youyes thou art here and the fire and nicette that was always in the deep heart of my visions he took no notice of her halfaudible wanderings i would not have you suppose he went on tonelessly steadily that i shall allow any conversion by you of this accident into opportunity i brought you to shelter for only the reason that i decline to burden myself with any shadow of compunction for what share my duty forced me to take in your punishment for the rest we remain as always wide poles apart in the pause he made she dropped her headcrept a little nearer to himcrouched at his feet not to be haunted by the wistful eyes by the look like a dogs that was so full of the silent struggle to comprehend made his task easier you may stop here he said until i am able to procure you other quarters and the means if possible to a living that will not be later than tomorrow i hope for tonight at least you are to sleep in my room yonder and i will make shift to lie out here do you understand yes she whispered very well he said but i saddle the agreement with one fixed condition as long as you remain herewhether it is for one day or two or moreyou are to hold no communication with meare never to speak to me unless i first address you she rose to her knees clasping her hands again to him her hair was fallen over her cheeks she looked a very small forlorn subject for extreme measures i shall be near you she said halfchoking he took her arm and motioned her to her feet it is understood then you had better go to bed now and rest and recover and get warm he put a candle into her hand led her to the door of the bedroom thrust her gently within and clicked the latch upon her then he went and stood over the fire what had he done what was he doing even as he had spoken making his condition he had known that that was a wild absurdity impossible of fulfilment what had moved him to it but a sudden recrudescence of that selfmutilating spirit he had had no deliberate thought to goad a willing jade or to return in kind to love the humiliation he had suffered from it yet he knew that he was doing so and it was a perilous lust to indulge his heart was full of ache his brain of phantoms these were reflected coming and going in the still red logs of the fire they represented in a thousand aspects the three ghosts that would haunt his life for evermore all womenall fair and fateful shapes and of the three the vilest because she had figured for the purest was the one that had come to claim him at the last it was a fierce satire upon the lesson of ennobling ideals pamela and throigne and nicette he felt it no sacrilege now to name this trinity in a breath indeed which alone of the three had made it her sport to coquet with hearts holding their suffering as nothing to the gratification of her vanity not either of those peasant girls of mricourtwhose passionate blood would always rather flame to the ecstasy of pursuit than to the selfish rapture of being hunted for the sake of their own beautiful skins his thoughts swerved from one figure to another this lord edward fitzgeraldhow had he come to usurp the very throne of desire he knew a little of him by reputehad heard of the ardent young soldier and apostle of the new liberty melancholy and something wild breathing the spirit of romance he had no grudge against him at least and what of mr sheridan whose influence alone he had apprehended ghosts they were to him now what profit was it to seek to analyse their bodiless significance sweeping and shadowy the smoke of all such phantoms reeled up the chimney only one face remained with him he glanced at the bedroom door lay down on the rug before the fire and wrapping his cloak about his haggard face committed himself to the hopelessness of slumber chapter xvi the citizen theophilus was at points of discussion with a rather dissipatedlooking phantom of respectability that had descended upon him at an extremely early hour let the citizenand moreover monsieur the englishmanrest assured he said that i accept his commission with a high sense of the compliment implied but it is not specific oh mon dieu jsus that is all i complainit is not specific in what way for example there is for consideration the toilette of vesta as well as that of aurora why deuce take it man you dont suppose i expect the girl to go to bed in her petticoats if thats what you mean cest bien monsieur je sais la carte du pays he bridged his fingers tapping the tips together to accent every item i am to procure then the citoyenne a wardrobe plain in character and of modest proportions it is for the reason that the citoyenne may possess such attire as will not militate against her chance of obtaining respectable employment scrupulously so monsieur this wardrobe is to be for both day and night also scrupulously so moreover it is to be of the limitations that will not tend to encourage the idea of a prolonged sojourn in a present sanctuary offered i have monsieurs word for it on grounds of the most disinterested platonism finally so long as mademoiselle remains under monsieurs protectioni crave one thousand pardonsunder monsieurs guardianshipshe is to receive every ordinary consideration as to service and meals he flourished his hands outwards and bowed his curls bobbing like wood shavings i shall have the honour to punctually acquit myself of these commissions monsieur need give himself no further concern in the matter you are a treasure my thophile said ned and he stepped out into the morning it was very cold and bright and beautiful for wind and cloud had dropped behind the horizon the pavements the roofs the steeples were wrapped in white that looked as soft as swansdown the whole city it seemed had put on its furs against the opening frost ned stepped without sound over the flags the hour was still so early that hardly a soul was abroad his tired eyes felt the restfulness of the rounded beds of snow his throat took in the stinging wine of the morning in grateful draughts he had had but a little troubled sleep and his wits seemed plugged and his brain sore he wanted to think he wanted to understand why it was that his thoughtsthat should have been all of the tragic quenching of a flame that had for so long been his beacon in waste placeswere unable to rescue themselves from a weary toingandfroing before the closed door of his own bedroom he wanted to understand and he could not only it dully presented itself to him as a monstrous thing that the later image should dominate his mind if he could recover but a little clearness of moral vision he was sure he would see what a foul wrong to his own loyal heart he was being led into committing so he tried to reasonin the lack as he felt of reason itself and still the cold air would not cleanse his brain of the impurity and still the figure that haunted him as he walked was not pamelas then he whispered aloudas if to see whether spoken words would not prevail with him she is a murderess i have given her scarcely a thought but of loathing and nowbecause of a specious dumb appealdamnation for all she has gone through she is as sound of wind and limb as a pagan circea perfect animal still i think she cannot suffer without a soul he strode on more rapidly i must find her another lodgingat once without delay walking preoccupied unregarding his direction he had made down one of the side streets that led into the place louis xv suddenly the sound of shrill jolly voices startled him he looked up in amazement to see close before him something the fact of whose existence he had hitherto most shrinkingly ignored sanson and his satellites were engaged in washing down the guillotine they were as voluble as grooms over a carriageand indeed the machine had its wheels and shafts and splashboardeven its luggagebasketall complete now committed involuntarily to view of it ned inspected the horrible engine with some curiosity hullo then my jackadandy cried one of the grooms boisterously art thou seeking a barber no said ned but the answer to a riddle the man fondled a beam grimacing it is all one said he here is the oracle i believe it is said ned only i am not yet sure of the question and he turned away he breakfasted at a caf made a particular little purchase to which he was whimsically attracted and returned about midday to his chambers they struck very cold and quiet there did not seem a sound in the house he entered his sittingroom and closed the door the girl was crouched in her old place upon the rug she looked up at him mutely as he went by her without a word to the fire he let a minute pass while he warmed himself then he said not turning his head you want to speak to me oh yes yes she answered at once and eagerly to thank you for these the clothes you neednt thank me it was my own interests i consulted in giving them to you your rags would have been no recommendation to a possible employer an employermonsieuran employer certainly did you imagine i intended to keep you on here indefinitely she made no reply have you breakfasted he said she answered yes gratefully in a low voice he twisted about then and regarded her the wise theophilus had he saw acquitted himself sensibly of his order the girl was clothed freshly and simply her own instinctive niceness of touch her kittenlike cleanliness had ministered daintily to the result the young mans brain swam for a moment he could have thought he was back again in the lodge at mricourt the unsullied fragrant presentment of a little jellyloving madonna charming the luminous shade of the dairy in which she sat the sun blazing upon the garden phloxes without touching this his natural childs head softly with a single beam in the same moment he dashed his hand so to speak upon the struggling fancy he would not have it rise further to confront him it was undeserved of its subject at the least the promise it had once suggested had never been vindicated and he would insist upon that now as an actual aggravation of the girls demerits seeing that at this late hour of her practical punishment for a wickedness confessed she could still so far look her old self as to inspireand demoralisea certain emotion of regard even the very hollows in her cheeks seemed filled since yesterday and she wore her new shoes and stockings without a hint of their discomforting her wounded feet was it then that a constitution could be so flawless as to be debarred by ignorance of suffering from sufferings prerogative of moral exaltationthat the nerves of emotion inherited from the nerves of physical feeling if it were so it were idle in this case to be considerate of the former he put his hand into his coat pocket and producing a small parcel held it out to her you have breakfasted he said but doubtless you will yet have an appetite for this she took it from him wonderingly if he had designed it as a grimly ironical test of her disposition he had reason to be discomfited by her reception of the pleasantry she glanced at the superscriptionit was a little box of guava jellythen suddenly let the packet fall and threw herself on her face upon the rug she lay so long and so still without sound or movement that presently he grew uneasy get up he cried at last touching herand hating himself for doing sowith his foot she stirredrose to a sitting posture her eyes had a dazed stunned look in them nicette he exclaimed a little troubled by the fixity of her gaze he saw then that she was gulping as though trying to speak what is it he asked mutinous against the gentler spirit that was possessing him he had to bend his head to hear her while they livedit was always hethat receivedthe praise the titbit the love who received baptiste he drew himself up with an astonished expression what answer was to make herewhat course pursue with a soul so inadequate she spoke of her parents it seemed was pleading their favouritism in vindication of her crime it was a confession of moral obliquity so ingenuous as to baffle argument for the first time a shock of conscious pity for a thing so handicapped in the pursuit of the living principle shook him he bent down seized the box of sweetmeat and flung it into the fire the girl gave a strange little cry and gazed up at him her mouth breathless her eyes glazed with the floating of sudden tears what now said ned her voice broke in a quick sob i thought there was no hope or forgiveness that you meant to hate me for evermore he turned away how could he be other than moved and stricken she had not after all so much sought to extenuate her crime as to plead for herself against the hatred she had thought his act was meant to express there was silence for a time then he sat down in a chair apart from her and spoke gazing into the fire how can you think it mine either to hate or to forgive how he struck his hand to his foreheadturned upon her in utter desperation nicette do you ever feel remorse for your deed i dare not think of it she whispered then suddenly she cried out i think the people of my dreams are often more real than the living about me they come and go sweet or terrible was it one of them left baptiste to die in the tree oh monsieur monsieur if i could learn itthat i was not guilty of his death or if i could die myself and atone she buried her face in her hands now thought ned shall i tell her the truththat practically she is not guilty no muttered the little belial voice in his ear what value lies in the practical significance the moral is the truth besides are you so sure that her imagination is not at this moment calculating its probable effects on you think of her consummate and enduring art in affecting a character in playing a part the frost of scepticism nipped his pretty burgeon of pity he hardened his heart and drew back again die he said with a little caustic laugh well for one of your imagination it should be easy in these days to devise a quite lawful means of introduction to monsieur sanson she glanced up at him quickly with a look of agony then drooped her head and said no more a second long silence fell between them but byandby ned found himself restlessly driven to open upon her again what happened after i had left you that time she seemed to wake to his voice shuddering out of some scaring dream my god they sought for me they burned my lodge they killed my poor gnisse they would have crucified me like the thieves but i hid and escaped in the night she paused go on he said i fled into the woods there when i was lost and near starving i fell by gods blessing upon the cagots who had once before visited our parts they were returned making their way towards paris because of the cry of equality they had lost their child it had been hunted by boys and had died of the illtreatment they were alone those two and they took me in and fed me and byandby when it was safe for me to move i went with them on their journey to the great city great god cried ned striking in in sheer amazement and these were they upon whom you allowed suspicion of the murder to rest whom the merest chance saved from suffering the consequences of a crime of which you alone were guilty but monsieuroh monsieur i knew when the cry rose that they were gone from the neighbourhood and indeed they are always so execrated that it could make no difference ned sank back in his chair well he said with a veritable groan i went with them and we were long long by the way and on the way the woman also died i think it was of nothing less than starvation then the man and i came on alone to paris and throigne met us and took me from him and the woman died of want and it never occurred to you that you were a burden on those whom you hadoh god how to unravel this warp hold your tongue nicette let there be silence between us in pitys name she shrunk down as if she had been struck her confidences it seemed were of no avail to move him but presently he spoke again why last nightwhen i accused you before the woman your frienddid you not give me the lie she would have taken your word before mine and she answered in the very voice of desolation because if i had lied i should have lost you he leapt to his feet i cannot breathe or think he cried i must leave youi must go out as he hurried from the room she dragged herself to his empty chair and threw her arms about it with a moan of agony all day he wandered through the streets and only returned home when darkness had closed many hours upon the city she will be in bed by now he thought the firelight made a glow about the room revealing it untenanted he sat himself down before the hearth feeling utterly weary and vanquished he had done nothing planned nothing as to the girls removal his brain seemed incapable of concentrated thought i should have lost youshould have lost you the cry had been drawn into his very veins it adapted itself to his pulsesto the knocking of his heart what was to be the answer this it seemeda white figure that stole from the bedroomcrept into the firelightcrouched down on the floor beside him and took his unresisting hand he felt the tremulous clutch and dared not move he felt his hand kissed pressed against warm bare fleshfelt a hot trickle lace it the paroxysm of emotion ceased and then suddenly she spoke whispering it can never be never he said low he knew through the utmost conviction of his stricken soul that it was all wrong and impossiblethat he must answer as he had done he felt a quiver pass through her frame she spoke again in a moment my sini know itholds us apart i have not atoned and until i have it holds us apart do you think monsieur baptiste has forgiven me i think he has nicette but you cannotnot yet though i love you so dearly perhaps i should not love you so well if you could yet it seems a strange thing to me why you helped me at all he half rose from his chair but she gently detained him and he sank down again you must go back to bed nicette we will talk it all over tomorrow tomorrow she said shall we be any nearer one another tomorrow he shook his head a very little sigh escaped her you will be kind and generous to me i know but you will give me no moment again such as this i have stolen and i have stolen your bed too monsieur but you must take it from me now and lie in the warm nest i have made for youit is such a little of myself it will not matter to youand i will sleep here before the fire he got now resolutely to his feet nicette it is folly you must return to bed i tell you i am going out again for the night tomorrow i say we will try to settle matters for the best she clung to him yet as he moved letting him even pull her a step forward on her knees one thingjust one last thing i shall like you to know when i am gonesome day when i am gonethat i died a maid her face in the shadow was turned up to him the firelight made an aureole of her hair he could feel her whole body heaving against his hand will you kiss me once she said he was conscious of a choking in his throat and beat down the emotion fiercely no he muttered it would imply something that must not be she sank back away from him without another word he turned and left her in the street the frost snapped at him like the very watchdog of desolation he huddled his cloak about him with a shudder as he faced it it is for the best he thought to be awayfrom the terror of my own weakness any auberge will serve for the night he strode a few paces crunching over the snow and stopped i might at least have quitted her of the worst of her remorse it would have been a little return for such lovemy god such love should he go back at once and tell her that she was guiltless of the little brothers actual death fool whispered belial still reasoning with him does her love for you alter the moral and will you an emotional bearer of forgiveness escape so easily a second time the warm nest in the bed fool he turned and refaced the chill emptiness of the night i must not he thought she shall know the truth tomorrow chapter xvii the morrowthat is always by some alchemistic process to convert the drossy problems of the night into liquid goldgreeted ned with leaden untransmutable skies that were only too representative of the irresolvable heaviness of his own thoughts he looked out of his grimy window of the little tavern on which he had quartered himself and saw the yellow of an almost substantial atmosphere sandwiched between a sagged grey welkin and a world of livid snow and he saw no prospect in that before him of any illumination of his dull perplexity he dressed breakfasted and presently went out into the streets the desire to postpone that hour of inevitable struggle with an allurement which he dreaded in his present condition of emotional bewilderment he would be unable to resist drove him to take a rambling course to his lodgings he had gone down to the quay of the thuilleries and was turning into the gardens when his attention was drawn to a man who rose from a bench at the moment and greeted him with a timid ejaculation of delight he stopped somewhat impatientlystarted stared and uttered an exclamation in his turn for in the ragged largeboned stranger who was looking at him from eyes that held the very spirit of patient deprecation he recognised all at once the poor pariah of a longpast experiencethe cagot whom he had befriended in the woods of mricourt he held out his hand in a sudden rush of emotion the man advanced bent down and touched it reverently monsieur murmured the poor creature it is the sunshine breaking ned regarded him with infinite humble pity the thought of the charity so large of the humanity so rare and so remote from that proclaimed in the windy casuistries of liberators who would use its name rather as a warcry than as a message of peace the thought of how this outcast reflecting in his selfless chivalry the very altruism of the man of sorrow had recently helped and protected a member of the race that had made him so was like a cool breath on his troubled brain i think it isi hope it is he said gently he put his hand on the shoulder of the gaunt figure the man was buttoned against the bitter cold into the mere scarecrow of a jacket his feet were bare and scarred with blood his cheeks his flesh wherever seenand that was in more places than custom prescribeswere fallen in upon a frame accordant with the strong soul that inhabited there and so said ned you are alone at last in the world the man looked up an expression of wonder on his face how did monsieur know ae it is true i am alone we were on our way hither in quest of the new liberty and god pitying her weary feet gave it her when but half the journey was done and the little child oh my friendperhaps she heard the little child crying for her in the night it is true monsieur but they will never be able to play birdsfly or shadowbuff in the moonlight up there without me the rogue and the little mother and i hear them talking all the night through wondering when i shall come and you do not complain why should i complain they are so safe at last think what it would have meant to them had god called me first yes yes andwhat is your name you have never told me your name it is laurent monsieur one is enough for us cagots laurent what has become of the woman you brought of your charity to paris merciful god monsieur is a wizard indeed she found her reward in the meeting with an old friend who took her away from me her reward ah monsieur she was an angel of light to the dying mother she prayed with and she sang to her and sometimes she would with her voice earn a silver livre by the wayenough in the end to buy the little place of rest in the churchyard laurent you are starved and frozen laurentdo you hear i also am alone in the world you shall come with me and be my servant and companion and we will travel always travel until at last wayworn and tired we shall come back we too to the little place of rest he turned greatly moved through the gate into the gardens come he whisperedthen he checked himself and faced suddenly on the astonished cagot tell me he cried what would the cagot think of him that wilfully withheld her souls cure from a poor shameful woman that loved him that he fearedthat he feared monsieur feared what to discharge his enemy from her thrall i said she loved him yes women love their oppressors but it is a love that in its hour of retaliation will ask a return in kindness for every blow given what shall be the fate of the man then when he kisses each bruise ned dwelt on the patient face in some astonishment philosopher he said wilt thou take service with me monsieur takes my breath away it is too wonderful to be true the truth i think laurent is always wonderful comehurry thou i at least will profit by this lesson to go and tell it and to kiss the bruises monsieur ned did not answer but turned once more and entered the gardens the cagot following at his heels a clamour of voices that had come distantly wafted to them as they passed through the gate took volume with every step they advanced suddenly breaking from a little park of trees into one of the long snowcovered walks that enfiladed the gardens east and west the cause of the tumult was revealed to them in the vision of a dozen or so infuriate tricoteuses priestesses of st antoine who were hurrying in their direction driving a single woman like a scapegoat in their front at first ned distinguishing nothing definitely saw only exemplified in this throng of vicious wives with its rabble of inhuman brats hooting and pervading it one of those exacerbated paroxysms of the mania of fraternity that were of such frequent occurrence nowadays as to confound the very heart of autonomy but as the horde came into focus and he paused to gather the import of its vehemenceall in a moment the truth leapt upon him and he uttered a cry and sprang into the road for he had recognised in the subject of all this raging ferment no less a person than the erstamazon throigne herself her black hair floated loose her eyes were alight with shame and terror her bodice hung in strips from her waist she hurried towards him maddening and moaning and as she ran the harpies scourged her bare shoulders with the leathern belts they had torn from their waists he rushed to intercept her flight she sawtried to evade him then instantly she leapt to recognition clutched and fell prone at his feet he stood over her while she shrieked and wailed incoherently he warded off the rain of lashes receiving much of it on his own arms and body beasts he yelled how has she deserved this infernal treatment the air blattered with their imprecations the traitress the reactionary the putain of brissot the thongs whistled the mob circumgyrated the uproar waxed murderous in the heat and menace of it a sudden new ally appeared in the midst courage master he cried and seizing off his ragged jacket he flung it over the victims bleeding shoulders and turned upon the rabble see here he shouted and struck his left breast with his hand upon the echo the nearest of the pack fell away shouldering into the throng behind them the ducks foot went up a shriek it is a cagota cagot ned in his fury could actually laugh it is a brother sisters of the confraternity he cried they were baffled only for the moment if they dared not touch they could fling there were heavy stones in plenty under the snow they were already stooping to gather them when a fresh diversion occurred a patrol of the national guard broke into the rabble and disintegrated it at once arose a clamour of demands retorts and counterretorts shrieking denunciations ned awaited the issue in perfect coolness suddenly a couple of gensdarmes approached and collared him you arrest me messieurs certainly citizen but i am an englishman and have done nothing but help a woman in distress that is well then it will serve thee no doubt before the commissary what commissary we are of the section of the croix blanche forward citizen he was marched off to a volley of execrations the cagot was driven in likewise amidst pointing bayonets a party of soldiers then lifted the prostrate woman surrounded and urged her forward she went babbling and dancing she was the virgin to whom the vision of mricourt had been vouchsafed she was the mother of god herself the guard chuckled coarse jests over her ravings the mob surrounded all going with them and spitting fury at the accursed ned resigned himself to the inevitable only it distressed him whenever he thought of it to picture the lonely figure in his chambers awaiting its reprieve the moment he was released he must hurry to it and acquit it of its trouble once he called over his shoulder to the cagot thou shalt not lack a new coat and without a badge presently courage my friend remember that thou art reborn into the year one of liberty and equality sacred and indivisible hold thy tongue growled a sergeant i have spoken said the englishman their progress by way of the quays and so round by the place de grve into the rue st antoine made small stir amongst the few passengers abroad in the bitter weather they were hurried traversing a medley of little streets into onethe rue pavevery gloomy and noisome and from this they were suddenly wheeled leaving the crowd stranded without into the courtyard of a sinister dark buildingthe htel de la force neds heart sickened before the recent associations of the place involuntarily he drew back up then cried the sergeant shouldering him on it is sometimes safer to enter than to leave here he pulled himself together and mounted a flight of steps leading to a narrow door the woman passed in before himpassed there and then out of his life he never saw her again from that hour to the day of her death twenty years later she raved and rotted in a maniacs cell she had become indeed mater tenebrarum bloodguilt and vanity had undermined a reason that was already shaken before the humiliation of that public chastisement came to finally overthrow it she died in the salptrirein the very prison that had witnessed the triumph of her vengeance and the spirit of her victim blown in the moonlit nights against the bars of her cell might cling to them like a bat and peer in and take its evil rapture of the retribution that had consigned her to that one haunted spot out of all the haunted city nedcarried into a dusky vestibule and thence into a little side office where he must await under guard the commissarys pleasurewas ushered after no great interval into the presence of that tremendous functionary he found him a young manrather a revolutionary blondinmilitary and fastidious with a nose as highbridged as the fifth proposition in euclid and an underjaw like a griffins he was seated in an elbowchair in the front of his men the cagot under care of a turnkey stood before and well away from him and between him and the cagot a soldier held out a burning pastile on the point of a bayonet he made a little gesture to the newcomer almost as if he were kissing his fingertips and addressed him at once in a lisping voice your name if you please ned satisfied him citizen edward murk he said waving away the superfluous title with a scented hand thou art accused of interfering with the processes of the law and inciting to a riot ned exploded immediately the law monsieur but i interfered in vindication of it how then didst thou not oppose thyself to the peoples will to their violence rather it was their will nevertheless and the peoples will is the law therefore thou opposedst the law it is a new law that monsieur truly it dates from the year one of fraternity and what has the law one of fraternity to say to my servant here he indicated the dazed laurent the commissary lifted his passionless eyebrows this man is i understand a cagotanother pastile benota cagot sir and yet he will venture into the public ways gloveless and without shoes thus poisoning what he touches you will say monsieur it is a superstition this year one is surely no better than other years the firstthan other opening pages to our periodic new ledgers of reformif we carry forward into it a tyrannical superstition what has that to do with the matter this is a man it is indeed monsieur answered ned sharply he was growing impatient of this meaningless arraignment he had other and more important business to attend to he looked into the vacuous young face is not this all inapplicable he said i tell monsieur that the man is my servant that we saw a woman suffering illtreatment that we went to her assistance humanely and without violence we are guilty of no assault no resistance to or outrage against any law either of the year one or of the year one thousand and one and i must ask monsieur to discharge us on the simple facts of the case he took it is to be acknowledged the wrong way with a fool i know nothing of the year one thousand and one said the officer with feeble irony it was before my time doubtless snapped in ned monsieur was born yesterday the commissary supporting his right elbow with his left hand sank back in his chair pinched his callow throat into a bag and closed his eyes the simple facts he saidas if reasoning with himself as the one most needing the lesson of reasonare that you have defied the authority of the plebiscite good heavens cried ned the officer coming upright again his lids in the act seemed to open mechanically like those of a doll i must tell you plainly he said that to my mind your interference was questionable and suspicious believe me sir said ned politely that in quoting your own mind you use an empty argument you state continued the commissary that this man is your servant who ever heard of a respectable person taking a cagot for a servant there rose murmured acclamations from the bystanders this was the first really apposite thing uttered by the officer he seemed greatly stimulated by the applause and moved thereby to clinch a fine situation i shall remand you he said quite briskly for inquiries to be made into the truth of your statements ned stared then burst out in a fury it is monstrous monsieur it is ridiculous you have only to listen a moment to what i sayto accept my references to a dozen of the first standing in the city to assure yourself of my identity the commissary waved his hand obedient to the gesture a couple of guards closed upon their captive i take nothing from you he said in accepting your references i might constitute myself a receiver of stolen goods it was an inspiration he looked up with a gasp into the faces of those about him to read in their expressions if it were possible that he himself could have said this thing it was true he had there must be no anticlimax take the prisoner away he said smilingly selfconscious as if he were ordering a table to be cleared for a fresh surprisecourse ned protesting threatening fulminating was forced from the room hurried down a passage and thrust into a little dark chamber that led therefrom the sound of a key grating in its lock fell disagreeably upon his ears only a thin wash of light reached him from a single barred window high up under the ceiling a couple of crippled chairstogether it might be said with an almost palpable smell of drainsformed the only furniture of the room the wallpaper moulted its gaudy dyes or hung in strips from the plaster the floor was littered with perished rags of parchment evidently the closet had been at one time some office connected with the prison recordsa dreary mad reflection to any one remembering to what recent use those records had been put ned sank down upon one of the chairs and for the moment looked about him quite stunned and aghast up and down up and down by the hour together the morning had drawn to noon the noon to evening and still he was confined with only an indefinite prospect of release it was hideous it was outrageous yet the humour of it all might have buoyed him up against the moment of his liberation had not his soulin its present condition introspective and selftorturingso writhed in exquisite anguish over a neverceasing fear or foreboding of somethingsome vague disaster that it seemed to him his prolonged absence from home must precipitate to this something he would or could give no name but his thoughts circled round the shadow of it feigning a selfassurance that there was no core of significance therein to terrify themyet terrified nevertheless at the first he had flattered himself that midday or thereabouts would bring him his deliverance the whole incident was so preposterous that under the burden of his more private affairs he would not consider it seriously but as the morning passed and the chill dark day drew on his anger and anxiety increased upon him to such an extent that he might hardly restrain himself from giving them childish expression in a furious onslaught on the panels of his door he refrained however and listening at the keyhole instead was presently aware of the regular tramp of a sentry in the passage byandby when the footsteps came opposite him he kicked out and hailed hullo there the man stopped quastu he growled ne temporte pas citoyen my temper shouted ned but i shall likely lose my senses if i am left longer without food as to that said the sentryand broke off and retreated in a very little while the key turned once more and a jailer entered with a platter of uninviting scraps take the filth away cried ned furiously thou canst procure me something fit to eat i suppose surely for the paying citizen go then he commissioned the man and then must drag out another halfhour awaiting the fellows reappearance at length the latter returned bearing a basket containing a cold fowl bread and a bottle of red wine now monsieur jaquemart said ned as he tackled the provender how long is permitted to this farce in the playing i do not understand you why a joke is a joke but i would have you go and explain to our pleasant commissary of the section croix blanche that brevity is the soul of wit again i do not understand ned wagged his finger at the man i have submitted to this outrage very patiently but i warn you there will be reprisals byandby that is all one to me wilt thou take a message from me to the commissary he has left the prison these many hours and when to return the jailer shrugged his shoulders perhaps tomorrowat any time or not at all ned jumped to his feet upsetting the basket what he shrieked then in a moment realising the practical fact of his isolationrealising all that was implied by ithe fell upon his agitation and smothered it my friend he said wilt thou convey a letter for me that depends naturally see then he fetched out a pencil tore a square from the white paper that lined his basket of provisionsi write to the citizen vergniauddating my billet prison of la forcethese words i am detained here on a ridiculous charge in the name of sanity come at once and release memurk i put the paper in your hands as i will put a louisdor when you stand before me with the answer the jailers eyes twinkled said he i go off duty after the evening gazette is issued the citizen may depend upon me ned groaned well he said what cant be cured must be endured but the earlier the respite the more generous my acknowledgment he was locked in again the sentry resumed his tramp the little window under the ceiling dusked like a drowsing eyelid presently drugged by utter weariness of brain and nerve he dozed on one of the rickety chairs and woke to the glare of a candle and the presence of his friendly jailer in the room behold my despatch citizen he seized the scrap of paper that bearing his own message and read scribbled on the back of it i fly to the succour of my dear friend the very moment i may quit myself of a little present business of urgency here are thy vails said ned in a tone of glad relief and leave me the candle my friend i shall not need it long up and downup and down the shape of the window under the ceiling became intimate to the desolate character of the room rather than to that segment of the free sky without which it had once appropriated to itself it was like a regard turned inwardsan eye glazing in the trance of selfinquisition and as such it was illustrative of the vision of the tormented soul it imprisoned from light up and down the candle had long guttered and fallen upon itself his only ray of comfort from the outer world came in a stretched thread of lampshine under the door dark night had crept upon him with the screak and thunder of slamming oak and iron and an increased emotion rather than a sense of muffled deep confinement and still the respite delayed and must now delay he was sick to think until the morrow for at last the voices of introspection that all day he had striven yet feared to interpret were become soulaudible sounds in the tenseness of black silence and at last his brain was clearing throwing truth like a precipitate into his heart how in two days had the flood of destiny burst obliterating all his ancient landmarks he was carried down like a dead thing should he drift thenor if not where strand and crawl ashore a fragment of human wreck i clutch and stop myself he thought scramble out lie half blind upon a little island of rest the flood still washes my feet but i will not yield to it then slowly it subsides the old beautiful landmarks reveal themselvessoiled and stained perhaps but they are dear to me and i would not have my retrospect without them he paced wildly to and fro again i have been in the flood what madness has it wrought in me pamela he whispered aloud in great emotionpamela yet his soulthough he believed it steadfast to its allegiance through all the numbing thunder of the race on which it had been bornewas rent by conflicting devils for must not his sympathies at least extend to one who nursed a hopeless passion oh he groaned in his heart if upon my release i could only find her gone on her own initiative out of my life and so to leave you a heritage of everlasting remorse the fiends would cry one moment he would be the brutal tyrant another the slave to his own nature of kindness he was indeed in a pitiable state of indetermination and always marking off the crawling hours that sense of inner foreboding pattered loud or soft like the ticking of a deathwatch pamela and throigne and nicette vanity and vanity and vanity and one love had claimed and one the hell of passion and one he threw himself upon the floor blaspheming hugging himself in the ecstasy of this protracted torment at last completely worn out he fell asleep he awoke having slumbered despite the hardness of his couch far into the morning he could only recollect himself and his circumstances with a mastering effort sitting up he saw his jailer standing by a little table that he had brought into the room what is that for he said the citizens meals meals good god and has not the commissary yet touched his acme of folly has not m vergniaud yet called to effect my release the man shook his head where did you overtake him said ned desperately what was he doing that was so urgent when you delivered to him my note he was conducting the actress simoncandeille to the theatre i heard madame engage him to a ptitsouper when the play was over ned turned away sick at heart then flashed round upon the man again in a fury the beast the philosophic egoist thou must carry him another message from me truly when i can said the jailer it must be when he could in the meantime the distracted captive was faced by the prospect of fresh long hours of cold gloom and anxiety again the morning dawdled on to midday to the desolate turn from noon his lunch was brought in by a stranger turnkey taciturn and unapproachable ned let him go without a commission his agitation could not stomach food at last when about four oclock in the afternoon he was feeling that unless soon relieved he must pay with his reason for that little act of humane interference steps sounded coming hurriedly down the corridor the key turned in the lock the door was flung open and there entered the roomthe young lord pamelas betrothed he was full of quick manliness and pity my dear lord he criedmy dear lord he took neds hand wrung it with hard sympathetic fervour i was with vergniaud and tommy paine last night after your note had been received by the minister it is the vilest piece of official insolence vergniaud will make hell about it i will make hell he was frantically engaged at the time and begged me to represent him in this release of his dear friend a certain lady was deeply concerned this morning to hear about it she would drive me down byandby on the way to her dressmaker i have come the moment i was able have made inquiries learnt the truth procured the release of your servant and given these scoundrels a foretaste of what they are to expect he was amazingly frank and cordial for a moment ned was stupefied from any thought of response he looked into the handsome intelligent face and a dull realisation of his own inefficiency as a suitor possessed him would this romantic fortunatus might have been his fancy have ever committed himself to a situation so ridiculous as this of mine his lordship was of the soldierly type very upright and spruce he wore at his neck a kerchief of the green that was later to bring him into trouble and the unhappy prisoner for a contrast was haggard unshorn unkempthis coat dusted with litter from the floor i cant find words to thank you muttered ned at last faith cried the other cheerily yeve scattered your vocabulary i shouldnt wonder come then to the rogues at the gate and ill help ye out with a loan ned drew back from the proffered grasp no he saidno then he passed his hand before his eyes your lordship must excuse me this suspenseit hath driven me half mad i am just a caged rat flying the instant the spring is raised mistress pamela and my prompt affectionate vergniaud their disinterested consideration for meand yours my lord yoursthey touch me to the quick i have such friendsmadame simoncandeille possibly among the number but i am at the last stage of anxiety and agitation i have no thought for the moment but to escape and alone i beg your lordship to forgive my apparent discourtesy and to let me pass god knows it may be too late even now the other looking very much surprised and offended bowed and drew away as your lordship pleases said he and at that ned without another word his face as stiff as a mask staggered past him hurried out into the corridor sped down it and made unaccosted for the street chapter xviii snow soft dazzling bewildering was again falling in the streets as ned a spectre of desperation hurried along them the city was all one strung movement of flakescloud materialising phantoms blocking the widest and the least avenues of hope the soulless persistency of them numbed his heart blinded his eyes he stumbled as he went feeling like one who in a nightmare frantically strives forward without advancing pamela and throigne and nicette the one on the way to her dressmakers the one buriednaked and buried alive the third he moaned as he struggled onward people passing him looked back with eyes askew in butting heads and grimaced and went on their way with pharisaic selfcongratulations at length uttering a breathing sigh of relief he stood before the door of his lodgings paused a moment mounted the steps and entered instantly he knew before a word had been spoken that he was come upon the something the real presence of the dread that had haunted him so long it was in the atmospherebehind him overhead to one side or the othernever confronting hima ghost sibilant with babble diabolic with tickling laughter he went up the stairs swiftly panicstricken and so softly into his sittingroom it was quiet as death yet a bodiless rustle he could have thought preceded him as he passed into the room beyond all there was neat formal accustomed only a little heap of girls clothes lay on the beda neatly disposed small pile of stuffs and linen with a pair of buckled shoes at the top he gasped as if he had been struck over the heart there was something here so intimate to the story of a pitifully misdirected life the shoes seemed to have taken the shape of the feet that had pursued him so far and at last it seemed so despairingly the linenhe bent and pressed his cheek to it it was fragrantas was everything personal to nicettebut it was cold how long had she been gone he had his wish then she had taken the initiative he was free to nurse his memories unvexed of a regard so misplaced he could raise his head and stand acquitted before his ancient ideals he drooped his head rather he was weak and overwrought the strain upon him during the last three days had been so extreme that perhaps his moral vision was impaired a sound coming from the adjoining room startled him was it she returned he winked down fiercely something that had gathered unaccountably in his eyes cleared his throat and strode forth the landlord theophilusthat was all but the little mans face was smockwhite his curls hung limp his eyeplaces were grey with fear he had closed the door behind him monsieur he whispered my god where hast thou been what is the matter monsieurs young friend has he not heard of her well she is gone i suppose aymon dieu jsusto the guillotine ned fell back there seemed to rise a roaring in his ears hush he saidlisten they are shrieking for her i must go his face was ghastly but the thundering voice sank and ceased and he knew that he had been dreaming what was that you said my thophile he asked with a little insane chuckle over his own fancifulness it was yesterday morning monsieur you had gone out the previous night and had not returned i heard her leave the house after breakfast i looked forth pitiful mother she was clad in the rags of her arrival her feet were bare they budded from the snow the very frosted flowers of a tootrustful spring she stood a moment then went off hlas it was not for me to speak but well said ned in a gripping voice of iron he was himself again but with death at his heart i can speak only from the evidence in the afternoon i looked into the salle de la libert as i sometimes will to hear the cases that were on there was a little excitement about a girl who had been seized that morning in one of the passages of the palais de justice with a long knife in her hand she had made no secret of the fact that it was her intention to assassinate one or other of the judges as they came forth at midday she was brought in for trial while i was there i swearmy god monsieur i swear i had no shadowy thought of the truth it was monsieurs young friend i shrank into an angle of the court in agony lest she should see and endeavour to implicate me thou needst not have feared i thinkthou needst not have feared monsieur she made no defence vive la tyrannie she cried i love the aristocrats ah praise to heaven monsieur that she put it in the plural i would sooner be spurned by one she said than exalted by an upstart chicaneur that was a stroke at the public accuser maybe thou shalt be exalted nevertheless said he to a prominent place and which of us was it lover of aristocrats that thou designdst to murder what needs to specify she cried when one wants to die any poisonous snake will serve for one to handle a little terrible groan broke from the listener monsieurmonsieur cried thophile in emotion but they condemned herthey condemned her oh the poor child and she revealed nothing refused to answer any questions as to her associates her place of abode her manner of life today she was to be taken to the scaffold if she has kept silence we are safe ned looked upon the speaker with a shocking expression if she has kept silence he muttered monsieur said the little man the tears were trickling down his lean cheeks the carts passed but ten minutes ago i hurried forth and ran till i could get glimpse of them down a sidestreet she was there she sat with her arms bound looking up and smiling and the snow fell upon her blue eyes like feathers from the wings of the angels that fluttered overhead awaiting her he uttered a little cry staggered recovered himself and clutched feebly at the figure that drove by him monsieur it is too lateit is useless in gods name do nothing to compromise usmonsieur he followed sobbing and piping down the stairs the rush passed from him the door slammed back in his face mon dieu he wailed to himself he will ruin all ned tore upon his way to seeto gain speech with her if only at the foot of the scaffoldoh merciful christ not so to make this agony everlasting he sobbed and panted as he ran you didnt kill him you didnt kill him he kept crying it as if he thought his hurrying voice might reach her before ever his feet could cover the distance once he pictured herthe soft sinning child that had whispered to him kissing his hand that night in the hot still secrecy of the roomunder the hands of the callous ruffian who had spoken with him from the guillotine and his wild prayers swung into frightful blasphemies some of the few he met in his headlong rush shrunk from him leaving him the road others who appeared likely to obstruct his passage he cursed as he fled by they were all ghosts to him glimmering impalpableflashing past in a white foam of flakes at length he broke into the place of the guillotine and without pausing in his mad race beat the snow from his eyesand saw here at least by reason of the bitter cold was no galaday and the crowd stood not so thick about the scaffold but that he might charge into and penetrate it he had reached at lastso his whirling brain interpreted itthe very congress of all the spectres that had haunted him of late the silent dull air was thick with silent threadsbusy stitches in a shroud whose hem was the enceinte of the city here a silent white pack stood looking up at a white yoke there was no terror in all the scene save where on the platform itself the boots of the executioners slipped in a red thaw then in a moment he was aware of her she rose from the cloud of white shapesherself a statue of whitenesspure at lastand other white shapes stooped and lifted her he burst through the intervening whitenesstore his way into the shroud nicette he screamed she struggled free for an instantturned looked down and saw him through the rain of flakes the rapture of a deathless passion was revealed to him the next moment she was fallen prostrate a whirring silvery wing swooped upon her she seemed to break in half like a woman of snow the end transcribers notes the dodd mead co edition was consulted for many of the following

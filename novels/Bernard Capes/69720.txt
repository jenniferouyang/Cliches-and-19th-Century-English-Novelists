xvii chapter xviii moll davis chapter i somewhere about the western angle now formed by the junction of oxford street and the charing cross road there stood in the year the mischief inn it was a substantial building consisting of two gabled sections divided by a third and wider having a pent roof and forming with the others a deep recess in whose ground quarters was plentiful accommodation for the stabling of horses at the level of the first story ran a railed wooden balcony common to all the bedrooms behind and in the yard below were rough benches and trestle tables disposed about where customers might forgather to discuss over their pipes and purl such topics as went seasonably with them it might be his popular majestys latest roguery or old mobs almost as great a thief and favourite the mischief standing as it did on the great highway running east and west formed a convenient terminus for travellers journeying from the contiguous wilds of berkshire and wiltshire the majority of whom for reasons of economy came by waggon this was a vast road craft with a tilt and tyres to its wheels a foot wide whose consistent record of progress never exceeded three miles to the hour it was drawn commonly by six sturdy roadsters in double harness and bearing yokes with swinging bells at the hames of their collars and time was never of the essence of its contract but it was safe if slow being well prepared and armed against surprises which were by no means of infrequent occurrence by the days long way especially as london was approached oxford street itself indeed bore a villainous reputation it stretched somewhat on the borders of the town with wild and wooded country going northwards from it and was handy therefore to the gentry whose profession it was to cut purses from the skirts of civilization latterly its heterogeneous domiciles had shown a tendency to increase and multiply and by adding to their number on either side the way to extend the boundaries of the comparative security which obtained about the central regions of westminster and whitehall but it was still a perilous district the very expression and moral of which appeared epitomized in the sign which swung on a high gallows beside a wooden water trough before the front of our inn and which depicted a poor unhappy citizen bearing upon his suffering shoulders a drunken scold in the neighbourhood of the building clustered like disreputable relations a knot of tenements which included a pawnbrokers and a gin shop and southwards from it zigzagged a muddy bridle way known appropriately as hog lane which traversing a motley course half town half rookery debouched finally upon the village of charing where in an open place stood the monument with its gilt cross so approximately appeared this particle of our london in the year following that of the kings graces restoration ad it is easier to explain a frog of to day out of a pliocene leviathan than it is to trace the growth of a huge metropolis from such paltry beginnings the tendency of nature is to reduce from the unwieldy to the workable while that of man is to magnify his productions out of all proportion with the simple necessities they are wanted to supply that is why towns increase while animals grow smaller the yard of the mischief inn was fairly crowded on that particular june morning which witnessed the encounter between its landlord and mrs moll davis this young lady had come to town out of wiltshire by waggon some fortnight or more earlier and putting up at the inn had succeeded already in outstaying a welcome which was wont to be continued to such angels only as came franked with a sufficiency of their golden namesakes in short mrs davis could not or would not pay her score and since she failed to quit the landlord and he declined to release her without settlement a state of deadlock had arisen between them which seemed to promise no conclusion but through the better ability of one or the other to throw its adversary in a wrestle of wit a contest in which the lady at least need expect no law and it was at this juncture that mr george hamilton appeared upon the scene he was a very agreeable young gentleman of cavalier rank debonair and smart to foppery which as yet however stopped short of the extravagance which later came to characterize it he wore his own long chestnut hair and a lingering tone of sobriety marked his dress the times in fact had not quite pulled free their damasked wings from the puritan case which had enclosed them though certain foreshadowed iridescences gave promise of the splendour to come and moreover the gentleman had ridden in that morning from the country and had been in no mind to stake his sweetest trappings against the habitual quagmires of oxford street he dismounted at the mischief for his morning draught and giving his horse to hold to his servant sat down at a table in the yard and hammered for the drawer george was a bold youth of his inches which were sufficient but quite immoral and unscrupulous he fitted amiably into his age which expected nothing better of a man than good company that he supplied and could have supplied in purer brand if good fellowship had been its inevitable corollary but there he lacked generally he wished no man good but where he saw his own profit of the sentiment and he could be an inhuman friend he had regular rather full features and a rolling brown eye which took in much that had been kindlier left unobserved and like most of his order he was infernally pugnacious while his ale was bringing he sat one arm akimbo the other crossed on his knee conning as if they were cattle the group about him and humming an abstracted tune there was no one who interested him much or who touched a note of originality in all the commonplace crowd which surrounded him grooms carters local traders a seedy rakehell or two a lowering anabaptist sipping his ale with a toast in it and furtively conscious the while of the scrutiny of a yellow trained band captain lolling by the tap door a prowling pitcher bawd lean red eyed and hugging his famine as he ogled about for custom one and all they conformed to type and presented nothing beyond it worth considering george felt quarrelsome over the matter as if he had been defrauded of a legitimate expectation true mankind in its ordinary habits and conversation could hardly be looked to at the best for more than diluted epigram yet there should be a limit to the insipidity of things and he felt it almost his duty to insist upon the fact possibly his brain was a little fevered from last nights debauch the seedy mohawks were his nearest neighbours said one to his fellow in the words of banquos murderer it will be rain to night hamilton turned on him who says so clout sir exclaimed the young man startled aback i say who says so i say so then a pox on your profanity are you to arrogate to yourself the almightys prerogatives it shall rain or not as the lord decrees hallelujah young sir boomed the anabaptist do you say it will not rain demanded george addressing him nay answered the fifth monarchist but i trust it will not then you are as bad as the other said george since you are as ready to lament the almightys dispensations he snapped again on the luckless first speaker i am a man of submission for my part and content to accept whatever comes even if it be a fool to spit himself on my rapier point ill take you on that question of your damned divinity the landlord came up at the moment bringing his drink and simultaneously there appeared on the balcony above the figure of a young girl a certain hush had fallen on the crowd expectant of a fracas zoons said boniface sourly well have no talk of swords by your leave no swords my lord none this is no hedge tavern we want no fire eaters here weve a reputation to maintain he was a gross club fisted man with a sooty underlip it needed such to keep a grip on the sort of company he dealt with a reputation for mischief by the token said hamilton derisively or you fly false colours the landlord grumbled violently no steel by god i say im master here he was already out of temper and glancing up found a timely butt for his wrath in the figure on the balcony with an exclamation of fury he heaved his shoulders through the mob until he came under here you he roared who let your ladyship out of duress she nodded and smiled down a hairpin she said i managed to pick the lock with it she was young almost a child with blue eyes laughing in a saucy face from under a black whimple set coquettishly on her head and garnished with a sprig of rosemary filched from the kitchen hung thick brown curls over dolly pink cheeks a deep falling collar quite plain was set about her slender throat and loosely knotted into it was a tasselled cord an underskirt of stone blue and an upper one of brown bunched at the tail into a little pannier completed a very attractive picture hamilton his attention drawn to it sat up interested and mollified at once then cried the landlord with an oath or two youll een return whence you came or ill bring the law on you for house breaking bing awast back you go to your chamber bobtail the lady nodded again pursing cherry lips and prompt the answer came from them ill see you damned first the crowd bawled with laughter but the landlord purple in the face turned to storm the heights by way of a flight of steps which gave access to the balcony from the yard corner before he had well started however hamiltons voice stayed him hold vintner steel or no steel i take up this quarrel he had risen and now advanced to the scene of action the press giving way to him his air his obvious rank no less than his hint of a dangerous temper were his sufficient passports not only with the company but to the landlords better consideration the man scowled and muttered but he stood halted hamilton blew a kiss to the rosy nymph before he turned on her persecutor duress house breaking quoth he what terms are these to hold an angel fast tell us her crime bluffer angel responded the landlord deeply aye a pretty angel to cully a poor innkeeper out of his dues look you here master you that are so righteous will you pay your angel her shot she owes you board and lodging aye she does seven days and more george looked up at the balcony is that true child the girl had already produced a little handkerchief which she now dabbed to her eyes her breath catching very touchingly sure i would find the money if i could she said he might give me credit for my good intentions ill give you credit for nothing roared the landlord god amighty shell be asking for a cash advance on her good intentions next george hushed him down whence do you hail child he said and whither make she whimpered im but a poor maid out of wiltshire kind sir and tis a husband i seek a husband quoth he alack that im none myself to accommodate your need but if a bachelor might serve the crowd hooted again pay her shot captain and hold her hostage for it shall i said hamilton he addressed the childish countenance above observing for the first time the tiniest of patches placed under the corner of its baby mouth that gave him some sniggering thought it seemed to suggest the footlight chloe rather than the genuine article moreover the baggage appeared for all her seeming innocence quite self possessed he wondered what do you say child he demanded she had fallen back a little using her handkerchief now she started as if conscious of some question and leaned forward again was it the gentleman with the plum pudding eye that spoke she said a clap of new laughter greeted the seeming artless sally george cachinnated with the rest but in a mortified fashion yes says he and a very sweet simile my dear he turned to the landlord what is she vintner god knows answered the man morosely a strolling play actress like as not shes no good whatever she is no good is a better woman than you you radish cried the girl thats certain said hamilton you are answered bluffer answered said the man aye i know her trust her young tongue to answer though you provoked it in the middle of a song song does she sing does she not like the wicked young syrup she is sings like a kettle the lady laughed and best when in hot water shall i sing to you now sing for your supper like master tom tucker said the cavalier yes sing by all means only come down to do it ill go bail for her he assured the landlord the man grumbled but submitted and george beckoned the nymph descend said he and give us of your quality you shall not lose by it she nodded disappeared for a moment and returning with a lute ran to the stairs descended to the yard and stood among the company confident and unabashed and straight and readily she touched the strings with slender fingers seeming oddly native to that tuneful contact and sang the little song which afterwards came to be the most associated with her naughty name my lodging is on the cold ground and hard very hard is my fare but that which grieves me more is the coldness of my dear oh turn love i prythee love turn to me for thou art the only one love that art adord by me ill twine thee a garland of straw love ill marry thee with a rush ring my frozen hopes will thaw love and merrily we will sing then turn to me my own love i prythee love turn to me for thou art the only one love that art adord by me there was silence as she ended for indeed the childs voice was of the sweetest as full and natural as a birds and then came a round of applause hamilton hushed it rather angrily would ye slam down the lid of the virginal while the last notes still ring in it he said unfeeling dolts sweet music touched him perhaps it was the only gentleness that could it wrought a glamour which willy nilly fooled his better reason it did so now conscious as he was of his own enthralment here was no longer a child adventuress but a plaintive innocent melodiously sorrowing in natures very voice he was never a giver in the disinterested sense now the song decided a point on which he had hitherto wavered he turned impulsively to the landlord what is her debt said he i discharge it thirty shillings and a groat answered the other promptly knock off the groat said hamilton for your contribution what man who calls the tune must pay the piper he would hear no remonstrances but waved the innkeeper away come aside with me he said to the girl and very willingly it seemed she obeyed he led her to a table apart where he sat her down himself facing her and there was none of the company rash enough to question by so much as a snigger that implied claim to privacy in a public place most dispersed about their business while the few who remained gave the couple a respectfully wide berth now said hamilton who are you pretty one a poor deserted wife kind sir she answered as ever wedded a villain a wife you baby please i was married in long clothes said she and who taught you that song grief she said and mr bedding your husband o no says she there was no bedding with him he conned her shrewdly he was already beginning to recover himself and to suspect a hussy under this rose why not he said he was that jealous she answered if the moon looked in at the window he would accuse me of making eyes at the man in her that was in wiltshire where our home was sure and so you left him mr bedding came by and took me to sing for him but a strolling company was never to my taste so you left it and came to town i went home again to your husband no he was gone gone he had taken umbrage as they call it he was always one to mind a little thing and offd with it to jericho leaving me nothing but his curse not so much as a sixpence beside and so you followed him to jericho not i i followed my own inclinations and they brought me here well inclinations spend more than they hoard as a rule havent you found it so sure ive no need to hoard when kind gentlemen pay my bills for me thats as it may be mrs by the by what is your name mary davis by your leave kind sir but my intimates call me moll please what is yours george hamilton moll thats a good name george are you of the kings court ive been there i do so long to see the king a dear kind gentleman they call him in our parts the father of his people is he well of quite a number of them why do you want to see the king only o just to see him george wagged a finger at the artless young baggage o ho mrs mollinda says he does the wind lie that way you have begun early true enough and youll not fail for lack of confidence in your pretty wits but its a long climb from the cradle to the four poster he laughed upon my word the babys assurance and by way of such obstacles she turned pained troubled eyes on the scoffer making as if to rise what have i said in my innocence nothing at all says he your innocence never spoke a word but by god your looks are voluble i faith youre the sweetest darling mrs moll and for that ill be your friend if you will as a decent young gentleman should what would you have me do find your husband for you alack is that to be my friend the best maybe but by and by who knows he may come to serve us with royalty yet do you trust me moll sure a poor girl like me must live on trust so she must and live very well too did that rogue of a landlord really keep you fast on my honour he did dont swear by false idols what have i said now that he put you on your honour no that he did not my honours not for such as him no indeed it flies at higher game well he must keep you still for a while not he he must i say you must bide here till i can arrange of your fortunes im but by the road and will come again anon never fear ill see you well provided but you must lie close for the moment if you would have my help in what to see the king of course she clapped her little hands in artless glee shall i see the king see him and sing to him perhaps in the meantime youre mine to dispose of is it a bargain he rose and she with him her expression downcast and demure thats well said he give me a buss mrs moll in token of our understanding he bent over the table pulled her to him and set his lips under the dangling curls then being released she ran with a face of fire to the steps and ascending them to the accompaniment of an irrepressible guffaw or so from the spectators paused a moment on the balcony above hearing a jackass bray in the stables what an echo there is in this place says she to the heads below when you gentlemen all laugh together and whisked into her room hamilton in the meantime going to arrange terms with the landlord grinned agreeably to his own thoughts the chit had neither imposed on him nor comely limb though she was disorganized his emotions indeed being deeply engaged at the moment to an intrigue which absorbed his most passionate energies he had no appetite for supplementary complications still beauty was beauty and to invest in it with whatever view to ultimate profit of one sort or the other was never a bad principle he had no conception at present of any use to which to put these covetable goods which good fortune had committed to his hands but that he could find a use for them and one that should be personally gainful he never had a doubt the only necessity was promptitude he had seen enough to know that his hold on the skit was to be measured by just the length and elasticity of the tether by which he might strive to keep her under his nominal control and that tether must be provided shortly or she would scamper free of her own accord but he was a man of distinguished resourcefulness in such matters and he never questioned his own ability to convert this capture somehow to a profitable end and in the meanwhile the girl was well disposed where no prowling town bull might come by her to steal a march on him indeed to make assurance double sure he hinted to the landlord of a favour contingent on his holding himself responsible as heretofore for the safe custody of his guest with a suggestion that locks which yielded themselves to the insidious manipulations of hairpins were better supplemented by stouter defences and having satisfied himself as to that he departed chapter ii in a fine panelled room which gave through two large windows upon the privy gardens of whitehall palace a lady and a gentleman were seated as far apart as the limits of the chamber would permit she in her place worked at a sampler or affected to work and he in his read in a book or affected to read the room was such as with the best will in the world we cannot lacking its appropriate human furniture preserve or reproduce in these days without vital loss to its character we may possess the sombre panels the rich hued pictures with their gilded frames sufficiently illuminating the austerity the venetian glass girandoles reflecting in the polished floor below as in water their starry opalescences we may have or acquire the brass studded or the stamped leather or the screw railed chairs the elaborately carved or the gate legged tables the priceless persian rugs which by the by are but an early fashion resumed the gilt caskets and the silvered mirrors we can not unless to bring great ridicule upon ourselves wear the long lovelocks down our cheeks or the silk favours at our shoulders or the jewelled cravats and beribboned hose and breeches without which all the rest must figure but as an anachronism a discordance an elgin marble ravished from its parthenon and lined up for show in a glass roofed museum that we do try to reconcile the irreconcilable in these matters using early english cradles as receptacles for our faggots and hanging up our silk hats in antique ambries is due to the fact that we have lost the art or the instinct for decorative appropriateness in those remote but less original days the same mind that conceived the idol adorned its shrine but if fashions in dress change and change there was never in all history but one fashion in human moods and tempers those whether figured in love hate desire or jealousy have been worn since the fall to the single unchangeable pattern which wrought and accompanied it one could not in fact from the fashion of their minds have distinguished these two seated apart from any ill assorted married couple of to day and yet they had been wedded earl and countess not so many months but that their differences might have less divorced them that those amounted to what they did was entirely the fault of the husband who had chosen deliberately to provoke an estrangement in perverse spite of a certain felt premonition that his villainy was about to recoil on his own head he really was a villain this lord chesterfield if only in one essential a greater than most of the young fire eating profligates of his time that he had fought several duels and killed his man in one at least of them was nothing out of the common that he had formed a number of loose attachments with petticoats of sorts was only to be expected of a gentleman of his rank and fortune but that he had wedded with his young countess on such terms of opportunism and self interest as were a disgrace to himself and an outrage to her there was the unpardonable sin he had wantonly insulted her jealousy to be rent and mangled by the yellow demon in his turn would serve him excellently right the long and the short of the situation is explained in a few words a certain mrs palmer who had secured the kings favour to that extent that letters patent to the earldom of castlemaine were already in process of being prepared for her husband had not failed to qualify herself before her exaltation it was said for the sort of business which had procured it and prominent among her admirers had been named his lordship of chesterfield philip stanhope this mature young gentleman some twenty eight years of age at the time of which we write had in consequence found himself a person somewhat suspect and ill considered in the royal regard and being very willing in his own interests to propitiate his master by disavowing the least thought of rivalry with him in the matter of the ladys favour had as the surest proof of his sincerity paid forthwith his ardent devoirs to a daughter of the duke of ormonde a young lady conventually bred of the sweetest looks and innocence in brief his suit had sped so well with this darling that their union had not been long in following the days of fervid courtship when having secured his object the perfidious creature dropped his mask and gave his young wife indirectly but very plainly to understand that his passion for her had been a pretence that a former idol was by no means dethroned in his heart and that he had no longer personal use for the affection which he had been at the pains to excite for no other purpose than to throw dust in the eyes of a certain distinguished individual he had not of course said this in so many words but he had let his manner his neglect his indifference imply what amounted to a confession of it in a fashion which was unmistakable and which no woman however unsophisticated could misread and not one in ten thousand fail to resent the young countess resented it naturally she resented it i am not going so far as to say as one in her situation might resent it at this day but she resented it conformably to the different standard of morals which prevailed in her own and which did not leave even a delicately bred ingnue in complete illusionment as to the conduct of men in general and husbands in particular she had lived for a year moreover within echo of the scandals at whitehall where her father as lord high steward held a prominent position and enough may have filtered through to her ears therefrom to correct any extravagant notions she might once have formed as to the ideality of the married state still and when all is said the fine depths of her nature found themselves grievously outraged in this application of a common rule to her particular case while being a girl of spirit as well as sense the desire to retaliate in form on such perfidy awoke in her bosom a passion dangerous to its young security it was not enough she felt to retort on coldness with coldness she must teach this scorner of her affections the estimate placed by others on a possession of which he did not appear to realize the value and by opening his eyes through a sense of loss make him suffer helplessly and in excess those very pangs of jealousy with which he had wantonly inflicted her a perilous policy but one actuated at least in its inception by the most righteous of motives the bee that stings deep however too often destroys itself in the loss of its own weapon and so it may be with offended chastity this young countess seeking about for an instrument with which to achieve her purpose came near to her downfall in the choice which opportunity not to speak of kinship imposed on her mr george hamilton her cousin german was its name now see her as she sits affecting to work with an occasional glance askance half derisive half wistful at her husbands pretended preoccupation and admit that she is proposing to herself a very risky course in thus feigning to lease her charms to a tenant so unscrupulous as master george the young wit of her the natural delicacy warring with passion the emotions engendered of such a combat and all housed in a form as pretty as that of a dresden shepherdess as pink and white as endearing in its childish bloom what could these all be but so many provocations to a man of hamiltons antecedents to play by diverting to his own advantage the sensibilities so fondly entrusted to his sympathy the part of machiavellian seducer he never hesitated as a fact but started at once to sort the hand which fortune had so gratuitously thrust upon him it was his good luck at the outset that his cousinship aided and abetted by his close intimacy with the earl gave him the entre at all times into those quarters at whitehall which chesterfield enjoyed in right of his position as groom of the stole to her majesty but like the practised intrigant that he was he used his privilege with discretion he was really to do him justice very enamoured of the lady and according to his code free of all moral responsibility in seeking to make a cuckold of a man who though he was his personal friend and confidant had chosen deliberately to invite such reprisals on the part of a faith he had grossly abused at the same time he did not under estimate the delicacy of his task or the strength of the instinctive prejudices he had to overcome though sure enough such obstacles but added a zest to the pursuit what as yet he did not guess was that his own eyes were not alone nor even the most compelling in having discovered and marked down for capture a tender prey which circumstances seemed to have made quite peculiarly attainable in short his majestys brother the duke of york was already suspected of a leaning in the same direction poor little abused countess but perhaps it would be better not to pity her prematurely she threw down her work on a sudden uncontrollable impulse and rising to her feet looked across at the insensible bear opposite some emotion of love and forbearance was working it seemed in her she hesitated an instant gazing with full eyes the knuckles of her little right hand held to her lips then hurried across the room and addressed her husband cannot we be friends philip before it is too late he did not even stir but just raised his lids indolently and offensively he was to do him justice a personable man as to his upper half with a fine head of mouse coloured hair and a ready brain under it but irresolution spoke in his legs which were weedy and so inasmuch as the strength of a rope is its weakest part affected the stability of the entire structure physical and moral he was in fact a waverer and unreliable overbearing to others because uncertain of himself much subject to moods and passions and always as is the case with those whose vanity is up in arms at the least suspicion of criticism more disposed to force his way by rudeness than to win it by consideration but he was skilled with his sword and that in a quarrelsome age procured him a better title to respect than a hundred courtesies would have done too late for what he drawled languidly she made a little gesture of helplessness then rallied to her task is this she said the natural fruit of the love you expressed for me before before i became your wife when you talk of nature madam he answered stirring and yawning then relapsing into his apathetic attitude you forget that with her a single season covers the whole contract of matrimony then is our season ended you are lady chesterfield he said is not that sufficient answer i want no wifehood without love philip has so little of me proved so much he shrugged in a way which might have meant anything or nothing she went on or did you woo me under false pretences from the first making me as i more than suspect merely your unconscious stalking horse to the kings favour he laughed but a little uneasily you get these fancies into your head he said i do she answered but they come i think to stay they are not like your fancies for this woman or the other that can be put off or on to suit your worldly convenience the king has claimed one of your fancies has he not my lord a wedded woman too barbara palmer by name that was a shameful thing for both of you but most shameful for the man who could deceive an innocent maid to curry favour with his sovereign did you not marry me to show him your heart was wholly divorced from that earlier idol he drew in his breath with an oath by god madam this is too much it is too much indeed she said and then suddenly she held out entreating hands her eyes brimming philip i could forgive you that even that it was before you knew me if only you would be to me again what you seemed will you philip if any suspicion of my learning and resenting the truth has caused this coldness in you keeping you aloof in your pride o forget it i am not exacting i know what men must be say only that you hold me in your true heart above that that woman and i will pardon you everything philip before it is too late he started furiously to his feet flinging the book in his hand away from him pardon too late that threat again zounds madam you presume i neither guess nor heed your meaning i cherish an image do i very well i cherish it as to yourself you are distasteful to me for what reason simply because you are you no other in the world i assure you and if that is not enough he stopped checked in the midst of his wrath by the look in the eyes before him it was not submission or fright it was the spark of a new amazed dawn that he had said the thing he could never recall occurred to him suddenly with an odd sick qualm he tried to recover the thread of his discourse but only to have it tail off into inarticulate stammerings enough she said in a low voice o truly and to spare distasteful am i that to you why so are all sweets to the carrion loving dog well i am well content to have your loathing sir will you please be gone there is nothing noisome here to tempt your palate distasteful she took a step forward a single one and his eyes flickered he thought perhaps she was going to strike him now listen to this she said i will never before god utter word to you again till you have gone down on your knees to me and asked my pardon for that insult she turned her shoulder on him and walked apart he watched her lowering and forced a laugh he meant for one of mockery silence between us he said be assured i make a second madam in that welcome compact he sat down again and picking up his book affected to become absorbed in it but all the time his pulses were thumping and his eyes furtively conning the rebel over the leaf edges a spot of bright colour was on her cheek she trilled a little air as she seated herself in her former position as naturally and light heartedly as if she had never a trouble in the world damn her he thought to take the upper hand of me like that his fury heaved and fermented in him like yeast in a dough pan he sneered at her pretence of cheerful abstraction she is thinking of me he reflected as i am of her he tried to escape her image to get genuinely interested in his book but his indignation and something else that qualmish something would always come between to be faced and flouted by this bantling adjudged and sentenced of her furious young disdain it was intolerable not to be endured a dozen times he twitched on the verge of an explosion and a dozen times with an ever diminishing heat restrained himself it was true enough he thought as his fume evaporated that he had not condescended to tact in his repulse of her diplomatically at least he should have been more tender of her feelings have attained his end more surely without brutality she had some reason for her resentment and he must admit she had looked well in expressing it a clear conscience burned with a clear fire and there was something cleanly piquant in the warmth it emitted it gave his arid veins a new sensation comparing those immature lines with the fuller which had hitherto besotted his fancy he found a curious interest in studying them it was like extracting a fresh slender white kernel from its grosser husk a sweet and rather tasty discovery had his eyes been at fault and his palate infatuation perhaps had blinded the one and cloyed the other well he might come yet to humour this situation even to atone in some measure for the unkindness of which he had been guilty but not at once she must be taught her little lesson before he could afford to unbend she was really a pretty child when all was said and done a brunette with large blue eyes appealing and alluring and a complexion like china roses the rest did he choose to will it should come to ripen in the sun of love like a peach hung on a wall there was a thrill in the sense of that power possessed and withheld with a sigh that was half a new rapture he turned resolutely to his reading and at that moment mr george hamilton was announced he entered gaily looking the pink of health and comeliness and nodding a cheery greeting to my lord his friend went to the lady like one full confident of his privileged position good morrow cousin quoth he she dropped her hands with her work into her lap and leaning forward looked up into his face with a smile you are welcome cousin she answered i was bored i faith he just glanced at the husband and laughed in such company kate she raised innocent brows what company my own do you mean there is none other here but sticks and stocks well say i meant your own can that bore you o faith it can o faith then youre hard to please tis proof im not for your saying so pleases me lord what a novelty to hear a compliment he conned her with a puzzled air then took the piece of work from her hands and stood quizzing it what is this he asked a sampler she answered have you never seen one before not in your hands it has been in my hands nevertheless for o god i dont know fifty years belike i began it when i was a little girl and time goes slowly in these days she jumped to her feet and stood at his shoulder pointing out the figures of the design do you see heres what i noted most put down as in a commonplace book people and texts and even animals including a number of my friends am i not a lely in portraiture cousin heres my dear nurse and here my governess to the life to the knife she looks rather whos this your father of course stupid do you put in none but those you favour o no here and there is one distasteful was this a favourite cat she pouted no sir a dog and heres your husband no another dog hm you can get a likeness indeed my lord slamming down his book somewhat violently got to his feet with a haste which seemed to belie the leisureliness of the stretch and yawn which followed am i not to have my place among the favoured says hamilton would you like it questioned the artful rogue i should be hard put tot to portray so perfect a gentleman they have not come my way of late what hath happened to your brooch cousin stay while i refasten it for you he lifted his chin obediently while she manipulated with deft slender fingers the jewel at his cravat my lord with a quick loud clearing of his throat started and came across the room what george said he i vow i was so lost in what i read i hardly noted you whats wrong with your cravat hamilton his head still tilted responded brusquely but nosily its chokid be thats all her little ladyship laughed ill be done in a moment poor man zounds blustered her husband here let me fasten it she ignored him altogether how sweet you smell cousin she said is it kissing comfits thats for sweet lips to answer gurgled hamilton my lord in a vicious spasm gripped the little wrist and wrenched it from its task hamilton cried damnation and my lady putting the wounded limb to her mouth looked up at him with wide appealing eyes some beast has hurt me she said take care of yourself cousin while i go and bathe it half crying she turned away and ran from the room the moment she was gone the two men bristled upon one another my lord opening with a snarl there are limits sir to my forbearance the first ive known of them was the sharp response whats that why what i say my wife is she your wife one would never guess it from the way you treat her my wife i say well take her word fort not yours do you quarrel with me george i faith im her kinsman phil you take the privileges of one better i than another for your sins my lord gulped as if he were taking a pill then forced a propitiatory smile why i confess i have sinned george and you mean me well no doubt but ill be damned if ill be lessoned even by a cousin then learn from a less scrupulous quarter therell be plenty to gather the fruit you let hang over the wall he was going but the other stopped him hurriedly whats that no tarry awhile george zounds man cant you see my state he was so suddenly solicitous so eager in his entreaty that hamilton paused in wonder and turned to face him why said he let me look at you i believe anno mirabile i do believe youre jealous philip stanhope jealous and of his wife chesterfield chuckled foolishly what are the symptoms yellow sir yellow a very jaundice of the eye why what hath happened between yesterday and to day nothing i tell you or perhaps everything is she so much admired is kate can you ask who have eyes and senses i think ive been at fault tell her so then why thats the devil ot were not on speaking terms hamilton sneered so its come to a head with her and who but a blind dullard would ever have failed to foresee that end yet with one so gracious it must have needed a foul provocation to drive her to such extremes what may i ask was the deciding insult ill be frank i told her she was distasteful to me hamilton threw up his hands ye gods and he can talk of speaking terms be thankful if she ever looks at you again his lordship winced not she hath sweet eyes too i own i spoke in temper and said a silly thing silly have you never heard of a woman scorned youve lost her before youve found her no no i trust you george damn it man i trust you i know you are my friend tell me what shall i do to reconcile you aye too sudden an exodus this turn tail i advise and get back to your flesh pots carrion she called it and me a dog the savour sticks somehow i cant go back to carrion let the king enjoy his own for me im content with mine she your own any mans rather after that dont say so george he put a twitching hand on hamiltons sleeve he seemed quite transformed in these few minutes smitten out of the blue and under that rankling wound lusting for what he had despised there are those who tyrannous to loves submission fall slaves to loves disdain here was one who expelled from paradise found himself as it were naked and ashamed id concede something he said to be on terms with her again not all her condition curse it but something substantial what was her condition she swore shed never speak word to me again till id gone on my knees to her to ask her pardon that was before youd hurt her physically shell want more now what more likely a separation ill not grant it shell take it her own way never fear what way why the way of all provoked wives you should know chesterfield broke from him and taking half a dozen agitated steps wheeled and returned to the charge let her then and be damned to her and yet that carrion george theres something in purity how do you know i wouldnt be the cause of her committing herself that would be a foul return for her trust youre very virtuous and considerate of a sudden i must go some lengths to save her go on your knees do you mean would she forgive me if i did she might pretend to just to quiet your suspicions curse you for a comfortless friend he went off again and again wheeled and flung back zounds man cant you see what is the case with me a case of love at first sight it seems to me i believe on my honour youre right you do so youve never looked at your wife till now not with these eyes well on my word im sorry for you why why are you sorry late comers to the feast you know must be content with bones he laughed provokingly my lords jaw seemed to drop youve no reason to suspect her he demanded none whatever then why hark ye phil i know my young cousin and i know women shes bound in self respect to refute your outrageous calumny by offering herself to be tasted elsewhere a pox on my peevish tongue dont say ive gone too far for hope george well say at least for simple remedies what desperate ones then in gods name hamilton considered frowning heavily while the other hung feverishly on his verdict the young man was in truth in a quandary everything hitherto had been favouring his purposed intrigue the husbands indifference the wifes grievance and her natural affection for him her cousin that under the circumstances had been easily manuvred into a warmer feeling he had his sympathy with her neglected state for a leading asset he had calculated upon chesterfields consistent callousness and blindness now this sudden and unexpected revulsion of feeling on the noblemans part had upset all his designs a reconciliation between the couple was the last thing in the world he desired to bring about his interests lay rather in widening the breach to effect the latter while appearing to assist the former must be from this time his insidious policy he cudgelled his brains for inspiration and suddenly he looked up theres only one remedy i can think of he said no other amends you could make would be adequate to the offence you might go down on your knees to her and she would forgive and despise you you might kiss and be friends and she would smile and turn away to wipe her lips no self abasement could atone for such an insult but it would rather wake in her disgust for one so poor in spirit that he dared not back his own slander yet what she would never yield despite pretence to recantation and apology she might to jealousy jealousy distasteful phil think of that you called her distasteful and so to see you dally with some fruit more to your liking what a madness then would be hers to oust the interloper to seize her place to convince you of the lovelier flavour of that you had insulted and rejected be bold and dare it force her into taking the initiative in this game of passion and youll win her yet whole and unsullied so spake the wily serpent his eyes furtive looking to confirm the breach while feigning a way to close it my lord stared before him glum and unconvinced tis a cursed risk he said what if it should fail then everything would fail the gods themselves are subject to fate and fate is jealousy if jealousy cannot work the oracle then nothing can it would be simpler to enforce her much and to drive her straightway upon other consolation but do as you will it is your concern and if we differ as to the means no no keep your temper george damn it man keep your temper i believe you may be right after all he stood glowering and biting his nails what fruit to dally with what pretty gull he said you dont say and it would have to be before her face i presume a laugh timely converted into a cough gurgled in hamiltons throat here was the way opened to the working of a certain dare devil scheme which had already flashed upon him in outline while he meditated with hardly a thought he jumped to it as to that he said soberly by the happiest of chances the means are offered you and immediately by kate herself she has a young friend about to visit her as she tells me a mrs moll davis some pretty tomrig from the country and what could better serve your purpose than she kates own friend why tis a very providence chesterfield grinned sourly i must see her first a lackey entered at the moment bringing a summons from the queen my lord was wanted by her majesty and he might curse and pish but he had to obey he sniggered round as he made for the door more of this anon dont go till i return jealousy it is george jealousy phil hamilton waved his hand and turned as the door shut on the departing figure then with his fingers at his chin and a grin on his face he stood to consider the game to which he had committed himself chapter iii men of pleasure and of roguery to boot were not in king charless time much concerned as a rule over the logical consequences of their pranks they took the day improvidently like the grasshopper nicked the glad moments as they passed and gave little thought to the reckonings of the morrow the unities in any comedy they enacted were of less moment to them than the general spirit of frolic and so long as the situations afforded entertainment they bestowed small thought on the dnouement in the making or the marring of an intrigue the fun was in the process and they seldom looked beyond to count the costs so when hamilton conceived his plot he had not one must understand foreseen any definite conclusion for it it was enough that what he was proposing to himself served the immediate purpose of his amiable villainy as to that his business was to make absolute the estrangement between these two whence his crafty counsel to the earl who had not failed to rise to that insidious bait he knew very well that in spite of all that had happened any genuinely contrite advances on the husbands part would be sure to be met halfway by the wife who was really a reasonable and forgiving little creature wherefore it was necessary for him to convince her timely and by ocular demonstration of the vanity of any lingering hopes she might be entertaining of remorse and repentance on the part of a delinquent spouse it was never to be supposed for a moment that she would answer to that test of jealousy in the manner he had professed to predict it would be certain on the contrary to alienate the last of her consideration from one who could so wantonly and callously abuse it she would turn from the heartless creature in a final disgust to seek according to all the rules of intrigue consolation of the nearest sympathy whereon it would remain only for him her cousin and confidant to reap the fruits of the emotional situation he had so cunningly engineered that was his hope and belief but his plan yet lacked completeness the deception he had contrived was but half a deception so long as it missed its counterpart how to provide that must be his next consideration as he pondered he heard a light step behind him and turned to see the lady herself she had come in very softly and now stood before him a rather piteous expression on her face her right arm ostensibly the maltreated one rested in a sling black that there might be no mistake about it and as long as she remembered she winced when it was touched cousin she said i am very unhappy what have i done to be so abused i faith i know not said he smiling unless it was you spoke before his face of a kissing in which he had no share i spoke but in play i am an honest wife dont cry your goods too loud kate or men may question them the soundest wares need the least recommendation i am i say and if i were not how should it affect him that hates me so nay you go too far indeed he said as much that i was distasteful to him did he say that she set her teeth and shall unsay it or i will never speak word to him again so im sorry on my word cousin did you not quarrel with him for what he did to you yes you could not know what hed said we had words i confess about what is he jealous of you what if he were kate she clenched her little left fist in wrathful glee is he i could love to believe it why he looked at her eagerly to make him suffer for me what ive suffered for him jealousy he would not hate me then the face of the arch plotter fell i see you love him through all he said sourly why should i not love him she answered he is my husband hamilton pulled himself together this faith he thought with an acid thrill is worth converting why indeed said he well i dont know if hes jealous of me or not but if thats your recipe for curing him we two might make a plausible conspiracy of it shall we rehearse the business now kate he put a persuasive hand on her arm she bethought herself and squeaked out you hurt me cousin and she backed a little a play like ours is only make believe but sure said he the best actors are those who even in rehearsal try to realize their parts to the life he approached her again offering to put his arm about her and at that she forgetting her injury whipped her little fist out of its sling and delivered him a sound box of the ear with it there she said emphatically there he answered holding his palm to the suffering auricle you cat she bridled like one her eyes glittering he pointed a derisive finger at the dangling sling hadnt you better put off that pretence o she said and thrust her hand again into the loop now said he you may find another instrument for your purpose im done with you her brow puckered and her lip went down youre never going to abandon me in my trouble she said she looked so bewitching so forlorn his heart could not help softening to her if i do not he said it must be on softer terms than yet was my hand so hard she pleaded penitently tis for the lips not the ear to decide said he give it me if you would hear kinder news of it she hung back a little then reluctantly acquiesced he mouthed the flushed palm till she snatched it away be good please she said it blushes for its naughty deed he declared but it is forgiven now she said will you not be serious and give me good advice that is not always palatable you know it is the way with healing drugs ah if it might only heal he sighed and shook his head with a look of commiseration what do you mean she asked alarmed that there is no cure possible im sorry for you in truth i am he said despondently if you still love him as you admit and i wish i could think that your policy of silence or your policy of jealousy or your policy of anything in the world would bring philip stanhope to his senses but alack my dear i fear tis all thrown away upon him and that his inconstancy is irreclaimable why at this very moment while you are calculating a means to his reformation he is to my knowledge scheming to have to his house here a country fancy of his one molly davis whom he calls his cousin she heard and stiffened a country fancy o i breathe no wrong of her he said and she may be his cousin left handed for all i know a sprightly wench at least that somehow met and tickled his humour and hell have her to stay with him on that plea of kinship but its for you to question him if you will i the white scorn of her the lifted lip and wrinkle in the little nose did you not hear me say i had sworn never to speak to him again conditionally that was no longer never and never and never in this house before my very face o it cannot be true well perhaps he only jested she moved and forgetting her sling again put a fierce young hand on his sleeve you called her his fancy a man may fancy in a woman more or less than she desires it may be her wit when shed give the world it were her face is she witty then no doubt he thinks so and ugly betwixt and between you have seen her more or less i only asked of her face it was a bad light she lies at an inn in the town called the mischief she lies well well thank you cousin her features relaxed in a wonderful way one might have thought her suddenly convinced and at ease with a sigh that seemed to dissipate all her scruples she chassd a retreating step or two and twirled and dropped a little mocking curtsey to the gentleman i must go now she said you have been very entertaining signor george and and there is no cure for blindness like like what like seeing you know his brows went up perplexed have i been so whimsical infinitely i assure you the drollest most diverting cousin tra la la but sympathetic i hope kate o believe me that isnt the word for it tra la la you know you can always depend upon me for help and advice o most disinterestedly his jaw seemed to stick as he opened it to answer she laughed as she turned her back on him ah he breathed out i see youll make it up with philip yet with a stamp of her foot she flared round on him in a final spasm of anger you dare to say so i tell you once and for all that from this moment it is eternal silence between us he watched her from under lowered lids and with a furtive smile on his lips sweep from the room then twitched up his shoulders to a noiseless laugh to make certain of her fixed resolution that was why he had provoked her to that last retort now at length it should be safe for him to act if only that dubious manner of hers had left him with more conviction as to his own ultimate profit in the matter but like enough it had been mere coquetry he left whitehall shortly and made his way to the mischief inn where he found mrs davis bored to death over her confinement to her room and in a very fractious mood have you come to take me away she said you called yourself my friend why so i am he answered what have i done to disprove it youve done nothing sure and thats what didnt i pay your reckoning o its true you opened the trap door but you must go and tie me by the tail first he laughed twas to keep my country mouse from the gib cats no reflection on her so to keep her from the cats you set a dog on her a nice one i owe you for that beast of a landlord well hes called off and here am i to redeem my word will you come with me where to to the tailor and the haberdasher first of all will that suit you very well if another pays so thats settled then we must have you dressed to the part what part she affected perhaps felt a passing perturbation but it served for no more than to add a thrill to her voice and then suddenly her eyes brightened have you got me a london engagement george she said perhaps in the kings theatre and she clasped her hands rapturously why said he an engagement true enough but tis on the human stage her lip fell dolefully o curse that mrs moll he said i shall be obliged if you will study to express your feelings less epigrammatically whats that she said why in your case tis another word for cursing i only know of one other said she but ill damn it with all my heart if that likes you better i like neither one nor tother tis to turn to bitter sweets those cherry seeming lips of yours and make poison of their nectar she was sitting at the table her elbows propped on it her chin on her fists and so disposed she put out her tongue at him gingumbobs she said and that was all and in short said he rising for he too was seated i think ill say good day to you sobered at once she jumped to her feet and intercepted him what have i said sure dont never mind a silly wench ill do what you want of me there he stood arrested but as if unwillingly i doubt your capacity child or your art to curb your tongue a fig for that when moll is moll but once she shapes herself to my designs good speech must go with good looks she seemed as if she would cry george ill curb it i did but jest with you havent i learned my speaking parts and said them to the letter too without one extra oath she was stroking his arms up and down her fingers wandered to his hands and gave themselves softly to that refuge her lifted eyes were full of azure pain tell me what you desire of me she said with pretty wooing why discretion first and last he answered have you got it havent i why look how particular i can be in the choice of my friends youll have to play a double part twice tenpence is two and sixpence george it ought to pay me it ought and shall if youre clever help me to bring about a thing i much desire and your fortunes as i promised shall be made my care he questioned the young uplifted face her hands were still held in his was the thing born a girl she said he laughed but did not answer and she seemed to muse her lids lowered what a pretty gentleman you are george she said absently by and by i never guessed at first when you came that unhandsome off the road what fine clothes could make of you why are you going to take me to the haberdashers to prink you out for great company child she looked up breathlessly not the kings all in good time he said if you please me well she said looking down again ill do my best saving my honour will that please you faith says the gentleman coolly if you save it at the expense of anothers she drew back a little not a womans never fear mrs moll tis your pretty rogues face and your ready impudence i wish for a bait and theyd catch no woman believe me come are you prepared to engage them in my service she primmed her lips holding up a finger discretion she said ill answer when im told he nodded and leading her apart from betraying keyholes seated himself and pulled her to a chair beside him now said he give me your little lovely ear while i whisper in it she sat at attention like a mouse while he spoke his low voiced scheme to her mischief intelligence secret laughter waited on her lips and eyes as she leaned to listen sometimes shaking her curls sometimes whispering the softest little yes or no and when at last it was all said she jumped to her feet with a laugh that was like glass bells and clapped her hands merrily while her companion sat one arm akimbo regarding her with a pleasant waiting expression well he said youll do it she strutted assuming the grand air and swept a curtsey i am my lord chesterfields most obliged she said throatily hamilton rose with a grin you will i can see said he its really simple if you will only bear in mind this main assurance they are not on speaking terms and each will think the other has invited you chapter iv running north from storeys gate the backs of its western houses abutting on the network of conduits which fed what is now in st jamess park called the ornamental water but which was then the canal was a short road or row named duke street in which was situated the building subsequently the town home of jeffreys the filthy fouquier tinville of an earlier revolution known as the admiralty house this mansion or part of it for the whole of it was of considerable dimensions was in fact the headquarters of the recently reorganized navy and as such is mentioned here as being associated however indirectly with our narrative inasmuch as it was to a member of its staff a mr samuel pepys not then long nominated to a clerkship of the acts that jack bannister the famous harpist and a figure with whom we have hereafter to reckon owed his discovery in the exclusive as apart from the popular sense this man sprung into evidence no one knew whence or when had for months been perambulating the town as an itinerant musician earning a precarious livelihood by playing before tavern doors at street corners and in marketplaces and rich only in the soulful tribute of the many headed to whom he had come to be known by the appellation of sad jack for sad indeed he appeared both in face and habit a lean stoop shouldered fellow grimly austere and always clothed in grey grey hose grey breeches grey doublet and grey hat from the shadow of whose limp wide brim his eyes shone white like pebbles gleaming through dark water his figure was familiar to the streets as his instrument strapped to his back a folding stool hung over his arm and his soul patiently subdued to the philosophy which could find in unrecognition the surest proof of worth he plodded his fortuitous way with eye grown selective in the matter of pitches and at his heels perhaps a string of ragamuffins who for the merest dole of his magnificences quality would be ready to walk in his shadow to the towns end for sweet music hath through all the ages the force we wot of to tame the furious beast and there was never a pied piper of genius but could count on his audience of rats to follow him over half the world if he pleased and this man had genius for all it went unrecognized but that was accident and no moral whatever attaches to the fact he communicated it from his finger tips to the strings hypostatically as it were bestowing on them that gift of tongues which speaking one language speaks all to his own ears it might appear that he was uttering no more than his native accents to all others gentile and barbarian it seemed that he spoke in theirs and that it is to command genius the universal appeal the gift of the holy ghost yet outside this solitary faculty or inspiration there was nothing noteworthy about the creature but his gloom and even that might have been no more than the shadow cast by the brighter half of his dual personality on the other born musicians are not as a rule remarkable for their intellectual brilliancy and sad jack was i am afraid no exception to the rule he was a dull fellow in truth in all that did not appertain to his exquisite art now it so happened that fortune one bright spring morning directed the wandering harpists footsteps towards that quarter of the town which has already been mentioned when attracted perhaps by the sunny quiet of the spot or by some suggestion in it of acoustic possibilities he turned into duke street and choosing a convenient place unslung his harp and stool and stood for some moments glassily appraising the constitution of the little throng which had followed him into that retreat he was inured by now to open air criticism and easily master of its moods he could afford to tantalize expectation sure of his ability to win the heart out of any crowd at the first touch of those long nervous fingers of his which for the moment caressed his chin reflective and with no more apparent sensibility in them than the fingers of a farmer calculating the profits on a flock of sheep and indeed these were sheep in their curiosity in their shyness of the challenging human eye in the way in which each refused to be thrust forward of his fellows lest his prominent position should argue his readiness to be fleeced but they all gaped and hung aloof while the musician anticipating their sure subjection leisurely keyed up his strings to the concordant pitch when at last satisfied and in the humour he began to play then it was curious to note the hush which instantly fell upon the throng sure of all the instruments of the senses ear eye palate nose and finger there is none so subtle in its mechanism as the first nor so defiant of analysis in the way it transmits its message to the soul the nature to which taste and vision and smell and touch may never prove holier than carnal provocations will yet find its divinity in music sound perhaps built the universe as amphion with his lyre built the walls of thebes children of light we may be children of sound also if only we knew now the kennel sweeper leaned upon his broom and dreamed of starry tracks where no rain ever fell the cadger hated himself no longer the little climbing boy sat on the rim of the tallest chimney in all the world the pretty sempstress hid with a little hand the furtive patch upon her chin and flushed to know it there the hackney coachman pulled on his rein and sat to listen a piece of straw stuck motionless between his teeth one and all they dwelt like spirits intoxicated hearing of a new message and drunk with some wonderful joy of release and then the sweet strains ended and they came to earth it was like heaven said the sempstress wiping a tear from the corner of her eye with her apron was it indeed said a full bodied good humoured looking gentleman who had paused on his way to his official duties to listen and who now pushed himself forward with an easy condescension this was mr pepys himself no less who brought to a stop between sense and sensibility had discovered no choice but to fall slave to those transports with which emotional music always filled him yet astounded as he was by the performance his eye a pretty shrewd and noticing one had been no less observant than his ear he wrinkled it quizzically at the little beauty was it says he well faith pretty angel you ought to know he was very handsomely dressed in a blue jackanapes coat then come into fashion with silver buttons a pair of fine white stockings and a white plume in his hat and he appeared if anything a little conscious of his finery but whether it was from his assurance which seemed unjustified of any exceptional good looks or the thickness of his calves which were stupendous he failed to impress the sempstress who heaving a petulant shoulder at him with a la sir i know i am no angel tripped about and away her nose in the air mr pepys chuckled into his chin though no more than twenty eight he possessed already an affluently double one and looking a moment after the retreating figure turned to the musician who all this while had been gazing into vacancy his hat placed crown downwards on the stones his sole petitioner but before any could respond to that mute invitation the new comer had stooped to snatch up the dishonoured headgear which he presented with a great bow to its owner tis the privilege of kings sir said he to go bonneted before their subjects prithee put this to a nobler use than a beggars bowl tis we that should doff to the prince of harpists and he suited the action to the word standing bareheaded before the musician he for his part sat staring doubtful whether he was honoured or derided sir he stammered have i not played to your liking so much so answered pepys that my liking is you play no more on the streets will you be sensible sir and discuss this business i can introduce you where your talent will receive justice and i ask no other reward for my pains which is indeed a duty sir i confess your playing ravished me beyond anything i have heard rise if you will and walk with me looking dumbfoundered the musician obeyed he appeared on closer acquaintance a much younger man than the other had suspected which was all in his favour as a prodigy the offer nevertheless had been a quite disinterested one a point to the fine gentlemans credit for in truth he was not above expecting commissions on occasion but in the question of music he was always at his most altruistic now he conducted his discovery into the court of the admiralty house the better to shake off the throng which followed and there put to him the few inquiries which came uppermost in his mind as to the strangers genesis to wit his social standing his calling the circumstances which had thrown him thus gifted and unpatronized upon london streets and so on but he learned little to satisfy his curiosity the man was reticent awkward of speech proud perhaps and beyond the facts that he was self taught had been a pedagogue in a country school and had voluntarily abandoned an uncongenial task for one more to his fancy and potential well being the listener was able to glean little but one thing stood out clear and that was the genius which proclaimed this oddity as exalted a natural musician as any that had ever captured the heart of the world and on that assurance mr pepys proceeded the upshot of this interview was that he came to introduce him having a pretty wide acquaintance in professional quarters among the right influential people with the result that sad jack from being a wandering street performer became presently one of the most fashionable soloists in the town with the command of a salary in proportion and engagements covering the most popular resorts from spring gardens to the new spa at islington and with that we will leave him for the time being while as to mr pepys having served his purpose he must walk here and now out of the picture chapter v the earl of chesterfield entering his apartments one afternoon was informed by the porter that a young person lately arrived waited on his convenience in the audience room to which she had been shown not ushered thus mrs moll to the menial instinct be it observed was still subtly and in spite of all her fine new trappings the unclassified young person she might impose on the master but never on the man his lordship demanded tartly why his lady had not been informed he was told that she was out the stranger it appeared had entered with an assured air stating that she was expected on a visit expected by whom she had bridled but in a manner twinkling like to the question by whom did he the porter suppose by one of the servants curse his impudence and so he had admitted her with her smart baggage assuming that if she was the invited guest of either his master or mistress it must be of the former why o for only the reason that she looked most like a gentlemans lady a gentlemans lady my lord grinned then looked serious did she give no name the name of davis please your lordship mrs moll davis she called herself chesterfields brow went up he whistled of course now he remembered this must be kates young country friend of whom he had been advised and her manners no doubt were to be accounted to mere rustic gaucherie he had better see her at once in his wifes absence and judge of her suitability from his point of view for the part for which hamilton had cast her she might prove after all an impossible instrument to play on and yet the rogue had seemed confident he turned on the porter harshly why did you not say so before mrs davis is her ladyships friend and guest and as such is to be lodged fitly see to it fellow and that you keep that free tongue of yours out of your cheek he went on and at the door of the audience chamber was received by a couple of lackeys who throwing wide the oak announced him in form my lord chesterfield for mrs davis she had been peering into costly nooks and corners and was taken by surprise but that did not matter the blush with which she whisked about from contemplating herself in a remote stand glass became her mightily and seemed offered to his lordship like a flower gathered from the mirror to propitiate him for the liberty she had been caught taking he accepted and pinned it over his heart so to speak if this was rusticity he was quite willing it appeared to him to become a country strephon on the spot the danger he foresaw at once was of falling in love with his own pretence and indeed mrs davis with her pert young face and forget me not eyes made an alluring figure and one seeming admirably efficient to the part she was dressed to play as to that hamilton had advised with taste and discretion so that in her plain bodice and pannier with her slim arms bared to the elbow and tied above with favours of ribbon and the curls shaken over her bright cheeks from under a coquettish hat brim she might have passed for the very sweet moral of a provincial nymph conceived in the happiest vein between homeliness and fashion she curtsied as she had been taught to curtsey on the stage latterly for her sex had only quite recently won its way to the footlights and boldly with a little musical laugh accepted the situation sure she said if you hadnt caught me at it my cheeks ud betray me i was looking in the glass so there it put him at his ease at once with no rustic coyness to conquer he was already half way to the end it mattered little he felt confident what he might venture to say and so he gave his tongue full rein so there said he and faith mistress davis if i were you i could look till my eyes went blind could you she said then youd be a blind donkey for your pains she came up and stood before him her chin raised her hands clasped behind her back so youre lord chesterfield she said how do you like it how do you he asked grinning hm she said critically bringing one hand forward to fondle her baby chin tis early days to say but on the face of you you look very much like any other man but perhaps youre different underneath made of gold like the boys in the folk tale o im not made of gold i can assure you arent you now ive heard of some that are said to be im made just like anybody else there now what a disappointment and you call yourself a lord why how would you have me i wouldnt have you at all what a question from a married man he was a little vexed he made that sound of impatience between tongue and palate which cannot be rendered in spelling i see youre a literal soul said he i must be careful how i put things youd better she said now i come to look at you youve got a sinful eye and now i come to look at you i dont wonder at it dont you well for all youre like to get you may put it in there and see none the worse he laughed a little astounded troth thought he this is a strange acquaintance for kate to have made why he said what have i asked or expected but the right of every man to see and admire o you may admire as much as you like quoth she i wouldnt deprive you of that gratification or yourself perhaps no she said with indifference you neednt consider me ive more than i can do with already what he said but not of the town quality tis only sheeps eyes they make at you in the country alls fish for that that comes to a womans net tis a question with her more of quantity than quality he shrugged his shoulders do you love the country sure she said i love the pigs and the cows and the horses and the ducks and the geese but after all theres no goose like a lord he laughed but a little uneasily he was not quite so confident as he had been of the simple nature of his task he would just like for an experiment to eschew badinage and insinuate a thought more feeling into the conversation i think i agree with you he said a lord is a goose unless hes a gander said she you called him a goose he answered with asperity and a goose he shall be well dont quarrel about it she protested goose and gander and gosling they say are three sounds but one thing why is a lord whichever he is well what was your reason for calling him a goose i never did i said there was no goose like him that was to flatter the goose i think was it now and i meant it to flatter the lord he raised appealing hands no i prithee flattery the very mess of pottage for which he sold his birthright as a man a lord mrs davis from the very moment he becomes one hath parted with sincerity no sure yes indeed and for it exchanged the eternal adulation of the hypocrite paid not to his merits but his title the base thenceforth surround him the worthy keep their distance lest old friendships once frankly mutual be suspected of self interest he knows no truth but such as he may read in its withholding he knows no love but such as loves his rank before himself was he not a goose to be a lord to part with truth and love to give himself to be devoured by parasites in a hundred forms he smiled appealing and a little melancholy the lady lifted her brows lud she said and to think we in the country only know but two the one that hops and the one that doesnt his lordship gave a slight start and cough exactly he said yes exactly he stiffened clearing his throat then smiled again but painfully so flatter me not he said be your sweet candid self to earn my gratitude you cannot know what it would mean to me to win at last a womans unaffected sympathy will you not extend to me the friendship which is already i understand my wifes her eyes twinkled her mouth twitched as she stood before him what is the matter he asked in mild surprise you you do look so droll she said and burst into a fit of laughter he was inclined to be very incensed but with good sense made a moral vault of it and landed lightly the other side of his own temper once there he could afford to echo the hussys merriment you are a bad girl he said grinning and shaking a finger but i can see we are going to be great friends hist though he looked about him cautiously and then approached her stand and deliver said she and backed a little no no he said on my honour i only wish a word in confidence o i know that word she said im not so young but ive learned to crack nuts with my own teeth here it is then he said coming no farther theres this difficulty in the way of our good understanding that it can owe no encouragement to my lady your friend why not now why the truth is were were not on speaking terms lord a mussy whats the matter o these little domestic differences they will occur unsuited i suppose it was her suggestion but it makes things somewhat awkward for the moment he heaved a profound sigh alone always alone you see what a goose to be a lord she eyed him roguishly shes been finding out things about you dont tell me he sighed again what a goose what a goose and then started as if remembering something o and theres another secret another said she thrilled and irresistibly she leaned her ear towards him listen he said and with a single step had dived and snatched a kiss you devil she cried starting away if i dont pay you for that the word died on her lips they were both simultaneously aware that the young countess had come unnoticed into the room and was standing regarding them with stony eyes my lord coughing and feeling at his cravat tried to hum a little nonchalant air failed conspicuously and hesitating a moment yielded incontinent to the better part of valour and swaggered out by the door with a little run at the last as if he felt behind him the invisible persuasion of a boot some minutes of pregnant silence succeeded his departure mrs davis was the first to break it im im glad to see your ladyship looking so bonny as if it had needed but the sound of this voice to galvanize her into life to assure her of the incarnate reality of the insult with which she had been threatened the young wife started and advancing a few hurried paces paused recollected herself and went on deliberately to a table on which she proceeded to deposit the gloves which she stripped leisurely from her hands she was just come in from riding and in her dove grey habit with the soft plumed hat on her head steeple crowned but coaxed into that picturesque shapelessness which only a woman can contrive looked a figure sweet enough to set mrs davis wondering over the criminal blindness of husbands mr george hamilton you see had let her into only so much of the truth a half knowledge which his lordships behaviour had certainly done nothing to rectify my lady whose fingers had gripped a silvered riding switch put down that weapon as if reluctantly and drew off her gloves if this woman was what she supposed there could be no course for her to adopt more contemptuous than that of overlooking her as if she did not exist for her sure it must have been a surprise for you said moll after waiting vainly for some response to find me come unbeknown to you on a visit to my kinsman but la we never know whats going to happen next now do we no answer look in any time youre in the neighbourhood he says to me and theres always bed and board for you at whitehall no answer youve a pretty place here my lady weve got none such in the country saving its the manor house where squire bucksey lives and him but half a gentleman having lost a leg and an arm at worcester fight my lady takes up a book which she affects to read in well said moll if youve nothing to say i think id better be following his lordship she moved as if to go the book slapped down my lady turned upon her peremptorily with crimson cheeks stay too intolerable an insolence this affectation of rustic artlessness i had thought to be silent but it transcends my endurance i had been warned of your coming and i know who you are your name is davis deny it not impudence was not offended but her sauce was up she turned to counter and the two faced one another deny it not i she said what if it is what how dare you speak to me is not your presence here offence enough what have i done now done no wonder your right cheek flushes for its shame he kissed it not i another moment if you hadnt come in and id have clouted his ears for him what made him kiss you thats for him to say you can ask him if you like i old acquaintance sake hell tell you perhaps ah what are you ahing about did it look like a habit between us take my word if you care that hes never kissed me in his life before care not i i thought you looked as if you didnt his kisses and his fancies are subjects of supreme indifference to me whats the matter then my self respect is the matter a thing beyond your comprehension to have to sit and suffer such a guest in silence as though i seemed to countenance her presence that is the matter mrs davis half whimpering put her knuckles to her eyes why dont you speak to him then she said and have me turned out o dear o dear a nice way this to treat a harmless visitor harmless for the first time a wonder seized her little ladyship was she really maligning in her heart a rustic simpleton no there was something here adroite practised something indescribable which precluded the idea and yet the thought had come to puzzle and disturb her though she could not believe her tone was less uncompromising when she spoke again i speak to him it is not for such as you to understand to answer to an insult is to flatter it let him answer for his own so it be one to himself and you never fear that i shall complain she turned away and back again i ask no questions about you she said i desire to hear and know nothing your conduct if you speak truth need be your only voucher she took up her gloves preparing to leave the room then stopped as if on a resistless impulse and looked into the sluts eyes you have a pretty face child she said i know not whence it comes or what designs but i would fain think no evil of it and she gathered up her things and went without another word it had been a brief interview but a stupefying for some moments after she was left alone moll stood motionless as if afraid to stir then gradually expression came back to her face and she gave a soft whistle lud the first is over she murmured and i would i could think the worst i stand to have my eyes scratched out seemeth to me but never mind george must be accommodated and the fool lord caught in the snare of his own laying weve not for that matter begun so badly she rubbed her cheek viciously then executing a little noiseless pas seul shivered to a stop and looked about her inquiringly she was as light on her feet as a kitten as graceful and as pretty what next she tittered will nobody fetch me or tell me and o she pressed a hand to the seat of suffering when do great folks dine she stiffened on the word like a soldier to attention a liveried gentleman who had come into the room stood bent and bowing before her and kicking a furtive heel to another who stood sniggering in the shadow of the door will your ladyship said the first speaking from the root of his nose condescend to be pleased to be shown your ladyships chamber moll whisked about her cheek on fire yes she will turnip head when youve got over that stomach ache of yours chapter vi it must be explained at this point that the comedy with which we are especially concerned formed only one of innumerable kindred sideshows in the endless junketing fair at whitehall palace where ever since the first days of the restoration the high revel which that reaction from cimmerian glooms had come to inaugurate had been steadily degenerating into a saturnalia as unblushing as it was universal it represents in fact but one among many such performances and though isolated by us for purely dramatic purposes is none the less to be understood as constituting part of the general entertainment thus you can picture our little company if you will as joining in the intervals between the acts in the common hilarity as forming part of the glittering personnel which daily in that idle pleasure loving court laughs and fribbles away the hours the young countess is there ingnue childish but already a mark for predatory eyes and not alas in her proud revolt wholly or wholly innocently unconscious of the fact my lord her husband secretly watchful of the change conceals under an affectation of insouciance the jealousy which is beginning to set him speculating as to any reason which may exist for it hamilton who holds in his hand or imagines that he holds the strings of all the puppets implicated in this play of cross purposes pervades the entire scene a figure of wit and grace handsome urbane and popular wherever he chooses to distribute his favours of the court and its demoralizing atmosphere are all these lives is all this complication of unscrupulous intrigue and if we leave that court out of our account it is not to imply thereby that the aforesaid lives are not nine tenths subject to its baneful influences but simply because to mix any such complex ingredients with a plain tale were hopelessly to confuse the issues thereof wherefore we will continue to confine our mise en scne if you please to that district of the huge rambling palace in which my lord of chesterfield has his quarters it is there that the sole business with which we are concerned develops itself now it comes to include this business in the process of its unfolding a certain illustrious figure with whose name we have dealt hitherto but in parenthesis his royal highness the duke of york was at this date a young man of twenty seven and somewhat notable in a reckless community for the comparative propriety of his conduct at least he kept his lapses within reasonable if infrequent bounds and in erring showed some occasional capacity for shamefacedness he had virtues courage truth to his word fidelity and application vices parsimony excessive hauteur and an implacable enmity for his foes yet commonly master of himself he possessed one cardinal weakness and that showed itself in a remarkable susceptibility to feminine allurements showed itself i say for he seemed unable to conceal it he was according to grammont the most completely unguarded ogler of his time fresh unspoiled and possessed of the double recommendation of having a husband and notoriously an indifferent one the little countess with the rose leaf face was not long you may be sure in attracting the rather prominent inquisition of those wandering orbs and not altogether be it said without some flattered consciousness on her part of their interested scrutiny the duke though austere to severity was not an uncomely stuart he was tall well formed and the sallow melancholy of his look when tempered to a soft occasion could be sufficiently moving satisfied as to first impressions he began to consider his further policy and in the meantime he ogled his ogling it seemed was not in spite of its temerity suspected by hamilton perhaps cousin georges confidence in his own most favoured position was too absolute to cherish a thought of any rival influence outside it but whatever the case it is certain that even if he observed he gave himself no concern whatever about an ocular blandishment which was generally at the service of any beaux yeux of a pattern finer than the common but if he remained indifferent it was far otherwise with the husband whose vision in a night had changed its blindness for the thousand lensed optic of spiderous jealousy realizing too late his own infatuated folly reduced to a vain coveting of what was by all legal right his own possession forced into an attitude of apparent insensibility to the promiscuous gallantries offered to his lady on the strength of their estrangement and prevented both by policy and pride from confessing to his altered sentiments the unhappy man was in these days suffering all the pangs the most vindictive wife could have wished and yet she would have forgiven him even now could he have brought that obstinate devil in him to submit to the one condition she had dictated and have owned to his iniquity and asked absolution for it but to that extreme he could not go it was still a point of honour with him to force her into being the first to break the silence and so he continued to ground what hopes he had on the nature of the compromise suggested by hamilton to that absurd faith he clung soon wearying of the little malapert instrument lent though he never guessed it to his purpose but desperately continuing to play her for the success he looked to achieve and in the meanwhile if his part in private was a difficult one in public it was an endless anguish it was not only that cursed to that compact of silence he must be perpetually manuvring to avoid its discovery by others and always on the edge of a fear lest what he so carefully concealed should be mockingly made known in a spasm of feminine perversity by the capricious partner thereto but that he was wholly debarred by it from uttering a word of warning or menace to that same partner on the subject of the perils to which her own wilfulness was subjecting her from oglings princely or otherwise he himself was so acutely sensitive to the danger that he found a suggestive meaning in every appreciative glance every small natural homage paid to a beauty which could not be seen but to be admired the attractions which should have been his pride had become his torment while his mind revolted from the memory of a dead infatuation as from something noisome and in so much the nemesis of deserved retribution had swiftly overtaken him from his jealous misery he could find no relief at last but in confiding its fancied justifications to his friend hamilton him for some inexplicable reason he never suspected curse it george he would say i am so driven and harassed curse it a little more and i shall pack her off to the peak he spoke of the peak in derbyshire near which his country seat bretby hall was situated the phrase at court came to pass into a jocular proverb so that to rid oneself of a tiresome wife was to send her to the peak but the threat a little alarmed hamilton it was true that if carried into effect it might prove itself the short cut to his own desired goal since friends come doubly welcomed into killing solitudes still that welcome gained at the sacrifice perhaps of a month in town was a prospect altogether too wry to be entertained with composure no he must certainly counter the suggestion with all his wits why he said what is poor kates new offence did i speak of any snarled chesterfield the old is wide enough and long enough to serve the purpose of a score how do you mean how says he why does she not take advantage of my tongue tied state to flaunt her coquetries in my very face speak to her then you know i cannot o you can indeed ill see her damned first why there you are youll see her damned first and so you will so i will what do you imply by that did you not say you would your word on it then you will curse you you mean the duke curse you what duke dont you know very well o a pox on these conundrums what duke i say york then what is he the villain ive watched them exchange glances why so have i and so have hundreds you own it with perfect equanimity such frank barter of the eyes is your surest proof of innocence give me your stolen look for mischief you think he means none then hamilton laughed and clapped his friend on the shoulder o phil said he thou art surely possessed the duke hath other fish to fry his net is full believe me on my sincerity and he meant it your jealousy corrupts your judgment and more it dishonours your wife come tell me how goes it with the little country skit kates friend chesterfield but half convinced shook his head and growled she wearies me a tasteless business what said the other again perturbed you are not crying off no he shrugged o faith no but tis uphill work the looser rein to give yourself a plague on distaste that is to put on the brake uphill a common creature nevertheless to appear my more natural choice and when she is by i think kate must hold me despicable is the skit so common troth youd think it though to do her justice she makes one laugh still though against your inclinations you play the part o i play it and with what effect so far none that you promised unless rank mutiny lay in your scheme she seems determined to show me that of all men she encounters i stand least in her regard so you are signalled out for her slights what could you wish more id rather be the one scorned by a woman than the fifty favoured tis to stand alone in her estimation and be thought of always for yourself shes jealous take my word these coquetries you speak of are but retorts on you in kind be thankful that she thinks you worth them it works phil believe me it works do you really think so im sure of it come visit us this night and make sureness surer hamilton feigned to reflect to night why the truth is chesterfield breaking into a chuckle nudged him roguishly hey hey i see an assignation well another night nay to prove youre wrong ill come it so happened that passing along a corridor that afternoon hamilton encountered the duke of york who took his arm and held him in friendly talk as he paced the matting with him up and down his royal highness was in a suit of plain black which became his sombre visage very well and wore no ornament but the george suspended from his neck by a blue ribbon i know your love for music geordie says he what is this new saraband that all seem suddenly crazed about hamilton told him it was by the signor francesco corbetti that famous master of the guitar who had lately come from paris to whitehall and with such good result for himself that the king who loved his art had actually appointed him a groom of the queens privy chamber with a princely salary in order that he might attach him permanently to the court tis nothing else both morning and noon said the young man with a groan till for my very love of music i could throttle these mutilators of it with their own guitar strings not a doting coxcomb or langrous amourette but murders the jealous pated swain six times a day i wish he were rotten is it not strange how vanity will never learn that to sing the nightingales song is not necessarily to sing the nightingale the duke smiled tolerantly are they all such bunglers said he i have heard of some reputed to handle their instruments well arran is one said hamilton and there is another accomplished performer among them your royal highnesss self but for the rest it is not that i object to their twanging to their hearts content it is that they must all do it to the same tune this saraband is indeed a ravishing air as corbetti plays it but watered nectar was never to my taste god forbid i should quarrel with a vogue his majesty started or curse to hear this discordant plucking of strings come wailing eternally like the wind through a hundred keyholes all i ask is an occasional change in the theme you think nevertheless the air itself beautiful o it is your royal highness should hear it what did you remark of lord arran geordie why he knows and plays it after corbetti the best of all this earl of arran kate chesterfields younger brother was a little callow perfumed exquisite a little lisping buck who could play many parts prettily but none to such effect as that of minstrel for which like moore and leigh hunt and other twitterers of a later date he had a small natural aptitude so when the italian by the kings grace brought guitars into that fashion that no ladys toilet table was thought complete without it included a beribboned instrument among its rouge and powder puffs this curled darling found his opportunity and earned through it a more devoted attention than any of his puppyish charms had hitherto been able to procure him he must play it to me said the duke the boy has a fine touch though something due no doubt to the quality of his instrument they say tis the best in all england no that it is not said hamilton unguardedly his sister owns the best the duke affected an air of momentary abstraction before he answered what did you say o my lady chesterfield she plays too faith that is the word for it answered the other she plays as they all do at playing and she has a finer guitar than her brother was it she should lease it to him doubtless she would if asked again his answer seemed to pass unnoticed then the duke started as if recollecting himself eh he said we were discussing what or whom ive forgot but let it pass there was something of interest what was it that i had in my mind to mention to you chapter vii the same three days later so in theatrical parlance we lift the curtain on a scene the replica of that introduced in the second chapter of this comedy of errors it was all as before even to the parted figures only with this difference somewhat equidistant between the two sat mrs davis that though an addition seeming insignificant had all the latent force in it of a barrel of gunpowder with an unlighted fuse attached the moment might come when the match being applied the whole of that artificial stuff of obmutescence would be blown in a flash to the winds mrs moll was perhaps herself a little conscious of the volcano on which she was perched yet it would be doing her an injustice to hint that she either felt or showed any perturbation while fully realizing that her position was in the last degree precarious the thrill of the thing the exercise of the mental agility needed to prevent or at least postpone that final catastrophe was compensation enough while it lasted to reconcile her to her utmost danger and in the meanwhile she was having in the slang of to day the time of her life lapt in a perfumed luxury which was as foreign as it was agreeable to her nature and enjoying it none the less because it was stolen fruit soon to be consumed like a born actress living in her part but like an astute woman keeping an unsleeping eye to the business side of her engagement she gave herself wholly to the situation and endeavoured to extract from it the best that mischief and ingenuity could devise morally she was in her own eyes merely the naughty little tertium quid needed in a drama of love and jealousy to effect a certain purpose of separation and incidentally she regarded the feelings of no one the play was the thing and nothing outside it mattered she was not personally taken with his lordship while professionally she coquetted with and as she supposed captivated him if in the course of those antics he should be so obsessed as to propose to make her his mistress in actual fact she might possibly for reasons of self interest be induced to accept but she was quite contented without the entertainment to her lay in the successful management of the double deception which was to end by procuring hamilton the fruit of his elaborate intrigue she was not jealous of him though he was the man handsome and daring for her fancy they were small souls akin and she would like to please him if only to hear his praise my lord read my lady worked and mrs davis sat with her hands on her lap and yawned when she addressed either it had to be with a careful view to maintaining with each the fiction that she was the others friend a task not to be under estimated for its difficulty and indeed only rendered possible by the stubborn avoidance by the two in replying to her of any reference to her position in the house as the guest of one of them but their mutual pride was in that her safety for any self betrayal they invited designedly or undesignedly she might actually have been their known and accepted visitor they spoke not so much to her as through her shafts designed by each to gall the other it was for her usefulness in that respect that my lady had condescended to condone her presence and even to the extent of some verbal interchanges as a medium transmitting the bitter intercourse of soul with soul she had her negative virtues it was evening and the girandoles were all a sparkling haze of light there was no company but these three for his lordship had of late shown a peevish avoidance of his friends and his implied intimation of a desire for solitude had been generally respected infinitely to the disgust of his young countess who never wedded to domestic dullness found in this infliction of it under the circumstances an intolerably aggravated grievance she sat like a figure of fate distilling frost moll leaning back in her chair linked her hands behind her head stretched deliciously gave a prodigious yawn and rattling her little heels on the floor came erect again and looked in a collapsed way at her ladyship sure youd find stitching easier wouldnt you she said if you took off that black sling of a thing the injured wife still advertised her hurt on occasion no answered the lady shortly pursing her lips i shouldnt wouldnt you now said the slut and settled herself down for a tease she was a born chatterer as glib at retort as she was garrulous and the bump of reverence had been wholly denied her she looked very pretty nevertheless in her evening frock of flowered lutestring with her bright hair tumbling over her bright cheeks and dressed at each temple with a knot of pink ribbon well theres no accounting for tastes if id hurt my arm i should either forget the bruise or forget my work they dont pull together i havent hurt my arm not it was bitten by a dog sakes now what made him do it what makes any dog bite an evil disposition i suppose you werent taking his bone away from him by chance not i hes welcome to a whole skeleton of bones for me all except the spare rib maybe his lordship from his place apart went ha ha and immediately looked furiously solemn my lady beyond a slight flushing of the cheek showed no consciousness of the interruption moll turned in her chair leaning her arms on the back and her chin on her crossed hands thats you she said is your book so funny killing answered chesterfield tis tis a tract on drainage lord now how humoursome no wonder it makes you roar but sure theres no laughter in your face you look as cross as a good friday bun zounds im amused i tell you he said as amused as a dog when a cat arches her back at him ive seen more amused things than that come prithee leave your book and let us talk what do you want to read for when a guest is by o just to occupy my mind put something into nothing do you mean well tis better empty than filled with drainage he laughed without hilarity but laid aside his reading well said he i am at your service thats right she said and so well make a merry company we three the best in the middle and the bread on each side like a duck sandwich little merriment in a sandwich to my thinking why so there isnt tis a poor substitute for the stomach a very poor substitute a man might better own a bread basket but that was too much for mrs davis she bridled instantly offended you vulgar beast ill have you know im not to be spoken to like that curse you there is nothing more incommensurable to be sure than the particular standards of decorum which obtain with people of mrs molls station now as then chesterfields eyebrows went up he shook with a little inward laughter why says he im all amazement twas but a faon de parler or as we call it a figure of speech well you can keep that part of speechs figure to yourself i will though ive got enough of my own come forgive my offence what were we discussing sandwiches well i say theyre a poor manner of food the man that invented them meant well but he went the wrong way about with it they should be a slice of bread between two slices of meat to my taste he must ha been like kits friend who always did the right thing and did it wrong she was constantly referring to this kit neither of her hearers had a notion as to who was the individual alluded to though each supposed it to be some one familiar to the others knowledge the lady of course thought it a woman the gentleman a man the name you see as applicable to a member of either sex was one very well chosen for abstract purposes it enabled her to keep up an assumption of understood references while avoiding the danger of specific instances kit was made the mouthpiece of quite a number of imaginary characters he or she might or might not have had some existence in fact even to a certain association with that mythical personage her husband in whom by the by hamilton had scant belief but for oracular purposes it mattered nothing whether kit were a derivation or a creation the enigma however had this whimsical effect both husband and wife became presently consumed with such an insatiable curiosity to penetrate the secret of kits identity that they felt like to burst under the weight of silence which the irony of circumstance had imposed on them what friend of kits was that inquired his lordship he was a plumber answered moll and turned on her hostess have you ever had a friend a plumber it was as though she had suddenly shot a jet of iced water over the daughter of the duke of ormonde kate started quivered and sat rigid never she gasped out well said moll i dont blame you theyve a smell about them of putty and warm tallow that isnt appetizing but this friend of kits was worse than most he never mended a broken pipe but what he shut up some of his tools in it first or stopped one leak without opening two arent you feeling well never mind my feelings the response came arctic im not accustomed to having them considered by the friends of plumbers was implied what a shame now if tis your arm thats hurting you dont stand on ceremony but get to bed we can manage alone somehow the earl raised his eyebrows positively petrified how dared the baggage mock the other thus however much her friend it could be nothing but her obsession about himself and his fatal attraction which emboldened her so to range herself as it were under the protection of his guns lady chesterfield her cheek aglow rose to her feet this is becoming insufferable she began and stopped biting her lip youve forgotten your sling said moll youve forgotten yourself said kate disdainfully and with a shrug resumed her seat but perhaps that is an advantage mrs davis jumped up with a ringing laugh what a company of crosspatches she cried the sandwich doesnt seem to be a success you come in the middle phil and be the duck he grinned but in a half scared way she had never yet ventured so far as to call him by his christian name he was feeling suddenly rather helpless taken off his feet by the excess of the storm he had himself invited when she ran to him and pulled at his coat he resisted feebly come and be the duck she chirped with laughter what a face to grin through a horse collar o look intelligent she shook him what shall we do play games hot cockles say or she released him and stood with deliberating finger on lip no that would never do dumb crambo what do you say to that she glanced with comical plaintiveness from one mute figure to the other but you dont look very playful either of you i wish kit was here youd never be able to resist kit whatever you do me chesterfield cleared his throat fingering the cravat at it is kit such a wag said he just was the answer and good at games there was never such a one for make believe a happy disposition but then as to happiness kit isnt married of course her ladyship in an uncontrollable spasm whisked about kit mrs davis has never suffered that most cruel of disillusionments and then they went at it alternately each pointedly addressing not the other and tossing the hypothetical kit between them as if that epicene individual were the most familiar of shuttlecocks kit is to be congratulated mrs davis said his lordship kit has chosen the better course mrs davis said her ladyship matrimony is the shadow of felicity mrs davis for which men like the dog in the fable drop the substance men you see are beasts mrs davis and not only beasts but silly beasts they dont know when they are well off mrs davis but women do mrs davis when men insist on remaining single a pity for them then mrs davis that they dont insist on remaining single too a great pity mrs davis but women are in everything self sacrificing they know how to take consolation for their injuries mrs davis the one lesson for which they are thankfully indebted to men mrs davis take care what youre confessing to mrs davis or what calumnies you are making poor kit responsible for mrs davis said her ladyship with a little contemptuous laugh o kit is the devil shouted the earl his wrath till then steadily crescendo exploding in a clap moll with a shriek of laughter put her little hands to her ears lud she cried ive never confessed to so much before without knowing it and to think kit is come to be the devil after all she lowered her hands to clap them and at that moment the doors were flung open and mr hamilton was announced he came in from attending the court a brilliant figure all silk and velvet with bows to his shoes a foot wide and deep ruffles of lace falling from his knees over his calves his teeth showed in a little tentative smile their whiteness emphasized by the thread of moustache no thicker than an eyebrow which adorned his upper lip while his glance swift and comprehensive took in the essentials of the situation on which he had alighted his young kinswoman sprang to greet him with a cry of gladness oh bien rencontr mon beau cousin you are welcome as health after sickness she positively seemed to fawn on him while chesterfield black and splenetic scowled from his place across the room hamilton was hugely gratified but prudence necessitated his discounting this demonstration in the kindest way possible he laughed and very gently putting aside the caressing hands answered sufficiently audibly troth kate if this is your malady it appears in a more attractive form than most and then lowering his voice he spoke her aside who is this stranger you should know she replied hardly deigning to respond in kind was it not you that warned me of her coming ah he said seeming enlightened and just perceptibly shrugged his shoulders is that so well make us known to one another child for theres no situation possible here without you said you had seen her never to be remembered by her i prithee kate she could not it stuck in her throat but she conceded this much she waved him with her hand towards the other two where they stood together hamilton made the best of it will you phil says he skipping up before with a killing smile for the lady chesterfield had no choice but to respond mrs davis he said in a voice that seemed to carry an oath behind it this is my friend mr george hamilton moll curtsied a wicked little winkle in her eye and the gentleman left hand on chest right extended and right toe advanced and pointed swept a bow the very exaggeration of courtly charmed said he sure said moll you were speaking said he when it was my misfortune to interrupt you was i said she now i remember it was about kit was it faith and whos kit kits the devil the devil he is i never said he now she then nor she kits kit zounds neither man nor woman zounds why not doesnt something come between man and woman what comes why the devil sure ah then kit is the devil indeed kit is not kit is what the devil comes between wait now i scent a quibble kit stands for christopher and kit stands for katherine both man and woman they go arm in arm not they why chris could never look at a woman without blushing and how about kate o she shed go arm in arm with a pair of breeches my lord laughed half vexedly she never could you know moll turned on him twas you not me called kit the devil why dont you answer for your own and with a manner of playful fretfulness she began to tease and rally him sotto voce hamilton looked with a grin at his cousin then moved to rejoin her she stood with set lips and a disdainful frown on her brow how can you encourage such intolerable stuff she said in an undertone as he approached come with me into the window he answered low and rebelling a moment she succumbed it was a large room and the movement secured them a relative privacy stuff it may be said he but tis the sort of ready flippancy which leads your philip stanhopes by the nose is there any truth in this kit how should i know or care some former flame of his belike with whom they play to perplex and insult me it is no concern of mine i am done with him is that true cousin he looked at her very earnestly nay i can see you are not speaking the truth can you see what true masculine eyes i tell you that having formed my resolve i am quite unconcerned and happy ah women think themselves what they want to be that is why they never understand when they are accused of being what they are indeed and pray what am i that i do not think myself jealous never jealous i say or you were not still so obsessed that you could fail to play the game i set you what game o what game says she why his game or fatuity make him jealous hoist him with his own petard and see this common jade deposed affecting while he spoke the simplest conversational manner he had an acute eye all the time for the two across the room he observed the little attention the earl was paying to the wiles besieging him his disturbed glances his way the morose suspicion of his expression and he knew that the man was still too corroded with jealousy to play adequately the part assigned him and in so far the decoy had failed it seemed to justify her uses it was evident that as chesterfield had stated she had begun to weary him a perilous situation which must be stopped from developing itself at whatever cost but this mischief had reserves of fascination not yet brought into action kates own guitar the famous instrument lay on a table hard by the sight of it brought one of these reserves most opportunely into his mind if he dared but he must dare kate looked at her beguiler queerly i had forgotten she said thank you cousin is your advice very disinterested to that extreme said he that i offer myself if you will the fond instrument to this provocation purely to serve you believe me why watch him now and judge if for all his misbehaviour he would relish that sort of retort on his infidelity i will not watch him she said or even look at him you are very kind to me cousin i will think on what you say he was so elated that he decided on the venture lifting the guitar he ran his fingers over the strings this mrs davis said he advancing a few steps is thought as no doubt you have been informed the finest instrument of its kind in london do you play the girls eyes sparkled if she had a soul it was to be evoked small and indefinite through music hamilton had calculated on that effect i play she said give it me her ladyship exclaimed angrily no put it away cousin i will not have it so misused he laughed o kate never so churlish those fingers ill go bail were not made for hurt or discord i prithee sweet kate give it me said moll entreatingly ill use it so ill make you all love me too indignant and too proud to protest further the young countess contented herself by flinging into a chair where she sat with her back turned obstinately on the performer and moll played her fingers fluttering over the strings like butterflies and drawing honey wheresoever they alighted it was not great music accomplished soul stirring but it was very natural and very moving quite true quite simple welling from the little spring that was her one pure sincerity and presently just as sympathetically when notes and chords are struck you may see a caged birds throat swell and throb until the responsive rapture comes irresistibly bubbling forth and overflowing her voice melted into or took up the melodious refrain her hands were shaping and in a moment she was singing a little song as sweet as a thrush upon a tree when my love comes o i will not upbraid him he meant but for kindness the gift that he gave is he to blame for the heaven that made him a heart full of tenderness meet to enslave when my love comes i will promise him roses gift for the gift that he laid in my breast o for that promise his kindness discloses will he not kiss me and make me his blest theres a cry in the air of the cuckoo sweet comer the daffodils blow and theres green on the tree theres a nest in the roof that is empty since summer when my love comes will he warm it for me it took her hearers by surprise hamilton not least he was so moved indeed for the moment that he failed to observe its effect on chesterfield they all dwelt silent for a little while the girl conscious of the impression she had made looked down still softly touching the strings and then in a twinkle her mood changed she shook her curls laughed touched out a lively air and began to dance her dancing was like her playing her singing native unaffected captivating a rhythm of lightness seeming to mock gravitation it was to help to make her famous by and by in days when the susceptible mr pepys was to go into raptures over seeing little miss davis jigging at the play end and indeed it was very pretty so elf like so unforced it roused the enthusiasm of at least two of her company when laughing and rosy she ceased chesterfield came to her all in a glow it was prettier than the frisking of your own lambs said he did you learn it of a shepherds piping and your song of the nightingale i vow i envy the country its possession of such a corisande my lady rose from her chair and without turning her head walked erect from the room hamilton watching the earl with a furtive smile heard her go and breathed a silent benediction on his own success chapter viii mr pepys to mention him once again kept as we know a commonplace book in which he was accustomed to jot down in shorthand let us hope the good stories post prandial and otherwise which came his way it must have been a rich if unseemly collection and is ill lost in these days to a world which whatever its mental capital has never more than enough of refreshing anecdotes to go round included in it one may be sure were those gems of information as related in the diary proffered at my lord crewes table by one templer on the habits of the viper and the tarantula this mr templer we note was a clergyman and by virtue of his cloth should be exonerated from the suspicion otherwise irresistible that he was pulling our samuels fat leg but it is worth quoting the passage in extenso that the reader may judge for himself he told us some ie serpents in the waste places of lancashire do grow to a great bigness and do feed upon larkes which they take thus they observe when the lark is soared to the highest and do crawl till they come to be just underneath them and there they place themselves with their mouth uppermost and there as is conceived they do eject poyson upon the bird for the bird do suddenly come down again in its course of a circle and falls directly into the mouth of the serpent which is very strange it is very strange and that lark at his highest be it observed how many hundred feet up and the stupendous accuracy of the aim but mr templer was a great traveller and of course therefore not at all a great liar and necessarily on the other hand too shrewd a man to be himself taken in by the gammoning of local naturalists of the tarantula he goes on to say that all the harvest long in italy presumably there are fiddlers go up and down the fields everywhere in expectation of being hired by those that are stung bless him and bless his admirable chronicler who never recorded a more ingenious tale save that perhaps which relates of his friend batalier the jovial but conscienceless cheapening a butt of bordeaux wine of some merchant on the score that it was soured by a thunderstorm the said storm having been just produced by an artful rogue hired to counterfeit the noise of one with rain and hail upon a deale board an incident which reminds one of peter simple and captain kearney but for mr pepyss book of tales no part of it survives so far as i know to supplement the diary or very possibly there might be found in it some mention of the adventure of jack bannister with the cly faker this adventure had befallen our musician some time before his encounter with the clerk of the acts which had turned out so signally to his advantage and one may be certain that the grateful protg in the course of unburdening his heart to that generous patron would not have omitted to mention an incident so poignantly associated with his recent hard experiences the story however may be given in our own words in the days precedent to that lucky contretemps in duke street sad jack had once possessed a donkey acquiring the beast by a stroke of good fortune through a raffle conducted in an inn yard over the effects of a deceased tinker he had used her to bear the burden of the instrument which in his ploddings abroad made so heavy physical an addition to the weight of melancholy which oppressed him thenceforth patient griselda acted the part of minstrel boy to the wandering harpist bearing on her sturdy little back the dumb intervals between performance and performance and standing apathetic by while the pence for her nights board and lodging and her masters were being charmed from a reluctant public she was a docile little ass and intelligent and between her and her owner was quickly established a comradeship which made their too soon severance a source of poignant grief to at least the human one of them it happened in this way they came chancing together one day into the broad thoroughfare of cornhill where about the neighbourhood of the great conduit near the east end they halted and prepared for their parts here hard by stood the tun or lock up a square detached building used for the temporary impounding of night offenders and it may have been their contiguity to that place of ill savour which procured them the company which was responsible for their separation rogues gravitate of instinct towards the gallows and your thief is never to be found hovering so certainly as about the buildings where justice inhabits however that might be and whether it were owing to the insolvency or the insensibility of his audience i cannot say but the net result to the musician showed itself in such a beggarly taking that he was driven to bring his performance to a short end with a view to shifting his ground and endeavouring to discover a more profitable pitch he loaded up griselda and moved off his expression perhaps reflecting the nature of his inward disappointment but he had not trudged fifty paces when his dismal preoccupation became conscious of a voice that pursued and arrested him hillo my troll away he turned about to see a figure approaching it was that of a common young fellow white faced dirty but with a world of shifty cunning in his diminutive optics his dress some refuse of finery cheapened from the hangman overhung his puny limbs he had packthread in his shoes and he wore his hat with a jack a dandy cock that did nothing but emphasize its extreme age and greasiness no one less unworldly than our musician would have stopped to parley with a creature so obviously questionable but in truth jack was in the slang of the canting tribe a born buzzard or pigeon what now demanded he heard ye said the stranger coming up with a rather panting grin harping it yonder over against lobs pound and thinks i to myself here be the very man for my master what master the stranger jerked his thumb over his shoulder salvator they call him a great learned doctor well what about him a needs a merry andrew so to speak i fail to smoke you friend one to play outside his door and attract custom ah he thought he understood it was being suggested that he should devote his gift to the services of an empiric by drawing siren like chance patients to his lure well why not there was no moral degradation implied in the business this salvator might be a perfectly honest practitioner and in any case his own art would be used for no purpose baser than its wont to procure him that was to say a profitable audience and with that his responsibility would cease the issue for salvator would be his own affair he thought of the comparative rest implied of his empty pockets what sayest thou grisel said he the little she ass grunted a small purr of affection would he make it worth my while asked jack of the pallid rogue take my word fort says he and demand your own terms the musician hesitated a moment longer then succumbed after all he was committing himself to no more than an interview lead on he said and the rascal going before he followed with the beast in his tracks they were here in a wide place of gabled houses all having stalls below with a common pent roof over and signs of trades innumerable hung like flags from its eaves out of this spacious thoroughfare they turned sharply into an alley sunless like a ravine from the overtopping of its tenements but full of life and bustle this was birchin lane much inhabited of dealers in second hand frippery and upholstery yet with spaces of quiet between where in the shadows lurked here and there a doorway enclosing some business less officious in its character and before one of these doors the stranger stopped a modest sign hung over it showing the inscription salvator physician with a tiny pestle and mortar depicted in the top outer corner and its base was sunk a single step below the street level wait you here said the fellow the whiles i go before to acquaint my master he rapped on the door with the iron knocker shaped like a sphinx that hung there and in a little it was opened to him by a strong hard faced woman who inquired his business that fact again should have warned our harpist but the man was a dreamer and simpleton he noted only that his escort was admitted and thereafter was content to await his reappearance with patience salvator sat alone in an upper room when the rogue was shown in to him the physician was of a piece with his chamber moth blown and fusty he wore a long black robe with a fur tippet and a fur cap was on his head from which his locks hung down the colour of dry ginger he looked spoiled and stained from much handling of medicaments and his jaw seemed to goggle with his eyes the room beyond a table an astral globe a bookcase stuffed with treatises and a chair or two possessed little furniture and no sign whatever of the usual mummified paraphernalia of a dealer in the healing arts he turned from his occupation of filling a test tube from a glass phial to face somewhat impatiently the visitor well friend and what is thy need the rogue fumbled his doffed hat none of my own master but my brothers a waits in the street below unwitting of my purpose what need what purpose state state and be done with it the purpose to have his wits cured if so be i can entice him into your honours presence what then hath befallen his wits what not great sir a thinks every one he meets doth owe him money and importunes the same for payment a kleptomaniacal symptom from mental possession to material you did well to approach me timely since when but i can judge nothing without i see him send him up to me mayhap hell be persuaded so he come alone but hell ask you payment that were to put the cart before the horse to fee the patient husteron proteron but dispatch dispatch the rogue descended to the street and took griseldas bridle from her master go make your own terms said he as if well pleased while i hold this a waits you up above soberly and without suspicion the musician mounted the stairs at the top salvator met him and conducting him into his room shut the door a moment said he while i examine your eyes he took a lens to the astonished man and effected a minute scrutiny muttering the while a visible wildness dilation of the pupil and congestion you have never slept in the moonlight now never sir hm nor been disappointed of a fortune nor suffered a blow on the head nor brooded on the covetous infidelity of a loved mistress will you tell me plainly sir what are the terms you offer for my services well come to that though tis true a physician usually asks a fee not gives it my services are to you good man then sir i decline at once what pay you for bringing you custom you bring me none i assure you if not yourself ill bring you none indeed nor prostitute my art to such a bargain why do you think i lead the life i do for pleasure what life now the life of a beggar sir the life of one who harps about the streets for alms harps do not you know else why was i brought here why indeed your brother must explain brother what brother him that came first a stranger sir who accosted me in the streets not half an hour gone and brought me on plea of an engagement to you his master his master not i id never set eyes on the man before one blank minute the musician stood staring at the speaker then turned and pounding down the stairs half crying half sobbing as he went a thief a thief a rogue stop him hes robbed me burst from the door and into the street the stranger had disappeared the beast the instrument beloved pet and the means to a livelihood all vanished at a stroke aimless distracted with skirts flying bannister flew hither and thither seeking and questioning some scoffed at him some sympathized not one had any clue to offer amid that labyrinth of lanes and byways stretching its network to the very waterside it had been easy for the scamp to make good his escape exhausted and broken the musician had to desist at last from his efforts to do him justice the poor fellow lamented more for his griselda than for his instrument though the loss of the latter presented the more desperate problem to him he could not afford from his scanty savings enough to buy him a new harp and without one how was he to procure himself a living in a last hope that he might find his conclusions premature and the truants back where he had left them he was returning dejectedly to the scene of his bereavement when he caught sight of the figure of salvator peering from his own doorway what fortune quoth the medicus with anxiety and the other his lips grimly pursed only shook his head come in good man and explain said the physician kindly since i perceive there is more here than meets the eye and that i have been in some manner i wot not of the unconscious instrument of your undoing nay by your favour i who have been giving good advice all my years of discretion may yet find enough to help a fellow creatures necessity it was such a revelation of human charity that sad jack was moved to comply he followed that good samaritan to his sanctum and there with some heartfelt lamenting for his ravished pet frankly confided to sympathetic ears his circumstances and the nature of the trick which had victimized him he had no reason to repent his candour a practised if a generous reader of humankind salvator was soon enough convinced of the innate honesty and simplicity of soul which underlay the frozen surface of this nature he saw a man here to be commiserated and trusted and in the end to cut the story short agreed to advance him the price of a new instrument on the mere undertaking that he should repay the loan in such instalments as his success might justify and to that arrangement very delicately suggested bannister was persuaded to subscribe it was indeed an oasis to have discovered in this desert of a great city and when in the course of months fame and fortune at the instigation of an appreciative patron leaped upon the humble street player he did not forget to whom his success had been primarily due but he sought out salvator in his abode and insisted on renting from him at a princely figure a suite of upper rooms in the house in birchin lane and there he made his lodging greatly to the satisfaction of his landlord who for all he was in no need of having patients harped to his door was yet by far too upright a man ever to be counted a rich one phlebotomy the conduct of a clyster the sane mixing of a potion the spreading of an adequate plaster what more he would say to his tenant is needed to fulfil the functions of an honest practitioner there be some plain quacksalvers who seeking to supplement the legitimate by abstruse suggestion adorn their chambers with the dried bodies of toads crocadilloes venomous asps contained in spirit and other such monstra horrenda of a cheating fancy whereby indeed if they show their improbity they exhibit a true knowledge of the uses of the imagination which will for ever pay to mystery the treble of what reason would pay to knowledge but not of such suggestio falsi is my dealing and though i suffer by it i would rather suffer in the company of galen than prosper in that of cornelius tilbury yet says bannister pointing to the astral globe you are not it seems for limiting your prescriptions to the terrestrial why answered salvator whose real unprofessional name by the way was shovel am i so dense and blind to the sources of light and life as to claim an independence for our planet the herb is as much of heaven as the star and the sign manual of our origin is printed on man and flower alike so must we consult man for heaven and heaven for man his lines his indications whether derived from this celestial house or the other for which reason i believe in astrology as in chiromancy since both guide me to the association of a particular humour in a patients blood with its corresponding cause and remedy they all being contained in his nativity or horoscope that is to say man and season and herb alike without subscribing to the fantastical conceits of gaule and indagine who profess to find in the palm of the hand a country of seven hills each as it were a watershed laced with innumerable descending rivulets of tendency i confess that i see no reason why what life hath marked on a man the source of life had not in the first instance predestined there light is what i seek and that comes not from the earth so was this worthy doctor sane humane and religious in one a very practical samaritan yet as it came to appear not all his honest theories were able to serve him in the single direction where most he pined to see them vindicated he was a widower and possessed of an only child a hopelessly crippled boy of fifteen bannister had been an inmate of the house for a full week before he learned of the existence of this pathetic incubus the building was well sized its upper part until he came to occupy it delivered to gloom and emptiness and to reach his rooms he had to pass by a door on the first landing which in his early notice of it was invariably closed but one night as he went by he observed the door ajar and saw a light and heard a voice within the voice was not that of his landlord nor of the hard faced woman who acted as his sole servant and housekeeper it was a weak voice and a querulous and it seemed to be expostulating over the meagreness of some concession grudgingly vouchsafed the musician paused in some astonishment resting momentarily the foot of the harp he shouldered on a stair tread he never parted from his loved instrument though in these days he used a good packhorse to convey it to and from the places where he performed it was near midnight and the house but for the voice was dead silent the woman after admitting him had preceded him up the flight and vanished it had never occurred to him that the place contained other than the two with whom he was familiar he stood petrified for the moment and as the sound of his footstep ceased so did that of the low and feeble complaint and then suddenly the woman came to the door and appeared before him bannister had always rather mentally recoiled from this person her bony sallowness her silence the gloom of seeming tragedy in her eyes he never learned from first to last what was her history and yet if tragedy there were connected with it it had likely proved a tragedy no more heroic than that of lovelessness and drudgery and the hard resignation to that lot of unfulfilment which foredoomed of personal ill favour is perhaps to a woman the bitterest tragedy of all she served him and waited on him well she did everything efficiently save smile yet for all her unemotional presence he thought he perceived now in the guttering light of the landing lamp a sign of perturbation on her face i was surprised he said and stopped no witting eavesdropper i thought i heard a voice i did not recognize twas colins she said anan he used being country bred the country expression colins she repeated the masters child i never knew he had one one she responded like an echo and ill hes always ill poor boy does this vigil signify she answered the unfinished question he wanted the door left ajar that he might see you pass with your harp see me pass aye since he cannot hear you play he looked at her in silence then in a quick unaccountable impulse placed a firm hand on her arm let me go in and almost to his wonder she acquiesced and moved aside to admit him it was a fair sized room and quite handsomely appointed what luxuries the house could command seemed mostly accumulated here there were soft mats on the floor jewels of stained glass let into the diamond paned casements a silver lamp glowing among books and illuminated manuscripts strewed over a table and in the midst in vivid contrast with the dark panelling on a white bed lay a white boy his face which for its structure might have been a pretty one was wasted to the bone his eyes were prominent and of an unearthly blue though fifteen he looked in weight and size less than a child of nine sad sad is it to see young life in any sickness its pathetic patience its uncomplaining acceptance of its cruel uncomprehended heritage but sadder is the sight of one doomed from his cradle to pain and helplessness to be born like this to death not life to the visible processes of dissolution from the very threshold of existence to be fated never to know but by report the meaning of health as the blind must shape in their imaginations the world they can never see truly that is to suffer the worst loss of possession which is never to have possessed while reading in the happiness of others the measure of ones own eternal deprivation here was some constitutional atrophy already fifteen years ago disputing with its unborn victim the world to come and proving on release stronger than the life it clung to the boy had been an invalid from his birth a lamp guttering before it was well lighted a nativity most fondly lending itself one would have thought to the triumphant vindication of its parent doctrines but that vindication never came the father could not cure his child and there was the anguish the life he loved most on earth was the life that most baffled his efforts to mend and prolong it his arts could not even win it surcease from the mortal languor and weariness which accompanied its dissolution he felt himself a hypocrite an impostor in the eyes that turning to him for relief found only helplessness and impotence he who to all others was so glib in professional assurance had nothing here to offer but empty commiseration and an agony of devotion it was very pitiful bannister pausing a moment on the threshold stepped softly in with wonder and compassion at his heart the boy propped up on his pillows regarded his entrance with shy fascinated eyes but the grave face of the new comer its simplicity its kindly melancholy were nothing but reassuring adjuncts to the midnight quiet of the room the musician shifted the harp from his shoulder would you like to hear me play he said here and now in the silence of the house the instant rapture called to the emaciated features was his sufficient answer he smiled cannot you sleep he said it is late to lie awake the boy shook his head what is time to me sir he said it without affectation it had seemed less touching otherwise well said bannister it must be a lydian measure lest those more concerned with sleep than we resent it lie still child while i drug thy tired brain he knew his own power in that way which is the last from vainglory true genius has no self consciousness it was his soul that played his fingers obeying and what conceit can there be in immortality seated he touched the strings and his soul spoke spoke all the pity and soft sympathy which were its burden it was tender music sighing sweetly subdued to the occasion and as he proceeded he lost himself in it lost all but the sense of that divine compassion which was moving and inspiring him still the sure instinct of the artist came presently to decree a period and ending short of surfeit on a dying note he came to earth the child was lying with closed lids heavy tears trickling from them upon the pillow the woman stood in the shadows one hand placed over her eyes what faint angelic melodies must have stricken half fearfully half joyfully the ears of dark watchers in the streets that night stepping very gently the musician bent above the boy good night colin he whispered and shall i come again anon with a convulsive movement two thin arms were flung about his neck o come come again and play to me i will come but now my child i am very weary see i will leave my harp to stand with you all night in earnest of my promise as he opened the door a gaunt and ghastly apparition faced him it was the father himself awakened and brought from his bed in doubt and trembling he closed the latch and turning on the musician seized him by the arms in a fierce and strenuous grip i was listening i was watching he whispered hoarsely shall i curse you or love you and then he fell upon his knees pawing and mumbling the sensitive hands no no he gasped in a broken voice be you his true physician not like this empty charlatan who for all his pretended knowledge hath never learned the magic that one touch of thy hands can dispense chapter ix and so the musician and the dying boy were made friends a quaint brief intimacy which the former could never recall in after years without a pang half pitiful half humorous for its oddity its relation here is purely in the nature of an interlude and may be wholly skipped without hurt to the main narrative by those who have an unconquerable repugnance of sentiment but for those others whether the majority or not i do not know who like to warm their hearts now and then at the little fire of compassion the episode as constituting an odd chapter in the life of a famous executant may possess a transitory charm it is for them it is narrated from that poignant midnight bannister both by day and evening was often in the sick boys room by nature tender hearted how indeed could he deny to suffering that wonderful new emollient discovered in his art his music succeeded where all dietetics therapeutics pharmaceutics lenitives palliatives analeptics galenics and other such ics and ives as appertain to orthodox leechcraft had failed however fondly applied to give relief it was an anodyne under which peace and resignation came gradually to be substituted for the weary fretfulness which long fruitless devotion had only helped to aggravate the father saw and sighed and was sadly grateful often he would come and listen to the throbbing strains sitting quite quietly apart and watching with a furtive wistfulness the rapt face on which all his ministering love had never been able to draw such lines of restful content and the slackness of his jaw on these occasions seemed somehow to add a curious pathos to the moral he had meant so well and done so little but it was not alone on the subject of music that the stranger and child drew together one could not for that matter always be harping and in the intervals at odd times they conversed much and familiarly and generally on recondite themes they were both in their different ages and degrees mystics the older from temperament the younger from his spiritual isolation lying there through the age long seasons what commune was possible to him but with fancies and unrealities the world was a shadow to him only his dreams were actual for them his fruitfullest pastures lay in the spars and splinters of jewelled light which glowed from the stained glass in the casement thence he gathered or thereinto read the strange phantasies which haunted his brain thoughts and visions which were like things glimpsed from beyond the veil this glass was old work acquired piecemeal from many sources and let into the upper halves of the windows without correlation in its parts and with no regard but for effect a disarrangement infinitely more suggestive than any formal pattern a few leaves a golden apple a section of trellis a hand grasping a sword hilt here and there a head of saint or warrior such interspersed with spaces of plain glass crimson or deep blue or sunny yellow formed the embroidered patchwork for a thousand fancies to play about one had to remember hearing the childs strange brooding rhapsodies thereon the years which his shrunken appearance belied moreover the intellectual light in him as is frequently the case with cripples was precocious abnormally brilliant and though he confessed his dreams to a lesser intellect it was to a corresponding sympathy the simple of heart are often the purest of vision bright wits must whet themselves on the concrete they cannot sharpen on abstractions it is for the unworldly to know what they cannot speak and so it was with this harpist there was one fragment which more than any other fascinated the boy it was in colour a splendid azure mysteriously liquid and on it hung from nowhere a little white hand minutely finished to the nails whose had it been what queens or angels sometimes he would say when the lamp is low and there is moonlight in the street i see it move and then a shadow grows above and out of it a face too dim to distinguish but if i shut my eyes i know it has come down and is bending over me the lady mother belike colin think you so dear jack it were sweet to have a mother in my room do you ever see faces framed in little blots of light when you close your lids hard surely i do what are they whence do they come i have no memories of such in all my life they are strangers to me yet as clear and actual as yours i look on now human the faces of men and women some good some evil but if i try to hold and fix em they slide and melt this one laughing that wickedly deriding i know them evanescent phantoms that poise like the shining dragonfly one instant on wing and so you make a movement to look closer are gone darted to extinction well may they not be the faces of those we saw through former eyes of ours in lives before this life the boy lay staring at him pondering his words as if half tranced i think you say truth he answered presently what odd surprises come floating sometimes into ones head like glimpses of a great secret bright bubbles that break just as you seem on the point of remembering what the lovely little pictures in them are reflections of that is a bubble of yours i have often tried to catch what does it seem to tell you child it seems to tell me how i that am i must have been since the beginning of things how i must have lain in the life that was the first life as surely as i lay in the life that was my mother think back and you will find it must be all through the countless ages i have been passed on from prison to prison waiting the release which is to come to me at length in death is to come to me through this last phase of conscious existence which is indeed my trial and sentence and then the scaffold jack we all have to mount the scaffold and at last the opened door the escape the rapture and i shall remember why it all was he clasped his thin hands his face seemed lit up with an inward glow like a porcelain lamp enclosing a dim flame is not that what you mean he said i think it is colin yet what could that imperishable seed have known until this last phase of realities for it the faces could not have existed why not since they existed for the lives of which it was that is true life is not contained in this or that of me but is the sum of all the casement formed a shallow recess of five lights it stood opposite the bed looking out on the street dimly seen through its latticed lower half the houses across the lane towered like dark phantoms with their faces to the north they were never but plunged in gloom but when the south sun was high and struck upon the stained glass the contrastive glow to tranced eyes made them appear impalpable things that was how the boy liked to regard them silvery abodes of mystery where any strange things might be happening and appearing framed between the floor and that upper frieze of glowing transparencies then the lower windows looked mere cobwebs in which sparks and glints of light hung caught like fireflies it was all a dream of mist and sparkle in which the sense of close confinement seemed dissolving but it was not so for the most part he hated the houses in their common hard aspect of nearness and oppression only when the rain fell thickly spouting from their eaves and gutters and half hiding them behind a veil of dropping water or when the snow clinging to their sills and window frames seemed to cut them into sugared sections could he endure to look on them without impatience they were the jealous barriers which imprisoned him from the infinite some boys so conditioned would have found their main pathetic interest in such sights and sounds of outer life as might penetrate to them in their isolation it was not so with him his spirit like an entombed flower yearned always towards the light stretching pallidly in a vain passion to attain the blue heaven of health and freedom perhaps strange little soul he was happiest in those long moonlit nights when the curtains being drawn about the lower casement he and his jewelled book of stories in the window were left alone together then he would lie for hours quite motionless as if hypnotized his eyes fixed on the dimly luminous scroll dreaming what unearthly dreams only the painted heads themselves might tell he liked to hear the watchman crying out the hours hollow and mysterious in the streets below he loved to see by day the not unrare vision of a pigeon pecking and preening on his window sill or the shadow of a hopping sparrow cross the panes those were his events until the harp came and then all at once he was transformed some long dumb chord in his soul leaped and vibrated to the rapture with a force that shook the life out of him i think that was the truth he died to all intents of joy the frail frame could not stand the exquisite tension of the bliss evoked in it now in the days of that brief friendship scarce one day passed but found the boy and man at some time together there was no more midnight playing but bannister would look in as occasion offered and mostly with his instrument accompanying then there would be sweet music a spell and talk a spell and perhaps unutterable silences to link them somehow it suggested the soul affinity formal but transcendent between a dying saint and his confessor there was a subtle thrill in the atmosphere of which all were conscious bannister himself the father the woman with the hard pathetic face whose eyes were always hidden by her hand when she was privileged to listen to the music they felt it like an unseen presence a sense of warning of change as when one feels spring moving in the grass under ones feet and not one would own to itself that it knew yet they all knew always to the last it was the little white hand in the blue pane which most fascinated the boy his wandering fancy would lose itself among the cluster of leaves as in an antique forest would find in the glowing fruit a very garden of hesperus sweet with nightingales and the warm scent of flowers would endow with a hundred characters the faces peering from that arras of bright hues but it was to the hand he for ever returned its beauty its severed mystery i should dearly like to learn to whom it belonged he would say but this i know very well if i could only reach it it would help me up and away it is the boy christs i think it was on a dark midsummer morning chill and stormy that the end came there had been signs and in their hearts they were prepared the father sat by his childs pillow holding one of the frail hands in his the woman dry eyed and silent busied herself noiselessly among the shadows near the foot of the bed sat the musician his harp before him touching little more than a melodious murmur from its strings he faced the casement which because of the wind had been close shut perhaps it was the drugged stillness of the room the spell wrought upon his brain by the soft woven paces of the chords his fingers trod perhaps he really dreamt but this is what seemed to happen before his eyes he was gazing unconscious that he was gazing on the window when he saw the shadow of a dove moving on the sill outside it dipped and strutted curtseying back and forth as if restless or impatient and as it hurried now this way now that of a sudden the noise of the wind ceased utterly and a flood of sunlight broke upon the window and in that same moment the player noticed a little white hand at the latch and the casement swung noiselessly open there was a sigh as of wings within without and his fingers stopped on a broken chord and as he stared dazzled incredulous he heard a quick rustle behind him and a startled cry my god hes gone he rose he turned half stupefied and saw the father on his feet bending with an agonized expression over the face on the pillow it was quite still a ray of sunlight touched it a smile of the most rapturous peace was on its lips in a spasm of emotion he caught the poor mans hand in one of his and with the other pointed mutely to the open window the physician giving vent to his tears leaned himself upon his shoulder twas thy music he said broke his prison and freed his soul twas thy unselfish love said bannister freed the music the woman her stern face all softened and agitated went to close the casement nay dame said the father let be he cannot take cold now to think he is seeing the blue sky and the white clouds for the first time and at that she cast herself upon the floor and hid her face only the convulsive heaving of her body witnessed to the breaking of the storm which had been so long pent up within her alas what unsuspected woman was revealed here what passion undercrushed and what desolation it was remarked that night in spring garden that never yet had the famous harpist so divinely justified his reputation he played like one transported lost to earth many of his ravished audience were in tears while the very pigeons petted and fearless seemed to gather about his feet nay there was one it was said a tender white dove that flew to his shoulder and settled there for a while making love at his ear but that may pass for a legend chapter x it may appear to some people that hamilton was taking a prodigious amount of trouble to reach by a roundabout way a conclusion at least as presumptively attainable by direct means as by sinuous and in this connection montroses quatrain may possibly occur to them he either fears his fate too much or his desert is small who dares not put it to the touch to gain or lose it all without however stopping to defend or disallow the moral applicability of these lines to our case in point it may be offered to such objectors that generally speaking the rewards most hardly won are the rewards most highly prized by men that five sixths of the satisfaction of success lie in the difficulties surmounted to achieve it the thing may be be adaged to infinity and that if there was a scamp in this world alive to that truism it was your restoration scamp with his plethora of experience in the ways of facile conquest who indeed could for ever take joy or credit of shooting the sitting pheasant of hunting the fox or the hare if his quarry the moment it were pursued squatted down to be trodden on rather would it be his object to scare away with a view to stalking and circumventing the affrighted game than by coming to straight conclusions with it to miss all the excitement of the chase now i do not say that in this particular scoundrelism he was bent on hamilton went deliberately about it to complicate an issue he ardently desired only intrigue in such matters being the recognized process it never occurred to him perhaps that satisfactory conclusions could be reached without it was a superstition of his time that beef to be tender must be first baited and certainly the sport added a zest of its own to the subsequent feast moreover the relish in the sport itself owed much of its savour as always with sport to the fact that the winners gains involved the losers losses to the account of his triumph if triumph it should be must be put not only the corruption of the wife but the fooling of the husband the humour of that result were enough to vindicate in itself the most tortuous of courses and the fact that the husband happened to be his connection and confidential friend only added in his eyes a touch of exquisite drollery to the situation in the process of engineering that situation he tasted all the thrilling delectation of the spy who conscious of his sole possession of momentous secrets plays the apparent tool to this side and the other himself the master of both and the real arbiter of their destinies he was walking one afternoon near the ring in hyde park watching the solemn circumambulation of the coaches about that damned and dusty arena when a voice hailed him and he saw chesterfields glum visage protruded from the window of a chariot which had drawn up hard by prithee come in coz said the earl and help a poor foundered wretch to forget himself in livelier company than that of his own thoughts hamilton with a laugh acceded and the two rolled on together is your mood so lugubrious asked the rogue why what a weathercock it is now pointing hot now chill without a devil of a reason that i can see in this temperate climate but the last time i met you you were all for sultry and now to mark your face ive seen a gargoyle with an icicle hung to its nose look less dismally frosty pish exclaimed the other testily if tis to the corisande you allude my fire that night was but a flash in the pan a touch of the real sulphur in it nevertheless i believe a touch and go it was then the skit can dance and sing to make a mans pulses leap i admit it but herself soon serves to kill that transitory glamour shes her own corrective well i say the more the pity why do you say it i dont understand he glanced at his companion a sudden wrath of suspicion in his eyes what dont you understand asked hamilton bridling though with an appearance of extreme urbanity to the others tone that you should deplore my not burning my fingers in the fire i play with did you design that i should when you recommended that hussy to me hm in a measure yes drawled hamilton for what reason curse it i say for what reason for what reason do you repeat me to gain time groping for an excuse do you i say you are full of questions will you have me answer them in one or one by one zounds man behave less like a pea dancing on a drum now by god george he set his teeth hissed in his breath shook his fists at nothing at all and fell suddenly calm ill be reasonable he said apostrophizing space quite temperate and reasonable is it reasonable to suppose that one a family connection and my friend in my close confidence could make such an admission without some motive designed to serve me unless indeed it pointed to a treachery on his part so black as to constitute a devilry unthinkable hamiltons brow corrugated by a curious psychological perversity he felt as much incensed over the insinuation as if there had actually been no warrant for it such is often the case with your wrongdoer he will justify himself to himself while remaining perfectly firm on the question of abstract morality you are a master of reason phil we know said he with a sneer the which if i doubted would not your proviso convince me so i have openly confessed my hand to beguile you to an infatuation that should leave the coast clear for me me to play the villain i never said so o did you not i said specifically the thing was unthinkable showing you had thought of it george dont torture me you said you know it was a pity i was not more really touched i say it again why in gods name so your attitude would be more convincing as it is the hollow pretence of it would not deceive a child is that all you meant forgive my words to you i am so torn and harassed and you are my only friend i think ill try to be more natural with the wretch more more convincing damn her yet i drove it home with kate the other night you saw how she left the room there you are because for the moment you were really what you had pretended to be under the spell could you ask a better proof no thats true but its hard to feign the fire you do not feel hamilton laughed indulgently you take things too seriously convince yourself you do not care whatever happens and fortune will be kind to you it is the jades way being a woman indifference to her is the only thing she cannot resist and it isnt as if the fruit you were asked to handle were rotten medlers heres a sweet country nectarine for which a very epicure might envy you a country crab i think as biting as shes little well well is this to forget yourself in livelier company marry phil if you can laugh at nothing else laugh at yourself always the best fool in a mans household but come ill give you distraction heres a story just on the town of two rogue apothecaries partners which might point the moral of an sops fable have you heard it chesterfield his eyes perfectly lacklustre muttered some incoherent response the other proceeded undaunted nixon and carter were they called and both attended among others on a certain ailing miserly old widow waiving their fees in hope of some rich bequest half promised to them for their devotion the day before she died she sent them two old shabby worn out cloaks one cloth one velvet in reward of their long services to her and of these garments nixon as the elder was to choose which he would the other going to his partner they were well mad i can promise you but making the best of it nixon chose the cloth as being the more serviceable and after in derision offered to part with it to carter for a shilling which promptly agreeing to and securing his bargain carter the more astute knave discovered each of its twelve buttons to be a gold carolus hidden under cloth and so they were at it nixon demanding back his goods and carter resisting till from quarrelling they came to blows and nixon killed carter for which nixon is to be hanged and now comes in the lovely moral for it seems they were both fifth monarchist men owing their lives to the act of indemnity yet who would have cut off their right hands rather than help the king to a tester of his own coin and the end is these twelve gold pounds are forfeit to the crown what think you of that for a rare combination of law and justice receiving no answer he looked at his companion and perceived him patently oblivious to every word he was saying he exclaimed and laid his hand on the door what now said chesterfield waking up the other cursed him fairly a pox on your insensibility here have i been pouring my precious wine of eloquence into thy cracked measure of a head that hath retained not one drop ill up and begone no dont have you been talking in truth o listen to him have i been talking no sir ive been thinking aloud and if my thoughts ran on jackasses in their relation to the creature called a mute you have only to speak without braying to prove yourself not half the donkey you seem dont be offensive george why do you apply such a word to me are you not a donkey to go brooding on thistles when i offer you grapes i cannot help but brood have patience with me coz theres a thought in my mind i cannot rid it of a thought what thought this cursed kit kit the kit her friend is for ever alluding to o that theres some purposed innuendo im convinced in the hussys mockery perhaps to some former flame of my wifes known to both i believe before god it is that you should have heard my lady before you came that night on my soul she had almost confessed bare faced that she used this kit to console herself for my neglect the devil she did it was a new and surprising suggestion for hamilton himself it seemed to open out a wholly unexpected vista of mortifying possibilities could there be anything in it little signs an odd look a queer inflection of the voice unsuspected of any significance at the time occurred to him now in the connection of his cousins confidences was she really playing a double game with all of them this little artless seeming thais no she was altogether too unsophisticated he could not believe it besides of course he was actually forgetting that she and mrs moll were but recent acquaintances they could not have a knowledge of that name in common unless did she specifically say him he asked chesterfield what do you mean demanded the earl you know mrs davis would not admit kits sex when i rallied her chesterfield shrugged his shoulders contemptuously pooh the merest subterfuge to mislead and torment me the dogs a male dog theres no question whatever about it hamilton sat frowning a while it was true that that fact of the womens unacquaintance counted for little moll the prying and mischievous might easily have made a discovery or again granted the alternative of kates double dealing the two might be in a naughty confederacy to punish the master of the house truly if it were no worse than that he could forgive them though their understanding meant a certain treachery to himself but at least it would ease his mind of a qualm which had suddenly overtaken it he meditated on the whole ill at ease he must find some opportunity of that he was decided to question mrs moll more particularly about this kit and though he foresaw well enough an evasive response he believed he would be able to extract from her some indication of the truth sufficiently illuminating to guide him in his further actions he turned to his companion with the suggestion leave the matter to me phil for the moment ill question the slut and like the persuasive artful dog i am worm the truth out of her will you george zounds if my suspicions should be verified and theres secret meetings between them though he be a kit of nine lives ill skewer them every one on my rapier like slivers of dogs meat when will you come when is it safe my lady rides abroad each day at noon to morrow then he put an impressive warning hand on the others sleeve this must not affect your behaviour to the visitor never whatever you do relax your attentions there but rather emphasize them o why why why he spoke with some impatient irritability are you really so dense why because if you must be instructed any slackness on your part might rouse your wifes suspicions we want if its to be a question of taking her off her guard to lull her into a sense of false security and the more infatuated you appear the more careless of precaution will she become strange that i should have to teach you sexual strategy he would not dismiss the whole suggestion at once you see as incredible and preposterous he was too well versed in the thousand duplicities of which woman is capable ever to accept her innocence at more than its face value nor is mere youth a guarantee with her of harmlessness the little two inch viper can bite to poisonous effect the moment it is hatched from the egg no it was judicious for the sake of all concerned to attempt to establish the identity of this hermaphroditic individual and he thought he could do it he went to essay the experiment the next day a little to his confusion he learned that his cousin whom he had calculated upon finding out was not yet departed but was strolling pending her horses arrival in the garden after a moments hesitation he went to seek her there and encountered her loitering about the paths which led down among ordered parterres and hedged alleys to the river side she looked very pretty in her scarlet riding habit la mode with the long skirted coat fashioned after a mans which was just then come into vogue and the little plumed hat tilted over one ear and the picture she made went straight down through his eyes to his heart her eyes opened a shade as she turned to recognize him are you coming to offer to ride with me she said because if you are yes he asked she tossed her head suddenly with a little shrug o no matter what the world can see the world will not suspect come if you wish it meaning by the world i suppose your husband then you have thought better of my suggestion what suggestion that you should use me to stimulate his jealousy i have thought of you as my kinsman and his friend is that a reproof kate chesterfield she ruffled a box border with her little pointed toe looking down the while why should you think it so cousin you are a man of honour are you not and i have your own word for it your offer was a quite disinterested one that may be but to turn it to no better account than riding innocently in company is not the way to make it effective she did not reply for a moment then looked him straight in the eyes what would you have us do i could answer for one thing he said his gaze was on a knot of rosebuds fastened in her bosom these walls are argus eyed grant me a token from that sweet nest and earn she said a credit i do not deserve why should i go out of my way so to damn myself hell hear of it the only one of all that would not care a sudden flush came to her face she leaned forward a little and spoke three words who is kit it fairly took him aback he was so startled that for a moment he could not answer kit he stammered then you are my husbands friend she said in his confidence you know and have shared no doubt the secrets of his past was it not enough to force upon me the daily insult of this davis creatures presence but he must make a jest through her lips of other infamies in which it seems they were both implicated who is this kit i say now one thing in his astonishment was made clear to hamilton kate was as innocent of kit as kit of kate that reassurance was consoling though it left him more confounded than ever as to the identity of the strange being on my honour cousin he said i have no idea you have not not a shadow of one but whoever she is if she she is what reason have you to connect phil with her she made a sound of scorn what reason am i deaf and blind to all hints and innuendoes to their conspiracy to mock me with veiled references to the part she has played in his life o reason indeed i think on my soul you are letting your imagination master you has he ever really confessed to this kit you did not hear him no it was before you came he did as much referring to her as the substance of happiness for which he had exchanged its shadow the shadow the wife o i am in truth a shadow of a wife then i say if that be so he deserves no mercy i intend to show him none give me the rose then why do you want it in reward of your disinterestedness just that she gazed at him a moment a fathomless look then o woman microcosm of all incomprehensibilities detached a bud from the group and held it out to him he received it in rapture and dared to put it to his lips but at that she flushed pink and turned from him i will ride alone she murmured nay do not press me further he forbore to it suited his plans to remain behind and he let her go without protest and the moment he was sure of her departure he went to seek mrs davis his veins were hot there was a glaze over his eyes she hath put foot within the magic circle he thought and i have her he went to find a servant and to dispatch him in quest of mrs moll the baggage came down to him presently into the great room and when they were left alone together danced gleefully up to him and dropped a curtsey is not that to the manner she said or is it the bong tong to offer you my cheek come he said with a shadow of impatience i want to have a serious talk with you lud what mischief have i been up to not mischief enough that is my complaint well thats easy remedied is it im beginning to doubt ah you dont know me you are enjoying yourself here are you not passably tis dull sometimes too much confinement and not enough fresh air youd like to be released perhaps from your duties should i what makes you think so it has occurred to me supposing i were to tell you you might go supposing well i shouldnt go thats all you wouldnt do you mean to say youd defy me yes i do mean to say it she came close before him put her little fists behind her back and tilted her chin at him whats all this about arent i wanted any more or have you changed your mind that ud be a pity because im not the sort you know to be taken or left just as it suits a mans convenience she laughed not pleasantly has it never occurred to you george that you happen to be just a little bit in my power the devil i am so am i on occasion you might find that out if you provoked me why what could you do i could blab couldnt i make havoc of your little plot he was a trifle staggered here was something overlooked in his calculations he had only designed in fact to stimulate her efforts this threatened rebellion revealed some mistake in his methods and lose for ever your chance of promotion said he well if you wish to make me your enemy she nodded her head once or twice i dont but id lose twenty kings sooner than sit quiet under a dirty trick like that do you propose staying on then till this imposture is discovered as every day makes more probable as well betray me at once you know i wouldnt do that but i like the fun and i like the life and i see no more risk of discovery now than when i came why do you want me to go i never said i did i dont as a matter of fact if you will only not like these things so well as half to forget your purpose in them my purpose thats to make the lord creature in love with me well havent i i miss the conclusive evidence the proof of the pudding thats in the eating that wasnt in the bargain be fair george im doing all that was asked of me and doing it faithful she was in fact yet he had actually hoped for more she was so excessively alluring that he could not believe chesterfield capable in spite of his apparent insensibility of ultimately resisting her charms were she fully resolved he should not and is that he said suggesting the little piece too much youve grown very fastidious of a sudden i told you i was beginning to doubt she looked at him queerly a moment isnt it going as well with you as you expected she asked your finishing him could do my cause no harm at least said he and bit his lip well i vow im sometimes amost sorry for her she said shes but my own age and and the mans in love with her all the time and at a word shed be with him dont i know that what a brace of blackguards we are george speak for yourself mrs moll said hamilton a little hotly love absolves all sinners it knows no villainy but incompetence sure you must be a saint then but betwixt this and that and your doubts despite it wasnt in the bargain and i wont do it then that settles it and we must manage without as you like she brought her hands to the front and linking them in the most decorous of love knots stiffened her neck and tossed her head backwards and a little askew besides she said you seem to forget that ive got a husband myself he burst into a laugh vexed but uncontrollable and immediately checked himself i had forgot i confess it he said kit is it not kit she ejaculated in deep scorn and then she too laughed derisively not kit said he if you knew kit you wouldnt ask such a silly question she answered well why shouldnt i know kit he seems an attractive person o kits attractive i see i see pardon my stupidity what do you see kits a hem friend of yours indeed kit is the best ahem friend of mine that ever hemmed a hem what a woman either that or a tailor damn it not a tailor damn it why not though it takes nine tailors to make a man one woman can make a tailor come moll thou art goosing me a tailors goose maybe tell me who is this friend of yours i wonder frankly is it man or woman frankly ive never asked ah you wont tell me are we not good comrades now and as such should have no secrets from one another what do you want to know what is kit sometimes this sometimes that we all have our moods i believe he has no existence but in your imagination who is he tell me will you kiss me george if i tell that i will he suited the action to the word putting his lips to hers while she submitted quietly now said he but i havent told she protested he could have boxed her pink ear and he did fling from her with some roughness psha he said i am wasting time and that is not all said she he saw a warning flush in her cheek and forced his vexation under well he said with a propitiatory laugh if you tell me nothing ive got the kiss for nothing and so mine is the best of the bargain but i count you a little unkind mollinda i dont mean to be that george she answered somewhat penitent but i shouldnt tell secrets not my own now should i that only served to restimulate his doubts and perplexity but he said no more on the subject feeling it wiser to desist never mind he said you have your own good reasons for silence of course and its no business of mine to press them what is more to the point is this question of your scruples regarding his lordship so you wont go to extremes then what is to be the course with all deference mrs moll you cant surely be planning to stay on here indefinitely well ill work up to any conclusion you like short of that you will sure even if it were to an appearance of that why not twould be enough for me to know my own innocence since im the only one that ever believes in it he pondered musing on her ill think it out faith well arrange some trick between us some coup de grce for her ladyship shall we o go to grass yourself she said speak english chapter xi to the duke of yorks chambers in whitehall came a mincing exquisite with a guitar slung from his neck by a broad silver ribbon he was dressed in silvered white from chin to toe and he strutted exactly like a white leghorn cock surveying his seraglio his long straw coloured hair was elaborately curled over his temples the lashes to his eyes were like pale spun glass a tiny cherished moustachio pointed upwards at the tips stood either side his round nose like a couple of thorns to a gooseberry he hummed as he walked flourishing a beringed and scented hand to such palace minions as met and saluted him by the way and reaching the dukes quarters acknowledged with a charming condescension the respectful greetings of m prosper gentleman of the chamber to his highness who accosted him at the door of the anteroom ha my good prothper i thee you well jethpre bien vair well most milord of arran you are to come this way sair his royal ighness e expectorate you bowing and waving his arms as if he were shooing on a fowl m prosper conducted the visitor by a private passage to the dukes closet where committing him to the hands of a page he bobbed and ducked himself away and the next moment the earl found himself in the presence of the lord high admiral james stuart was seated at a table liberally strewn with documents writing and mathematical implements there were no gimcracks visible on it unless a little bronze ship which served for a paper weight deserved the title the aspect of the room like his own inornate businesslike severe was in odd contrast with the silken frippery which came to invade it one would have guessed some particular purpose to lie behind the permitted violation of those austere privacies his highness was minutely examining a chart when the lordling entered standing over him and occasionally dabbing a forefinger like a discoloured banana on some specified shoal or anchorage was a huge individual in a full skirted blue coat trimmed with the coarse lace called trolly lolly whose bearing spoke unmistakably of the sea this was captain stone of the naseby frigate in fact a practical sailorman much in favour with his royal master he was a rough and ready specimen of his class with manners as blunt as his features he turned to stare at the sugary apparition as it sailed into view and a grin of derision which he made no effort to conceal widened his already ample features ha my lord said the duke you are welcome be seated sir be seated i shall be disengaged in one moment stone oblige me by removing your hat from that chair that my lord of arran may come to anchor the bulky sea captain with a most offensive affectation of alacrity skipped to obey he swept the chair with his hat more he produced from somewhere an enormous blue handkerchief like a small ensign and elaborately polished the seat with it now says he if your lordships breeches will deign to reconsecrate the altar my top gear hath profaned the duke his elbow leaned on the table shaded his face with his palm and laughed noiselessly as for the sweet puppy himself self esteem had thickened his moral cuticle beyond penetration by anything less than a pickaxe of ridicule he closed his lids and with an ineffable smile and wave of the hand dropped languidly into the proffered place duke and captain continued for a while their investigation of the chart then the former put it away and leaning back in his chair addressed a question to the latter what is this i hear captain of decent folk impressed illegally in the city by order of my lord mayor the burly seaman shrugged his shoulders hes an ass sir that bludworth yet an ass in some sort deserving commendation in what way why in the way that leads by short cuts to disputed ends he gets there while your wise man talks aye but he tramples rights to do it he may we must have men they were given no press money i understand he had none to give them still we must have men the thing should be in order there were those among them i hear of quite respectable estate aye but we must have men i say your fool on occasion can have his uses the duke as if involuntarily shot a swift glance towards the seated figure could they under the circumstances he said be broke for desertion i leave that answered the seaman dryly to your highness tis not the way at least to make the kings service popular well i could venture a better way he meant of course the settlement of long arrears of pay a chronic scandal in the navy but the obvious was not palatable the duke just raising his eyebrows at the speaker bent them in a frown and sat drumming for some moments with his fingers on the table suddenly he turned to arran what would you suggest my lord said he to make the navy popular the lay opinion given an intelligence such as yours is often valuable in these matters his lordship exquisitely flattered sat up i should offer a handthome bounty thir said he with perhaps some vivid recollection of personal sufferings endured in the channel to the man who should devith or invent a thertain cure for thea thickneth captain stone regardless of his company burst into a roar of laughter by gog your highness cried he heres the pressman for our money to make the navy popular quotha give them stomach for it aye why not and lace our sails with silver twist and hang a silken tassel at the main and pipe to quarters on a hurdy gurdy o well have our captains monkey yet with lovelocks to his head and white ribbons to his shoon his lordship on whom this pickaxe had wrought at last flushed up to the eyes with anger and resentment he rose to his feet thith monthtruth inthult he began i crave your highnetheth grath and stuck for lack of words the duke whose cue was nothing if not propitiation turned in some genuine wrath on the seaman you forget yourself sir he said sternly you will favour me by retiring waiving the question of respect for his lordships opinions you fail in it to me who invited them nor need you be so cocksure in your own who knows what inclinations might have served us but for dread of that malady you must go the captain not venturing to remonstrate but seeing as he thought through the others motive obeyed and so much without rancour that he could not forbear some subdued sputtering laughter as he left the room an ebullition which in fact found its secret response in the dukes own bosom he addressed himself the man gone with a rather twinkling blandishment to his remaining guest a rough untutored fellow my lord but reliable according to his lights they are not penetrating perhaps yet clear as regards the surface of things you must forgive him that was an original suggestion of yours he would not grasp its inner significance naturally to cure sea sickness now there is something in it i am happy minced the bantling in your highnetheth commendation that mal de mer is a very dithtrething thing it maketh a man look a fool and a man dothnt like to look a fool the duke considered but for the character of the remedy what do you say to music music will not according to master george herbert cure the toothache but is sea sickness the toothache my lord not the toothache no thir is it not rather by all reports a surging or vertigo of the brain induced by that reversal of the laws of equilibrium which transposes the offices as it were of matter animate and matter inanimate i i take your highnetheth word for it why it is clear we are designed and organized are we not to be voluntary agents on a plane of stability yeth yeth o yeth very well so we lie down or rise at will the solid earth abetting but supposing the parts reversed ourselves the willingly quiescent the earth the one to rise or fall would not our brain devised on the opposite principle be naturally upset carrying with it the stomach its most intimate relation im thure it would quite thure to be thure take my word for it when we go to sea we are transposing the functional processes of mind and matter how then to render that exchange nugatory the sense of it is conveyed through what the eyes is it not o yeth indeed you thee the heaving before you heave yourthelf exactly a sympathetic emotion or motion our vision then is the direct cause of sea sickness why because in pursuing an unstable thing it becomes itself unstable and there i see light the eyes are at right angles to the ears are they not and we are agreed that the sense of instability is conveyed through the eyes through the eyeth well supposing now we introduce a second appeal to the senses through the ears that second appeal would traverse the first appeal would it not at right angles the two forming together a sort of sensory cross hatch or truss which would immediately produce the stability necessary to keep the otherwise unsupported sight from accommodating itself to the action of the waves you follow me i think o yeth your suggestion was a really very able one my lord and it speaks loudly against the folly of scorning all ex official criticism in these matters but to follow our theorizing to a practical end we are at one then in believing it possible that the sense of sight could be trussed and stiffened by the introduction of the sense of sound to make an effective business of it however that sense of sound would have to be compelling enough to arrest and neutralize the visual tendency it would have to be that is to say exceedingly strong and exceedingly sweet it might be possible to introduce on each of our ships a professional harpist or lutist to supply with their music a prophylactic against sea sickness but one has to remember that not all musicians are sailors and that it might prove disastrous to the moral should one fail in his own sea legs at the very moment he was trying to provide another with his yeth that ith very true then again as to the force of the appeal not all performers have that convincing mastery of their instruments my lord which according to what i hear is peculiarly your own o truth your highneth flatterth me you shall prove it he smiled very pleasantly but believe me my lord i am infinitely your debtor for a suggestion which may go far to revolutionize the whole question of impressment and the popularity of the navy now will you not give me a taste of the quality which has come to enter so aptly into the context of our discussion you know i play a little on the guitar myself but not so well as to refuse a hint or two from a master of the instrument there was a question of a saraband i would fain take a lesson in its presentation corbettith your highneth meanth the puppy strange scion of a house distinguished in the persons of its head and firstborn for both courage and nobility glowed with gratified vanity he really believed at last that twas he himself had originated that exquisite specific against the curse of the ocean and that the duke was his admiring debtor for it he struck an attitude slung his guitar into position and receiving a nod from his auditor forthwith touched out the measure of signor francescos saraband it was a quite graceful composition and he played it well the duke was enraptured it is in truth a most sweet and moving piece he said and masterly rendered i have never known to be displayed a more perfect accord between composer performer and instrument yet if they were to be considered in order of merit i should put without hesitation the executant in the first place and the guitar in the least yet itth a good guitar thir ventured the glowing youth he lifted and eyed with beatific patronage that faithful recorder of his genius good answered the duke yet good is not good enough to be the servant of the best but where indeed could one look for an instrument worthy of an orpheus o i bluth your highneth yet i will not thay but what i might give a better account of mythelf on an inthtrument pothethed by my thithter my lady chethterfield it ith a wonder that corbetti himthelf hath declared it indeed james spoke abstractedly seeming hardly to attend now will you make me your debtor my lord for a hint or two it would flatter my poor skill to expend it on so rare a melody he was so full of compliment and ingratiation that the first diffidence of the sweet earl was soon exchanged for a vanity approaching condescension he took his royal pupil in hand and conducted him over the opening bars of the composition but the duke strange to say proved himself a most sad bungler he could not for some reason master the air and finally with a shrug of impatience he desisted and begged his instructor to repeat to him his own version of certain ingenious passages i will murder the innocents no longer quoth he handing back the instrument render them again in living phrase and so take the taste of my own villainy out of my mouth it is thith way said his lordship and went on thrumming most mellifluously ah said the duke if one could take the way of genius only by having it pointed out to one yet did not that last note ring a little false no by my fay thir you may be right yet methinks i have a very hair splitting ear it will quarrel on so little as a fraction of a tone not the player but the string maybe was to blame even your best of instruments will lack perfection betraying weak places in their constitution like broken letters in a printed type sound it again ah it is not quite true indeed your highneth thith ith a very ordinary fair guitar but ath i thay i know a better true my lady shrewsburys no not i thought you mentioned hers not herth my lady chetherfieldth o your sisters so she is the possessor of that masterpiece is it indeed so excellent none better i dare to venture in all the world my lord you must let me hear you on it so near the perfect achievement and yet to fall short of it by a hair twas not to be endured we must visit your sister you and i together and beg this favour of her kindness now even the court of the restoration had its codes of etiquette more particular in some odd ways than to days and among them was none which permitted a prince of the blood royal to condescend to social intercourse with a young married woman without danger to her reputation arran to be sure knew this well enough shallow dandiprat as he was and the slight qualm he felt over the proposition was evidence of a certain suspicion awakened in him for the first time but it was faint and no proof against his vanity he was not so base as to design any deliberate treachery to his own flesh and blood but his conscience was an indeterminate quantity easily at the mercy of any plausible rascal he considered and decided that the inclusion of himself in the dukes suggestion was the surest proof that there could be no arrire pense behind it an intrigant bent on some nefarious conquest would not propose a brother to assist him in his purpose he gave a little embarrassed laugh nevertheless and hung his foolish head if your highneth thinkth it worth your highnetheth while he said worth my lord worth said the duke warmly what is this genius of yours worth if not the most perfect of mediums through which to give itself expression you are very good i am very impatient and shall continue so until we have given effect to this arrangement chapter xii little lady chesterfield sat in her private boudoir looking out on a glowing section of the palace gardens thirty feet away a marble basin shaped like a tazza bubbled with a tiny jet of water and on the rim of the basin as if posed for a picture sat a single peacock great white clouds loitered in a sapphire sky a thousand flowers starred the beds the box borders were lush with growth and all between went a maze of little paths frilled with green sweetness it was an endearing prospect spacious and peaceful hardly ruffled by the murmurs of the great life in whose midmost it was cloistered yet small consciousness of its tranquillity was apparent in the blue eyes whose introspective vision reflected only the mists and turbulence of a troubled heart now as regards physical infection one may be susceptible to the predaceous germ on one occasion and not on another it is a question of bodily condition so there is a moral microbe whose insidious approaches may find us pregnable or not according to our spiritual temper of the time the healthiest constitutions enjoy no absolute immunity in this respect and those which do escape harm often owe their reputation for incorruptibility to no better than the accident which found them free from attack at the weak moments evil disposition makes no more sinners than the lack of it does saints it is mostly a question of coincidence between the alighting seed down and the soil suitable to its germination well there are soils and soils and as one seed which sickens on a rich loam will wax bursting fat in an arid crevice so sand will not produce roses yet i should say if one sought a common denominator in this matter of proneness to moral infections one could not instance a state more typically susceptive to all than that of idleness and boredom and to that perilous condition had poor kate succeeded she was ennuye sick of soul tired of everything and everybody her matrimonial barque she felt had been flung on a shoal where it lay as divorced from wreck as from rescue there appeared no alternative but to abandon it and yet all her instincts of faith and decency still fought against that seeming treachery to her vows she had really at one time believed in the poor creature her husband even though necessarily at the modified valuation imposed upon wives of her date and condition she had not utterly abandoned her hope in him yet but little of it remained and that little so tempered with scorn and disgust as to seem hardly worth the retaining still the wifely instinct clung by a thread and was so far her resource and safety yet not much was needed to snap that last strand and she knew it and felt it and was wrought thereby to a state of nervous irritability which halted in its sense of sick isolation between fidelity and revolt she was susceptible in fact when the germ made its appearance it was a flattering germ garbed royally with a melting eye and an insinuative manner she may have been already conscious in herself of premonitory symptoms betokening its approach as the wind of the avalanche heralds the fall thereof i will certainly not commit myself to any statement to the contrary but even were that the case it is not to say that her hold on the thread continued less fond and desperate it is likely indeed that it acquired a more urgent grip as foreseeing a particular strain upon its resources royalty could pull so hard with so little effort of its own however that may be it is worthy of note that she displayed at least the courage of her sex in facing the possibility of infection instead of flying from it now as she sat gazing out on the quiet scene with unregarding eyes and obsessed with the sole thought that she was the most aggrieved and weary spirited woman in the world she heard a sound in the room behind her and turned to see her second brother young arran he minced forward the darling and saluted her with the most unimaginable grace though there was certainly a little tell tale flush on his callow cheek thithter kit quoth he i have taken the privilege of a brother to introduth a vithitor to your private apartment a visitor she rose uncertain to her feet and was aware with a little shock of the blood of the figure of the duke of york standing in the doorway his royal highness with a grave smile in which there was nevertheless a touch of anxiety advanced into the room closing the door behind him uninvited but not too greatly daring i hope said he formality ceremonial were all incompatible with the boon we designed to ask of your ladyship a vivid flush would rise to her cheek she could not help it nor control with all her will to the self conscious instinct betrayed in her drooped lashes for a moment in the embarrassment of her youth she stood dumb before this realized liberty a privilege your brother called it continued the duke then if for him how much more for me of its extent believe me i am so fully sensible that accepting your silence for condonation of my presumption i hesitate to abuse a favour so freely vouchsafed by taking advantage of it to beg another she raised her lids and again dropped them the shadow of a smile twitched the corners of her mouth and then her breath caught suddenly and irresistibly in a little half hysterical laugh the pomposity of this prelude was after all too much for her o my lord duke she said if i were to assume the nature of this favour from the solemnity of its introduction i should have no alternative but to refuse it offhand as implying something grave and weighty beyond my years i pray you bear my youth in mind he smiled relieved and at ease most tenderly madam for all that resounding symphony you shall find the piece when we come to play it a very pastorale in lightness will you not be seated by your favour your highness when you have set me the example she sought to take refuge from her fluttering apprehensions behind that shy insistence on punctilio the duke bowed and accepting a chair from his lordship of arran signified his entreaty that the lady should occupy another contiguous kate had no choice but to obey she was not yet mistress of her blushes and she blushed as she seated herself but there was a strange excitement in her heart nevertheless now said his highness i am in the position of a litigant who hath engaged an advocate to plead his cause for him so like a sensible client i leave the first word to him he waited in a serene confidence lady chesterfield looked at her brother what is it richard his lordship giggled hemd pulled at his cravat and spoke nothing in the world thithter kit o she said nothing is easily granted i give you the case your highness he rates his own genius too lightly cried the duke i see that for the sake of his modesty i must reverse the parts take me for advocate then and hear my plea it is that saving one factor your brother is the most accomplished guitarist at court o fie your highneth said arran squirming in every limb think of corbetti a master i grant said the duke but with the faults incident to professionalism a perfect executant art hath yet despoiled him of nature for pure sympathy give me your born musician before your trained again arran squirmed o your highneth your highneth the duke turned to kate do you not love your brothers playing indeed answered the girl perplexed richard plays well well he echoed protesting have you heard him in the new saraband she shook her head ah he said not corbetti himself could so interpret the loveliness of his own composition i speak as one who knows my lords performance to eschew superlatives was divine yet there was a flaw the perfect master lacked the perfect instrument to attain the latter or at least more nearly approximate it only one resource offered your ladyship as he informed me was owner of the finest guitar in all england to hear him on that guitar became then a necessity with me a fever a passion it was to entreat that opportunity that i ventured this descent upon your ladyships privacy she heard she opened her eyes in ingenuous wonder before she could consider the words they were on her lips is that all nay not all he answered softly not all but that you might hear and feel involuntarily she shrank away a little richard knew she said that he could always have my guitar for the asking is that so said his highness but he did not tell me perchance because he would have his sister learn the estimate in which he is held by others to show his power to move me in your presence ah he waved a playful hand a very white and shapely one relations are notoriously grudging critics of their own still she struggled faintly this is a poor room for resonance my lord duke the audience chamber would have been better chosen nay he said are we not private here private sir is not privacy the very essence of all sweet sounds and thoughts to risk interruption is to risk the jarring of their lovely sequence no we are happiest where we are apart and secluded the loneliest bower is that where the bird sings his song to an end she rose hastily and with an effort to control her agitation i will go and fetch it she said it is not here he sought to detain her does not your brother know the place arran interposed some vague uneasiness perhaps was making itself felt in the shallow brain of the nincompoop no by my thoul your highneth he said nor underthtand if she told me kate hurried to the door as she did so a feminine form outside whisked into the near shelter of some hangings then foreseeing certain detection if she remained where she was waited until the issuing figure had vanished down a passage when she herself slipped away incontinent in another direction the duke in the meanwhile sat frowning and silent half suspecting a ruse on the ladys part to escape him but in that he did the countess too much or too little justice for whatever reason of honour or perversity you may take your choice kate acquitted herself faithfully of her errand and came back with the guitar whereat the royal brow cleared wonderfully and arran played the saraband this time to perfection exclaimed his highness sweet melody sweet touch and sweetest atmosphere it had been all a banquet of delight served as it were amidst the tenderest surroundings in a self contained corner of eden by the most paradisical of chefs the duke was transported he was really transported though it is true some ecstasies stop short of heaven there are sirens in campania to see to that and kate was also moved she could not well help but be her heart was in too emotional a state to be safe proof against such soft besieging when the duke leaned towards her she did not stir but sat with eyes downcast her bosom plainly turbulent was i not right he said and could any gain in resonance have improved on this faultless unison of parts perfection must know bounds even like a framed picture or the soul cannot compass it to have enlarged these but in one direction would have been to sacrifice the proportions of the whole the harmonious concord of place and sound and tenderest feeling give me this bower lady for your rounded madrigal wherein sweetest music lends itself with love and beauty to weave a finished pattern of delight my lord grant me the instrument a moment he took the guitar somewhat peremptorily from the earls hesitating hands but he was in no mood at this pass to temporize or finesse and having received it he went plucking softly among the strings gathering up sweet chords and sobbing accidentals as it were flowers to present in a nosegay to the heart of his moved hearer there was a knowledge a sure emotionalism in his touch which went far to discount his earlier pretence of inadequacy and arran in his weak brain may have felt somehow conscious of the fact and of a suspicion that he had been subtly beguiled into lending his own vanity for a catspaw to the others schemes but he had no wit to mend the situation he had encouraged and so he only stood silent with his mouth open sowing gape seed as they say in sussex the duke ending presently on a dying fall sighed and looked up lady he said there is a test of the interpretative power of music which some deny to render the very spirit of a flower in sound so that one listening with closed eyes will say that be jonquils or that be rosemary or lavender or what you will only the player must have that same blossom he would explain nigh to him that his soul may be permeated by its essence while he improvises what say you shall we put it to the proof poor artist as i am if my skill prove but twin brother to my wish i will interpret you my blossoms so that you shall cry thats for the one in flower language called remembrance or thats for gentle friendship or thats for love will you be so entertained only for the means he looked to the earl this was no more than a ruse devised on the moment to rid himself of that simple incubus my lord said he with an ingratiatory smile will you favour me so far as to go gather me a posy from the garden but before the sappy youth could fall into that palpable trap kate had risen hurriedly to her feet nay brother she said stay you here i know better than you where to find the blooms most meet to his highnesss purpose and she was going half scared and yet half diverted but scarce had she taken a step or two when a sudden voice singing outside the window brought her to an instant standstill oh turn love i prythee love turn to me for thou art the only one love that art adord by me so sweet and unexpected they all whisked about in surprise to mark the singer she loitered in seeming unconsciousness of their neighbourhood among the beds a slender girl figure on whose face as she stooped and rose the sunlight went and came as if it fought her for a kiss she looked a very stillroom fairy of the gardens herself expressed from all their daintiest scents and colours and so no doubt the men thought but for my lady chesterfield the apparition wrought in her a revulsion of feeling which was as instant as it was startling her wrongs the empty vanity of her scruples all rushed upon her in a moment and she stood stock still and then she gave a chill little laugh a woman of ice in a moment and said she small and quiet but it were ill manners for a hostess to desert her guest and after all dick thou art the musician to feel a musicians needs my lord looked suddenly gratified ath you will thithter kit said he unless your friend outthide would prefer your company friend cried her ladyship she is no friend of mine of whoth then you may ask her if you will nay i see that you are all excitement to put his highnesss pleasant fancy to the test go then leave your sister and gather flowers he answered with a little foolish shamefaced snigger then turned and stole away a tiptoe as if he feared to be detected while she watched his departure with a twitch of scorn upon her lips the duke with an amused smile on his regarded her furtively her rigid attitude the flushed curve of her cheek which alone of her face was visible as she stood with her back to him but much expression can be conveyed in a curve no friend of yours my lady he asked softly no she said and lowering her head began plucking at her handkerchief without turning to him of your husbands perhaps he asked in the same tone of any mans she answered o he rose and just glancing through the window at the pretty figure now joined in company with that of the young nobleman took a step or two which brought him within close range of the averted face is that so he said and she lies in this house she did not answer and venturing quite gently to capture her reluctant fingers he led her by them to the window the couple outside were already it appeared on friendly terms they laughed and chatted together making a sport of the flower choosing in which with all pretty coquetries the lady would defer to her companion plucking this bloom and that and holding it to his button nose and throwing the thing away in a pretended pet if he shook his head to it the duke stood some moments regarding the scene why young but practised he said presently he has met her before never to my knowledge she spoke low trembling a little now perhaps from that sudden chill not he said and drew in a quick breath as if scandalized i see i see and how is she known her name is mary davis ah some wanton fancy of your your highness i beg you to let me go she broke from his too sympathetic hold and went back from him until a space separated them believe me said he gravely i had no wish to surprise this unhappy secret out of you i know she said hurriedly i know but learning it you will be considerate considerate and compassionate on my royal faith he answered it shall be an inviolable confidence between us have i not myself too good reason to sympathize with the ill mated he did not say whether on his own account or on his wifes perhaps if on hers that ill starred woman would have preferred his fidelity to all the sympathy in the world but as in such matters the feminine prejudice is always in favour of the man so kate in no ways an exception to her sex was quite prepared to accept the sentiment at its obvious significance a faint sigh lifted her innocent bosom i may not speak of that she said is is marriage always so unhappy he sighed too always i know not it may chance to include that natural correlation of sympathies that perfect soul affinity which was no doubt in the original scheme of things before the fall blest immeasurably blest the nuptials in that case yet how rare a coincidence a man and woman both virgin both unspoiled may here and there find as predestined their rapturous conjunction and so achieve themselves in flawless unity but for the most part we must be resigned to forgo that heavenly encounter until caught fast in alien bonds we meet and recognize for the first time our elective affinities too late then i cannot say only is it possible that heaven could blame us for consummating its own ideal at the expense of the social conventions made by man ah if we could only in the first instance be safe to meet with her the heartfelt the unmistakable the lovely ordained perfecter of our imperfect beings what happiness would be added to the world and what sin avoided his very voice was like a wooing confidence he bent to gaze into her face ill mated alike in that at least he said and sought her hand again come sweet soul be seated and let me play to you once more kate started as if to an electric shock no your highness you will not i must not let me call my brother he intercepted her say at least i may visit you again see you speak to you he spoke low and vehemently no no she said almost weeping not now o let me go sir i was wrong to complain wrong to encourage you she made past him and hurried to the open window richard she cried richard how long you are his highness waits the flowers with impatience arran had no choice but to obey she saw his companion with a pert laugh and toss of the head thrust the nosegay into his hand and watch him with a mocking lip as he retreated from her and the next moment he was in the room but for the duke he was quite content with his progress she had put her confidence in his keeping and for a sound beginning that meant much chapter xiii the earl of chesterfield entered his drawing room in a very morose frame of mind which was scarcely improved by his discovery of a young lady already seated there before him she was yawning over an illuminated missal but at sight of the intruder she clapped the volume down with a bang stretched put her arms behind her head and smiled with an air of relieved welcome any male to moll was better than none come along she said dont be shy of me he was pacing forward his hands behind his back and stopped to regard her sourly his head askew yes you remarked he said mrs davis went into a noiseless shake of laughter dont do that she cried or youll give yourself a stiff neck what a face sure has my lady been putting bitter aloes on your nails naughty boy to stop your biting em mrs davis said my lord not moving and with an air of acid civility i am really constrained to impress upon you that it is possible to presume on ones privileges as lady chesterfields friend and guest is it was the serene answer and im really constrained to impress upon you that its possible to presume upon ones position as the husband of that guests hostess presume madam presume in my own house she jumped up and came at him with such a whisk of skirts that involuntarily he retreated a step before her you dare she said when the very first time we met you had the brazen impudence to kiss me presume indeed and in your own house a nice house this to pretend to any airs of propriety there are distinctions to be made madam which perhaps you can hardly be expected to appreciate between me and another why deuce take you cried the lady are you telling me im not respectable she quivered on the verge of an explosion he was a little alarmed it had been foolish of him to lay aside just because his wife was not by the part he was affecting to play he had forgotten in his peevishness that it was as necessary to mislead the visitor as to his sentiments as it was her ladyship yet he could not command his temper all in a moment are you telling me he said that my house is not her eyes sparkled at him i cant appreciate distinctions you know she said or i might understand why my lady may do just what i do and be respected for it while i for my part have to suffer all manner of sauce and impudence one of these days i shall be taking two of those precious grooms of yours and knocking their heads together he frowned setting his lips i am sorry if you have reason to complain of the conduct of my household i was not aware of this and will take immediate measures for the punishment of any servant you may point out as having shown you discourtesy o alls one for that cried moll with a toss i can look after myself only dont talk about my presumption in treating you with the familiarity that you treat me or be so sure of the holy propriety of your house in everything where im not concerned he looked at her with a gloomy perplexity but did not answer liberties cried mrs moll snapping her fingers but where the master sets the example the mistress cant be blamed for following him i suppose do you allude to her ladyship he demanded yes i do she answered with a saucy laugh to what liberties do you refer as applied to yourself perhaps myself be damned cried the lady i talk of her being closeted alone in her private apartments with gentlemen visitors his lordship started and stiffened as suddenly rigid as a frog popped into boiling water what visitors he said in a suffocated voice moll laughed again wouldnt you like to know crosspatch he took a furious step forward and checked himself her brothers belike and so much for your mischief making mrs davis he said it with a sneer but his eyes glowed then thats all right and settled replied the girl and so now you can be at peace wasnt it you say so what do you say o i mustnt mention kit i suppose kit he uttered a blazing oath under his breath so my suspicions are confirmed about that reptile by god if you and my lady are a pair and in collusion after all fiddle de dee she said putting out the tip of her tongue at him what do you mean by collusion that im abetting her in carrying on with my own particular friend not likely he stamped in impotent exasperation why do you tell me then but i see what it is she has robbed you of this creature and you want to be revenged on her for it and by god you shall tell me when was this this very afternoon and how long was he with her who o you know i thought you might mean the other the other there was another then he positively squeaked in his fury who was it curse it i will know sure youre so hot im afraid to tell you she said he broke away positively dancing took a rageful turn or two and came back relatively reasonable now mrs davis he said will you be so good as to acquaint me all all about this visit come let us kiss and be friends he advanced towards her with hands extended and a twisted smile meant to be ingratiatory on his lips but she backed before him no sure she said that would be friendship at too high a price what does it matter to you who visited her arent you ready to throw her over stock and block for me yes yes only hm tis a question of justification dont you see of proof damn it of her guilt you wont want to kiss me now no on my word and you wont call the gentlemen out to answer for their misbehaviour curse me no then ill tell you it was you are sure you wont kiss me not for a thousand pound what not for a thousand was ever woman so insulted then ill kiss you for nothing you will so then my mouths shut o he threw up his hands and eyes giving vent to the remarkable utterance the foul fiend grant me virtue then he waxed dangerous mrs moll if its to be kissing after all ill pay you and with interest here and now she gave a little scream o mussey ill tell you it was the duke he stood looking at her grinning like a dog the duke what duke how should i know you saw him sure how o i just looked through the keyhole still he stared the grin or snarl fixed on his face and what did you see only the two gentlemen and my lady what they were there together why not why not why not now what does it all mean and which was the favoured one with her it was his highness stayed longest his highness so they called him he looked a very nice tall gentleman though over grave for my taste yes chesterfields manner had suddenly fallen ominously quiet i think i know whom you mean and so he the duke stayed longest did he and what became of the other o he came out to me in the garden whither id run after peeping she saw it rising in him and likened it in her own mind to a saucepan of milk coming to the boil there was a flickering under the surface and then a heave and rise and the next moment it was overflowing with a tumultuous ebullition there was no stopping yet his voice maintained its intense suppression only doubly envenomed he came out to you did he i understand your particular friend your particular pander to dishonourable royalty came out to you having effected his purpose of infamous procuration to congratulate you and himself i suppose on the success of your joint villainy so this is the solution of the mystery and this your return for the hospitality you have received indeed my lady chooses her intimates cleverly now moll was a mischief making naughtiness and knew it but no woman however self consciously guilty can take abuse without recrimination you suppose so do you indeed she said and i say if you apply those names to me and kit youre a liar and a beast a nice character you upon my word to call shame upon your lady for doing in all innocence what you are doing out of the wickedness of your soul every day of your life she mustnt entertain a great gentleman mustnt she but you may practise your dissembling arts on her own friend and think none the worse of yourself for it pander forsooth i throw the word back in your ugly teeth as i throw your dirty attentions i dont want them and i dont want you my teeth may be ugly says my lord with a savage grin but they can bite as this friend of yours will find to his cost when once i track him down as i shall do poor kit cried mrs moll with a mocking laugh and as to my attentions to you said the other you may count them for what you like only dont include any inclination of mine in the bill i paid them because it suited me and not because you did for anything but a catspaw and now that i know your true character why you may take yourself off for any attraction i find in you and the sooner the better for all parties concerned i do not consider you a fit companion for my lady thats plain said moll a little cowed in spite of herself i wish to make it so answered his lordship frigidly for what purpose my lady invited you here i know not nor in what degree that purpose tallied with your command of a confederate the hired instrument as i take it of a more exalted infamy it is enough that you have used your position here to consolidate the discord and misunderstanding you found already unhappily existing and what have you done i should like to know cried mrs moll and with an object went on the gentleman not deigning to answer her which is only perfectly apparent to me at a late hour but that recognition now it has come imposes a duty on me and on you the perhaps unwelcome realization that i am the master of this house i neither ask nor expect you to betray to me this creature of yours and of my lord duke i shall identify him in good time and then he will not have reason to congratulate himself on his amiable participation in your designs but as to yourself i have merely to intimate that i shall esteem it a favour and to avoid unpleasantness if you will put an early period to your visit here he bowed with such an immense and killing stateliness that the young lady was quite overawed and for the moment had not a word to answer and so walking deliberately with his head high he left the room mrs davis sat for some minutes after he was gone her face a lively play of emotions why deuce take it she thought her lids wide if he doesnt believe as ive used kit for go between with madam and the duke creature mussey me her eyes half closed her little nose wrinkled stuffing her handkerchief into her mouth she went into a scream of laughter but her mood soon changed panting she rose to her feet and struck one little fist into the palm of the other so im to go am i she said not before ive paid you for that insult my lad i dont quite know how yet but somehow the last words got to be with me chapter xiv the tormented nobleman craving for advice and sympathy lost little time before he sought out his friend and kinsman mr george hamilton he found that gentleman who had just returned from a game of pell mell with his majesty refreshing himself with a pot and sop in his own chambers before committing himself and his mid day toilet to the hands of his valet chesterfield drove out the man incontinent and closed the door on him i want a word with you george said he breathless and agitated too disturbed and full of his subject to apologize or finesse its all out ive discovered the truth and curse me if twere the king himself id bury my sword in his treacherous heart as it is hamilton his face half hidden by the quart pot put up an expostulatory hand and bubbled amphorically as it is let me finish my ale o you can jest cried the other but i tell you tis no jesting matter so he hath wronged me ill have his life were he twenty james stuarts rolled into one george set down the tankard drained his eyes gaped a little the duke of york damn him cried the earl i always said it was he but you would never believe me and now he hath been to visit her on what false pretext i know not and they have been closeted alone together alone in her private apartments when was this asked hamilton astonished and disturbed enough for his part yesterday afternoon replied the other and he hissed between his clenched teeth and ill not forgive the dishonour done to my house or spare him though he wore the crown nay coz said hamilton command yourself how got you this information how why from that little cursed prying eavesdropping skit her friend and that is not all twas through kit the meeting came about a common pitcher bawd who shall pay for it with every bone in his body broke through kit aye she confessed to him at last he brought the duke was the tool arranged between them no doubt o what measure can gauge the perfidy of woman who do you say confessed to him o a curse on your dullness who but mrs davis what and to kates collusion in the plot of course then she lied and if she lied in one thing the truth of all is to question what do you mean i mean that unless you can conceive my cousin as the most double faced artful little villain in the world mrs davis was lying to you in pretending that kate could be a party to this employment of the creature kit why because she knows so little about kit that twas only the other day she was charging kit to you as some probable light of your fancy before you married her she thought kit a woman well she knows better now but dont you see i see nothing and know nothing but that my lady has granted the duke a secret interview and that ill call them both to account for it now phil be reasonable even if thats the case and i question it there can be harmless interviews between a stuart and a beautiful woman psha and what grounds have you for questioning it ive told you one take it from me and i had the confession from kates own lips shes as jealous of you and kit as ever you can be of kit and her the shaft went somewhat home chesterfield stood glowering and gnawing his finger then who the devil is kit he said suddenly ah replied hamilton who we are all the gulls i sometimes think of that little scheming hussy your wifes friend but do you mean to say she actually went so far as to assert that the dukes visit was due to kit chesterfield reflected still devouring his finger well now i come to think ont she didnt explicitly in so many words say as much perhaps she didnt mention kit at all o yes she did but but what curse it george he burst out in helpless distraction she has a non committal way i admit it of forcing upon one conclusions which she might say she never meant to suggest she may have been mocking me to lead me astray i wish she had never come i wish i had never consented to the part you laid on me what hath it all ended in but disaster whatever the truth of the other charge there is no blinking the fact of the dukes visit how do you know the whole thing may have been a fable to torment you from all accounts you havent played a very wooing part with her no i cant believe it but anyhow tis easy proved and though kit may prove a legend ill never doubt but that she herself was somehow instrumental in bringing about this meeting and yet you say she reported on it to you aye a keyhole report why look there in that case she must be a very arch traitor false to both sides tis like enough but ill have no more of her i told her in so many words she must go you did why not why not what have you to say against it im not sure ive anything i think perhaps you did right o im vastly obliged to you for your condescension you deserve no consideration phil upon my soul if you choose to adopt that tone with me ive done with the matter he was vexed and bothered enough for himself truth to tell the visit of the duke if as he hardly doubted it had actually taken place was a subject for confounding thought he cared nothing for kits part in the business real or pretended his little cousins attitude towards it was what concerned him did that point to artlessness or design he had believed or chosen to believe that in a certain eventuality he himself had a prescriptive title to the most favoured treatment he had always in full confidence proceeded upon that supposition and now if he had been deceiving himself throughout all his elaborate hoax would prove itself waste trouble and he might just as well have spared himself the complication he had been already as it was beginning to question the practical wisdom of the imposture to which he had subscribed and to wonder if more direct means might not have served his purpose better the reflection occurring to him now with aggravated force inclined him to regard this difficult and exasperating husband as the source of all his worry he was moved to throw prudence to the winds and take his unswerving course for the object he had in view and chesterfields own temper lent itself immediately to that provocation consideration matter said the nobleman with the loftiest acidity ill ask you to bear in mind george that the part i requested of you was sympathy and not dictation hamilton had remained seated all this time he rose now in a white fume of anger o was that it he said in answer well ill tell you that i have never yet felt sympathy with a cuckold or counted the man who couldnt command his wifes fidelity as deserving less than he got tis just a question of resourcefulness in more ways than one and the woman who has reason to like her bonds doesnt strain at them now you may go hang for me and as to your damned duke temper temper interrupted the other quite pale and furious upon my soul your manner might almost proclaim you his disappointed rival the two stood glaring at one another do you say that deliberately asked hamilton at length what if i do retorted the other then by god youll provoke me to disprove it on your kinswoman ill not be insulted for nothing you shall not be ill see to it forewarned is to have my answer ready to the occasion he smacked his hand to his sword hilt and turning very haughtily stalked out of the room hamilton breathing hard watched his departure and presently dropped back into his chair with a sneering laugh the sword is the only resource of a fool thought he the duke and now me tis his one solution for everything but hell think better of it never give away his cuckoldom so openly his he frowned heavily as he pondered has it come to that and was mrs moll instrumental in arranging this meeting and is she making us all her dupes me included id give something to look into her mind but shes to receive her cong and tis as well i think especially as it saves me the necessity of settling with her yet as to her reputed traffic with the duke and this kits part in it o mercy on us all i must see her somehow and set my wits to hers fin contre fin or if need be fort contre fin o what a plaguey difficult and fascinating world this is if a man cant hate without wrong and cant love without wrong where is the ethical mean to justify his creation ill go be an oyster he didnt do that but hearing of the earl being on duty that evening with her majesty and assuming the countesss coincident attendance at court he slipped over to the chesterfields quarters in the hope and expectation of finding mrs davis yawning away the hours there with only herself for company but to his surprise and irresistible gratification he found not moll but her little ladyship herself in solitary possession of the great chamber at which discovery his eyes glowed and his pulses thrilled what kate says he glibly lying i never hoped to find you alone she had received him with no sign of fervour corresponding to his own and now looked up from her work a little chill and unresponsive why should you have hoped it cousin she said why should you show pleasure now that it is so why are we not near and dear kinsfolk said he not near enough for the forbidden degrees she answered and therefore not near enough to be alone together his brows went up you were not wont to speak to me like this what have i done to change you o nothing that is quite true well my feelings have not changed i was sure they had not were you he looked at her curiously but her impassive face gave him no clue to her thoughts did you expect to find my lord she said again quietly busy at her work or was it perhaps mrs davis you sought if i sought one i sought the other he answered they are not long to be caught apart thank you for the reminder she answered and he bit his lip with vexation well he hath taken her to attend on her majesty i presume since that is where his duties detain him you had better seek them there a thrill shot through his veins in the sudden thought that she was jealous not i he said i know where i am well off if phil does not a faintest increase of colour flushed her cheek but she worked on steadily still she said in spite of their inseparability as you consider it i do not doubt but that she is in the house at this moment shall i send her a message that you are here what are you implying if you please cousin he said why she answered quietly you knew very well that my lord was elsewhere and concluded my absence from his who other than mrs davis then could have been the object of this clandestine visit he heard he smiled to himself he drew his chair a little closer kate he said are you in very truth jealous she cast one startled glance at him but though her bosom betrayed its own disquiet maintained her self possession jealous she said of mrs davis and my husband no he answered but of mrs davis he sought to convey a world of meaning into his look his tone shall i confess the truth he said it was mrs davis i expected to find alone here i will send her to you she rose no no he begged her with a gesture to be seated again but she refused to respond be your kind and reasonable self you misconceive me indeed you do i had come to a resolution it was to see this young woman and urge upon her by every motive of decency and consideration to leave this house and cease to take advantage of a grotesque situation to persecute and humiliate you she stood looking down at him still impassive still inscrutable i should be grateful to you cousin she said but i am humiliated in nothing but your thinking me so at least you are unhappy o no indeed not well it is true that freedom has its compensations sweeter by contrast than any rich possession and morally you are free cousin i know i am free to choose i choose freedom ah but with love he caught lightly at her skirt but she withdrew it sharply from him there is no need to act she said when there is no audience indeed i am not acting he answered i am glad of it she said because it is a bad play i prefer you in your part cousin of the disinterested friend then he was stung to a foolish retort like the duke of york she started ever so slightly what about him was that the character he came to play when he visited you yesterday in your private apartments to his surprise she answered him with perfect apparent serenity of course he merely came to borrow my guitar of me was she really innocent or dissembling he believed the latter and looked at her with some genuine admiration for her subtlety o he said was that all and being in julias chamber to melt melodious words to lutes of amber i suppose he played she answered indeed they both played both he laughed so his highness came accompanied o yes she said he would never have come alone and who was his friend one of mine ah you will not tell me are you not interesting yourself a little too much in my personal affairs she said she held out her hand coldly good night am i to go then no i am i am really dropping with sleep good night cousin he got up in a pet i am sorry my company has proved so fatiguing there was a time when you could endure it with a better grace but that was before your days of freedom and happiness and he strode out of the room resisting a violent temptation to bang the door but her ladyship stood looking after him rather piteously and with tears sprung suddenly to her eyes i was so sorry cousin she murmured with a grievous sigh but i am afraid you are a bad man and outside on the gravel under the moonlight master george hurrying away stopped to grind his vicious teeth has he stolen a march on me and who was the other for you see that problem of kit was again disturbing his mind chapter xv hamilton making moodily for his quarters took a somewhat deserted by way which led him shortly under a long covered passage connected with the stables he had but entered this unlighted tunnel when aware of a couple of figures approaching its further end he backed instinctively into the shadows prepared with the amiable humour of his kind to detect an intrigue or surprise a secret therefrom peering himself unseen he saw the two man and woman stop in the moonlight at the mouth of the archway where he could very clearly distinguish the identity of one of them and almost as certainly guess that of the other his ears pricked to catch their whispered confidences but he was too far off to distinguish more than an inarticulate giggling murmur and then there appeared to occur a little scuffle between the pair and to the sound of a distinct smack the lady broke away and entered the passage alone obviously an attention of her cavaliers having been promptly acknowledged by her any further escort on his part had been peremptorily declined he did not attempt indeed to follow but standing alone in the moonlight a moment holding his hand to his cheek suddenly turned tail and vanished the hooded lady came on all unconscious of the watcher and was nearing the point of emergence when hamilton stepped across her path and barred her way she gave a small irrepressible squeak and stood stock still come he said let us see what little tib is after her tom this amorous night she recognized his voice and let him lead her impassively to near the mouth of the passage just so as the entering light might fall upon her face and then he turned back the shrouding wimple and saw a very rosebud the blush must be hot said he that shows by moonlight and now mrs moll what have you got to say for yourself she laughed quite recovered and backed a step from him gentlemen first said she how did you find my lady alone for a guess i came to find you sure and by god ive found you out yes im found out you wouldnt have me spend all my time stifling within you favour moonlit walks it seems why for precautions sake and to oblige you im doubtful about my obligation to you of late mrs moll who were you walking with i never asked him his name i didnt suppose it would be camel fo it was my lord arran was it not was it now what an eye youve got and you had met him i suppose by appointment no it was by the yew tree come my lady youre playing some game of your own in all this and i want to know what it is i brought you here for a specific purpose and ive more than an idea that youre converting the opportunity to a purpose of your own what is it whats what i was only taking a stroll how did you make the acquaintance of my lord arran o is that his name you know it is well to be sure many more people know tom fool than tom fool knows doesnt he know you he does now im thinking his cheek will keep him in mind of me for the next hour had the limb been no more than the victim of a chance gallantry hamilton looked at her perplexed a saintly innocence spoke from her eyes but with a vexed laugh he dismissed the absurdity and then his brows lifted to a sudden inspiration he had recalled on the instant some seeming casual words of the duke of york addressed to himself they had related to a saraband and to a certain superlative guitar possessed by arrans sister now he actually blinked in the dazzling illumination of an idea kate and the guitar and the royal strummer and arran lured by moll at the dukes instigation the unconscious procurer of that meeting there however ordered was the connection the explanation of the visit he felt as sure of it as if he had himself planned out the process why in the name of intrigue had he never hit on the trail before but now it was found it led to certain conclusions with a dogs smile showing his teeth he clapped his two hands on the girls shoulders and held her grippingly before him ive been thinking said he you told lord chesterfield and he told me that youd been witness of the duke of yorks visit to his wife isnt that so sure said moll her heart going a little in spite of herself i looked and listened through the keyhole she confessed it quite unabashed nor did hamilton regard the act as anything but cricket in the modern meaning honour with gentlemen of his kidney was just a phrase to toss on swordpoints how he said did you know it was the duke of york i heard them say so you are lying you pretended to lord chesterfield that you did not know who the visitor was and so you give yourself away do i and a very pretty gift too though i say it ah you are quite shameless i see now what cause have i for shame tell me that what cause you can ask that o i can ask anything enough of this equivocating what did you mean by stating you heard them say it was the duke why i meant it who were they just my lady and the other o the other who was the other why the one that wasnt my lady of course was it kit i never said so you know what do you say now i say what i said before come was it man or woman how should i know im ashamed of you george his strong fingers quivered with an almost irresistible desire to shake the life out of her possibly for she had a liking for him he might have won the truth from her even now by a show of tenderness but his temper exacerbated by a recent disappointment had got the better of him and any further finessing was at the moment beyond his power very well my lady said he drawing a deep breath i shall know how to deal with a traitor whom i had thought a confederate i have done my part fairly by you wait there said the girl stopping him she had abundance of spirit and carried the sharpest little set of claws at the ends of her velvet fingers you promised to let the king see me i promised to let you see the king o well isnt that the same thing if hes got eyes anyhow you havent done it it was to have been the reward of your service to me and in that by god youve failed and i believe failed of purpose i dont reward traitors how have i been a traitor dont you know very well but perhaps youve come to the conclusion that saving the king the duke of york might suit you for second best george dont george me madam youll make me dangerous o i know what you mean but wholl believe such a little rogue and liar and who do you think will get the best of a contest of wits between us but tell his lordship if you will im at that reckless stage i should welcome a sharp decision with him for you youve proved yourself a worse than useless partner in the business earning the mans aversion instead of his love and by your hints and antics bringing the pair nearer through a mutual jealousy than you found them but i understood now why it was and just the value of the scruples you were so nice in expressing they waited on the highest bidder didnt they and i wish you luck of him now youve got him upon my soul mrs davis you have my sincere respect as one of the artfullest little timeservers that ever knew how to take a profit of circumstance i dont know what you mean o of course not innocence in a wimple like a very pansy of the fields you want me to go i suppose why your talents i confess seem wasted in this dull corner of the palace there are livelier quarters for their exercise the duke of yorks for instance he took his hands from her shoulders but their grip might still have imprisoned her so rigid remained her attitude you wont let me see the king she said hey day jeered he not short of the very highest will content this country chip but nothing for nothing say i she stood quite motionless conning him stood for a full minute without a word and then she shook her shoulders and laughed and held out her hand to him well then good bye george she said i think youre hard on me but i bear no malice and well part friends wont we advice isnt dismissal said hamilton and youre not my guest no i know she answered but truth is his lordship was equally emphatic about my wanting a change or perhaps it was himself wanted it im not sure well ill take a day to consider of it you wouldnt think better of me i suppose if in the meantime i were able to put you right about a certain question youve been puzzling yourself over what question fubbs he felt quite kindly to her again since she had yielded so submissively to his suggestion the little rogues face of her drawn in silver point and just touched with pink looked a sweet spiritual flower in the moonlight o i mustnt tell she said or it would spoil everything then how can i answer for my better thoughts he protested no you cant of course she said only i dont want us to part enemies come he said kisses are more proof than words but at that with a light laugh she sprang past him and ran at twenty yards she turned blew him a mocking salute and again turning disappeared round a corner in truth a fascinating little devil thought hamilton with a grim smile as he continued his way it goes to my heart to lose her but if anything were needed to prove the justice of my surmises regarding her double dealing the equanimity with which she accepted her dismissal should supply it and yet she loves me well enough to wish to coax my good opinion at the end how what is this mystery of mysteries poor moll poor moll herself had got home meanwhile and crouching catlike by an unlatched window with her eyes peering above the sill to see if the coast were clear had presently re entered the house by the way she had emerged from it once in she stood up shaking her cloak from her shoulders touched her hair into order with rapid fingers and exhaled a tragic sigh so she whispered with the tiniest of giggles one and one makes two and two and one makes three if she asks me to go i shall begin to think im not wanted here any more will it come i wonder it came in fact quite punctually and entirely to her surprise as stealing noiselessly across the room she pushed open the unclosed door it made her jump to find the countess herself standing awaiting her spectrally on the threshold she stopped fairly staggered and for the moment had not a word to say her ladyship advancing moll fell back before her and the two stood facing one another in the empty chamber it was remote and unused and bare of everything save the entering moonbeams which gave it an aspect as of its windows being shored up by ghostly buttresses i congratulate you mrs davis said kate in the most curiously inward of little voices it is apart and well chosen and only the merest accident led to my discovery of your use of it but having seen you slip out i could not but watch and wait to welcome you home again moll rallied her wits for the inevitable combat sure she said hasnt your ladyship ever felt the delight of climbing in by the window when you might enter by the open door i prefer direct ways to underhand was the chilling response try a stolen kiss before you answer for that said moll thank you i leave that sort of thing to you what do you mean now by that sort of thing does a royal duke count in it because tis not every time hes to be found coming in by the open door your knowledge of the customs of princes said kate icily but with a curious little tremble in her voice is of course very profound so you will be aware that they can claim privileges denied to others is that so now then what call had my lord your husband to get into such a tantrum about it when i told him that the duke of york had been paying you a visit seismographically as it were she was conscious of the shock her words produced kate shivered and seemed to stiffen i am not answerable for his lordships tantrums as you call them she said in a stifled way any more than for his tastes and predilections if any malicious wretch has chosen to carry slanderous tales to him and he to listen to them that was me said moll and im not going to be abused for just peeping through a keyhole and telling him what i saw behind it how should i know in my innocence that it wasnt all quite right and proper and the last thing to make him explode over her little ladyship seemed to catch her breath over the mere audacity of this self vindication and then she answered in volume though always careful to subdue her voice to the occasion innocent you without heart or conscience monster of guile and ingratitude viper on the hearth that has warmed you spy and informer that you are to dare that brazen confession and in the same breath to pretend to an artless innocence of the fire your vile calumny was intended to blow into a blaze you innocent you anything but the shameless wanton your every act proclaims you she paused panting go on said moll unruffled get it all out and over it does not move you said kate why should it deaf to every appeal of honour and decency shame on your womans nature that can so wrong and vilify one of your own sex whose only fault has been too great a tolerance of the insult and humiliation imposed upon her by your presence again she stopped and mrs moll took up the tale very pink and cool gingumbobs she said if im so wicked arent you a little giving away your own innocency if all was so in order in the great gentlemans visit why are you so warm about my peeping and telling of it because by making a secret of it you designedly make it appear the very scandal it was not i made no secret of it bless you why ill go tell everybody about it this very moment if you like there now aint i forgiving forgiving poor kate put back a stray curl from her damp forehead you dare to throw the burden of compunction upon me what have i not to forgive since the day of your arrival in this room now desperately she grasped to recover the moral lead and to elude the charge to which the other wickedly sought to pin her why are you here i say she went on hurriedly what is the meaning of these secret exits and entrances but no need to ask your insolence betrays you did you meet your lover did he slip out from the queens presence just to kiss and dally a wanton moment with the fond inseparable object of his fancy could neither of you wait the hour of reunion in the house you insult and pollute by your presence poor severed unhappy couple rent apart by the only brief interval which my lord is forced against his will to devote to duty and decency she stopped of her very passion i wouldnt be sarcastic if i were you said moll it fits you about as well as the lancashire giants breeches would and tis all thrown away because if you mean his lordship i wouldnt trouble to walk out of one room into another to meet him much less climb through a window kate her bosom still stormy looked her scornful incredulity she pointed to the casement why that way then she said for no reason answered the visitor except that when a bodys watched and pounced on for her every movement she has to take her own measures to steal a little freedom the air isnt so fresh or the company so lively here that one isnt driven once in a while to play truant aye you may sneer and doubt madam she was waxing a little warm but tis true nevertheless that if i were to spy your precious husband in my walks id go a mile out of my way to avoid him love him indeed i tell you that he fair sickens me i tell you that if i drew him in a lottery id tear the ticket up under his very nose indeed she snapped her fingers viciously as if rehearsing the act and then stood with her arms akimbo breathing defiance then why said her ladyship with an extremely wrathful hauteur yet with an instinctive wincing from the pugnacious little claws do you persist in this daily offence of imposing your company where it is least admired or desired the naughty girl broke into a laugh and clapped her hands its come she cried its come as i knew it would and her face fell twinklingly grave so you want me to go she said i should have thought responded kate it could have been small gratification to you to stay on to contemplate the failure of your designs on a virtue on which you would meanly seek to revenge yourself by pretending to scorn what you have been powerless to corrupt moll fairly whistled mercy on us she exclaimed virtue do you mean his and is that your way of putting it so its sour grapes on my part is it but i never said you know that i had that effect on him that he has on me who would expect you to say it vain and heartless creature but whatever the truth and i look to only distortion of it from your lips these clandestine flittings be their object what or whom they may can no longer be suffered to impair the reputation of this house they must either cease or you must go moll her lip lifted brought up her right hand with a slow flourish and once twice thrice snapped thumb and second finger together with great deliberation very well my lady said she i will go and leave the reputation of this house in your keeping i have done my little best to purify it during my brief time here but i am afraid the disease is too deep seated for anything but a chirurgical operation when you have been removed perhaps by his royal physicianship of york the place may have a chance of recovery and she dropped a little insolent curtsy and without a tremor her nose exalted brushed by my lady and stalked out of the room at which kate having no word to say nor courage to say it fell against the wall with a white face and had a hard to do to fight away an inclination to tears chapter xvi mrs davis conscious that her position was no longer a tenable one and driven to naughty extremities by the three sided investment which left her no alternative but to retreat fighting retired to her chamber to consider the course by which she could best inflict a parthian stroke on the three enemies who each from a different motive were responsible for her coming ejectment she contemplated nothing very terrible it is true only some exaggerated form of mischief in keeping with her little lawless whimsical nature she was not a tragic vengeance and she nursed no very grievous resentment over a treatment which she was perfectly aware she had done much to deserve and little to be entitled to deprecate she had taken advantage of a temptation to play especially of late a game of her own rather than that of hamilton her employer and confederate and she had wasted her opportunities rather on personal enjoyment than in pursuance of any consistent effort to serve that gentlemans designs she knew all this admitted her own shortcomings and yet though she had a physical liking for the rascal she was not going to let him escape scot free without any endeavour to retaliate on him for his cool repudiation of her at the eleventh hour she wished and intended him no great harm only she felt it a moral obligation on herself to speak the last word in this comedy of misunderstandings it was worth while to show him that his supposed easy command of women was subject to some little accidents of discomfiture and humiliation where he chose to presume too much in his dealings with the sharp witted among them after which she would be quite willing to call quits with him now hamilton for his part in leaping to a certain conclusion as regarded molls connection with the guitar incident had shrewdly approximated but only approximated the truth mrs davis as we know had had nothing to do with the dukes visit nevertheless the dukes visit came to have something to do with mrs davis his highness a singularly close observer though with a congenital incapacity for profitable reflection had not failed to take stock of the attractive little figure in the garden nor to consider to what possible uses he might convert the fact of its offence in the eyes of the lady of whom he was enamoured he might for instance by privately threatening that offence with punishment for its wrong doing terrify it into lending itself as an instrument to his own designs it should be worth trying only it was necessary first to secure an interview with the person of the offence there was no difficulty to be foreseen in that save the one difficulty of eluding scandal in the process and indeed from the ladys point of view there was no difficulty at all for in very truth from the moment when listening and peeping at the keyhole moll had realized the rank of the countesss visitor that amazing young person had been actually busying her brain with speculations as to her own possible eligibility as a royal favourite though in the regard of the second best only it had been under the spur of that inspiration indeed that deterred by no false modesty as to her personal qualifications in the way of looks and witcheries she had appeared singing at the window with the view that questions might be asked about her a piece of effrontery which seeing that it was ventured in the very face of the high born rival to be supplanted might fairly be considered unsurpassable but diffidence was never one of molls weaknesses so far then master georges native acumen had led him to within sight of the facts he had been wrong only in assuming the meeting to be already a fait accompli it was not so far and the reason was this the duke could not afford to bid directly for the services of a great noblemans presumed chre amie but he could employ an agent and for this purpose he had selected arran as much through his imbecility as through his relationship with the family a convenient instrument for the task of enticing the quarry into his preserves it was easily done and after all at a minimum expense in tactics arran acting as his highnesss decoy and with no thought but to accommodate his master in the sort of jest approved and applauded by the gallants of his day found no difficulty in getting into communication with mrs davis or in arranging an accidental meeting with her of course at that moll refused utterly to be beguiled offhand into committing herself to the mysterious interview entreated of her she was pettish wilful distracting she showed a complete obtuseness in realizing the nature of the rank which stood behind the summons she was wholly childish and adorable and she ended by chastising the impertinence which her innocent flirtations had seemed meant to provoke and all the while she was calculating how best she could invite those second approaches to which she was resolved in her mind to succumb the issue of that night decided her the next day she sent a little private note of penitence to arran and that same evening saw her closeted with the duke of york there was none other present but the young earl retained possibly by his royal highness for the part of chaperon a precaution not ill advised the prince may have been disposed to think when he came to re view the visible attractions of his visitor they were such indeed that he felt he would have to keep a definite guard on his susceptibilities if he were to come out of the interview unscathed he would have had no objection in the world to take this sugared bonbon by the way as a man might crunch a salted almond to add a zest to his wine only the stake at issue was too instant the bottle might pass while he was enjoying the appetizer wherefore he assumed from the first an air of coldness and restraint he bowed to the lady and assigned her a seat with a gesture my lord has informed you he said of my reason for desiring this meeting mrs davis shook her pretty head not he o said the duke it is explained in a few words during a recent visit of ceremony i was paying to how shall i name her your unofficial hostess i chanced to hear you singing outside the window of the room in which i was seated la said moll with a shrug of her white shoulders to think of it and i never guessed but i was alone she was not in the least overawed by the sacrosanctity of her company she would have answered back to the pope himself in his own coin of excommunication or anything else and certainly not less to a lay son of his however illustrious she had no bump of reverence whatever on her little noddle you have a rare voice mrs davis said the prince it is a pity is it not that it should be wasted on discord when it might be so much more profitably employed in winning you a way to legitimate and decent fame moll opened her eyes this for a beginning was not at all the sort of thing she had expected what discord if you please said she tut tut answered his highness hardly smiling is not that a very unnecessary question we have not got eyes for nothing ears for nothing intelligence for nothing if the form of discord need not be specified it need none the less be understood i will speak plainly however and to this effect your position in a certain quarter of whitehall palace is not by whomsoever franked a desirable one it constitutes in short a scandal to the place and an insult to one who is forced against her will to condone it moll rose to her feet her eyes sparkling why she said there is no need nor desire on my part said the duke coldly to go into particulars it is enough that the situation i have hinted at must terminate and this was all this the sole reason for which she had been trapped and beguiled into this interview with the great person it appeared so and mrs davis had nothing for it but to bear her disappointment and chagrin with what philosophy she could and on the whole she bore them amiably after all molls philosophy fished in large waters and if she failed in a catch she was always ready without complaint to rebait her hook and try again there is a sort of self complacency in certain beauties which is too serenely un selfconscious to be called vanity it is largely founded i think on the flawless digestion which generally goes with physical perfection i suppose she has been putting you up to this she said quite coolly i call it mean of her when she knows perfectly well that she is the scandal and not me but i see what it is she wants to rid herself of a witness shes done nothing to make a friendly one and so being afraid to tell me downright i must go she hands over the business to the one his highness put up his hand with such a grim authoritative expression that the young lady stopped though with a rebellious gulp my lord said the duke very smoothly addressing the earl i think perhaps this interview will not suffer by being confined to the two most interested in it he smiled and nodded arran with an answering grimace expressive at least of as much mental vacuity as understanding bowed low and withdrew the moment they were alone the duke turned in his chair and crossing his knees and leaning on one arm bent his melancholy brows on moll in deliberate scrutiny by she madam he said you allude to moll laughed shortly o dont you know very well dont you know he said that the young gentleman just left is her brother of course i do answered moll and that that was why you wanted to shut my mouth he sat regarding her some moments longer and then a little sombre smile dawned on his face you have a quick understanding i perceive mrs davis he said that may be a profitable or a perilous possession according as it is employed i wonder it has never yet led you to realize the supreme asset you have in your voice o i see well enough you too want me out of the way said moll perking a scornful nose what is the good of going round about it like this im dangerous where i am i suppose very well then i must be got rid of he laughed too impulsive too impulsive my little lady dangerous you could be thats patent to any mans peace of mind but as to the sense in which you mean it she broke in with a little imperious stamp as to that im not to be misjudged by you or any one when i said the scandal wasnt in my position i meant it if you think im there as my lords doxy youre precious well mistaken i hate the beast and if its a question of scandal tis her ladyship ought to go there she ought and you know why i dont on my honour then youd like to ah that maybe is quite another matter he looked at her she looked at him come mrs davis he said after a minute of silence im sure we are on the way to understand one another o are we said moll with a sniff scandals he said have nothing to do with facts an apparition might cause one you may be as innocent as a babe but appearances are against you therefore you must suffer for appearances now about this voice of yours well what about it with that and your face for fortune you might under proper auspices prove an incalculable success what do you mean by auspices he leaned forward lightly touching his breast with his fingers patronage a royal dukes and in the meantime pending developments we might consent to condone this offence leaving you undisturbed in your present position i see said the girl after a pause her eyes rather glowing i see and that you mean is to be your reward to me by and by for consenting if i do consent to act now as your creature and decoy to help you to your fancy youve no objection to letting me remain on the spot in spite of my polluting it if only ill act my best for you as an informer and go between such intelligence said the duke combined with gifts so sweet should ensure you properly directed a prosperous future well said moll its a bargain if you like only wait while i think a sense of mischief was already alive in her defrauded in her higher expectations she cared nothing for that conditional promise of patronage except that it humiliated even her to be thought worthy of it she had the wit and the gifts if she chose to exercise them to prevail in that direction without any help from outsiders feeling rather at bay in the midst of this group of self interested plotters she was driven at last to abandon her position in a revel of retaliation on them all only how could she manage it how let her think youre a great gentleman i know she said suddenly but where loves concerned even princes have to take their place among the ranks have you never fear of a rival he gazed at her sombrely some moments without speaking do you know of any he asked at length i know of a coming meeting she said with whom kits his name ive learnt no more how did you learn that never mind how ive not been in her company these weeks for nothing and when and where is this meeting to take place at half past eight oclock to morrow evening in the in the mulberry garden she chose the place and time at haphazard what cried his highness biting his lip so public o said moll theres nothing so private for that matter as a vizard and and hes to wear a green scarf in his hat to be known by her and she a green bow in her bosom to be known by him if you doubt youd better go and see for yourself my lord dukes countenance had fallen very glum a shadow seemed to overspread his face it is a good thought he said kit did you say kit sure supposing i were to be kit moll clapped her hands in delight and pretending it she cried find out all about the other hm his highness was plainly disturbed he sat awhile pondering a gloomy frown knotting his forehead presently he looked up with a deep sigh well said he you have already proved your title to my favour i will consider of this matter and in the meantime keep you as silent as the grave he rose put a finger to his lips not a word to any one he said you shall hear from me again and he led her to the door smiled on her hesitated laughed away the temptation and bade her go and then he returned to his seat and sat gnawing at his nails for the next half hour chapter xvii on the morning succeeding the conversation last recorded the following anonymous communication was received by three of the individuals most concerned in this history an assignation vizards with kit is arranged for this evening in the mulberry garden the parties to it will be distinguished by in the gentlemans case a green scarf about the hat in the ladys a green bow at the bosom a well wisher this note in facsimile and in a palpably feigned hand was delivered by the twopenny post through its recent establishment in cloak lane near dowgate hill to his lordship the earl of chesterfield to my lady countess his wife and to mr george hamilton my ladys kinsman each in its private turn pooh poohd over it each concluded that it was without question the work of mrs davis and therefore not worth consideration in any shape and each decided after long and irritable reflection that it would lose nothing by going to verify the falsehood or accuracy of the report and to each in conclusion succeeded the same inspiration was it possible that perspicacious mrs moll had clearly foreseen that contingency which was to adorn itself with the fateful badge with a view to surprising such secrets as might reveal themselves to that verdant enigma his lordship considered this may be nothing but the hussys retaliation on me for my rejection of her advances and yet curse it how can she afford to be so definite in her facts without some ground to go upon tis my lady thats meant thats sure there must be something in some way in it and if so how to surprise and expose them ah by god i know my lady thought is she really by chance telling the truth and is this her way of revenging herself on me for my reflections on her character yet if it is all an imposition a barren vengeance that would be defeating its own object no there must be something at the bottom of it some mischief some wickedness tis my lord thats meant without question and in that case i have a right a duty to perform in being present but how to penetrate such perfidy supposing it to exist o i know what i will do if only i can be there first and lead him to betray himself mr hamilton reflected what is this my mollinda for mollindas work you are kit and an assignation with whom is it man or woman you little devil and so is the enigma to be resolved at last i dont believe a word of it it is some pretty trick of yours to requite me for my late unkindness to you well ill defeat it find me with a green scarf to my hat at the rendezvous and kiss me for kit whoever you may be who would have thought of that now george but your own ingenious self but in spite of their pretended confidence they were all three properly puzzled and nervous bless you and one after the other in an inconsequent sort of way they put themselves into positions where they might hope to run across mrs davis by accident and question her casually as to her plans for the evening but exasperatingly enough moll was never once in evidence the whole day long and no one knew what had become of her she had vanished from all human ken like the baseless fabric of a vision chapter xviii where the grounds of buckingham palace now extend there stood in the seventeenth century the old flowery pleasaunce known as mulberry garden a place long appropriated like its spring prototype at whitehall to al fresco entertainment ex mural and mural as things then went there was to the ordinary cit a soupon of adventure suggested in a visit to this remoter fairyland and as a little enterprising beyond the confines of the orthodox adds a zest to the soberest merry making mulberry garden possessed an attraction for the town which was certainly due as much to its comparative removedness as to any diversions it might offer in the way of dancing and junketing there was a mild thrill in achieving it its wild and tangled acres only gathered into cores of brilliancy at certain definite centres where after dark the scattered threads of lamps like gossamer hung with dew drops constellated thickly about groups of arbours set in open spaces among the trees where glittering forms circulated and laughter rang and cheese cakes were eaten and lips kissed under fragrant ambushes of boughs woven into a thousand pretty devices of green garters and lovers knots there was here none of the structural artifices which later came to vulgarize and alas popularize the more ordered vistas of vauxhall across the water cascades and sham ruins and side shows and so forth but nature was allowed for the most part her own sweet untrammelled way and where the wildernesses were converted it was to no more than an artless religion of green swards and bowers whereon and wherein the tripping frolic of foot and heart might adapt itself if it would to the music of the moon and the song of the innocent nightingale not that to those chaste warblers of the night was entrusted the whole provision of music for the company skies might be moonless and birds silent or out of season wherefore there was generally to be found engaged to the service of romantic hearts and ears some performer skilled on lute or harp whose melodious utterances thrilling through grove and clearing were calculated to awaken such emotions as were compatible with the sweet understanding of sylvan solitudes now that is a true picture though very certainly a one sided for where innocence goes sin is sure to follow and the atmosphere of mulberry garden was by no means all of harmless frolic compact being relatively remote and consisting moreover for three fourths of its space of unredeemed wilderness it formed a tempting rendezvous for spirits kept better apart and too often it must be confessed a meeting among its waste thickets was tantamount to an intrigue still in its popular centres the whole may be said to have leavened the parts and it was to those nominally that the town gravitated and in them found its entertainment mulberry garden was aristocratic and remained so until its vogue came to abate which it was already threatening to do through the growing reputation of that jardin printemps at lambeth to the entrance of which a trip across the water made such a pleasant prelude never popularly patronized there were times when robuster novelties attracting the exclusive might enjoy its green walks and hospitalities with the sense almost of being a privileged company invited to a fte champtre it had of course its central restaurant without which it could not have existed aristocratically in the building known as mulberry garden house where quite recherch little dinners could be eaten and indeed it was there that mr pepys to mention him but once again discussed that spanish olio chartered by one shere and mentioned in the diary which he found so richly delectable a very noble dish such as i never saw better or more of in this room fashion would dine and often too liberally wine too before emerging to tickle its pseudo pastoral sentiment with pretence of neo arcadian groves and flowery shepherdesses and it was from this room that vizard on brow mr george hamilton issued at about a quarter past eight oclock on a certain soft and windless june night he looked sharply about him as he descended the steps into the open searching among the company within his range for a particular token it was one of those exceptional occasions when the visitors were relatively few and as such widely scattered among the walks and trees all the space before him was strung with tiny lamps festooned from branch to branch or ambushed in cloudy green like glow worms they cast a diffused light enough to distinguish people by but clothing one and all in a romantic glamour very soft and mystic many most in fact of the company wore vizards women indeed on view in public places seldom appeared unmasked not from blushing modesty but to hide their inability to blush at all where a blush was called for that was understood and derided yet while wit and address might effect what they could in the way of persuasion it was an article of the strictest punctilio that no vizor should be removed by force a rule so respected that any abuse of it was like enough in those hot times to lead to bloody reprisals on the offender now not distinguishing what he sought and indeed the hour was yet early for an expected trysting master george sauntered away with the purpose to seek some retired spot where he might pin about his hat the green emblem of identification which he had brought with him in his pocket on his way reaching an open space where much company was congregated he stopped to ascertain the cause of the assembling and perceived seated upon a green knoll in the midst the long grey clad figure of a harpist who was in the act of tuning up his instrument before performing quel quil soit he asked of a scented exquisite who stood near him what exclaimed the gallant turning in a fainting affectation on his interlocutor not know him not know our divine orpheus the rare the inspired the man to whose finger tips the bees come a sipping for honey the man the tweak of whose thumb will ravish a heart from its bosom as clean as a periwinkle from its shell i asked for a name said hamilton caustically and you have given me a catalogue of which the least desired part was the note of exclamation at the end well tis jack bannister said the stranger much misliking the others tone but recognizing a potential something in it which kept him civil but having furnished the information he first edged and then swaggered away hamilton had heard speak of the prodigy but had never yet chanced to alight on him he lingered now to endorse or not the extravagant eulogies lavished on this eighth wonder of his age and having listened he admitted to himself that the verdict was justified there was something in this mans performance which surpassed anything he had hitherto experienced it illustrated in the extremest degree what is called genius but which is really soul that spiritual utterance born with a few men like an unknown language which would be transcendental were it not for the medium paint or ink or chord or marble through which it must materialize in order to reach the senses ah he thought if he could only say all that without the harp if shakespeare could only have conveyed his mind to us without pen or paper what a divine and cleansing understanding would be ours but the senses are cloudy interpreters he was moved but he would not applaud as well cry brava he thought to the divine speaker of the sermon on the mount i will not so degrade him to exalt myself but there were others who lacked his understanding and the clapping of hands was general it offended this paradoxical being and he strode away the perfection of his impression sullied as he dived into a dusk unfrequented walk a new strain of music pursued him but he would not stop to listen to it that applause had spelt the surfeit which had spoilt the feast presently a little stealing figure in front of him barred his way there was but an occasional lamp here and the path was dim but he could make out that it was a woman and young and alone it was easy to overtake her and a matter of course to stop and accost because she was masked and unaccompanied which was in itself a challenge as he stood a sudden thought seizing him he looked down at her bosom but no green emblem was there to inform him only a rather tell tale tawdriness of ornament and material and he laughed and put his hand on the truants arm he is under the gooseberry bushes beyond he said shall we go stoop and seek him there she started from him wincing up her shoulders in alarm while she clutched a handkerchief between her palms and then he heard her breath catch and saw that she had been crying o dont touch me she said with a gulp please to let me go past good gentleman the address her intonation betrayed her plainly enough for what she was some little town skit sempstress or servant maid broken loose and now frightened over her own temerity why said he if you are in distress i am a rare comforter come let me remove this before it dissolves she could offer no resistance to so beautiful a gentleman and he slipped the vizard from her face it was a blowzed and plain one so revealed its only recommendation youth let honesty spare to deny itself said hamilton there was no need to cover this away child what are you doing here i dont know said the girl distraught and sobbing i didnt ought to have come o let me go what made you come then twas my young man there he called me a name and i thought i thought if i was to be called that youd not be called it for nothing now you know that was foolish because to answer wrong with wrong is like patching a worn out gown with a piece cut from itself yes sir so it is mend bad with good child and he positively seemed to expand forgive injuries tell me what wrought this change of feeling in you this sense of an error realized and repented she began to sob again but quietly and hanging her head twas twas him there i think a playing so beautiful and and i seemed overtook all of a sudden with my wickedness i want to get out to escape from from why from yourself child and so you shall but whither to him o no no to mother come then i will see you on your road o dont sir pish i am sincere what is thy name betty sir harkee betsinda i also heard the harpist and was overtook and repented me of my sins for the time being now for the nonce i am to be trusted but you must hurry this virtue will certainly last to the gate where i will see you safe bestowed go home then and be a good girl and never think to sin this way again she still hesitated tearful and in doubt but quickly surrendered to his insistence and went beside him submissively he led her by a circuitous route to the great wicket of the place where it stood in a blaze of flambeaux facing the dining hall and there outside waited a throng of chairs and vehicles the most having brought visitors but among them several hackney coaches driven over as they might be to day on the chance of a fare and into one of these hamilton bundled his charge having first settled with the coachman and he sent her off with his blessing smiling on her timid benedictions and then he turned his back on the gate and smacked his chest with ineffable unction and threw a glance at the sky as if to observe if the recording angel were there making a note yet what if the girl had been pretty but he shall have the benefit of the doubt he strolled back the length of the lighted building savouring by the way his own laudableness and coming presently to the starry tree haunted sward beyond was aware in one instant of a lady with an emerald bow in her bosom standing fanning herself apart near a rhododendron thicket and of a cavalier whose hat was adorned with an apple green scarf striding across the grass to join her he was so near the two that he was able unobserved to slip though with a little jump of the heart behind a tree trunk within earshot of the coming colloquy the gentleman walked up to the lady and bowed and stood silent she responded with the minutest toss of her head and remained as mute she fanned herself he whistled hem said he hem said she hamilton chuckled though in an exasperated way by the lord he thought if tis not my cousin kate and phil and i perceive what is their game which is for each to make the other speak first he watched like a cat hem coughed the lady again and hem coughed the gentleman only more aggressively at that moment a second lady having a green bow at her bosom came rapidly from the direction of the gate and passing across the observers near field of vision went on and vanished among the trees she was seen both by him and by the stationary lady who started ever so slightly chesterfield having his back to the flitting figure stood unmoved i think said the lady in an odd repressed little voice and seeming to make up her mind of a sudden that you have made a mistake chesterfield uttered a sort of triumphant snarl no by god said he i have made no mistake and now acknowledge madam that you have been the first to break the silence between us what then she protested you have made a mistake i say whoever you may think me i am not she now hamilton struck with an idea had been privily during these few moments pinning his own scarf about his hat and at these words he came from his ambush no guet apens but the grass sir said he must explain my soft approach this lady speaks truth you are mistaken in her chesterfields eyes glared red through his vizard holes he sneered horribly if i were mistaken before sir said he judge what i may be now then he turned with a whirl on the other is this the way you hope to convince me against your shameless perfidy but you are betrayed madam as much in your purposed visit here as in the object of your wanton escapade will you still pretend you do not know your husband indeed she said i know him very well he uttered an oath then you know his way with villains and white with passion he whipped out his sword they were all standing apart screened by shrubs from the general view for the first time the lady showed some trepidation she moved hurriedly to interpose herself for shame put it up she said i tell you again you are mistaken and you may say it a hundred times he cried and i shall not believe you sir said hamilton frigidly i too wear a sword though i have not drawn it you shall not lack the need cried the other but he left him for the moment and addressing the lady stamped with fury you dare to face me with that lie and the very witness to it standing here to refute you but theres a way to settle it take off your vizard ill not ah take it off i say never while i live then by god ill do it for you he actually meant it she retreated before him kit she cried will you see me so insulted now at that my lord stopped dead mowing and grinning like an ape so convict out of your own mouth he cried will you dare to deny longer and then he turned his fury on the other liar and betrayer whatever your cursed identity this point shall penetrate it look to yourself hamilton was ready the swords tinkled the lady screamed there she goes again the green favour look is it for her you have mistaken me wretch hold your wicked hand as by one consent the two belligerents lowered their points the figure which had once before revealed itself hurrying past was again come into view walking this time with a gentleman about whose hat was wound a scarf of green sarcenet hamilton gaped a surprised grin on his face already somewhat confounded by his cousins appeal to him this suggestion of a further entanglement seemed fairly to take his breath away was the coincidence accidental or deliberate and if the latter what the mischief was at the bottom of it all he might have thought who rather but that was superfluous there could be only one anyhow being in for it he would make the best he could of circumstance for the rest he was rather tickled with the hussys impudent daring and curious to see how her plot worked out where was she herself he wondered somewhere watching the game no doubt but as for my lord he stared like one petrified all his assurance was knocked out of him he looked goggle eyed and gasping like a landed fish from his adversary to the lady and from the lady to hamilton and again from them both to the rapidly receding couple it seemed minutes before he could find his voice but but he said and stuck again very well sir said hamilton take your guard but the other with a muttered oath slipped his blade into its scabbard im damned if i do he said and looked stupidly at the lady you called him kit you know he muttered and why not she said is he to be killed for being christened you may realize by now sir said hamilton that you have made an error if i may suggest the way to rectify it is by not imposing yourself longer on our company the glare came again into chesterfields eyes and then doubt confusion indecision was this in truth his errant wife he had never questioned it before but now was there not something seeming more familiar in the pose the walk of the other and yet he bent bewildered to search the secret of the impenetrable mask certainly the dim light the artificial atmosphere were trickish things they confused the visual sense no less than that of voice and hearing was he mistaken after all and what was his folly in that case in bandying words with these while the actual delinquents escaped one moment longer he hesitated then with a curse turned on his heel and hurried off in pursuit the two remaining watched his retreat in silence and then hamilton resheathing his sword with a snap gave a low laugh nothing my phil muttered he will make thee a gentleman and he turned on his companion she stood quite still observing him what made you call me kit said he why are you not kit she asked he peered at her inquisitive surely she could not have failed to recognize him no that was incredible and he her there could be no doubt about it her voice her figure her manner of dressing her hair even the trick of her speech moulded on soft wilful lips even the fashion of her gown which he seemed vaguely to recall they were all kate indubitably kate no he must seek another reason for her caprice and could it be this that all the time in kit had been meant himself that all the time she had been taking this playful symbolic means to avow her love for one she dared not admit by name it was a revealing a rapturous thought it might explain much which had seemed inexplicable and yet if it were true what had decided the crisis was it possible that it was she herself who had written that anonymous letter confident in her bait to allure him hither but in that case how had her husband got wind of the ruse and who were those others all apparently in the emblematic secret well at least she had claimed him and that was sufficient for his present satisfaction if some eavesdropping mischief possessed of knowledge was manuvring to complicate the issue they must set their own wits to outwit hers for the moment it was only his obvious policy to answer that question in kind yes i am kit he said i understand at last your very kit sweet cousin and now let us away to covert where we can talk which way she said her voice seemed to suggest some tiny inward struggle the shady way he answered with a laugh and she went compliantly with him you made sure of my coming he asked tenderly o yes she answered sure he sighed i have waited long trying to dissemble but trust a woman to know come this way little cousin there are labyrinths of wild darknesses beyond where none may hope to track and find us is not the night sweet so phil hath sinned at last beyond forgiveness come why do you linger for she had stopped i hear music she said it is only some harping fellow come where is he yonder in the grove she stood as if spellbound took a hurried step or two paused and caught her hands to her bosom let us go listen she said her breath came quick where is he i will go i tell you and in a moment she was running he followed calling to her cousin wait what hath taken you stop for me at least but she paid no heed to him and sped on her feet twinkled on the grass in and out between the hanging lamps he found her lost her found her again among the thickening throng and in another moment hard pressing on her tracks he had pursued her into the ring which stood about the player through it to the very front where she stopped breathless and panting and now let us follow the footsteps of that other green bowed lady the seeming double or replica of this whom we can leave for the time being she was kate herself in fact the little outraged wife intent on her design to personate the object of her faithless spouses pursuit and by figuring to him under false colours to draw him into an unconscious confession of his guilt she had driven over in her coach and though some accident had delayed her by the way in time she still hoped to enable her to forestall the other alighting she had hurriedly traversed the distance between the gates and the open sward beyond where the company were most wont to congregate but though she used her eyes for all the inquisition they were worth without result eager and flurried then she was turning to retrace her steps when she saw him making towards her from the shadow of a clump of trees whence obviously he had been watching she stopped instantly and let out a shaking breath to ease the turmoil of her heart it was he her husband it never occurred to her to doubt it the height the figure were sufficient not to speak of the damning token in his hat and once assured she hardly looked his way i think and yet so susceptible is jealousy to false witness it was not my lord at all but the duke of york he came up to her where she stood and gazing intently through his mask waited silently a while and then he sighed with extreme audibility still she vouchsafed him no recognition or encouragement but stood as cold and motionless as one of the white lilies in the bed beyond he was forced at last into taking the initiative not one word madam said he to him that wears your favour will you not reassure my anxiety he was aware of the faintest odd response to this appeal it might have been a whispered note of exultation for whom sir she said still white still inflexible do you take me ah he said is not that bow in your bosom sufficient answer with a quick fierce action she pulled the vizard from her face looked him in the eyes one moment and replacing it half turned her back on him now she said are you satisfied of your error satisfied said he but not of my error for indeed there is none and indeed there was none from his point of view she turned on him irresistibly unable to control her indignation you can dare to say it trapped and detected in the very act there is no error none and i am she i suppose whom you expected to find revealed under this token o shameless but your dissembling does not deceive me instant and ready as it proves itself go seek her sir the vile party to your iniquity she is doubtless somewhere in the garden and bear with you the scorn and detestation of the insulted wife you thought vainly to overreach and who now denounces and repudiates you for evermore she made as if to leave him but again turned a quivering smile on her lips and bear with you philip stanhope this reflection which i know will gall you above any sense of guilt expressed it was you broke the long silence between us and it was i that trapped you into doing so if you can feel any humiliation greater than your own discovered wickedness it will lie in that i know stop cried his highness as she was going the truth had dawned upon him through that torrent of invective not kit was he in her assumption but her own recreant husband the discovery was illuminating and indirectly gratifying inasmuch as it seemed to dispose so far as she was concerned of that hypothetical intriguer and yet was it possible she was only manuvring to justify her own frailty through her husbands example where are you going he said she answered in one straitened monosyllable home and that reassured and decided him it was a cruel ruse perhaps but he saw no other hope in her excited state of detaining and reasoning with her doubtless when the inevitable discovery ensued the emotional reaction consequent on it would prove his forgiver and abetter he had to hurry to keep pace with her nay he whispered in her ear believe me when i say there was no error could i have failed think you to recognize my kate though in a subtler disguise than this trust a husbands eyes and senses sweetheart come be reasonable we cannot talk here turn with me and let us seek a spot more private to our confidences in the solitudes beyond indeed as they advanced it was to make themselves more and more the cynosure of neighbouring eyes but the wife was not to be moved she was deaf and blind now with a passion she could not surmount as he persisted in accompanying her she stopped suddenly and stamped her little foot on the grass will you cease to importune me she said and go only turn and come away he entreated and i will explain everything never she exclaimed vehemently i do not believe you not one word it is all over between us leave me and go and seek your paramour i will not he persisted doggedly there is none but yourself for me i am going home i say then i will go with you she hurried a few steps farther then as he kept beside her turned with a flounce and went off in the opposite direction he wheeled to follow and so suddenly that he ran into the very arms of a masked gentleman who the moment before had been advancing upon him from the rear he snapped out a half angry apology and was for speeding on but to his astonishment the other gripped and held him like a vice unhand me sir cried the duke what do you dare for the moment he was beside himself with fury seeing his light quarry who had taken advantage of the check in the act of making her escape but his struggles availed him nothing aye i dare said the stranger viciously and he turned his face in a white fume to regard the flight of the fugitive go your way said he between his teeth as if addressing the receding figure you are marked down at last my lady and will be called on in due time to pay the reckoning and as for you you villain he whisked like a devil on his prisoner you have got to answer for this here and now he had to somehow his highness with that acute perception of his saw the necessity and ceased to strive he was fairly trapped and very certainly by the injured husband himself he had nothing for it but to bring all his finesse to the solution of so embarrassing a problem sir said he with a good deal of haughtiness will you please to quit this rude grasp on me you need not fear i am a man of honour o of honour said chesterfield with a sneer but he released his hold you surprise me on my word but being so perhaps you will inform me man of honour where you would like to come with me to have your throat cut we will discuss the necessity of that said the duke civilly when i know your name so particular mocked the other but will it not inform you sufficiently to be told that i am the husband of the lady you have just parted with indeed it informs me nothing replied the duke most suavely what you dare to pretend to me that you know her not sir said the duke i would disdain to answer to your insolence were it not that there must be something in appearances which it seems justifies it in you i cannot presume your name from that of the lady who has just vanished because i do not know her you are lying to me i know you deserve no explanation which i vouchsafe nevertheless solely for her good credits sake i admit i accosted the lady in question but it was under a misapprehension being misled by a certain token she wore in her dress and for which i had been directed to look my importunities are explained by my reluctance to believe that a coincidence so remarkable as the wearing of that same token by another was even conceivable truly a plausible defence but there is a craft as well as a credulity in jealousy and chesterfield showed it well sir said he i will take your word fort on a condition and that is that you return me your name for my own i am the earl of chesterfield and i said the duke prefer to be known to you for the moment as kit simply kit at your service it was no sooner spoken than he realized his blunder it would be this very anonymity the presumptive second party to the liaison whom the husband being here would be in search of chesterfield in fact showed his instant sense of the admission he let out a laugh that was wholly diabolical ha ha cried he damned and condemned thou dog out of thine own mouth conscious that all this time they were objects of some curious attention on the part of the nearest company he thought it well now to subdue his voice and affect a nonchalant manner mr kit said he in an undertone you will hardly continue in face of that confession your pretence of innocence nor by denying me the satisfaction i demand here and now force me to the necessity of whipping you like the hound you are in public there are level spaces in the wildernesses beyond and something of a rising moon sufficient for the business we have in hand will you walk with me sir or without admitting anything said his highness very haughty and wroth or condescending to further remonstrance i answer to your effrontery as it deserves it must be chastised at whatever cost to the truth follow me sir and he stalked off in high choler he was horribly perplexed nevertheless though for the moment so offended as half to mean the bellicosity he threatened but reflection soon cooled him of that temper and he recognized that if nothing else intervened there would be no alternative for him but to make himself known at the critical pass to his adversary the two gentlemen disappeared in the direction of the thickets and so leaving them we will return to hamilton and his green bow the harper harped his sweetest and the lady stood and listened entranced she seemed as one fascinated half hypnotized oblivious of the soft reproaches her companion kept whispering in her ear she paid no heed whatever to his babble but always her gaze was fixed on the long swaying form of the musician and the melancholy wrapt eyes of him lost like her own to all outer influences and impressions and wholly absorbed in the visions conjured up of his unconscious soul and when at length he ended on a triumphant chord she sighed and seemed to come awake and first joining in the applause with her little hands plucked off her vizard being quite carried away by her feelings and waving it in the air cried brava in a manner to make the people about her laugh hamilton momentarily pressed back by the thrusting forward of the crowd saw that ebullition and frowned and wondered a little over such a grossiret in his cousin but she had the thing on again before he could reach her to remonstrate and indeed he never had the chance to for all of a sudden he found himself witness of an odd scene attracted it seemed by the little acclaiming voice the performer who was seated not ten yards away got suddenly to his feet and after standing staring a minute came striding across the grass towards the spot whence the demonstration had issued those about the lady may have thought that he was bent on some graceful acknowledgment to her of an approval so spontaneous and so unusual but whatever the attention he designed she did not wait to receive it as if seized with a sudden panic over the publicity she had called down upon herself she whipped round and taking advantage of an opening in the crowd slipped through it to a roar of laughter and was gone in an instant so quick had she been that hamilton taken by surprise and hemmed in as he was could not extricate himself from his position in time to mark the direction of her flight but once clear of the press he stood completely baffled and cursing his evil luck and in the meantime green bow was making good her escape she ran as if some spectre were at her heels across the thronged grass in and out between the trees heedless of the attention she attracted making instinctively for the outer glooms onward she sped and never paused until the covert of green shadows coming thickly about her gave her comfort and reassurance of an asylum reached at last and then she stopped panting and dishevelled but with a little inclination nevertheless to some hysterical giggling o mussey me she whispered as she fought for breath o mussey me and then she looked hurriedly about her she was still so near the fringe of the thickets as to have a clear view of the lighted swards she had left not safe from detection yet she must penetrate deeper into the wilderness if she hoped to baffle pursuit away from her ran a little glow worm track dim but discernible and threaded with lamps always attenuating until they seemed to cease altogether in the leafy depths she followed it and found it to conduct her deep into an open space among the trees about which was hung a slender coronal of lamps and in whose midmost stood a rustic arbour for whispering lovers made but at the moment it seemed unoccupied and here she stopped to recover her breath and her self possession and with a laugh began to preen her tumbled plumes like a bird escaped from the fowler i never did there never she said aloud and instantly looked up with a start a masked lady with a green bow at her bosom had come silently it seemed from the direction of the bower and was standing regarding her with stony eyes this was poor kate indeed whom accident had precipitated upon the same refuge moll after that first little shock continued her preening unperturbed you fair took my breath away she said coming on me that fashion like a ghost kates head was bent forward her dove like eyes glared who are you she said scarce audibly how dare you thrust yourself upon me like this highty tighty said moll still comfortably busy i might ask that of you of me cried kate desperately i think i hardly know myself for indeed the other had taken pains to duplicate her in many particulars both dress and voice what are you doing here but i understand the cunning infamy of it all at last it was to throw dust in the eyes of scandal by feigning twas his own wife he came to meet he who said moll readjusting her breast knot do not you well know false creature but you are betrayed through that very token in your bosom you used to further your wicked designs what says saucebox maynt i wear a green bow if it suits my complexion lies and duplicity cries the other are your complexion it suits them very well green stands for forsaken says the vixen is that why you wear one yourself it was a stab that made the poor lady wince her face went from pink to white cruel and inhuman she gasped come call fair my lady said moll in some heat if hes been and mistaken you for me whoever he is and i take it thats the truth youve only got what you asked for look through the keyhole you know and youll get a sore eye her white teeth showed a moment under the hem of her vizard with a dart her ladyship was upon her i will see it that face she could hardly articulate in her passion abandoned wretch that you are masquerading under a false name i will know this kit of his for whom she is take it off i say but the facile jade easily repulsed and eluded her give over she said youre no match for me and indeed it was obvious to the poor girl that she was not so she desisted in a moment and resolved upon the better part of dignity which is contempt keep your secret she said panting after all its shame is better hidden out of sight do you know who i am i can guess said moll go to him then you will find him seeking for you yonder in the open tell him that he is welcome to his goods for me that i have seen them and understand their attraction to one so sunk in base corruption as himself come now said moll keep a civil tongue in your head did kate suspect she glanced anyhow in a startled puzzled way at the dim face menacing her before she turned on her heel and with her head held erect swept away she made for the narrow track leaving the other standing where she was and had passed but half way down it when she met hamilton face to face the scarf in his hat was plainly distinguishable she took him for her husband and stood rigidly aside to let him pass ah little wicked truant said he but i have run you to earth at last what made you scamper from the great musician in that panic fashion his voice insensibly perplexed her but her emotions were in too prejudiced a state to serve her for trusty interpreters are you then the great musician she said hard scorn in her tone since it was you alone i sought to escape from and and for ever from me a grieved amazement marked his voice after what hath passed between us she stood back peremptorily signing him on with her hand passed are you again in error proceed sir tis but a little distance and find her the brazen partner of your guilt for whom you have already once mistaken me he cried out you are mad how could i ever mistake you were we not listening together but now to the harpist when you turned and ran i ran i have heard no harpist it was from your lying importunities i escaped my lying before god i spoke my very heart and you were kind cousin cousin am i not your cousin though your lover george hamilton do you not know me cousin she sighed seemed to sway a little then to stiffen o she said i know you now indeed he laughed relieved why what misled you kate never mind she was a serpent all at once subtle wooing alluring let us go back this way there is something i want to show you will you come come he would have followed her to the pit yet what surprise had she in store for him what unknown witness to her own mistake what solution of this mystery of her denial about the music she had appeared strangely affected by that performance was it possible it had wrought upon her to forgetfulness well he would know in a moment she meant that he should meant to face him with the proof of his own misconception and his intended betrayal of herself it was somehow that woman wretchs doing of that she felt certain though she was bewildered with the complication of it all but at least her course here was clear it was to expose and denounce the would be seducer in the presence of the wanton who had entrapped him mrs moll however was not to be caught so easily she had in fact having followed stealthily in kates footsteps and whisked behind a tree at the psychologic moment overheard the gist of this colloquy and it imbued her with no desire to return and face the music she just waited until the couple had passed out of sight then slipped into the track with a view to making her escape by it but alas for the best laid plans of mice and monkeys this little monkey was nabbed before she had well set foot on the path for there suddenly appeared advancing towards her along the narrow way the figures of a couple of gentlemen and each had a green scarf adorning his hat well im damned she whispered and stood stock still his highness coming first saw her at once and paused as he thought recognizing her in some amazement it was an embarrassing moment and he was standing in frank indecision when chesterfield coming up pushed by him and in his turn jerked to a stop what by god said he so we have tracked you to your lair my lady he ran at her with a scowl and seized her by the wrist so roughly that she cried out aye howl said he you will have full reason for your lamentation before i have done with you and this fancy beau of yours come my pretty faithful kate and watch us fight you shall stand by and clap your husband victor while i cut him into ribbons for love knots to your gown come stir there is a green hard by where he shall caper for you dancing to very prick song will you not come she could not help herself indeed his grip was iron he dragged her with him so that he half pulled her arm out o lud she thought im in for it now a few steps farther and they broke into the clearing my lady and hamilton were just before them it was plain they had both overheard they stood as if petrified kate with white face and bewildered eyes her companion with the grin of a dog at bay lifting his lip curse it said chesterfield whats this involuntarily he released his hold on which moll with a naughty laugh sprang from him and stood apart nursing her angry wrist and so they remained a full minute chesterfield and my lord duke facing the other two the girl covertly watching the earl looked from one woman to the other and more than once but always his eyes returned to his true wife on whom they finally rested if this said he in a gripping voice and pulling off his mask is to make me the victim of some foul conspiracy it fails with you my lady i know you you need pretend no longer she plucked off her vizard and throwing it with a gesture of scorn on the grass stood proudly up before him well guessed sir she said but you were not so happy in your choice a moment ago was it the green bow deceived you yes by god it was madam though you may sneer i looked for it on none but you on me her eyes opened amazed and why please because i was privily informed you were to wear it indeed and for whose benefit will you ask it he stepped aside flinging out his arm towards his highness who stood silent gnawing his forefinger and this kit this damning witness to your guilt to answer for it to your face did i not find you with him but now for shame madam but he shall pay for his temerity with his life you are mad she said in a voice of wonder i never saw you i thought him you and that he had accosted me taking me for kit you kit why in gods name kits a man no a woman a man i say hes here and so is she here she i tell you no what cursed coil is this and you thought him me you say why answer that he wore the scarf in his hat the secret letter spoke of the secret letter what you have received one too i have received one in a sudden thought she whipped round on hamilton and you also cousin judging by your token cousin roared chesterfield what you too george for seeing further disguise useless that gentleman had also discovered himself damme am i to fight you all he stamped with fury who and what is at the bottom of this juggling why kit said hamilton coolly he guessed pretty well the truth and was only mad with himself for having walked so tamely into the trap whoever kit may be i had the letter sure enough and acted on it twas the green bow nothing else for which i went how could i know your wife behind it why not at all quoth my lady by what you said to her i think cousin you were the most mistaken of us all he felt the cold sarcastic sting in her tone and knew himself revealed and dismissed from that moment chesterfield clinched and convulsed his fists in impotent desperation but but he shouted and turned on his wife again kit was to wear a scarf i tell you no a bow said she and nothing else madam he cried there would be no disputing kits sex in that case said hamilton pleasantly and then he laughed but there are still two potential kits in the field and both unmasked why not ask them obviously it was the simple course chesterfield pounced on the duke you hear kit or the devil man whichever you are confess yourself his highness hesitated it was an awkward moment for him and succumbed finally to the tyranny of circumstance i could claim my privilege and refuse sir said he were it not that by persisting in this disguise the fair fame of an innocent lady might appear to lack its vindication i took her if not for another at least not for herself and he pulled off his vizard in his turn the duke of york muttered the earl falling back a little with a stupefied look while kate on her part her face flushing crimson bent her eyes on the ground but in a moment she looked up and clasping her hands took a passionate step forward my lord duke she said urgently and pitifully tell him you owe it to me that i knew nothing of your presence here that i guessed you as little as he did himself my behaviour proves it surely madam said his highness rather grimly it should be self evident to any reasonable man but to put the matter beyond dispute i confess myself a victim to the same mischievous agency which it seems has been working this havoc amongst us from private information received i understood that here on this night a green scarf was to rally to a green bow the pass word kit and twas in a mere spirit of frolic that i undertook to be present in order to confuse the issue if i had guessed for a moment but you did not guess sir said chesterfield dryly and only half convinced i did not guess said the duke mildly and piously and now comes in the question who is the one responsible for all this misunderstanding kit cried moll she was standing a little apart on a rising mound kit she cried with a ringing laugh heres kit and she took from her pocket a little impish sexless doll a mere thing of cloth and wire which she flourished in the air my darling she said hugging and kissing the fetish look at them look at it good people its always been with me everywhere from the time i was a baby and sometimes its a girl and sometimes a boy and i never can tell from one minute to another what it will be up to next o you dear and she held the rubbish to her young breast swaying it as if it were an infant they had all turned on her like a pack baying a little speared otter stupefaction marked their faces a dead silence ensued and suddenly in the midst of it awoke a sound music the plucking of fingers on harp strings and with one impulse they turned it came from the darkness of the trees sweet wild unearthly it rose on the starry night like incense like a drug like a spell taking their brains captive and in a moment it had slipped into a symphony preluding some wonder and the girl as if irresistibly compelled was singing my lodging is on the cold ground and hard very hard is my fare but that which grieves me more is the coldness of my dear oh turn love i prythee love turn to me for thou art the only one love that art adord by me ill twine thee a garland of straw love ill marry thee with a rush ring my frozen hopes will thaw love and merrily we will sing then turn to me my own love i prythee love turn to me for thou art the only one love that art adored by me the voice ceased and the music a sort of universal sigh seemed to breathe from the hearts of the listeners it was like a sigh of waking the girl wiped her eyes and sniffed and laughed well what next she said defiantly chesterfield the least impressible of the group took a furious step forward that mask he said hoarsely that mask and without the least demur she whipped it from her face and stood saucily before them he turned on his wife you see madam your friend no friend of mine cried her ladyship how dare you so insult me he stared bewildered no friend of yours did you not invite her to our house never you know you did yourself i before god no i thought she was your guest what is this my lord and i thought her yours mine i had never seen her in my life before that hussy again that amazed inquisition of the delinquent hussy yourself cried moll and then she screamed with laughter o dont look so perplexed good people its all right neither of you invited me i invited myself yourself cried my lady dumbfounded why you see my dear said moll as you werent on speaking terms i thought i might risk it as each of you would suppose the other had asked me and so i did and so it turned out and ive had a good time a killing time and i thank you both for it and im glad to see your little difference is made up at last and to know that im after all the one youve got to thank for it you cried her ladyship with infinite scorn yes me my dear said moll now dont be nasty about it twas i you know wrote all those letters and arranged this little mixture by which youve come to profit you infamous creature said kate who suggested this trick to you hamilton if he did not look felt supremely uncomfortable but he need not have feared his confederates loyalty honour amongst thieves was a good enough motto for her kit said mrs moll tis a rare little impy when it chooses he breathed again as for his highness he had already realizing that he had been well fooled and unwilling to risk any further compromising revelations slipped quietly and unostentatiously away kate breathed her disdain i will know she began and paused perhaps after all she did know or guess her indignant eyes sought her cousin be wise said hamilton with a laugh and leave it at that when alls said you know tis very truth that shes to thank however she chose to work it for this this tender reconciliation she turned her shoulder on him and his sneering and again addressed moll was it not enough to impose yourself on us as you did without setting your wicked wits to work to spite us in this fashion why did you do it o said mrs davis nonchalantly i was tired of you all and your tragic ways and i wanted some fun and there was none to be got out of that jealous grumps of a husband of yours and and so i played for a general post what then and what cause have you of all people to blame me for it now at that chesterfield uttering an oath made a run for the saucy creature as if he were minded to strike her no damn it phil cried hamilton moving to interpose hold your hand what cause have you either for that matter cause cried the nobleman glaring round what the devil do you do defending her are you in her confidence cause by god ill have her by the heels for a common rogue and impostor ill and he was making for the girl again she struck out at him with a little shriek jack davis she cried are you going to see your wife ill treated before your eyes there was a rustle in the shadows and a long form came bounding out and seemed to tumble towards the mound zounds ejaculated hamilton his wife if it isnt the harping prodigy he whistled tis all plain now hold sir cried the musician this is indeed my wife he ascended the mound and stood shoulder to shoulder beside that injured lady chesterfield fell back snorting while kate ran to him and clutched his arm that touch so desired so unfamiliar seemed to fall like balm on his passion moll looked up with a twinkle of dismal resignation at the sad adoring face above her so youve found me at last jack she said and all my funs over i suppose for the present well a day and she heaved a great sigh how did you know me know you he exclaimed and o the aching tragedy to him implied in those two words was not your voice enough child when you cried brava there is none other like it in all the world i followed it when i could and some instinct led me hither and then and then o i wondered if you could be moved in the old way and and and i was moved jack i had to sing when you made me lud if you could only be always the angel your playing makes you but she heaved her shoulders pettishly well i must come back to be your wife again i suppose will you molly poor wretch the rapture and the marvel o yes she said indifferently well what have you been doing with yourself all this while playing for bread he answered i took another name bannister my mothers and i think it blessed me i have been making a reputation and a fortune molly a fortune cried the lady opening her eyes then ill come with you sure la now what must all these folks think of us making love in public she led him down from the mound up to the listening group astonished spectators of this domestic reunion she was quite cool and impudent these are some of my friends jack says she or were till a moment ago you dont ask me what ive been doing since we quarrelled and parted well theyll tell you if you are curious only dont you believe all they say and then she addressed the company my lord hem ladies and gentlemen ive found though quite unexpected the husband i came to london to seek not the one i meant but an old one i had thought used up never mind for that and i daresay both my lady and me know what it is to wear a turned gown but the point is that if you ever doubted of my respectability and some of you may not all perhaps recognizing the thing when they see it heres the proof of it to answer you and so shall remain until we quarrel again and go our ways as before no no said the radiant creature with a patient smile no no croaked hamilton with a laugh to spite you cried moll blazing on him id live with him for ever at least for part of it poor man what a vengeance said her ladyship and turned with cold disdain on the mocker she still held her husbands arm i trust you appreciate your punishment cousin she said and will submit to it without resorting to the bad counsel of jealousy and so she faced the lady i congratulate you mrs davis on your your proof we had not learned i confess to associate you with angels in any form and the very opportune arrival of this one whether in the conspiracy or not must serve you i suppose for a means to escape the chastisement you have so richly deserved at our hands under what circumstances and at whose instigation you were moved to venture on this audacity it is idle to inquire we should never extract the truth nor the air being cleared of you need we now wish to when one has thrown off a sickness one likes to dismiss its unpleasantness from ones thoughts your boxes with their green bows and vulgarities and thrice turned gowns and whatever other stage properties or perquisites they may contain shall be sent to your direction come my lord and she turned very stately and entering the track with her husband disappeared along it theres gratitude cried moll and positively snivelling threw herself upon sad jacks sober bosom hamilton looking on with a grin wrinkling his nose shrugged his shoulders began to whistle and sauntered off in another direction my lord and lady in the meantime walked like reconciled lovers do you know she said with an arch smile that twas you first broke the silence between us no no said he stopping ah but it was it was not i say and i say it was they had edged apart for the moment it seemed as if it was all to begin over again curse it muttered my lord why do not you remember said she rallying to sweetness that you declared you knew me he bit his lip scowled and brightened thats true my lady but i have not gone down on my knees to you and on the very word advancing a pace he tripped over a stump and went down on his knees she checked an impulse to laugh and did the tactful thing as he got to his feet she gazed at him with dear doves eyes and said she and now i will ask the pardon o i would ask anything do anything for you my lord since learning since learning he tucked her arm within his and they went on together and on the green in the light of the fading lamps moll snivelled what does this all mean what mischief hast thou been up to thou incorrigible one asked the fond fellow her husband as he held her not i but kit said the girl and with a tearful laugh she produced the fetish and held it up to his face what said he smiling dost thou still carry that absurd imp about with thee always and wherever i go she answered solemnly and then with a sigh i think he is the only one my heart hath ever really loved the first as he shall be the last there dont gloom jack but kiss him kiss him the end transcribers notes minor spelling

lisgard gravely when her attendant had closed the door behind her i want to have a little serious talk with you tonight as you please my lady returned mistress forest in a tone which the other did not fail to mark it was a very respectful tonea more humble one even than she was ordinarily wont to usebut there was a certain deliberation and set resolve about it too which expressed as decidedly as though she had used the words i am ready to listen madam but i know very well what you are going to ask me and i have made up my mind already to answer no mary continued my lady earnestly but not without a tremor in her kind soft voice come and sit here on the sofa beside me and let us not be mistress and maid tonight but only friends yes madam and marys voice trembled too for this unlookedfor arrangement would place her she knew at a disadvantage in the argument which was certainly at hand we have known one another many many years marymore than half our livesand i dont think we have had a single quarrel yet not one maam not one assented the waitingmaid already after the manner of her susceptible kind beginning to cry i can remember you when quite a child mary not fifteen years old as willing and kindhearted a girl as the sun ever shone upon and when i had not a friend in the world nor even so much as a coin that i could call my own and when i was weak and sick at heart having lost all that was dear to me i remember who it was that tended and caressed me as though i was her own sister dont ye dont ye my lady hush hush cried the weeping mary it was only natural that i should take to a sweet innocent creature cast at our very door by the raging sea i often dream of that storm o nights madam even now of the thunder and the lightning and the rain and of the flashes that were not lightning but signals for helpthat alas we could not givefrom the poor doomed ship and how father and the other fishermen and many of the visitors themselvesand among them poor sir robertall crowded down to the cove for they could not get nearer to the shore because of the waves and i was with them sheltering myself in the brushwood as well as i could and peering through the branches to see the great white waves lit up for an instant and then the darkness shutting all things out except the roaring of the storm i mind it just as though it were but yesterday and ah my lady shall i ever forget when that one great wave dashed up into the very cove itself wetting us all to the skin and knocking down young jack west whom it almost carried back with it in its return and then the great black spar which it did carry back with something white aclinging to it when my father cried out o my god a woman and all our hearts seemed stricken with a sudden shoot of pain lord how i cried for my part to think that a poor creature should he tossing in that dreadful foam and when i heard good sir roberts voice clear and loud as a bugle one hundred pounds to the man who brings her ashore dead or alive i do believe i could have run out and kissed him ah my lady what a noble gentleman he was for though he could not have known how dear you were to be to himyou might have been an old woman for all he could seehow he worked and strove to save you not by his money alone for no mre gain would have tempted men to do what was done that night but by risking life and limb they made a double chain holding one anothers hands for there was no time to spare for ropes and went down almost among the breakers where you were my father and sir robert were the two first men god bless them here mistress forest paused interrupted by incipient hysterics and my lady herself cried like a child but not in agony her tears were tribute to the memory of a gallant deed i mind my father had a black shouldera place you could not cover with both your handsall along of the spar being driven up against him but they carried it up with you upon it safe into the cove and then there was a great cry for us women to come down and help ah how beautiful you looked my lady though we thought you dead white and cold and wet with your long black hair dripping like seaweed and your tender limbs all bruised and bleeding it must have been a kind band as tied you to the plank for between your dainty waist and the rough rope there was bound a sailors jacket my lady moaned and held her bands up as though she would say forbear but mistress forest could not be stayed there was little enough clothes upon you poor lady just a bodice and a petticoat but round your neck there was hung a charm or two and perhaps that had some hand in saying you from drowning my lady looked quickly up how strange it seemed that the comment passed by mary forest upon the locket and the bundle of letters in their little waterproof case should have been so exactly what derrick had pointed out it would be the coincidence reminded her of the task that lay before her and of the danger of delaying it yes mary i indeed owe my life to you and yours and i am not forgetful of the debt your welfare is and ever will be only second in importance to that of my own children and it is concerning it that i now wish to speak with you your future you owe me nothing my dear lady that you have not paid again and again i am sure interrupted the waitingmaid hurriedly when you rose to that high station for which it seems to everybody you were born your hand was always held out to me through good report and evil report you have ever stood my friend it will be a great wrench of my heart dearest mistress when i leave your serviceas i shall have to do i fear very soon mary yes my lady you see im not a young girl now and it is not everybody who has so good a chance as i have now ofofsettling in life service is not inheritance you know my lady although i am well aware i should never want for nothing whether i live or die mary broke in her mistress eagerly i have taken care of that good friend and if i should die tomorrow but you shall see my will itself for it lies here she laid her hand upon the desk before her but mary checked her with a determined no my lady no i was never greedywith all my faults you will grant that much i knowand if i had been like mrs welsh and others of this household i could namebut that i never was a mischiefmakeri might long since have put myself beyond all need of legacies and you never would have missed it but mr derrick is himself a person of property a very rich man indeed for one in my condition of lifenot that i need be a burden upon any man thank heaven for i have money saved out of my wagesand very handsome they always wereand that great present of good sir roberts still untouched the most generous of gentlemen he was i am sure my lady nobody felt for you as i did when sir robert died and you have often said how terrible it was to lose a husband thereforehere for a moment her excessive volubility flagged for the first time she paused and reddened then added with the air of a mathematician stating an indisputable corollarytherefore you must allow dear mistress that to find oneparticularly when one comes to my time of lifeis not unpleasant nor a chance to be lightly thrown aside that depends entirely upon the sort of husband he may be mary observed my lady gravely really dear madam with all respect i think i am the best judge of that rejoined the waitingmaid tartly although indeed i never thought to say such words to you sir richard may have his likes and dislikes but i am not his slave nor yet his servant for the matter of that while master walter who saving your presence everybody knows to be worth a hundred of him likes ralph very much a pang shot across my ladys face and left it crimson as though she had received a blow but the waitingmaid little knew what had brought the colour there although she felt that she had pained her mistress deeply god forgive me cried she penitently if my foolish tongue has hurt your feelings my lady i did not mean to say aught against sir richard i am sure i scarcely knew what i said for when those are dear to usas ralph has grown to be with me and i dont deny itare misjudged and wronged why then we are apt to say bitter things this talk was none of my seeking my lady and although ralph thinks that you are to blame because of his being forbidden the hall and all the rest of it i have always told him you have never said a word to set me against him and oh i am sorry you are doing it now because what is done cannot be undone and great heaven you are not married to this man cried my lady rising from her seat with agitation o no my ladycertainly not my lady rejoined the waitingmaid with a certain demure dignity there has been nothing underhand between us in the matter at all except that is so far as meeting mr derrick at the back gate did you go out to meet him tonight inquired lady lisgard sharply and keeping her eyes fixed steadily upon her attendants face no madam i did not she is speaking truth murmured my lady to herself who then could it be whom i saw upon the churchyard path just now although continued mrs forest quietly i dont deny that i have often met him after dusk no other time being permitted to us but today he has gone to town and you are to write to him thither to give him your final decision as to whether you will become his wife or not how on earth do you know that my lady inquired the waitingmaid with a curiosity even beyond her indignation i do know it dear old friend answered lady lisgard tenderly and it is because of that knowledge that i have sent for you tonight to strive to persuade you to write no while there is yet time it was very seldomnot once in a year perhapsthat mary forest was ever out of temper with my lady but then such a supreme occasion as the present had never occurred before underneath their mre superficial relation of mistress and servant they were more like elder and younger sister but then even sisters quarrel when the one wants the othergenerally under some pretence of mre prudence not to be listened to by a woman of spiritto give up the man of her choice the ample countenance of mistress forest expressed something more than decision in the negative there was an unpleasant smile upon her pale lips which seemed to say if you knew what i know you would know that you are wasting your breath she sat with her plump hands folded before her like a naughty boy that has been put in the corner but who does not carenay more who knows that he has got a cracker to put presently under his masters chair the results of which will make full amends for the inconvenience he at present experiences i will say nothing more mary of the mutual esteem and affection between us two and of the pain that an eternal partingsuch as your marriage with this mr derrick would most undoubtedly entailneeds must cost us both i presume that you have weighed that matter in your mind and found ithowever weightyinsufficient to alter your determination mary nodded sharply enough but it was doubtful if she could have spoken already her features had lost their rigidity as though melted by my ladys touching tones you have known this personthat is to say you have met him some dozen timesduring a period of less than four months yet such is his influence over you that you are prepared to sacrifice for him a friend of thirty years standing a comfortable home and a position in which you are respected by all who know you if i was speaking to a young girl mary i should not advance these arguments but you are aa wise and sensible woman and yet not of such a mature age that you need despair of finding a suitable partner for the rest of your life mistress forest heaved a little sigh of relief and her cheeks began to tone down to something like their natural crimson they had been purple with the apprehension of what my lady might have said upon the subject of age now what is it pursued my lady which has produced this confidence in an almost entire stranger do you know anything of his former life which may be a guarantee to you for the stability of your future have you ever met a single individual who is acquainted with it in any way for all you know this man may have been a my lady for a moment the relative position of mentor and pupil were exchanged there was a quiet power about the waitingmaids rebuke for which an archbishop would have given more than his blessing if he could only have incorporated it into a charge you are right mary said my lady frankly let us only speak of what is within our own knowledge does this mans own conduct then give any promise of lasting happiness to the woman who may become his wife is he sober i believe he is fond of a glass my lady as most men are who have no home or people to look after them if he had a wife he would never go to the publichouse at all perhapshe tells me so himself my lady smiled faintly is he industrious and provident mary he has earned his money hardly enough my lady and it seems only natural that he should now spend a little in enjoying himself but not fling his money to left and righti use your own words dear maryand treat every chancecompanion he comes across to liquor do you suppose that at his age he is likely to change habits of this sort i am not aware my lady that his age is anything against him replied the waitingmaid coldly he is not so like to run through his money as if he were younger and particularly when he has got some one to provide for beside himself and indeed so far as money goes he has thousands of pounds and if all goes well with himand something has occurred today about which he has sent me a line by hand dear fellow by which it has been made almost certain that things will go wellhe will be a very rich man indeed after a week or two there is some great race on epsom downs o mary how can you talk so cheerfully of money acquired in that way if it is won today it is lost tomorrow and even if it were not so do you know that it is gained from those who can ill afford to lose it and who having lost it often turn to wicked ways i dont know about that my lady im sure responded the waitingmaid demurely i leave all these things to my betters but i suppose if racing was a crime mr chifney would not be let to have the abbey barnsir richard being so very particularand master walter would not for ever be up at the stables why he and mr derrick are both together hand and glove in this very businesssomething about a french racer it is although when you and i were at dijon my lady we never heard of there being such a thing in all france did weso my poor ralph cannot be so very wicked after all and please maam it is no use saying anything more about it for i have written him that letter already which he was to find in london and put it in the post and did you answer yes or no mary i answered yes my ladythat i would marry himand begging your pardon madam but i mean to stand to it chapter ii confession there is one serious disadvantagewhich mistresses should do well to rememberat which waitingmaids are always placed in disputations with their domestic superiors they cannot except they are prepared for instant dismissal either quit the room and hang the door after them or leave it open and run down stairs saying things at the top of their voices both these modes of procedure so natural to the female when put out are denied to them for the same reason that when on board ship they cant take champagne for seasickness as their employers do they cannot afford the indulgence now although mary forest was not debarred by mre pecuniary considerations from flinging herself out of her mistresss room when she cried and i mean to stand to it there were other reasons which prevented her from suiting to her words that very appropriate and natural action in all her blinding passion and she was really very angry she never quite lost sight of the respect she owed her mistress her devotion to her was such that even while she listened to her most unpalatable arguments against the man she had accepted for her husband her heart smote her with a sense of ingratitude towards the longtried friend who after all she knew was anxious for her happiness rather than for her own mre comfort and when she seemed most obstinate she had often been nearest to throwing herself upon her mistresss neck and exclaiming you are quite right my lady and i believe i have been an old fool all along it was more with the desire of putting a stop to this most unpleasant dispute than because her determination was absolutely adamantine and inflexible that she once more reiterated yes my lady i mean to stand to it and fixed her eyes doggedly upon the floor as though she would not even encounter another questioning glance mary said her mistress solemnly and after a long silence i am grieved beyond all power of words to tell at what you have just said but the mischief may not yet be quite past mending i have seen thismr derrickthis very night and therefore he will not receive your letter till at earliest tomorrow evening no nor then neither my lady so far as that goes for i was late for the london post i put the letter in the box for the very reason that i might not be persuaded to change my mind by then it has not yet left the village postoffice interrupted my lady hastily snatching up her bonnet from the table on which she had wearily put it down upon entering the room there is time to stop it yet no my lady i heard the postmans horn half an hour ago and if it were otherwise nothing would induce me to alter what i have already writtennothingnothing repeated mistress forest emphasising her last two words by beating with her foot upon the carpet alas dear friend you know not what you say replied my lady very gravely give me your hand mary nay do not withdraw it coldly for you will have need of comfort and support almost as much alas as imary mary this man is married already the waitingmaid started from her seat with a shrill scream i dont believe it i wont believe it it is false how dare you tell a lie to me lady lisgard only to gain your ends hush hush mary did you ever know me to tell a lie my friend it is true as that yonder moon is rising that this man has a wife alive do not weep so passionately the perjured villain the false bad man the wicked wicked wretch cried the waitingmaid her eyes flashing through their tears nay above all do not blame him mary for he knows it not himself he does not indeed what not know whether hes married or not sobbed the unhappy brideelect i dont believe that at all events even if i believe you he has married so many he doesnt know rightly who is his wife that is what you mean i see sailors are all alike o dear dear dear when mrs welsh comes to know of it and the monster will have got my letter by tomorrow night to shew about how nearly have i been committing bibibigamy calm yourself dear mary calm yourself your trouble is nothing to what i suffer and must continue to endure for my life long ah my lady i daresay it is very bad to be a widow but its much worse to die an oldleastways at fortyfior fortyfour ratherto lose o dear what an honest man he looked and such a beard and eyes i will never trust to appearances again i daresay it is very wrong my lady but i feefeefeel as though i could tear mrs derricks eyes out i do indeed here the bottle of smellingsalts which upon a certain occasion we saw used by mary forest for the recovery of her mistress had to change hands the unfortunate waitingmaid was taken with a very genuine fit of hysterics and not of the quiet sort either and if her senses left her it could not certainly be said that she also lost the use of her limbs at last exhausted in body but also more reasonable as to her mind she whispered mistress dearest tell me all you know then my lady knew that the time was come for her first selfhumiliation throughout the narrative that followed they were sitting upon the sofa together hand in hand but each had her face averted from the other and only now and then by a convulsive grasp of the fingers did mary shew her sympathy with her unhappy mistress at first she was too full of her own trouble to interrupt by words but soon the astounding revelation from my ladys lips overwhelmed every faculty of speech within her and she sat like a child who listens to a horrid story in the darkening twilight we have known one another more than half our lives mary said i a while ago and yet there has been a secret between us all that time i have never kept anything else from you but this was not mine alone to tell it was sir roberts also when he asked me to become his wife at coveton and you thought me so mad for first refusing him and afterwards for demanding such a long delay i had a reason for it which he knew but which you have never guessed i was then the threeweeks bride of another manyou may well start mary but that is the dreadful truth the man ralph gavestone whom i mourned so deeply as being drowned with my dear parents and all the rest of the ships company in that great stormwhich i would to heaven had whelmed me in its waveswas not my halfbrother as sir robert persuaded me to give out but my husband you had no weddingring my lady when you came ashore murmured the waitingmaid half incredulously that is true mary i know not how it was but perhaps the cold and wet of that dreadful night made my fingers shrinkyou remember how wan and thin i lookedand the ring must have dropped off i never saw it after i reached land but i was none the less a widowas i thought and although friendless save for you maryhomeless and penniless i thought i could never take another husband to my arms although the raging sea had worked that rough divorce between us at first i replied no sir robert never you will bear me witness that i did then when he pressed me still i bargained for three years i thought that he would tire of waiting for me and get some fitter mate in the meantime i did as heaven is my judge i was true to my poor ralphhe had saved me upon that spar at the risk and as i then believed at the sacrifice of his own lifeas long as inay i was true to him in a sense for ever sir robert was well aware of that i do not need justification from man or woman god himself absolved me i think so far but that was an evil day mary when i married i was no more sir roberts wife than you were mary think of that and he was not my husband and our children of whom he was so proud are basebornbastards sir richardis it not terrible do you not wonder that i live and am not madhe is not sir richard and my dear dear walter he is baseborn too and lettyfor whom her eldest brother thinks nobody too highshe too is no lisgard if i had waited seven years instead of three this would not have been so there are lawbooks in the library which have told me so much but i have no advisernone no friendyes you mary i knowbut not one who can help me is not this something worse than death itself which has fallen upon me and this man derrickhe was gavestone whispered mary forest in a hoarse grating voice yes did i not tell you so i only found it out last christmas eve i knew his voice and i knew the carol that he sang for one thing only do i thank heaveni who had reason as i thought to be thankful for so many thingsthat sir robert is not alive his sleep in yonder churchyard is disturbed by no such ghastly dream ah happy dead mistress beloved mistress cried the waitingmaid in an agony of remorseforgive me that i have been thinking of myself these many weeks while you have been so burdened and tormented henceforth i am yours only as i hope to get to heaven when i die i will be true to you whatever happens let us think what that may be nay let us not think exclaimed her mistress with a shudder or i shall lose my wits would you have me picture what this house would be should he come hither and claim me for his wife richard and he beneath the selfsame roof and he the master would walterthough he herds with him you saybrook this man as his equal would he not loathe him rather and how soon ah me unlearn the love he owes to mehis wretched mother i cannot hear to think of it i tell you let us act let us be doing somethingsomething how my brain whirls think for me marypray for me for heaven is deaf alas to my poor prayers but even while she spoke the gracious tears began to fill the furrows in her cheeks which until now had been dry throughout her talk and having told her friend the weight about her heart was lifted off a little and the tightness round her brow was loosened by the blessed hand of sympathy i must write to him at once said mary thoughtfully how fortunate that he did not leave mirk until tonight the two letters will now reach him at the same time he cannot write in answer to the one whichwhich i wrote firstwithout having read the other that will be something saved my lady shook her head there is but little hope in that i fear for he himself has this night told meyes i saw him face to face mary only i was thickly veiled thank heavenhe told me frankly thinking i did not wish to lose my waitingmaid that he should lay it to my charge if your reply was no and should not take it as the answer of your heart how much more if he gets a refusal coming so quickly upon the very heels of this acceptance will he decline to believe it comes from your own self more likely it would cause him reckless as he is to do something rash and vengefulperhaps to return hither on the instant and o mary mary i would give five thousand pounds this day if that would stop his coming to mirk again would that not stop him mistress asked the waitingmaid with earnest gravity five thousand pounds is a fortune is it not it would not stop him mary rejoined my lady sadly ralph gavestone even in his youthtime never valued money a fillip when weighed against a whim and now his will is more a law to him than ever i have never known resolve so fixed as i read it in his eyes this night and if he guessed the truth maryoh if he did but dream that i his lawful wife for whom he had gladly laid his own life down whose memory he has kept fresh and green when all else has withered whose loss has been his ruin was playing him falsehe said himself that on his reckless soul twas like as not there might be murder some dayand mary i do believe him white as the very moonbeams was my ladys face and the hand trembled which held the handkerchief she passed across her damp white brow not for myself good mary is this fear gasped she but for my dear onesdo you hear them yonder is it not sad to listen to such mirthfor this unhappy man being wronged becomes a madman straightway not disgrace alone may fall upon us here not only shamethink of that mary not only shame upon sir richard and the rest but even crime may visit us this house of dead sir robertonce the home of peace and genial ease and hospitalitybut that shall never be no they shall never meet my sons and he i will die rather and my corpse would part them wide enough o mistress talk not so you freeze my very blood what was it we were saying before you began to look like this you talked of bribing this ralph gavestonefor how could i offer him gold save as a bribe but if a bribe what need was there to bribe him why should i wish him once more upon the other side of the world why pay him a younger brothers portion to quit the courtship of my waitingmaid no mary this man is no mre rogue that he should take his money without question and be off he is suspicious keenand ah if wronged as implacable as death itself one moment my lady cried mistress forest leaping to her feet i do believe i have a plan to get that letter back ah good heaven what is it wise kind heart see madam and she began to reckon on her plump fingers with her pleasant face aglow with mingled joy and astonishment at her own sagacity the note was put in late for the london post from dalwynch it will therefore remain there though it has left mirk all tonight and not be forwarded till the morning mail if we drive over tomorrow earlystarting say at six oclockwe shall be in plenty of time to stop its going further in the meantime i will write another letter in its place you have saved mefor this timei do believe dear mary yes we can drive to dalwynchi will give orders for the carriage to be ready at sixand still be back at the abbey by breakfasttime if we are pressed for the reason we can give the true oneto a certain point if needs must beyou had a mind to alter what you have written to your suitor chapter iii contrary to the regulations of her majestys postoffice sorely did the fat coachman who had no neck inveigh against that caprice of his mistress which compelled his appearance at the front door upon the ensuing morning at an hour so altogether unexampled if he had but heard that it was all upon the account of mistress forest and the outlandish fellow who wore little gold rings in his ears and that curly heard so like the doormat of the servantshall it is doubtful whether he would have obeyed such a premature behest at all but as it was he was sitting on the coachbox with the sleek nags before him at the foot of the great steps which led down from the entrancehall at six oclock to a minute it was broad daylight of course so bright that it made him wink again as it flashed upon the glittering harness and the shining skins of the pampered beasts but still it was not a time for a man of his years and girth to be hurried up and made to toil as late as you please at night my lady and nobody ever heard joe wiggins utter a murmur muttered he but theres no constitushun as can stand such wear and tear as this however that might be with mr wiggins miss rose aynton seemed to make uncommonly light of early rising for much to the astonishment of her hostess she was up and dressed and in the breakfastroom when that lady made her appearance at halfpast five i happened to hear that you were goingout betimes dear lady lisgard said she with her sweetest smile and getting up in these first summer mornings is such a treat to a poor londonbred girl like me so without saying a word to dearest letty i thought i would just fill her place for once and make your coffee for you thank you rose returned my lady a little stiffly for she had not intended that anybody and far less one who was not a member of her own family should have been a witness to her departure i have unpleasant business on hand which takes me to dalwynch before the morning train starts if you are going to london began rose hesitatingly as if intending to send something by my ladys hands to her aunt if it was not too much troublei am not going to london replied lady lisgard quietly i shall be back by the usual breakfasthour i have no doubt here my lady sipped her coffee with the air of a connoisseur and perceiving miss aynton was about to ask more questions requested a little sugar then a fresh supply ofno not hot milksome cream would the carriage never come round and release her from this importunate girl how glad the people will be to see you about again once more lady lisgard observed miss aynton cheerfully you cant imagine how curious they have been to know why you have shut yourself up so long i was not aware that my movements were any business of theirs rose returned my lady with severity nor indeed of anybodys except myself very true answered miss aynton carelessly that is what i always told them besides it is not pleasant to run the chance of meeting a rude and perhaps halfdrunken ruffian like this man derrick when one knows he has made up his mind to address one upon the first opportunity indeed said my lady scornfully i assure you i was quite unaware of that dreadful menace she stole a glance over her cup to see if there was anything to read in this strange girls face but there was nothing as soon as she had finished her duties in connection with the coffeepot she had taken a piece of fancywork in her hands in the execution of which she seemed entirely wrapped up o yes of course it is most ridiculous but that is what all the village has been saying for these five months more or less and now that you are going out for the first time when he has but left the place overnight they are sure to say how do you know rose that this man left mirk last night inquired my lady setting down her cup and looking at the young girl fixedly could it possibly have been she whom she had beheld lurking about the churchyard wall and perhaps listening to the conversation in the course of which derrick had announced his intention of going at that late hour to dalwynch so as to be in time for the first uptrain upon the morrow a faint flush stole over miss ayntons face but by no means such a blush as is called telltale it might easily enough have been caused by the mre directness of the question your son mr walter told me replied she simplyhe is a great ally of this mans you knowhere is the carriage i am afraid you will find it very dull lady lisgard taking this long drive all alone if i thought that my company thank you rose replied my lady hastily it is most kind of you to offer it but the fact is i am going to take forest with me this visit to dalwynch is mainly upon her account indeed if the chariot held more than two perhaps i should take you at your word but as it issee i have a book for my companioncome forest we have no time to lose mary had entered the room while she was speaking and gave quite a start at seeing miss aynton at the breakfasttable her mistress was already cloaked and had her bonnet on to dalwynch my lady said the footman having put up the steps and closed the chariotdoor yes drive fast which part of the town my lady for there were two roads to the posttown the relative length of which from the abbey depended upon what part of the place was to be visited miss aynton was standing on the last flight of the stone steps and could hear every word that was spoken take the lower road replied my lady very distinctly and the wellhung chariotpleasantest invention save the fairweather hansom which the wit of coachmakers has yet sought outrolled swiftly along the gravelled road then they are not going to the railway station exclaimed rose aloud no miss assented the butler as he stood at the open halldoor regarding nature as though it were a novelty to him at that hour i should say it must be the postoffice perhaps my lady wishes to get the letters this morning earlier than the mirks man can bring them very likely roberts returned the young lady a little disconcerted at her involuntary remark having been overheard let us hope she will have good news but i should scarcely have thought it was necessary to have gone herself well i am not so sure miss mrs rudd the postmistress at dalwynch is a great stickler for forms and that and she might have made some difficulty particularly as she did not obtain her place through our influence whose influence roberts ours miss to be sure the lisgard interest you see was given last election to the losing side although time was i can well recollect when poor sir robert had everything of that sort at his disposal that was vacant in these parts but them yallers they have gone and spoilt it all this time and with a sigh of regret for the golden age of patronage and a shake of the head directed against the levelling opinions at present in the ascendant mr roberts went off to his breakfast no sooner had the wheels of the chariot began to move than lady lisgard observed to her companion you have the letter with you that i dictated last night have you not yes my lady here it is though not sealed down in case you might have thought of anything to add no mary said her mistress perusing it there is nothing here that i can better by thought although i spent all night in thinking over it a refusal could scarce be made shorter or more decided than this there is not a trace of vacillation to give the most sanguine suitor hope then as if some other idea was expressing itself almost in spite of herself she added do i not look deadly pale mary very white and worn madam as you well may but bad enough for people to observe who did not know the cause for some people madam she saw it sharp enough if you mean her my lady and the waitingmaid made a significant gesture in the direction of miss rose aynton nothing escapes her bless younothing and the sooner shes out of the house under present circumstancesand indeed under every circumstance in my opinionthe better you never liked her from the first mary said her mistress in the tone of one who argues against her own conviction we should not be uncharitable in our judgments of others and particularly as respects young folks we often set down as serious faults what in them is only thoughtlessness miss aynton is none of that sort my lady she always thinks before she speaks and takes a good long look before she leaps and for all she seems as though butter would not melt in her mouth shes as full o schemes as a cat at a dairydoor if theres cream to be got in this world shell get it my lady ill go bail let the buttermilk fall to whose share it will i confess that i cant quite understand her said my lady musing i am sure when she first came she seemed simple and unobtrusive enough while on the other hand in her manner towards me of late downright impudence i call it my lady in such a chit as she well i dont say that but she is certainly not so respectful as she might be i shall be sorry to send her back to london just as the summer is beginning to live with her cross old aunt whom she appears to dislike so but i confess i think she has been here long enough much too long my lady much too long answered mrs forest gravely she has set more people in the house by the ears than you wot of while anne rees who used to be miss lettys maid one would think miss aynton was her mistress now so entirely has she got her under her thumb she has ferreted out some folly of annesheaven knows how she did it or what it is but the girls her slave from whom but her did she learn that you were starting at this hour and again why was not miss letty told as well as miss rose do you suppose she would have let anybody else make coffee for her mamma if she had been aware of your departure no no then miss aynton will take credit to herself for not permitting miss letty to be called and fatigue herself by getting up so early nasty sly young hussy thats just her way uncommon civil kind and attentive until she gets the upper hand and finds you under her thumb then you begin to know her weve found her out in the servantshall although she makes a fool of old roberts yet she actually told him that at the last dinnerparty at the abbey she thought him the most distinguishedlooking person in the room but only wait till she catches him some afternoon at the madeira then hell be her obedient humble servant without having any more pretty speeches thats a bad bold girl maam let her be ten times a lady born here mistress forest indignantly tossing her head back without making due allowance for her bonnet came into sharp contact with the back of the chariot and severely bit her tongue my lady was thereby enabled to interpose a remark but why have you not told me a word of this before mary i would never have permitted a guest of mine and particularly a young lady to whom i stand in the relation of guardian while she is under my roof first to ingratiate herself with my servants and then to tyrannise over them in the way you describe i never heard of anything more atrociously mean and i think you have been wanting in your dutylet alone your personal regard for me maryto have concealed the matter so long begging your pardon my lady you have nobody to blame but yourself for that observed the waitingmaid with asperity the only harsh words you ever spoke to me were about certain of mrs welshs doings of which i complained with reason though i do not wish to refer to them now what you said was this never abuse the affectionate relation in which we two stand mary by causing me to side with you against your fellowservants i can deny you nothing but do not vex me with talebearing i hate all vulgar gossip and despise those who bring it after a settingdown like that it was not likely that i should give tongue about miss ayntons ways nor let you know how she has made anne rees a spy upon us all no no mind your own business mary forest says you and ive minded it my lady ever since do not be angry with me friend returned lady lisgard sadly i daresay i was wrong and even if not i have no heart to argue with you now and no wonder poor dear assented the waitingmaid greatly mollified i was a brute to bring it up against you just now in all this trouble nor was it the right time perhaps to speak about miss ayntons goings on only you yourself said her manner was not quite what it used to be and i was so afraid that she might be getting you my lady under her thumb how could that possibly be mary she surely cannot have the slightest suspicion of she sniffs something my lady or she would not have been making your coffee this morning however let her sniff only be you very careful to lock your desk and when you want to say anything to me about you know who come out of earshot of the keyhole of your own doorah wouldnt she though but i know better a thief no i didnt say a thief although for the matter of that she has a mind to steal from you or i am much mistaken something you value most on earthyour son there now ive said it and the waitingmaid drew a very long breath as though some oppressive weight was off her mind at last she evidently expected her mistress to express astonishment if not horror and it was positively a disappointment to her when my lady replied calmly i know all about that mary but you are doing miss aynton wrong she might have been my daughterinlaw if she liked and yet to my certain knowledge she refused to be so she refused most certainly she did my son made her an offer in my presence and she rejected himbut here we are at dalwynch tell wiggins to stop at the postoffice thank heaven there is plenty of time to spare how my heart does beat the waitingmaid pulled the checkstring and delivered her mistresss orders but quite mechanically without knowing what she said in spite of the importance of what she had now so immediately to do her mind was entirely occupied with the wonder of what she had just heard and she kept repeating to herself and she rejected him and she rejected him while her heightened eyebrows almost amalgamated with her hair perhaps some of this excessive astonishment was due to poor mistress forests peculiar position she thought it so strange that one of her own sex should reject any manwho was not already married to somebody else here is the postoffice mary mind you speak very civilly to the woman and make haste i shall be in a perfect fever till i see you come back with that dreadful letter safe in your hand one minute two minutes three minuteseach seeming an hour to my lady shrinking in a corner of the chariot while the omnibus to the station passed and repassed picking up she knew not what passengers and bearing derrick himself for all she knew within it at last lady lisgard could endure the suspense no longer john said she to the footman standing beside the door what is forest about why does she not return she is talking to mrs rudd my lady i think there is some dispute about a letter for they are both in the postoffice department let me out john exclaimed my lady impatiently and the next instant she had entered mrs rudds establishment this was for the most part a grocers shop onefifth of it only being reserved for the reception and despatch of her majestys mails there were no customers at that still early hour a young man who was sanding the floor with some ostentation as though to imply that all the sand went that way and none into the sugar made a respectable pause as my ladys silk swept by and another who appeared to be washing his hands in tea assumed that sickly smile which is supposed by persons of his class to conciliate people of quality but mrs rudd herself intrenched behind her little postoffice palisade gave no sign of gracious welcome and from out the pigeonhole through which she distributed her stamps her words poured forth in an undiminished stream of denial and severity nay i doubt whether the presence of my lady did not intensify the bitterness of its tone whatever importance it may be to you to get this letter mistress forest cried she addressing poor mary who was looking very disconsolate and not a little angry also it is of much greater moment to me that i should keep it it is as much as my place is worth to give a letter back which has once been given into my charge and i am not aware that i owe that place to my lady lisgard and therefore feel called upon to riski beg pardon your ladyshipbut i did not catch sight of you before what your servant has come to ask of me is something out of the question i will post this second letter for heralthough it is two minutes past the time even with an extra stamp for thatbut as for returning her this other yes i have no doubt its hersalthough for that matter peoples handwriting is often very like other peoplesbut directly it reached this box it became the property of the postmastergeneral it is no more hers now than it is mine and if i was to yield it up its a matter madam that might be brought before the assizes mrs rudd said my lady quietly i hope although your late husband and my son were not quite of the same way of thinking as to politics that you do not look upon me in an unneighbourly light i do not wish to insult you by offering you a bribe but i may say this much that nobody ever put me under an obligation yet without my endeavouring to recompense them to the best of my power yes my ladyalthough i cant say as i have ever been overburdened with favours at your ladyships handsi know what sugar and currants goes to the abbey from simmons every weekenough for a regiment im sure and at such a price too and all because he voted blue voting blue mrs rudd interrupted my lady is nothing at all compared with the good service you would do me if you could only oblige my maid in the matter of this letter her future happiness i may say is bound up in the mre fact of that little note arriving or not at its destination mr r derrick turf hotel piccadilly muttered mrs rudd looking at the address over the top of her silver spectacles i should like to have half the abbey grocery custom very much of course you shall have it whispered my lady in broken tones but i dare not do it continued the postmistress this might be held over meif it ever came to be knownso that i should never be my own mistress again which now that rudd is gone i mean to be when you have once done an illegal action my lady you may just as well be a slaveuntil you have taken your punishment somebody is sure to get wind of it and to put you under their thumb my lady gave a ghastly smile for speech was not in her look here mrs rudd interposed mistress forest softly you are not asked either to destroy or to give up this letterof the inside of which if you please i will tell you every word it is written to my loverthats the fact and i am very very anxious that he should receive ithere she trod upon my ladys foot with unmistakable emphasisshould receive it by this nights post well so he will returned the postmistress in piccadilly yes but mr derrick is not in piccadilly urged the waitingmaid the direction should he care of mr arthur haldanewhat court is it my ladyyes pump court temple if you would only let me write that mrs rudd upon the envelope instead of the present address all mischief will be avoided would it not my lady there seems no great harm in that said mrs rudd reflectively no harm whatever and a great deal of good to you murmured the waitingmaid as with a rapid hand she crossed out the words already written and substituted for them the address of mr haldanes lawchambers thank you kindly now please to stamp this other i am so much obliged and i too said my lady graciously be so kind mrs rudd as to let me take your list of groceries with me what nice macaroni that looksi find such a difficulty in getting it in the country pure mrs rudd herself accompanied my lady to her chariot and courtesied to the ground as the chariot whirled away no sooner were they alone than mistress and maid exchanged a hearty kiss thank you thank you dear mary cried the former without your presence of mind what should we have done i began to feel quite prostrate with despair and even now i tremble to think how nearly we had failed i could not go through such a scene again i believe even if my life depended upon it ah yes you could my lady and i only trust it may not be necessary for you to do so there is nothing more however to be done at present save to wait and hopeexcept the telegraph message i ventured to tell john to the railway station telegraph to whom and about what mary we must let mr arthur know what he is to do with that letter my lady otherwise he may endeavour to forward it to the person to whom it is addressed very true dear mary i do believe that my wits are leaving me by all means telegraph burn it i wish i could repay you for your prudent thought as easily as i can recompense mrs rudd for her complaisance do not think of repaying me my dear replied the waitingmaid fondly it is a heartfelt pleasure to find that i am not altogether useless in this strait i am yoursyoursyoursmy beloved mistress and will be though every friend on earth should stand afar off and you were forsaken by your very kith and kin but god forbid that should ever be the case mary ejaculated lady lisgard solemnly amen my ladyamen im sure but when the worst happens that can happen you will please to remember you have mary forest still chapter iv an uncheerful picnic by the time lady lisgard returned to the abbey notwithstanding that the sleek bays had devoured the road with all the haste of which their condition permitted it was long past the breakfasthour and her absence from that meal provoked no little comment from the members of her family nobody was able to allay their curiosity as to what could have taken mamma to dalwynch but miss aynton did her best to stimulate it she has gone upon mary forests account said shethat is all i can tell you i never knew any one take such trouble about her maids as dear lady lisgard yes rose replied letty warmly but it is not every maid who has lived with her mistress thirty years i believe mary would lay down her very life for dear mamma and indeed for any of us whenever i read those stupid letters in the papers about there being no good old servants to be seen now a days i long to send the editor a list of our people at the abbey mary indeed is quite a new acquisition in comparison with wiggins and the gardener but then she is almost faultless i have heard mamma say that there has never been a word between them not between them indeed letty returned miss aynton laughing for mistress forest has all the talk to herself sir richard smiled grimly for mary had been in his bad books ever since her attachment to that vagabond derrick good miss rose cried waltervery good i wish i could say as much for this socalled newlaid egg why should eggs be of different degrees of freshness why not all fresh why are they ever permitted to accumulate my egg is very good observed sir richard sententiously how is yours miss aynton and he laid an emphasis upon the name in tacit reproof to his brother for having been so familiar as to say miss rose well sir richard i am londonbred you know and therefore your country eggs by comparison are excellent i wish i could think said the baronet with stateliness that in other matters we equally gained by contrast with town in your opinion i believe london is the place to get everything good remarked walter sharply we are going today miss aynton continued the baronet without noticing the interruption to offer you something which really cannot be got in town and which hitherto the state of the weather has forbidden even here ah for shame richard interrupted letty holding up her hands now that was to be a surprise for roseits a picnic my dear i daresay now you scarcely know what that is i can tell you then ejaculated walter with acidity its packing up all the things you would have in the ordinary course at luncheon in a comfortable mannerexcept the bread or something equally necessary which is always left behindand carrying them about six miles to the top of an unprotected hillin this particular case to a tower without a roof to itthere to be eaten without tables or chairs and in positions the most likely to produce indigestion that the human body can adapt itself to i have always been told that being in a bad humour is the most certain thing to cause what you eat to disagree with you observed letty demurelynever mind what walter says i am sure you will be delighted dear rose we are going to belcomb a sort of shootingbox belonging to us about five miles away and built by grandpapa commonly termed lisgards folly added master walter not by his descendants however i should hope with one exception observed sir richard haughtilyi will thank you walter not to cut my newspaper master walter had seized the paperknife as though it had been a more deadly weapon and was engaged in disembowelling one of a multiplicity of newspapers which had just arrived by post i did not see it was yours returned he goodness knows nobody wants to read the court journal but yourself the idea of not liking ones newspaper cut yes i must say my dear richard said letty playfully patting her elder brother next to whom she sat upon the shoulder that is a most singular objection of yours i think it certainly proves that you will always remain an old bachelor sir richard maintained a frowning silence master walter twirled his silken moustache and looked up at miss aynton with a meaning smile what is your opinion upon the subject said he miss rose insolent exclaimed sir richard rising so hastily that he knocked over the chair on which he had been sitting how dare you ask such questions in my presence richard richard cried a reproving voice and lo at the open door stood my lady holloweyed and pale and with such a weariness and melancholy in her tones as would have touched most heartsam i ever to find you and walter quarrelling thusyes i have heard all and think you both to blame but nothing can excuse this violence if i have any authority in this house at all not another word i beg sir richard bit his lip but resumed his seat walter went on quietly dissecting the illustrated london news with an air of intense interest miss aynton very accurately traced the pattern of her plate with her fork letty the innocent cause of the outbreak shed silent tears altogether the family picture was gloomy and the situation embarrassing my lady reaped this advantage however that nobody asked her a word about her expedition to dalwynch do not let me detain you at table my dear letty said she breaking a solemn pause miss aynton was so good as to make my coffee this morning and therefore it is only fair that she should perform the same kind office now glad enough of this excuse to leave the rooma movement felt by all to be very difficult of imitationletty rushed up stairs to indulge in a good cry in her own bedroom the upper system of fountains only having been yet in play sir richard gloomily stalked away towards the stables walter lounged into the hall lit a cigar and paced to and fro upon the terrace beneath the windows of the breakfastroom with both his hands in his pockets whiffs of his havana and scraps of the opera tune which he was humming came in at the open window to those who yet remained my lady had much too good taste to dislike the smell of good tobacco and the air which he had chosen was a favourite one with her perhaps master walter hummed it upon that account he was to leave the abbey next day to join his regimentalthough not immediately it was only natural he should wish to spend a few days in london after he had had so much of the quiet of mirk and yet my lady grudged them how pleasant everything about him was how dull the abbey would be without him what a sad pity it was that he and sir richard got on so ill if she were to die would they not turn their hacks on one another for ever and he brothers no more and if something worse than death were to happen to herno she would not think of that had not all that could be done to avert such utter ruin been done that very morning there was surely no immediate peril nowno necessity for such excessive caution and selfrestraint as she had been obliged of late months to exercise it was something to have breathingspace and liberty i hope you are coming with us to the picnic lady lisgard now that that horrid man has gone said a cold quiet voice my lady looking out of window at her favourite son and lost in gloomy depths of thought had entirely forgotten that she had invited miss rose aynton to bear her company she did not venture to look upon her questioners face though she felt that it was fixed on hers reading heaven knew what how had she dared to think of liberty with this domestic spy under her very roof what should she answer to this dreadful question something this girl must know or must suspect or she would never have ventured thus to allude a second time to the man derrick after her rebuff in the morning above all things she would follow mistress forests advice and get miss aynton out of mirk abbey she had intended to speak to her respecting what had just occurred at the breakfasttable that would also offer an opportunity to say something more yes rose i am going with you to belcomb it is a very favourite spot of minevery it was about that expedition partly that i wished to speak with you i was about to ask you to be very careful in your conduct towards my sons this day it is the last time they will be together for weeks perhaps be kind to my poor richard of course walter knew nothing of what has passed between you and his brother but the bow which he drew at a venture sent home a barbed shot miss aynton bowed her head you were sorry for that rose i know you cannot fail to see how irritable he has lately grown poor fellow the fact is he has overestimated the strength of his own powers of selfconstraint your presence is a perpetual trial to him my lady paused anticipating some reply to a hint so palpable but miss aynton who carried her fancywork in her pocket continued to develop a pansy in floss silk and the flower opened in silence under these circumstances dear rose pursued my lady do you not think it would be betteri know how embarrassing it would be to you to propose it and therefore although your hostess i relieve you of the taskdo you not think it would on the whole be wiser for you to leave us a little sooner than you had intended the humming of the opera tune and the odour of the havana were growing more distinct and the elastic footfall on the gravel was coming very near if i consulted my own feelings returned miss aynton in firm clear tones i should certainly have left mirk before this lady lisgard hush miss aynton for heavens sake cried my lady the window is open but unless sir richard himself pursued the girl in more subdued accents releases me from my promise to remain until after his birthday i must with your permission madam do so otherwise he might possibly imagine that his presence is too great a trial for me and i should be loath indeed to have my departure so misconstrued there was bitterness in the tone with which she spoke but determination too i am to understand then returned my lady flushing that contrary to my advice and wish mother dear here comes the break cried master walter from the terrace beneath in his ringing cheerful tones i hope you have told roberts about the prog yes dear yes answered my lady lovingly even in her haste then turning to the young girl she whispered almost fiercely at least miss aynton you will shape your behaviour this afternoon as i requested there is no time now to discuss the other matter and indeed the butler entered the next moment with the break is at the door my lady now the break was a very roomy vehicle with accommodation within it for three times the party who were now about to occupy it beside two seats at the back like flying buttresses for footmen yet sir richard chose to sit upon the box beside the driver a place only selected unless for smoking purposes by persons with horsey characteristics who prefer coachmans talk to that of their equals and among whom the baronet could not be justly classed but the fact was the young man was in an evil temper and desired no companionship but his own he would have seen the whole expedition at the bottom of the seaa metaphor open to the gravest objections but which he used while arguing the matter with himself aloudif it were not that that fellow walter was goingandandhe was not going to let him have all the talk to himself that was all true sir richard had given up the idea of transforming miss aynton into lady lisgard but still it was not pleasant to see another man making himself exclusively agreeable to her he was annoyed with himself at having exhibited such passion at the breakfasttable for the more he thought of it the more he felt convinced that walters remark although doubtless intended to be offensive had not been made with any knowledge of his own rejected suit still he was in a very bad temperand listened to the conversation going on behind his back with a moody brow and every now and then a parting of the lips through which escaped something the reverse of a prayer it was walter of course who was talking inhabited said he in answer to some question of miss ayntons o dear no belcomb never had a tenant but once and i should think would never have another one sir heron grant and his brother took it two years for the shootingseason a brace of scotchmen whose ancestors dated from the deluge but so dreary a couple that one wished that the family had started from a still earlier epoch and been all washed away i thought richard rather liked sir heron observed letty simply yes because he was a baronet and birds of the same gorgeous plumage flock together you know there was nothing remarkable about him but his feathers and he scarcely ever opened his mouth except to put food in it it is said that in the old stagecoach times he and his brother travelled from edinburgh to london and only uttered one sentence apiece at york the younger brother saw a rat come out of a wheatrick by jove cried he theres a rat the next morning and after an interval of about eighty miles sir heron replied ay if towser had seen that rat he would have made short work of him well it appears they agreed at all events returned rose coldly after all even a foolish remark is better than an illnatured one the scenery is getting well worth your attention here observed sir richard turning graciously round towards miss aynton belcomb is a complete solitude but for those who are contented with the pleasures of the country it is a pleasant spot enough can we see the house from here sir richard no not until we reach this windmill on the top of the hill the private road branches out from the highway at that spot and the mill is the nearest inhabited house to belcombby the by mother hathaway must be spoken to about those sails of histhere you saw how even old jenny started at themit is positively dangerous for horses to pass by he must build up that old wall a foot higher and put a gate up any stray cattle might wander in and get knocked downthe sails are so close to the ground master walter had not at all relished miss ayntons rejoinder to his story still less had he liked his brothers striking into the conversation least of all did he approve of this landlord talk about repairs and alterations which reminded him of his being a younger son and having neither part nor lot in the great lisgard heritage theres the folly cried he suddenly with a view of changing the subject upon that clifflike hill yonder above that belt of trees what that beautiful ivied tower exclaimed rose yes without a roof to it well at all events its very pretty said miss aynton reprovingly i am sure mr walter you ought to be grateful to your grandpapa for building so picturesque an edifice he might have made a road however to it observed walter satirically a road and a roof i do consider to be indispensable theres a beautiful winding path through the wood rose said letty fifty times better than any road and is not the piece of water charming it is the only one with any pretension to be called a lake in all the county certainly belcomb deserved praise a small but comfortably furnished house embosomed in trees through which were the pleasantest peeps of hill and dale and spread before it quite a crystal tarn with rocky islands so picturesquely grouped that they almost gave the notion of being artificial it was as though a segment of the lakecountry had been cut off and inserted into the very midst of wheatshire it was as lonely too to all appearance as any cumberland mre an old man and his wife who were in charge of the place came hirpling out with respectful welcomes and the latter was about to remove the shutters of the drawingroom when my lady interposed no rachel we will not trouble you to do that we are going to picnic at the tower you seem quite surprised to see us so early i suppose nobody has been here yet upon the same errand well no maam nor is it likely after your orders oh the fact is mother interrupted sir richard with a little stammer i forgot to tell you about it but rinkel informs me there has been considerable damage done by parties coming here from dalwynch and other places and therefore he has put up a notice to prohibit the whole thing in future and indeed upon the path leading to the folly which could be approached by another way than that in front of the house they presently came upon a board recently erected which threatened trespassers with all the rigour of the law there was a bitter sneer upon captain lisgards handsome face at this assumption of authority upon the part of his brother and it did not soften when my lady thoughtfully remarked ah well that will certainly make the place very private a curious reply as letty thought at the time for her mother to make who was always so eager to oblige her neighbours and who well knew how popular lisgards folly was with the humbler class of townsfolk in the summer months but she was destined to be vastly more astonished before that day was spent the little party so strangely out of accord with one another took their lunch indeed beneath the shadow of the tower but all those harmonious elements which are so absolutely essential to the success of a picnic were wanting there were no high spirits no goodhumoured badinage and not the ghost of a laugh my lady singularly silent even for her gazed around her on the familiar landscape or regarded the shuttered cottage with a mournful interest as though they reminded her of happier times miss aynton careful of what my lady had enjoined was studiously urbane to sir richard but without obtaining the wishedfor result for while the baronet was thereby only rendered tolerably gracious the captain grew intensely irritated poor letty who was the only one prepared to be agreeable or had any expectation of enjoying herself felt immensely relieved when the repast was concluded and the horses were ordered to be put to as for strolling about the grounds and pointing out their varied beauties to rose as she had counted upon doing that was no longer to be thought of sir richard as usual offered his arm in stately fashion to his mother but master walter lighting a cigar stood for a few minutes looking down with knitted brow upon the lake then sauntered after them without saying a word and with both hands in his pockets dear rose cried letty who watched these proceedings with little short of terror what have you said to make walter so cross i never saw him behave like that in my life he did not even look at you would it be very wrong if you just ran after him and said a word or two before we got into the carriage i am so dreadfully afraid of a quarrel between him and richard just as you please letty returned miss aynton looking pale and a little frightened too and forcing a laugh she tripped down the zigzag path in pursuit of the exasperated captain letty waited a reasonable time watching the footman collect the dbris of the entertainment and pack the plate and then supposing their difficulty had been adjusted followed upon the track of her friend and walter the path was not only of considerable length but so very steep that one little zigzag overhung another thus as she descended she perceived through the thin spring foliage the two young people standing beneath her although they were quite unconscious of her approach she caught the last words of something rose was saying those were walter dear she marked the girl stretch her arms towards him as though she would have clasped them round his neck and then she saw captain lisgard of her majestys light dragoons put her roughly by shake himself free of her with a movement expressive almost of loathing and turn upon his heels with an oath chapter v the finesse in trumps it is the night before the derby the west end is thronged with men the streets are perceptibly more thronged with welldressed males than at any other time in the year the may meetings brought enough of parsons and sobercoated laity to dull the living tideto almost make us londoners a mournful people which we are naturally not despite what frenchmen say but those grave ones have either departed from us or are now lost and undistinguishable in this influx of gay company all the newcomers are in their most gorgeous raiment for is not this the great gaudy week of the wicked half the officers of cavalry in her majestys sendee have obtained leave of absence for eightandforty hours upon urgent private affairs and a fourth of the infantry have done the like they have come up from every station within the four seas to see the great race run which is to put in their pockets from five pounds to fifty thousand over their little books they shake their shining heads and stroke their tawny moustaches in a deprecating manner but each one has a secret expectation that he shall pull it off this once for upon the whole our military friends have not been fortunate in turf transactions there is a fair sprinkling too of respectable country gentlemen who rarely leave their families to occupy their oldbachelor quarters at longs or the tavistock except on this supreme occasion every fast universityman who can obtain an exeat upon any pretence whateverfrom sudden mortality in the domestic circle down to being subpoenaed by a friendly attorney in the supposititious case of hookey a blind man v walkeris up in town resplendent confident young every sporting farmer save those in the north who have a private saturnalia of their own in the midautumn has left his farm for two nights and a day and is seeing life in london besides these an innumerable host of welldressed scoundrelsfor whom the word welcher is altogether too commendablehave come up from country quarters where they have been playing various little games all more or less discreditable to work together for evil with their metropolitan confreres for four days every haunt of dissipation is holding highest holiday the stupid obscene cider cellars find for one night at least that they have attractions still the musichalls are tropical with heat and rankest human vegetation cremorne after the crowded theatres have disgorged their steaming crowds is like a fair the strangers room at all the clubs has been bespoken this night for weeks in the cardrooms the smokingrooms the billiardrooms there is scarcely space to move far less to breathe in yet there is everywhere a babblement of tongues and the words that are most bandied about from feverish mouth to mouth are first the king and secondly menelaus the tout had kept his wordeither from fear or nicest honouruntil the stipulated week had elapsed and then the news of the trialrace began to circulate from his outsiders place to that of fourth favourite then of third and at last to that of second had the french horse gradually risen a curious and illogical position enoughbut then the turfpeople are illogicalfor if the news that he had beaten the king was true he ought to have been first favourite and if the news was not true he had no reason to find favour at all as it was however the king had come down half a point as if to meet him to to while menelaus stood at to and had that trialrace really taken place or not and if so was it on the square was the question which was just then agitating the houses of lords and commons nay it was whispered marlborough house itself and all the messtables in her majestys service more than any other subject in this world there was also a vague rumour that the favourites understandings were not as they should be that there was a contraction that might be fatal to his prospects that the idols feet were of clay ralph derrick had put the pot on his many laws and would be a millionaire if he won but walter lisgard had put more than the pot if the french colours did not shew in front at the winningpost the captain still to use the elegant metaphor of the sporting fraternity would be in queer street so infatuated had the young man grown that he had absolutely hedged even that one bet which insured him a thousand pounds in case the king should win the race notwithstanding his coyness in accepting the first offer of a loan from his uncultivated friend he had borrowed of him twice since in each case giving his iou whereby he endeavoured to persuade himself that he was liquidating all obligation yet unless he considered his mre autograph was worth the sums for which it was pledged i know not how he succeeded in this for if menelaus did not happen to win he not only would not have enough to discharge his debts of honour for nearly two yearswhen he would come into possession of his patrimony of five thousand poundsbut even a great portion of that would be bespoken thus of course he had placed himself through mre greed in a most unpleasant position but at the same time it must be allowed that he had yielded to a great temptation such as would probably have made the mouth of any financier water had the opportunity offered in his particular line for with the exception of mre outsiders the king had beaten every horse that was to contend with him on the morrow and menelaus to walters certain knowledge had beaten the king equinely speaking then it was a certainty that the french horse should win the derby in which case the young mans gains would be prodigious for not only had he taken advantage of the original position of the animal in the betting but as the odds grew less and less had still backed him until his possible winnings reached on paper to five figures on the other hand by this last piece of imprudence his possiblebut no it was not possible things surely wouldnt go so devilish cross with a fellow as that or to put the captains thought in other words the government of the universe being founded upon just principles would never permit such a stupendous misfortune to overwhelm him or it might be the gallant captain believed that fortune was indeed a female and would therefore hesitate to inflict calamity upon so pretty a fellow as himself at the same time the event of the morrow was so big with fate that it was not pleasant to dwell upon it and anything which could have prevented his mind from recurring to the same would have been welcomed gladly but there was but one thing that had the power to do this his anxiety was far too deep to be flattered away by the smile of beauty or lost in the sparkle of wine the homoeopathic treatment similia similibus he felt was the only one that could now give him relief and he therefore sought for rest from the cares of the racecourse in the excitement of the gamingtable do not however let it be supposed that the captain sought out any of those convenient establishments for the immediate transfer of property which are guarded by iron doors and always liable to the incursions of the police who upon breaking in discover fourandtwenty gentlemen one of whom has swallowed the dice sitting round a green baize table in conversation about music and the fine arts master walter was rash in his speculations but he was not madman enough to play chickenhazard against foxes i think i shall try my luck with the landrails tonight observed he to his companion derrick stopping short in flaring piccadilly and bitinghis nails the two men had been occupying lodgings in the same house the turf hotel being full the younger finding a species of comfort in the society of the partowner of menelaus who was even more confident of the success of that noble quadruped than himself by all means my lad returned the goldfinder simply although i dont know what they are and so as you take me with you i dont care three weeks ago such a proposition would have staggered the captain or rather he would have rejected it pointblank to be seen in public with his uncouth and flashilyattired friend was at that time a considerable trial to the fastidious light dragoon but the immense interest which they had in common had rendered the familiarity of the once odious orson at first tolerable and eventually welcome and even necessary he had taken him with him into quite exclusive circles and except on one occasion at the rag where derrick having drunk more champagne than was good for him had offered to fight major pompus of the fusiliers for what he liked nothing unpleasant had taken place in consequence men observed what a deuced rum fellow lisgard brought with him the other night but the said stranger had lost his money very goodnaturedly at the whisttable and it was understood that he had more to lose under such circumstances the gentlemenplayers were very charitable mr ralph derrick did not play a firstrate game at whist very few persons who have not been brought up in good society do but his performance was not so inferior as to make success impossible for a night or two however certain the ruin that would have overtaken him in the longrun moreover he was never put off his head by the largeness of the stake his habitual lavishness in moneymatters rendering him indifferent to that matter captain lisgard on the other hand though an excellent player considering his tender years was liable to have his nerves disorganised at any crisis of a rubber upon which an unusual amount depended yes repeated master walter ill try my luck at the landrails and you shall come too ralph any member has a right to introduce whom he likes even a miner from caribooeh master walter provided hes got money in his pocket well im their man whether its for whist or allfours allfours repeated the captain with irritation who ever heard of a gentleman playing at that game do pray be particular in what you say tonight whatever you do call a knave a knave and not a jack the landrails is a very select place ralph where men who like to play their whist more quietly than at the rag look in for an hour or two rather late heavier stakes i suppose observed derrick bluntly yes rather you see theres always some row with the committee if play gets beyond a certain height at the regular clubs now this is a sort of friendly circle where the points are quite optional and the bets too yes i think i shall try my luck for a pony or two i dont think you look quite fit for whist my lad tonight returned derrick gazing gravely into the young mans haggard face tomorrow will be a trying day remember i think you had much better get to bed i couldnt do it man replied walter vehementlyi dare not i should never sleep a wink and perhaps go mad with thinking before the morning look here how my hand trembles i have not nerves of iron like you poor lad poor lad ejaculated the other with affectionate compassion nothing as you say ever makes me trembleexcept d t ah heaven but that is terrible never drink lad never drink and something like a shudder throbbed through the speakers brawny frame the landrails meet here said walter stopping at the door of a private house in the neighbourhood of st jamess palace it is past eleven and i daresay play has begun who owns this house asked derrick carelessly surveying the unpretending tenement in questionor rather who pays the rent well i hope we shall ralph this evening the fact is the hire of the rooms the attendance and even the cost of the refreshments are all defrayed each night by the winners in proportion to their gains money does not change hands until the ensuing week but the secretary enters all accounts in his ledger and sees that they are duly squared i am answerable for your liabilities tonight so do you be careful with the liquors as the youthful mentor administered this wholesome piece of advice to his senior the door opened and they were admitted it was a most respectable house neither very large nor very small and neatly but inexpensively furnished the butler was a man who might have been the bodyservant of an evangelical bishop and whose conscience was troubled by the spiritual shortcomings of his right reverend master to come upon so grave and sad a man upon the eve of the derby day was quite a homily in itself through the open door of the diningroom could be seen a cold collation at which men dropped in from abovestairs if they felt so disposed but there were light refreshments in the drawingroom also and a great variety of pleasant drinks the landrails were thirsty folks and imbibed gallons of iced hock and seltzer water but they had not as a rule good appetites there were three tables for whist and one dedicated to piquet or cart all these had massive candlesticks screwed into their woodworkperhaps only to prevent their falling off but it also put a stop to any possible use of them as a weapon or missile and i think that contingency had been also taken into account a candlestick comes uncommonly handy to the fingers when luck has gone pertinaciously against one and the man who has won all the money is personally hateful above all things it was important in that quiet friendly circle to repress all ebullition of temper and to steer clear of all disputes nobody one would hope who was in a position to be admitted to that society would stoop to cheating but a little strap was inserted at the opposite corners of each table for the convenience of marking the score wherein when the counters were once placed they could not he accidentally removed by the elbow persons who are acquainted with the game of whist have informed me that it is sometimes betterin the case of holding two by honours for instanceto be at three than four the spacious roomfor it was a double drawingroomwas by no means brilliantly lit up a couple of bare waxcandles stood upon the refreshmenttable where by the by there was no attendant each man helping himself at pleasure but the other four pair in the room had shades over them which dulled their radiance although it caused them to throw a very bright light upon the tables themselves when the newcomers entered which they did quite unannounced the sight struck one of them at least as a very strange one three shining isles of lightfor one whisttable was not in useamid a sea of gloom ten thoughtful faces with a sort of halo round them and one or two sombre ones standing by like their evil genii and watching the play there was not a sound to be heard at first except the dull fall of the pieces of pasteboard but presently a hand being finished in their neighbourhood a sort of hushed talk began about what would have happened if somebody had underplayed the diamond what are the points whispered derrick in his companions ear what are the points tonight beamish inquired walter of one of the four a very unimpassionedlooking young man who replied with a most unpleasant and ghastly smileas though he had cut his throat a little too high up fives and fifties my gallant captain with the odds in ponies so being a younger son i advise you to go to some other table never mind i am going to make a good marriage returned walter coolly mr beamish had been a penniless government clerk until he wedded the widow of an opulent builder with half a town for her jointure if you are not full added the captain i declare in here for myself and friend all four looked up for an instant at the threatened stranger for your good player intent on gain detests the introduction of an unknown hand somehow or other although the odds are two to one its always his cursed luck to have him for a partner general prim who had been a martinet in the peninsula and as offensive to his fellowcreatures as less favourable circumstances had permitted ever since gave a ferocious grin and shook his single scalplock of gray hair like a malignant pantaloon the hon pink hawthorne attache at the court at christiana but absent from that lively capital upon sickleave wrenched his fair moustache this way and that and frowned as gloomily as his foolish forehead would permit the dealer a mr roberts an ancient bencher of one of the inns of court paused with the trump card in his fingers still unturned does your friend know what the blue peter means lisgard ive been a sailor half my life sir and its devilish odd if i did not returned ralph derrick grimly what the devil did the fellow mean added he to walter as the game began and all the four became at once automatons its the new system of asking for trumps answered walter peevishly the same thing that they called the pilot the other night how ridiculous you have made yourself see theres another table up bless the man not there thats the piquet place ralph had quietly seated himself next to major piccalilli of the irregular cavalry cayenne station upper india and had already disturbed his markingcards whereby that gallant officer was reduced to the verge of apoplexy with speechless rage stay you shall stick to this one continued walter in a low voice that fellow beamish is hateful to meand i will cut in yonder there is not a mufftable in the roomall these beggars play too well with these words the captain hurried away and as soon as the rubber he had been watching was finished derrick was admitted of the conclave to the exclusion of general prim who cursed that circumstance very audibly and for a man of his advanced years with considerable emphasis and vigour derrick fell as a partner to the lot of the gentleman who had inquired as to his proficiency in the art of asking for trumps if you would only hold your cards a little more on the table i should be able to see them myself remarked mr roberts with severity if they look over my hands sir returned derrick reassuringly ill forgive em thats allif you wont take that old gentlemans betsreferring to the general who seemed extremely anxious to back their adversariesthen i will and he did itand luck went with him there was nothing stronger than champagne to be got at in that respectable place of business so ralph kept his head and wona hundred and fifty pounds or so then the table breaking up he rose and stood over his young friend to see how the cards were going with him bad muttered derrick to himself as he watched walter running through his hand with eager haste as a woman flirts her fan his beautiful face was dark with care his eyes flashed impatiently upon the man whose turn it was to lead our odds are in fifties eh lisgard drawled his righthand adversary captain and lieutenant wobegon of the horse guards azure the same as before i suppose returned the young man haughtily ralph gave a prolonged whistle his young friend had a treble up and the others nothing so that he must be betting two hundred and fifty pounds to one hundred and the same as before too within the next minute the cards were thrown down upon the table and the adversaries scored a treble likewise thats been my cursed luck ralph all tonight cried the young man with a little grating laugh four by honours against one every deal you must have been doing something devilish bad lisgard observed the guardsman yes i haveplaying answered walter bitterly but no fellow can play with sixes and sevens it demoralises one so all cards do my grandmother says answered wobegon who for a guardsman was not without humour she made me promise when she paid my debts my first derby that i would never back anything again and i never have except my luck and bills captain lisgard had naturally a keen appreciation of fun but he did not vouchsafe a smile to the facetious guardsman who himself joked like an undertaker and had never been known to laugh in his life the fact was that nothing could just now commend itself to master walter except winning back his money reader did you ever play for more than you can afford pardon me the inquiry there is no occasion to be pharisaical for it is even possible to do worse things than that in your line moreover the question of what is more than you can afford is such a large one and affords such opportunities for a nimble conscience to escape i remember in lord houghtons life of keats that that gallant nobleman in defending the poet from the charge of dissipation and gambling remarks that it all arose from his having lost ten pounds upon a certain evening at cards how considering that the author of hyperion had no income nor any bank except his imagination to apply toand it was notorious that he could never put a cheque even upon thati take his lordship to be a very charitable peer ten pounds must have been for keats a large sum but undoubtedly the matter is one for a man to decide for himself the whole question is relative and if you are apt to lose your temper then remember you play for more than you can afford although your stakes are butpennystamps captain walter lisgard had lost his temper and his money also there was a numbed sense of misfortune pervading him it seemed to him as though he was predestinated to lose i am much mistaken if he had not a sort of humming in his ears one of the most religious men whom it has been my fortune to meet has informed me that in his unregenerate days when he was a gambler and everything else he once prayed to win at cards every sin sir in the decalogue i am glad to say have i committedmeaning that the present change in him was rendered thereby all the more satisfactorywith the sole exception of murder then it strikes me said i in addition to your other backslidings at the time you speak of you were just a trifle blasphemous no sir said he i think not all that i possessed in the world was depending upon the result of a certain game at cart if i had lost it i should have been a beggar if i won it i resolutely resolved never to touch a card againnever to run the risk of experiencing a second time the mental agony i was then undergoing i am not ashamed to confess sir that in such a strait i prayed to win and i did win all i have to say sir replied i is this that it was uncommonly hard upon the other man good resolutions are indeed by no means uncommon among tolerably young persons in positions of pecuniary peril such as that of captain lisgard they vow their candles to this and that patron saint if they should but escape shipwreck upon the green baize this once master walters bid was confined to a few dips if one may use so humble a metaphor of which about fifty went to the pound and even those were not offered in a penitent spirit he would never play whist with the landrails any more he would never lay the long odds beyond coutersa foolish word he and his set used for sovereigns he would never back himself at all when playing with that fool pompushis present partner he would become in short exceedingly wise and prudent if he should only pull off this present rubber there was life in the mussel yet they were at three all when pompus led his knave instead of his ten from ten knave king and only got the trick when he should have got the game we shall never have another chance now sighed walter as his lefthand adversary turned up the queen but privately he thought that fortune would not be quite so cruel as all that came to moreover he had an excellent hand his fingers trembled as he arranged the long suit of clubs headed by tierce major and saw that he had four trumps to bring them in with as the game went on however pompus exhibited his usual feebleness and things began to look very black indeed in the third round of trumps master walters memory left him sudden as an extinguished taper it is sad to have to say it of so excellent a player but he recollected nothing whatever except that if he lost that rubber it would be an addition of three hundred pounds to the sum he already owed captain wobegon it was his turn to play and he was third hand he had the king and ten of trumps the ace had been played ay he remembered that after a struggle and the knave too yes his lefthand adversary had played the knave should he finesse his ten or not that was the question upon the decision of which depended some five hundred pounds whist is not always a game of pleasure master walter finessed the ten thousand devils cried derrick with a tremendous imprecation why the queen was turned up on your left lad you have thrown away the game and it was so walter lisgard did not speak a word but having compared his notebook with that of captain wobegon retired into a little office out of the back drawingroom where the secretary of the landrails entered the members somewhat complicated little accounts with one another in a very businesslikelooking ledger you have had a bad night of it for you sir remarked this gentleman quietly you generally hold your own yes what is the cursed total eighteen hundred ralph derrick said walter lisgard as the two walked up st jamess street towards their lodgings for bath and breakfasts but scarcely for bed since the morning was already far advancedif any horse but menelaus wins the race i am a ruined man chapter vi mr withers withdraws himself when derrick and the captain met at the breakfasttable upon that derby morning there was a note for the latter waiting by his plate it had been brought over from the turf hotel with apologies having been detained there by mistake through everybody being so busy for at least a week as he turned it moodily over without opening it ralph saw that it had the mirk postmark you have a letter from home i see lad lucky dog yes very lucky replied the young man cynically as he ran his eye over the contents worse than my infernal luck of last night and only less than the misfortune i am looking for today is the news in this letter how is that lad well you will hear some dayhere he took the note and slowly tore it lengthways into thin strips and then across so that it lay in a hundred fragmentsbut its a secret at least it was until a week ago but being in a womans hands of course she let it slip and master walter looked as near to ugly as it was possible for his handsome face to go i fancied your folks at home were unaware of your having intended to be at the turf hotel and rather thought you were with your regiment like a good boy the captain returned no answer but derrick who was in excellent spirits notwithstanding the anxieties of the coming day continued to address him in that healthy and cheerful strain which is the most intolerable of all manners to one who is melancholy and what is worse in dread suspense now for my part walter any letter in a womans hand as i think yours isnay you foolish lad if you hadnt stuffed it into your breastpocket so quickly i protest i should have thought it had come from your mother or your sister why you dont mean to say that that pretty little gatekeeper down at mirk writes letters to handsome master walter and why not asked the captain defiantly if it had come from mistress forest then indeed you might have taken upon yourself to object although i understand that even there you have not yet obtained the position of bridegroomelect no returned derrick drily i was about to say that i should have welcomed any letter in a womans hand especially if it began my dearest what the devil do you mean by looking over my letter exclaimed master walter starting up in a fury nothing answered the other purple with laughter and muffin i never dreamed of such a thing but since you said it came from the gatekeepers daughter i thought id make a shot the idea of my wanting to read all the pretty things the little fool writes to a wicked young dog like you its no fun to me to watch a moth at a candle but what a spoiled lad it is why here i have had no letter at all from mirk and yet i am content silence gives consent they say and particularly in this case when i know nothing but your ladymother prevents mary writing my dearest ralph to me indeed if she wrote dear sir i can have no more to do with you it would not have the smallest effect what i have made up my mind to do generally comes to pass where theres a willthat is supposing it is strong enoughthere is most times a way i know youre a devil of a fellow sneered master walter rising and gazing out of window at the bustling street already astir with the derby vehicles but i am afraid your will cant win me this race its done a great deal towards it captain lisgard it brought about the trialrace with the crack although my lord did give himself such cursed airs and not only let you in for a good thing but lent you the money to take advantage of it to the uttermost thats true said walter frankly and holding out his thin white hand i daresay you think me an ungrateful beast but im worried by a matter that you know nothing of besides not another word ladnot another word i am a rude rough creature and i said some unpleasant things myselfhere is our hansom and with lightgreen curtains of gauze im cursed if i go down to epsom with the colours of the king on my cab why the beggar must have done it to insult us stuff and nonsense ralph its only to keep off the dust if you have no curtains you must wear a veil thats all look there in yonder baroucheandfour every man has a green veil on by heaven that wobegons one of em hes got my iou for fifteen hundred pounds in his waistcoatpocket and theres that ugly devil beamish toowell muttered the captain to himself im glad i didnt go with that party at all events master walter who was as popular in town as elsewhere had been asked to take a seat for that day in halfadozen drags and barouches but he had preferred to go alone with derrick not that he enjoyed his companionship but because as i have before said he gathered some comfort from his society under the present cloud of anxiety and apprehension i say walter you are a pretty fellow you forgot all about the provisions but see here cried derrick triumphantly pulling a hamper from under the sofa a pigeonpie a fowl two bottles of champagne and one of brandy what confounded nonsense returned the young man peevishly there are dozens of parties who would have given us lunch the idea of a hamper on the top of a hansom well come you are wrong anyway there lad for i have seen a dozen going by this morning very likely and you have also seen plenty of vans each with a barrel of ale however its of no consequence if the frenchman wins i could eat periwinkles out of a handbarrow with a hairpin and if he loseswhy then i shall not have much appetite look here lad replied derrick gravely this sort of thing wont do never be down on your luck until at all events your luck is down upon you you are not cut out for this work i can see a man ought to be sanguine yet cool hopeful of gainyet quite prepared for loss who goes in for such a stake as you have got upon todays race a gambler should be all brain and no heart let me suggest before we start that you should just take a little brandy no no ejaculated the captain impatiently if i am a funk as you so delicately hint i am not a fool come lets be off the next time i see this room again i shall be a made manor a beggar to any man who risks by betting more than he can conveniently spare the going to the derby is by no means a cheerful expedition whatever his coming home may chance to be and further it may be observed that of all professional persons those who take up the turf as their line in life are the most sombre and unlively many of them are clever fellows enough and one or two are honest men but there is no such thing as fun among them the ring would never take to the snowballing one another as the stockbrokers have been known to do when change was dull they have only a certain grim and cruel humour such as the yankees use the point of which lies always in overreaching one another derrick was right when he said that master walter was not fit for such a calling but the same thing might almost with equal force have been said of himself he was not indeed of an anxious disposition but his temper when once roused was almost demoniacal and he could never stand being cheated now cheating in some form or other is the soul of the turf whenever it is possible to trot in that vast procession down to epsom the appearance of which is so gay and the pace so funereal the largewheeled hansom does it many a pretentious fourinhand did the captain and derrick pass and many a wickedlooking brougham with its high steppingsteeds and the occupants of each had often a word to say about the fellow with the beard that lisgard had picked up and was carrying about with him everywhere for the manly growth that fringed ralph derricks chin was something portentous even in these days of beards and his appearance was rendered still more striking from the fact of his wearing an infinite number of wooden dolls in the band of his hat where louis xi used to stick the images of his patron saints in vain walter had informed him that this was a weakness only indulged in by snobs ralph rejoined but not without an extra tinge of red in his weatherbeaten cheek that being a snob himself it was therefore only natural that he ralph should take pleasure in thus adorning himself he had rather be a snob than a nob by a precious sight he knew that as for making an exhibition of himself if that was really the case it was only right that the public should be advertised of the matter so he purchased a penny trumpet and executed thereon the most discordant flourishes say another word lad added he with cheerful malice and blessed if i dont buy a false nose walter made no further remonstrance he leaned back in the hansom as far he could and as much behind the green gauze curtain until they reached the course when his companion divested himself of the objectionable ornaments and made a present of a live tortoise which he had also acquired on the way to an importunate gipsy woman instead of crossing her palm as requested with a piece of silver they could hear by this time the hum and the roar of the great human sea which surged about the railings in front of the grand stand and in a few minutes more they were within them they pushed their way through the babbling throng towards a certain corner that had been agreed upon and there was mr tite chifney waiting for them with a very pale face indeed nothing wrong with the horse is there cried ralph in a loud and menacing voice which caused not a few sharp eyes to glance cunningly towards them and set not a few sharp ears to listen to what might come next no sir nothing returned the trainer for heavens sake speak low i never saw him looking better in my life we will see him now if you like wheres blanquette continued ralph a little reassured by this as they moved away towards the paddock mr blanquette is not here mr derrick not here why he was to join you the day before yesterday otherwise i would have come myself he has been here sir but hes gone away again what is he not coming back today i hope so sir i most sincerity hope so but the fact isnow take it quietly for its none of my faulthes gone after jack withers in an instant while walter ejaculated a smothered cry of agony and wrath derrick had seized the trainer by the throat you know me sir cried he as i swore to treat that tout on the downs at mirk so will i treat you if that jockey but two bluecoated men had thrust themselves between the strong man and his victim a gentleman in a tightbuttoned frockcoat was coming up too in plain clothes with that swift determined stride peculiar to members of the force and the crowd grew very thick about them and a thousand eyes were being concentrated upon ralphs furious face he knew if his temper was lost now he felt that all was lost with an effort that almost cost him a fit of apoplexyi am sorry said he that i laid my hand upon you mr chifney that will do returned the trainer quietly arranging his neckcloth mr inspector you know me and there is no occasion for your services all right mr chifney but you have got a rummish customer to deal with there replied the guardian of the law stroking his chin and looking at derrick much as a vicepresident of the zoological society might regard a novelty in wild beasts that had been halfpromised to the establishment and then withdrawn i have never been treated thus complained the trainer as the three moved away and the gaping crowd gathered round some other object of attraction and have never deserved such treatment from any employer of mine although i have kept racingstables these thirty years i can make some allowance for one who has so much money on this horse as i know you have mr derrick but i give you my honour and word that i was as astounded as mr blanquette himself when i heard the news that jack had skedaddled he was your own jockey remember not mine no boy in my stables has ever played such a scurvy trick as this have you any boy that can take this scoundrels place asked captain lisgard impatiently i have got as good riders as can be got master walter upon so short a notice and menelaus shall have the pick of them but you know what a devil of a temper the horse has and this withers was the only lad who understood him how comes it that blanquette has gone to look for him asked derrick thoughtfully does he know where he is likely to be found not as i know of sir returned the trainer gravely he said he would bring him back dead or alivethose were his words stop a moment chifney ejaculated ralph i can scarcely find breath to utter even the suspicion of it and the certainty would i verily believe choke me but do you think it possible that all is not quite on the square with blanquette himself well mr derrick id rather not say mr blanquette is as much the owner of the horse as yourself hes my employer tooand nobody ever heard tite chifney breathe a word thousand devils cried derrick stamping his foot so that the print of it was left in the yielding turf is this a time for your senseless scruples i ask you do you think it possible that this manmy pal for years one that has oftentimes faced death in my company and once shared the last scanty meal that stood between us and starvationdo you think it possible i say that this man has sold the race well sir replied mr chifney frankly about victuals eaten under the circumstances you describe of course im no judge but as to friendship and that ive known a son play his own father false upon the turf before now and what an englishman will do in the way of smartness you may take your oath a frenchman will doand a deuced sight worse too moreover since you press this question i may say that your partner has been seen talking with wileylord stonarts agentmore than once and why in the devils name was i not told that was not my business mr derrick you might not have thanked me for interfering with your affairs i thought that you and mr blanquette were one besides to confess the truth i thought it was the king who was being nobbled and since lord stonart has chosen to withdraw his horses from my keepingchiefly by the by through his disgust at that trialrace in which his crack was beateni of course was no longer bound to look after his interests no indeed quite the reverse added the trainer with an offended air did this frenchman say he would be here today if he did not find the boy inquired captain lisgard sharply with an unpleasant look in his fine eyes i can answer that question for him returned the golddigger grimly if he has played me false he will not only not be here he will have put the seaand not the narrow one eitherbetween himself and ralph derrick for he knows me very well but nowhere he drew a long breath and made a motion with his mighty arms as though he would dismiss that matter for the present tempting as it was to dwell uponlet us see the boy that is to take this rascals place we may pull through still with luck chapter vii at epsom have you ever seen at the beginning of a great law case a certain hush and stir among the gentlemen of the long robe and then a young man risenot much over forty that isand inform my lud that his unfortunate client was placed at a sad disadvantage for that through the unexpected but unavoidable absence of his leader the whole case must needs devolve upon his own the juniors shoulders the circumstance is of course most lamentable but still the young counsel if he is worth a guinea fee has a certain confident radiance about him for he feels that his opportunity has come at last and that he has but to grasp the skirts of happy chance to be borne from that moment woolsackwards so was it with mr samuel hicks horsejockey unattached when suddenly called upon to fill the vacant seat of brother withers absent without leave to ride a derby at a moments notice was to one in his position almost what to take the command of the mediterranean squadron would be to a young gentleman at the naval school but not a trace of indecision was visible on the young centaurs countenance i will do my best gentlemen said he modestly then added with the irrepressible assurance of his class and i think i know how to ride you know nothing and are an infernal young fool returned the trainer sharply you never were outside of such a horse as menelaus in your life if he is in a good temper a child might steer him but if he jibsif he stands stockstill in that great race an hour hence as he is as like to do as notwhat will you do then bless my soul sir cried the boy his golden futurenot without mother in a comfortable cottage and easy for life let us hope in the foregroundall swept away by this relentless predictionbless my soul sir i think i should cut his throat i like this fellow cried derrick slapping the lad upon the back look you here is twenty pounds which you may keep in any case and you had better take it now for if you lose the race there will be plenty of folks to want all my money but if you win boy i will make it two hundred and i will make it four added master walter fervently so you see you will be a made man for life remarked the trainer kindly but listen to me sam or else all this glitter will be the merest moonshine be sure never touch your horse with whip or spur for withers i have noticed never did but if the beast jibsi saw jack do this at the trialrace and once beforesnatch at his ear there may be some secret in the way of handling it but there is no time for finding that out do you twist it hard o sir ill twist it off but he shall win returned the jockey plaintively and off he went to don his new owners coloursblack and redas proudly as an ensign to his first battlefield it had got about that there was some hitch about menelaus and the odds were rising rapidly against him and when the large and somewhat ungainly animal took his preparatory canter in front of the stand under the guidance of the uncelebrated hicks they rose still higher if any of his ancient confidence had remained to captain lisgard he could scarcely have resisted the tempting offers that were being roared out in harsh and nasal tones from every quarter of the ring ill lay to against many laws for most of the racing fraternity favoured mr derricks pronunciation of that name ill lay to ill take to i name the winner for the relation between the king and the french horse in the betting was that of buckets in a well i take odds that menelaus is not placed exclaimed a shrill and sneering voice close beside where the two men most interested in that depreciated animal were standing what odds will you take my lord inquired captain lisgard biting his lip in wrath for it was lord stonart who was offering them the man whose confidential agent had been talking with blanquette and to whose machinations it was almost certainly owing that menelaus had lost his rider ah lisgard how are you returned he coolly how came it that i missed you just now in the paddock havent seen you since that morning on mirk down so were going to try that race over again eh i think you were asking for odds my lord about the black horse being placed rejoined the captain pale with passion at the sarcasm that lurked in the others tone yes so i was there has something gone amiss they say with him ill take to in fiftieshundreds if you like dont do it whispered derrick eagerly dont you see what the scoundrel reckons upon if the horse runs straight he will win the race but if he jibs he will be nowhere he is therefore taking odds where he ought to give them you dont take me eh continued his lordship well i think your friend advises you wisely see the horses are moving towards the hill like myself you have no stall i conclude where are you going to place yourself i think i shall remain below here on the green then i shall see the race from the roof my lord answered the captain savagely and thither he and his companion betook themselves accordingly to look down from that elevation upon epsom downs just before the start for the great race is to behold a wondrous spectacle mena quarter of a million or soas black and thick as bees and emitting much such a hum and clangour as attends the swarming of those perilous insects and the carriages twelve deepdwarfed to much the same proportions as those chariots which used to be dragged in public by the industrious fleas but raise your raceglass and with a single sweep you survey every social degree of human life from the duchess to the poor drunken hag on the lookout for empty bottles from the peer to the ragged thief who bides his moment to snatch his booty from his lordships carriageseat this rascals opportunity is coming if there are five minutes in an englishmans life in which he is indifferent to the preservation of his property it is those five which are now at hand when that little jockey rainbow yonder is gathering on the hill thirty of the fleetest horses in the world are about to contend for the greatest prize that horse can win it is not that circumstance however which makes so many hearts go pitapat keeps all lips sealed and rivets every eye except that of the pickpocket and his natural enemy the policeman upon that shifting speck of colour all are aware of the enormous interests that hang upon the result impending even if they have none themselves vague hut gigantic shadows of loss and gain forecast themselves upon every mind in a few seconds more certain unknown scoundrelsfellowcreatures however with whom we have indissoluble sympathieswill be enriched beyond the dreams of avarice and certain other poor devils will be ruined a solemn hush pervades all pandemonium the very organgrinders cease their hateful discord the vendors of racecards give their lungs brief respite the proprietors of aunt sallies intermit their useless cry of three throws a penny and stand on tiptoe with their fasces beneath their arms as eager as my lord who totters insecure erect upon the front seat of his drag nervous folks see all these things because they cannot keep their eyes fixed where they would a sudden roar breaks forth not in the least like human speech but it means that they are off are they off ralph inquires master walter of his companion or is it a lie his small and wellgloved hand is trembling so that his raceglass gives him views like a kaleidoscope splendour or penurynay worse or shame await him and are at the threshold he knows not yet the foot of which it is that draws so nigh and he dares not look forth to see they are not off yet lad returned ralph and even he has to swallow something which appears to be in his throat but is not before he can give that assurance master walter draws a long breath for this is a reprieve and endeavours once more to fix his eyes upon the dancing horses but it is the retina of the mind only which presents its image he beholds his mothers face paler and more careworn than ever sharpened with pain through something which she has learned since theyre off theyre off is again the cry and this time the great plane of faces shifts and flashes as it follows the speck of colour now in rapid motionat first a double line next a lengthening oval and then a string of brilliants knotted here and there as they approach tattenham corner walter perceives for the first time that they are horses and that three are leading all the restgreen black and yellow the chances are then but two to one against him how they lag and crawl these vaunted coursers of the air how long is this frightful suspense to last the yellows beatmica is out of itthe black winsthe favourite is beaten blast himmenelaus winsthere is a thunder of hoofs a flash of black and green then a cry such as even on epsom downs was never before heard by heaven hes off the boy is killed was it short of the post what numbers up the green has won the king the king hurrah hurrah and so the babblement breaks forth again and the tumultuous crowd flows in like water upon the fair green course save one small space of it kept clear by men with staves where lies a poor whitefaced jockey senseless and motionless for whose misfortune everybody is sorry but especially those who have backed the black all had gone well with the french horse until within a few strides of the winningpost he was leading by half a length and his victory seemed certain to all eyes when suddenlywhether through the devilish nature of the beast or whether poor sam had touched him with the heel in that overwhelming crisis can never now be knownbut he stopped stockstill and shot his rider snatching at his ear as he flew by a dozen yards like cricketball from catapult the uncelebrated hicks had actually preceded the rival jockey at the post but left his horse behind him and there the beast was standing yet with his forefeet planted resolutely before him and his untwisted ears laid level with his neck as though he was giving a hack at leapfrog come down and let us get away from this lad broke forth derrick impatiently it is no use waiting here it is no use waiting here echoed the young man mechanically as he followed his friend through the fastthinning crowd down to the basement story at the foot of the staircase they met mr chifney looking very white and disconcerted he too had put more trust than he was wont to place in horses in menelaus and had suffered in consequence and the wily trainer was not used to losses how is the boy inquired derrick bad sir bad it is a bad business altogether muttered the man of horseflesh not perhaps wholly thinking of the boy it was not his fault however continued ralph no man could have kept his seat during such a devils trick look you let him have all he requires everything i will be responsible mr chifney had expected from this stormy client some terrible outbreak of wrath and disappointment and lo he was all benevolence and charity his astonishment exhibited itself significantly enough in his face but ralph mistook the cause why do you stare so sir i suppose i am good for a few pounds yet the horse is mine and i apprehend will be security enough though i wish i could afford to shoot himcursed beast where is lord stonart a great personage has i have heard just sent for him to offer his congratulations ralph derrick uttered a harsh and bitter laugh i suppose we couldnt see this interesting interview eh certainly not sir replied the trainer hurriedly alarmed by derricks tone and air i hope you are not thinking of putting us all in the wrong by any act of violence well no i thought of conferring the honour of knighthood upon his lordship with a horsewhipthats all take him away whispered the trainer to master walter for heavens sake take him home yes home come home ralph repeated the young man like one in a dream ha lisgard how goes it drawled captain wobegon sauntering slowly up to where the three were standing i hope you recouped yourself for last nights misfortunes by the king just now devilish near thing though the frenchman did win by a head but luckily it was the boys and not his own i backed the wrong horse returned master walter gloomily and i owe youhow much is it a little over fourteen hundred if its any convenience to you i can wait a fortnight or so i would say longerbut lurlineshe was inquiring after you only yesterday by the by i felt quite jealoushas a soul above economy and after the derby you know folks send in their bills especially jewellers they know if they are not paid then its a bad lookout what a lot that fellow stonart must have netted im sorry to see you so down in the mouth you used to be such a lucky fellow used to be such a lucky fellow mused master walter as he and his companion made their way to the outskirts of the heath where a place had been appointed at which their hansom was to wait for them yes so i was i used to win in a small way and yet people were always glad to see me they wont be so pleasant i reckon when they find that i am a defaulter i cant get at any money for a year and who ll wait a year without making a row even if they do mine will be a fine coming of age how could i have been such a frightful fool tell your fortune my pretty gentleman observed a gipsy girl laying her walnutcoloured fingers upon the young mans coatsleeve you are born under a lucky star i may have been born there but i have wandered far away from its influence replied master walter shaking her hand off somewhat roughly if you want a shilling you shall have it for i have nothing but other peoples money about me and that one always parts with very readily but dont call me lucky for thats a lie you jade bless your handsome face returned the gipsy humbly its a shame that it ever should be crossed by the shadow of sorrow you cant be unlucky sir with eyes like yoursespecially added she as the two strode hastily away especially among the ladies do you hear that lad laughed derrick encouragingly but the young man was too wrapt up in his own sombre thoughts to heed such things i must sell out muttered he to himself thats the first thing and i must run down to mirk there is no knowing what that spitfire there may do else heres our hansom and the fellow not drunk for a wonder exclaimed derrick wheres the horse man in this next booth sir returned the driver i will put him to in no timei am afraid your honours have not won see walter lad cried derrick in remonstrance thats your fault dont hang out such signals of distress that everybody who meets us offers their confounded pity be a man lad be a man besides what did that gipsy girl say just now many a wise word is spoken in jest she said with your good looks that you must needs he lucky with the women i should like to see the heiress who would say no to captain walter lisgard a good marriage would mend all this and go to the devil exclaimed the young man passionately you are out of temper lad returned the other gravely but dont say those sort of things to me for i have not deserved them not deserved them you have been my ruin curse you continued the other with vehemence but for you you drunken take you care walter lisgard roared the bearded man in a voice of thunder do not make me strike you for i would as soon strike my son how can all this be my fault do you suppose that i have not lost alsoalmost all i have in the world save a few hundreds ay mine i suppose exclaimed walter bitterly i know i owe you a thousand pounds yes returned the other producing his pocketbook here are three ious bearing your signature for two three and five hundred pounds you shall be paid sir never fear rejoined the young man insolently no man but you however would have produced them at such a time but it serves me right for herding with such people thank you young man at the same time few of your fine gentlemen would treat them this way thus saying he tore them into little strips and scattered them to the windall i ask by way of repayment now is that you will listen to a few words i have to say i have loved you walter lisgard in spite of yourself and would have laid down my life for yours i have concealed from my own heart as well as i could the selfish baseness that underlies your every actbut that is over now look you on the coasts where i have come from there is many a bay which if you saw it at high tide you would say what a beautiful harbour what smooth and smiling water this is a place for all men to cast anchor but when the tide is going out you see how you have been deceived here is a reef that would wreck a navy here is a jagged and cruel rock and there another and another with every one you say to yourself surely this is the last but for this and for that there was never a better anchorage and how beautiful the place is what luxuriant foliagewhat exquisite verdure fringes the shorejust the shores you know but when the tide is quite out it is impossible to like the place any longer there are nothing but reefs and rocks to be seen then and a few loathsome reptiles among the slime now walter lisgard i have come upon you at dead lowwater and i dont wish to meet you any more you will deceive others of course who may see you at the flow but you will never deceive me i shall go down to mirk after a little to bring away my wife take my advice and dont be there above all things see that your mother does not cross me in that matter or it will be worse for all concerned i have nobody now in the world who cares for me save mary forest and they shall not rob me of her here is the hansom in which we can no longer sit together you are not used to walking being what is called a gentleman so you had better take it all i ask you is to leave our lodgings before i reach them since you will arrive there first or if noti will take myself off elsewhere i should be sorry to be under the same roof with you again young man then pulling his hat forward upon his brow in place of farewell ralph derrick turned his back upon walter lisgard and took his way to town on foot as the captain sitting alone in no very enviable frame of mind passed him afterwards upon the road he could not help remarking to himself how old and bowed the insolent fellow looked chapter viii miss ayntons thumb is turned back i suppose mary that i shall be sure of getting a letter from mr arthur today observed my lady to her maid as that confidential domestic was proceeding with the dutieswhich were by no means mysteriesof her toilet upon the morning after the picnic at belcomb he is certain to reply concerning a matter which was important enough to cause the use of the telegraph i suppose so my lady very like nothing could be more in contrast than the tones in which these two persons had spoken the question had been earnest almost fervent and one which evidently was put in order to evoke an affirmative answer the reply was given carelessly enough or rather as though the thoughts of her who uttered it were absent from the matter altogether very likely mary why how can it be otherwise just run down and open the letterbag you know where to find the key yes my lady as mary forest left the room she cast at her beloved mistress whose eyes were fixed thoughtfully upon the pattern of the carpet and observed her not a look of unspeakable love and pity and when the door was shut between them she burst into a passion of silent tears it will kill her murmured she she can never survive this second trouble sorrow and shame sorrow and shame are all that fall to my dear mistress now how shall i tell her may heaven give her strength to bear it but i wish for her sake that she was dead and already the angel she deserves to beah you minx ejaculated mary interrupting herself as she passed miss ayntons room and shaking her plump fist at its unconscious tenant youll go to quite another place and serve you right too and seemingly comforted by this reflection she wiped her eyes with the hem of her apron and hurried down the backstairs upon her errand what will arthur think mused my lady as she awaited her maids return with a beating heart he will certainly connect the request to destroy that letter with what i said to him at the watersmeet a while ago aboutshe did not utter the concluding words at all but only formed them with her lipspoor ralph if arthur suspects it will be with him the first step to knowledge and yet he would never use it to my hurt if there were anything amiss in the concealment of this matter then i should fear him for he is the soul of honour but my bastard songod help him if he ever comes to know itrobs nobody even of this barren title and my childrens money is due to no one else they might have been paupers as well as bastards let their mother comfort herself with that thought all she can my ladys lips were crooked into a bitter smile hers was not a cynical facefar from itand such an expression misbecame it sadly it looked more like a contortion of the mouth induced by bodily painwell mary is there no letter from mr arthur no maam none then there is one more cause for anxiety added to the rest of my troubles that is all ah me how foolishly i used to fret myself in days when there was no cause perhaps he never got the telegraph and not understanding why the letter came to him has transmitted it back toto the person to whom it was addressedmary you had better presently run over to the lisgard arms and see to that steve will give it up if you explain to him that it is your handwriting tell him if necessary that i promise him he shall not lose the inn i must have that letter mr arthur could not possibly know the london address ofof that person could he very likely my lady yesat least i dont know mary i beg your pardon madam replied the waitingmaid starting like one aroused from a dream i was not thinking what i said i was thinking of something else i think you might give me your attention mary returned my lady sighing you cannot be thinking of anything so momentous as this matter which involves sorrow shame and perchance utter ruin alas but i can my lady answered the other gravely and i am doing it there has something happened worse than anything you can guess at master walter great heaven has any accident happened to my boy i saw him hut an hour ago he came into my room dear fellow to bid me goodbye before he started for the station the young horse was in the dogcart mary mary do notdo not tell me that my walter is killed he is quite well my lady so far as i knowquite well in health thank heaven for that bless you for that mary why did you frighten me so if there is nothing the matter there is something the matter my lady pray command yourself you will have need of all your fortitude i would never tell it youburdened as you are alreadyonly you must know it you above all and no one else if we can help it more secrets more deception mary spare me if you can dear friend i am sorely tried already i cannot spare you my lady or i would do so heaven knows nay i would almost take the shame upon my own shoulders if that might shield you from the sorrow it must needs bring with it miss letty it is not fit that shame and my daughter should be mentioned in the same breath replied my lady rising and speaking with dignity do not continue i forbid you to speak what you were going to say is false and i will not listen it is true my ladytrue as that the sun is shining now of course miss letty has nothing to do with it but it was through her i learned it does she know it then asked my lady sternly certainly not madam and heaven grant she never may shes as pureminded as any seraph and like charity thinketh no evil but she told me this afternoonseeing that you were troubled and not liking to pain you perhaps without reason and speaking to me as her old nurse and friend who loves all the lisgards good and bad for they are not all good alas alas and who will love them to the endshe told me that something which she had overheard between miss rose and master walter you mean sir richard interposed my lady no madamhis brother it was master walter that i was speaking of the other day in the carriage and whom i understood your ladyship to say that miss aynton had refused i knew very well that they were lovemaking flirting and such like upon the sly but i did not knowi could not suspect o mistress dear a terrible disgrace has befallen you through that infamous young hussy miss rose ayntonthough what master walter could have seen in the jade i am sure passes my comprehension altogether disgrace walter rose aynton what do you mean woman asked my lady angrily you must be mad to say such things i heard sir richard ask the girl to be his wife with my own ears and she refused him did she my lady well im surprised at that for i should have thought she would have stuck at nothingbut let me tell the whole story what miss letty heard at the picnic was this she heard master walter cursing miss rose that was an odd thing for a young gentleman to do to a young ladyalthough for that matter i have no doubt she deserved itwas it not well that was what miss letty thought she had never heard such words before and could scarcely force her innocent lips to repeat them but i made her do it and certainly master walter expressed himself pretty strong it seems he was angered about the young womans behaviour to his brother yesterday ay interrupted my lady quietly and still thinking that the prejudice of her waitingmaid had much exaggerated matters that was partly my fault i begged miss aynton to be more complaisant in her manner to sir richard well master walter might have been annoyed madam but what right had he to be jealous and especially what relation could exist between him and miss rose which justified him in using such dreadful words fancy swearing at her my lady yes that is shocking indeed mary miss letty however must certainly have misunderstood him thats what i told her my lady in hopes to quiet her a bit but i did not believe it myself no more than you do we dont suppose that miss letty invented the oaths do we that is true sighed lady lisgard it makes me very wretched to think that my boy walter should have so far forgotten himself as to use such language to a young girla guest too in his mothers house i shall certainly demand an explanation of it from his own lips alas there is no need madam returned the waitingmaid i can tell you allif you can bear to listen to it i am listening said my lady wearily but she sat with her back towards mistress forest and once in the course of her recital she uttered a piteous moan and covered her face with her hands when miss letty told me what i have just said my lady and had parted from me a little comforted trying to persuade herself that she really might have been mistaken in what she had overheard i instantly sought out anne rees and bade her come with me to my room you wouldnt have believed it in a girl as you yourself chose out of the village school and who has been at the abbey under my own eye for four years but she refused pointblank very respectful i must say but also very firm i durstnt do it said she all of a twitternot till miss rose is abed and asleep or if i do you may be certain sure as she will come to know it and get out of me every word that may pass between us two the girl looked as scared as though she had seen a ghost and yet my request did not seem to come on her at all unexpected and in point of fact she knew what she was wanted for well enough however i thought it best to let her have her way and so it was arranged that she was to come to my room as soon as she had done with the young ladiesalthough tis little enough indeed she has done for miss letty of late weeks but all for that spiteful little hussy miss rose now said i when i got her alone anne rees there is nobody to listen to what we say and you may speak to me as to your own mother ah mistress forest answered she beginning to whimper i only wish i dared this young lady has got you under her thumb i see annie now if youll tell me the whole truth of what is going on between her and master walter i promise you that ill turn her thumb back it will hurt her a littleand that you wont be sorry for perhapsand it will set you free oh mistress forest if you could only do that i would be a good girl all my life and never try on other peoples clothes again nor be a spy upon my lady and here she stopped quite short and looked as though she would have bitten her tongue off now anne said i you must tell me whether you will or not for you have gone too far to turn back how did miss rose aynton make a slave of a wellconducted girl like youwith nothing but vanity that i know of to be said against youand compel you to do all this dirty work for her well mistress forest as you truly say i was always a vain child and heaven has punished me pretty sharp for it one day when the young ladies were out and i was in miss ayntons room asetting it to rights what should i come uponwhere perhaps i had no right to look for it for it was evidentlymeant to be hiddenbut a queershaped leather box with trinkets in it a jewelcase i suppose you mean anne yes maam but they were none of those as miss aynton was in the habit of wearingnor had she that box when she first came she must have brought it down with her after she went back to london for a week in the early part of the year however all as struck me then was the beauty of the jewels and i thought there was no harm in my just trying them on in the front of the swing mirror my ears not being pierced i couldnt fix the earrings although i wouldnt aminded a little pain and they sparkled like morningdew but i clasped on the pearl necklace and the bracelets and stood admiring myself in the lookingglass a good long time then all of a sudden i saw an angry face looking over my shoulder and heard a cruel voice whisper thief thief just like the hiss of a woodsnake i scarcely recognised miss rose who had always looked so pleasant and been such a smoothspoken young lady i could send you to prison anne eees for this continued she very grave and slow and i will too if you dont do everything i tell you i hate a thief lor miss cried i have mercy for heavens sake i never meant to thieve nothing and i hate a liar added she looking so cold and cruel that she made me shudder you break open my drawernot a word you had girl or ill send to dalwynch for a policemanand i actually find my property on your very person you ought to go to jail for this and perhaps i am wrong not to send you there however remember from this moment you are my servantonly mine and whatever i tell you to do whether it is against your late mistress or not see that you do it and dare not to breathe one word of anything that i do or speak or possesssuch as these jewels for instanceor you will rue it bitterly amie rees of course i promised mistress forest for i was in such a state of terror that i would have promised anything but you cannot imagine to what a slavery i bound myself i know all about that anne said i everybody knows youre become a spy and a sneak but there is no occasion for you to follow such vocations any longer my lady would never believe a word of your intending to steal those things i can promise you her protection so make your mind quite easy upon that pointbut now what about master walter well mistress forest the jewels were his present to begin with there have been very wicked goings on it was quite dreadful to see her kiss dear good miss letty at night and return her god bless you so pious like when she was not blessing heri mean miss roseat all oh mistress forest i have known all this for weeks and weeks and dared not speak one word and now the truth is almost too terrible to tell and then my lady pursued mistress forest she told me things which it is not necessary to repeat to you i knew she was telling truth but in order to assure myself that it was so i crept out with naked feet and listened at miss ayntons door and i heard two voices did you recognise them woman are you sure of that asked my lady sternly ah yes madamthere is no doubt heaven help us and forgive us murmured my lady with bowed head ah walter walter i had expected shame but not from deed of yours where is thismiss aynton mary at her breakfast my lady and doubtless making an exceedingly good one she is not one to let her conscience interfere with her appetite bless you like the murderer under sentence in dalwynch jail as i read of in the paper yesterday she takes her meals with regularity i warrant and does not in any way physically deteriorate under the distressing circumstances of her situation send her to me maryin the boudoir yonder said my lady gravely tell her i desire to speak with her very particularly breakfast no alas i feel as though a morsel of food would choke me send her hither at once chapter ix thrust and counterthrust i cannot for my own part at all agree with the depreciatory expressions used by mistress forest with respect to miss rose ayntons personal appearance what master walter could have seen in her c it was easy enough for anybody else to see who was not of her own sex a magnificent figure masses of silken hair that when unbound would ripple almost to her dainty feet and a countenance bright as light and clear as wind and indeed this latter was too keen and sharply cut for my taste the sort of expression which one likes to see in ones lawyer does not so well become the object of our hearts affections of course there was nothing of steel about miss rose except what might have been in her crinoline but i never saw man or woman who gave me so much the idea of being armed cappied she seemed to be equipped in a complete milan suit of proof impregnable invulnerable like le noir fainant in ivanhoe she never attacked anybody although my lady fancied she had recently detected signs of aggression about her and those who knew her best avoided putting the temptation in her way but when she entered her hostesss boudoir by invitation upon that particular morning she looked not only as usual on her guard there was also a certain slumbrous fire in her dark eyes which betokened onslaughtthe initiative of battle my lady herself remarked it not without pity how little is this poor lost creature aware thought she that i know all but she was quite wrong in this miss rose had almost gathered the truth from the trembling fingers and frightened manner of her tiringmaid that morning and the thing had been quite confirmed to her by the malicious triumph with which mary forest had delivered her mistresss request to see her in the boudoir upon very particular business will you please to sit down miss aynton yes it was so the secret was out not even a morning salutation from her friend and hostess and the hand only outstretched to point her out a chair at the other extremity of the room before proceeding with what i have to say began my lady i wish to know whether your aunt is in town i believe so lady lisgard i think she has come back from leamingtonalthough i have not heard from her for the last two days that is well when i hinted yesterday morning that it would be better for you to return to london i was unaware of the necessity for your departure from this roof at onceimmediatelyand for ever indeed not a muscle moved confident in the goodness if not of her cause at least of her milan suit conscious too of the possession of a damascus poniard undreamed of by the foe and admirable for close encounters her right hand nervously opened and shut as though to clutch the handlethat was all you have disgraced this house and me yourself and your sex you lie insolent woman returned the other and judge others by yourself each started to her feet and looked her enemy in the face as she slung these words of flame it is worse than useless girl thus to brazen it out continued my lady attaching no importance to the emphasis the other laid upon her last words outraging not only moral laws but even the rites of hospitality you have intrigued with my own son under my own roof you dare to say so lady lisgard do you it is only for his sake i swear that i do not brand you wanton for that calumny i could do it you know i could although you wear that look of wonder was not that man derrick once your lover ah you wince at that sir robertgood easy manhe knew nothing of course here she stopped for my ladys face was terrible to look upon be silent bad bold girl you shoot your poisoned arrows at a venture and aim nothing home you know not what a wife should behow should you you it is not true that the swan is born to be the only graceful shape of scorn a fair woman unjustly slandered is its rival therein rose aynton cowered before that keen contemptbeneath the dropping of those bitter wordsas though they were sword and fire i will never forgive you this lady lisgard muttered shenever never you you forgive to such as you it would be idle to protest my soul is spotless the man whose name you have soiled by uttering itmy husbandhe in high heaven knows right well that never so much as thought of mine has wronged him vile evilminded girl as false as frail that is sufficient madam almost enough even if i were indeed the thing you take me for here the girl paused to moisten her dry lips and catch her breath of which passion had almost deprived her now look you i was wrong i thought my lady was not so lilypure as the world took her to be and i was wrong i have seen things with my own eyes and through the eyes of others that might well entitle me to say i still believe it i tell you lady lisgard i have proofsor what seemed to me to be so a few minutes backof the charge that has so moved you such as would amply justify my disbelief in your denial but i honestly avow that i was wrong i thank you miss rose aynton for your charity spare your scorn madam it is no charity that moves me nay far from it convinced almost against my will i own by your unsupported assertionyour mre no i have withdrawn an accusation for which i have been patiently preparing evidence this long timenot indeed for your hurt but for my own safety and convenience and hereby confess it baseless and unjust now on your part i do beseech you make amends to me you too have had your seeming proofs of my disgrace you too have heard and seen yourself or through the eyes and ears of others certain add not lost wretched girl interposed my lady deceit to sin all that is left you is to pray to heaven for pardon and to leave that hospitable roof which you have disgraced rose ayntons gipsy face grew drawn and pale she had aimed her blow and missed the weapon in which she had put so much trust had proved utterly good for nothing all her schemes of the last few months were rendered fruitless and the discoveries to which she had attached such vast importance and which she had attained to by such mean arts shewn to be vain and futile and now that she had humiliated herself by owning this and thrown herself at this womans feet she would not extend so much as a fingertip to help her lady lisgard as i hope for heaven cried she in anguish i am innocent of that with which you charge me i am honest as yourself or letty alas you shudder because i dare to compare myself with your pure daughter you think that i soil that name too by uttering it what shall i sayby what shall i swear in order to make you believe me i would to heaven i could believe you rose returned my lady sadly touched in spite of herself by the girls yearning appeal if you could erase this damning blot upon my sons fair name and give me back my walteras i deemed him but an hour agoi would be so grateful girl that you should almost think i loved you you would cried rose with eagerness then added bitterly but no you mean if i could say your son has never pressed his lips to these has never sworn to be mine and mine alone but you would not thank me for merely proving that in this although he did it he was not to blame what not to blame no madamfor even for his sake i cannot longer bear this burden of undeserved shame walter lisgard is my husband we were married weeks ago when i went to london in the spring married married gasped my lady thank god for that far better to deceive me boy than this poor girl i never thought to say i am glad you are my daughterinlaw rose aynton but i do say so now she took both her hands in hers and gazed upon her downcast face now overspread with blushes and tinged for once with genuine tenderness it moves you does it that i am thankful to see the honour of my son preserved at some sacrifice of his prospects how little do you know me girl yet i am glad to move you anyway rose be a kind wife to him i will not blame you for what has happened although i have much cause i must blame him rather who can wonder that you yielded when he said be mine so gentle and so loving as he can be now too i see it all when you refused sir richard in the library you were actually his brothers wife ah heaven you must not remain here longernot a day i shall write to walter nay madammother exclaimed rose beseechingly i pray you let me write i have broken my plighted word and disobeyed my husbands bidding in revealing this to please him i had resolved to defend myself this morning as i best might by returning thrust for thrust without using this shieldmy innocenceat all but your bitter wordsa shower of barbed dartsdrove me behind it he will be very wrath with me indeed madam but far worse if the news comes from you he has much just now to make him anxious too indeed replied my lady hastily how is it then that i have heard nothing of it but i forgot it is you who have his secrets now yes you shall write not i tell him that i am sorrysorry that he should have deceived me above all but that i forgive him freely he knows that however right well he must not come back to mirk until he hears from me and you rose you must join him without delay every member of this household must learn at once that you are walters wife but not till you have gonefor richards sake my ladys thoughts as always were for others even when this great blow had wellnigh stunned her she did not permit herself the luxury of selfish grief she was already busy with schemes for the benefit of her erring boy how to contrive and where to save without prejudice to sir richards interests for that must be now avoided above everything so that a respectable allowance might be meted out to the young couple she could not respect and far less love the girl who had become her walters wife in so clandestine a manner but still she was his wife and therefore in her eyes a something precious then bad as matters were they might have been far worse she had fully expected that they were so and she felt in some sort grateful to accept this product of rashness and deceit in place of downright shame moreover she foresaw in her own mind for ever dwelling on such contingencies that out of this evil a certain good might come in case of that terrible misfortune befalling her compared with which this present sorrow was as the prick of a pins point rose upon her part had certainly cause for congratulation upon the result of this interview although her weapon of offence had failed herand she was genuinely convinced of the groundlessness of her late suspicions concerning lady lisgardshe had found in her motherinlaw a most generous adversary and one certainly far more forgiving than she deserved even the worst of us i conclude are not bad at all times and when my lady as they parted touched her brow with her pale lips and murmured once more be a kind wife to him rose that young woman mustered an honest tear or twoof which articles to do her justice she did not keep like some women a constant supply on hand for social emergencies not until she regained her own room did she begin to think that she had been unnecessarily humble and had weakly suffered herself to be moved by the show of forgiveness and goodwill which my lady had doubtless put on for her own purposes however the confession had been made and upon the whole most satisfactorily got over the thought of which had oppressed her of late more than she cared to own and made her bitter against her motherinlaw as people generally feel towards those whom they are conscious of having wronged and now there was that letter to write to walter which we have seen him peruse with such disfavour at his hotel in town acquainting him with her premature avowal of their common secret and many a line of dexterous excuse she wove and many a line of affectionate pleading only to be torn up and recomposed again and again for there was one person in the world beside herself whom rose loved dearly and yet of whom she stood in deepest awe and he whom she both loved and feared with all the strength of her energetic nature was her husbandwalter lisgard chapter x no letters upon the morning after the interview between rose and lady lisgard the latter again sent down mistress forest for the postbag and was once more disappointed at receiving no news from arthur haldane not only did the interval of twentyfour hours make this matter additionally serious and increase her former apprehensions that he had not received her telegram and might find some means of forwarding derricks letter to himselfsince it had certainly not come back to the lisgard arms but there was a still graver cause for anxiety in the fact that mary forest also received no reply from ralph to that rejection so decidedly yet courteously composed by her mistress with the view of taking away all hope and at the same time of leaving as little sting of anger as was possible lady lisgard would have almost preferred to have received from this man a declaration of open warfarean expressed resolution of carrying away mary as his wife in spite of all obstaclesrather than this menacing no answer contemptuous silence was not at all the natural line for one of his violent character to take if he had decided to treat her waitingwomans letter as final he was more likely in that case to have penned a tornado of invective and bidden both mistress and maid to have gone to the devil it seemed only too probable then that he was determinedas he had threatenedto take no denial and that he would return in person sooner or later to mirk to prosecute his suit my lady made certain preparations for that extremitynay for the worst that could possibly arisechief among which was thecomposition of a very long and carefullyconned epistle to her eldest son that she put by in her desk undated and unsealed so that additions could be made to it at pleasure then she waited in agonies of suspense day after day and yet no letter came for her maid from ralph or for herself from arthur haldane moreover although in her absorbing anxiety about the more serious subject this affected my lady far less than it did rose no communication came from walter in answer to her long and justificatory letter acquainting him with the disclosure of their marriage our readers are aware that this last circumstance was simply due to the fact that it was reposing in the addressbox of the turf hotel until such time as it caught the eye of the overworked waiter and was carried over with apologies to walters lodgings whither he had given orders that anything addressed to him should be conveyed forthwith but he had not particularly expected a letter from that quarteror at all events felt very anxious to get itfor nobody but rose would have written to him to the turf hotel all others at mirk and elsewhere believing him to be at canterbury with his regiment whence all communications were forwarded to him to his london lodgings thus from the very deceit to which she had lent herselfto her peculiar information as to his movementswas this failure of roses letter to reach her husband owing during this protracted interval she suffered agonies of suspense of mortification and even of fear it was wormwood to have to say to her motherinlaw every morning he has not written yet and thereby to confess that walter treated with indifference the embarrassing position in which she was now placed at mirk abbey moreover she surmised that her husband was too much enraged with her disobedience in betraying their secret to write at all his wife knewalthough few others didthat master walter was capable of being put out to a very considerable extent his very marriage with herselfalthough she fortunately did not know thathad been mainly owing to his impatience of opposition and pique against his elder brother doubtless propinquity and opportunities of flirtation with a beautiful and accomplished girl not by any means lavish of her smiles but whose devotion to himself had been almost that of a slave for her master had carried the handsome captain towards the gulf of matrimony but it was the desire to thwart sir richardwho his jealous eye perceived was falling seriously in love with rose long before she saw itwhich was the final cause of his rash act he eagerly snatched at an occasion at once of selfgratification and of humiliating his proud and arrogant brother he was delighted to let him know that neither his wealth nor his title could weigh in the balance of a womans favour against the gifts and graces which it was his habit to depreciate or ignore we have said that he discovered sir richards passion even before the object of it but roses subtle brain was already preoccupied with himself to give that scheming beauty her due i think that even had she not been already walters wife she would not have exchanged him for the baronet at the period when he made her that dazzling offer in the library she felt that she had let slip a splendid prize and was proportionally angry with sir richard whose backwardness and hauteur had prevented her from recognising the possibility of its falling to her lot but the feeling of disappointment was but transient she was a bride of only a few weeks and to get disenchanted of one like walter lisgard is a long process even for a wife by this time however though she idolised him still rose had learned to fear him and absolutely dared not pen another letter to inquire the reason of his silence of those who waited sick at heart for the coming of the postman every morning lady lisgard therefore was the first to lose patience she wrote to arthur haldane a few urgent lines requesting his immediate presence at mirk upon private and particular business and within an hour of their receipt he took the train and appeared in person at the abbey my lady had decided to consult him in preference to his father respecting the arrangements necessary to be made for the future maintenance of walter and his wife since it would be very unwise to make so much importance of the matter concerning derrick about which she was in reality vastly more concerned and burned to know the truth what is the matter ma mre inquired he tenderly when not without the exercise of some addressfor sir richard was always hospitable and especially in the absence of his brother both gracious and attentive to all guestsarthur and my lady had managed to get an hour to themselves in the boudoir you look very pale and anxious yes arthur i have enough to make me so walter has secretly made rose aynton his wife ah you pity me i see and perhaps him also do not condole with me however i have sent for you hither to help me to make the bestalas alas you would not have believed it of my walter would you and my lady touched by the sympathising look and manner of the honest young fellow burst into the first good cry which she had permitted to herself since the calamity had been discovered for when confiding the circumstance to letty it had been her duty to bear up and when alone a still more serious anxiety consumed her even now her emotion though violent was soon over and the indulgence in it seemed to have done her good pardon me arthur said she with one of her old smiles i wont be foolish any more and then after narrating matters with which we are acquainted she laid before him as concisely as she could what funds at her own disposal could be made available to form an income for the young couple in addition to the interest which walters fortune of five thousand pounds or so into the possession of which he would come in some eighteen months would yield she little knew that on that very nightfor it was the eve of the derby daythe unworthy boy for whom she was making such sacrifices was about to risk and lose more than a third of his patrimony and that upon the next day the remainder was doomed to go and much more with it but this will pinch you ma mere reasoned arthur kindly and narrow your own already somewhat scanty revenue sadly sir richard will come into a very fine rentroll in june beside thousands but can we ask him to help walter and his wife and could walter take it even if his brother were generous enough to offer it sir richard is quite capable of such magnanimity ma mere unless i am much mistaken in his character he would not like to see his brothereven were he but a lisgard let alone his so near kith and kinin a position that would be discreditable to the family while if one has really loved a woman one surely does not wish to see her poor and struggling simply because she has preferred some one else as for walters accepting the help which his brother can so well spareit may be a little bitterbut in my opinion that would be far preferable to receiving what would impoverish his mother the arrangements you propose would leave you but three hundred pounds a year yes answered my lady hastily i require that for a purpose else half the sum would easily suffice my present needs it would do nothing of the sort ma mre come let us be reasonable if you will leave this matter in my hands i will endeavour to be the mediator between your sons sir richard has an honest regard for me i think and walter also when he is himself poor walter murmured my lady sighing yes he is to be pitied answered the other drily but also between ourselvesalthough i shall endeavour after my lawyer instincts to make it appear otherwise to his brotherto be somewhat blamed ma mre since then i am prepared under the cloak of arbitrator to be the partisan of your darlingyes they are both your darlings lady lisgard i know but with a difference walter is in trouble urged my lady pitifully yes that is the reason of course however will you put the case unreservedly in my own hands for if so although it is not an easy task i will do my best to make your sons shake hands there is none like you arthur none heaven bless you and reward you there may be none like me ma mere but there are also i hope many people a great deal better and now that we have done with this matter for the present may i ask why letters are directed to another person under care to me which i am at the same time directed by telegram to put behind the fire oh you got that telegram did you said my lady quietly mary forest entreated me so to send it the fact was she accepted that person by letterwhat was his nameof whom we spoke together some time ago at the watersmeet but afterwards persuaded by me acting in accordance with your suggestion you remember she decided to refuse him but the first letter was unfortunately posted before the second was written and the postmistress at dalwynch positively refused to give it up although i drove over there myself to request it well upon my life ma mre but youre a bold woman exclaimed the young lawyer laughing why of course she wouldnt give it up she would be stealing the property of the postmastergeneral if she had done so and you would be the receiver with the guiltiest knowledge well at all events she did not pursued my lady simply she would do nothing beyond directing the envelope afresh to your address honest creature interrupted arthur grimly under these circumstances i telegraphed to you knowing that you would be good enough to destroy the letter directly it reached you yes ma mere and i did so returned arthur gravely but i feared it was not right and now that you have told me this i know that it was wrong you may have had your reasons dear lady lisgard and doubtless very urgent ones to wish the destruction of those letters those letters exclaimed my lady yes i am certain of course that you intended no harm to any one and that what you did was in ignorance of the law but so suspicious was i of your having transgressed itand at the same time perhaps a little annoyed that you should have chosen me lady lisgard for your instrument in such a matterthat i purposely omitted to communicate with you to put in writing any evidence whatsoever of that transaction yes yes said my lady hastily and taking no notice of the young mans evident annoyance but you speak of letters there was only one letter directed to pump court there were two lady lisgard and both addressed in the same handwriting the words turf hotel piccadilly were crossed out also in each case i remember in red ink it was the postmistress who did it i have no doubt if you led her to imagine that that was the wrong address in the one instance she naturally imagined it to be so in the other and probably made the alteration in all good faith great heaven and so it must have been exclaimed my lady clasping her hands o arthur this mischanceif my misconduct does indeed deserve punishment has brought i fear a very harsh and bitter onethat is on mary the second letter should have reached the person to whom it was addressed without fail he will now have heard nothingthis derrick and he will take the womans silence for consent o arthur arthur you little know what bad news this is i can see ma mre that it vexes you answered the young man kindly and that is evil enough for me to know some sorrows are best kept to ones self i think now look you this mr derrick will certainly being a sportingman be in town tomorrow night he will not have left his hotel before the derby is over now i will go and seek him out tomorrow with the letter in my hand that mary shall rewrite we have only but a very little time remember dear arthur counsellor and friend and son in one what comfort do you not give me in all straits she rose and offered him her pale but comely cheek which the young man touched with reverent lips then holding her hand in his he said in a firm voice and now ma mre even that is not fee enough for such an avaricious lawyer as i am i have promised myself a talk with letty do so and heaven bless you my dear boyay bless you both continued my lady when he had left the room for you would take her for your wife even though you knew what i know of her unhappy birth i have almost a mind to tell him but then with his stern notions of what is rightalthough heaven knows i wrong no one by this reticencehe might some sorrows are best kept to ones self i think said he and whether he suspects something amiss and meant the words for my particular ear or not it is sound advice sufficient for the day is the evil thereof if i were always to be thinking of the morrow i should soon go mad chapter xi mr arthur haldane makes himself useful some writers are very fond of describing interviews between betrothed persons and there are undoubtedly readers who take a pleasure in reading such delicate details and yet it seems strange that this should be so with respect to the mre description of what in real life is undoubtedly tame and stupid to the lookeron for what can be duller or more uninteresting except to one another than an engaged couple with what meaningless emphasis they smile what mysterious secrets known to every adult in the company they interchange and how they go blindly feeling after one anothers hands under the table whenever the opportunity offers i think it even profane to mention such tender mysteries arthur haldane and letty lisgard were not indeed a betrothed couple when they met upon the present occasion but they became so before they parted their subject of conversation being the marriage of somebody else it naturally enough strayed to their own i am not a good match for you letty just at present said the young man frankly during a lucid interval but i do not despair of removing the disparity of fortune i am getting on in my profession better than i could have hoped for i dont see why disparity of any sort dear arthur should affect persons who really love one another thats my own sweet letty replied the other relapsing but then your familyno exertions of mine can procure for me such a pedigree as you can boast of that is a matter of genuine congratulation arthur dear richard often makes me wish that there were no such things as ancestors i suppose it is a dreadful heresy but it seems to me so strange that people are not taken for what they are let their birth be what it will my rose of radicals exclaimed the young man with admiration your words deserve to be written in letters of gold and so saying he took out his pocketbook and in spite of her opposition transcribed them then and there of what possible good can that be you dear foolish fellow i cannot say for certain letty answered he gravely but keep a thing long enough and its use will come folks say mr arthur haldane had as we are aware some other interviews awaiting him less agreeable than the one on hand which perhaps may account for his prolonging it to an inordinate length there was no difference of opinion expressed in this one and what is unusual in arguments between the sexes the lady had not the last word at parting strictly speaking neither had it the farewell of each expired almost at the same instant and was not breathed into the ear at all i say almost advisedly and from a desire to be accurate for if each imprints a kiss upon the others cheek they cannot do it quite coincidently and it is certain if the statistics of the matter could be collected that nine engaged couples for of course no couple does it who are not engaged out of every ten do salute one another in that way and not press lip to lip as the poets make out in fact it requires a particular and uniform conformation of noseboth must be snubsto render the thing practicable sir richard whom we have been compelled occasionally to represent in an unfavourable light did not fall short in his interview with arthur haldane of the high estimate which the latter had formed of his chivalric nature or perhaps it was through his overweening pride that could not permit the woman upon whom his affections had once condescended to rest to be inconvenienced by narrow circumstances but actuated by whatever motive his behaviour towards the rash young couple was liberal in the extreme he accepted very willingly the explanation given by the young lawyer with great tact of his refusal by rose aynton no utterance was given to the remark that if he had pressed his suit a little earlier doubtless no thought of his younger brother would have entered the girls brain but the suggestion was somehow or other delicately conveyed and in that gilead there was balm strange as it may appear the object of his rejected suit seemed to have won forgiveness not only for herself but for her husband to whose faults he had heretofore shewn himself so unfraternally alive he certainty did not request arthur to offer his congratulations to the young benedict but he sent by him a conciliatory message and a special request that captain and mrs lisgard would not fail to visit the abbey upon the occasion of the approaching fte the period of his own coming of age would be a very fitting one for the newlymarried pair to introduce themselves to the people of the country while their presence at such a time would evidence that there was no family breach in all this there was doubtless a leaven of selfishness but there was considerable magnanimity also and the manner in which the baronet spoke of rose herself would have done honour to bayard in this matter it must be even conceded that he shewed more nobility of spirit than the ladies of his household his mother had forgiven the girl after a fashion it is true but her feelings towards her were anything but genial ones heart cannot be made to yearn towards a sly and deceitful young person just because she happens to be ones daughterinlaw her pity for walter was great but it did not beget love for her with letty again rose stood even lower or perhaps seemed to do so from the higher eminence which she had previously occupied in the affections of her schoolfriend a young lady who has sworn an eternal friendship does not relish the discovery that the other party to that solemn transaction has been making a fool of her under her own roof for months nay has been systematically deceiving her upon a matter mutual confidences concerning which form the very basis of such compactsnamely the beloved object young men do not encourage one another to communicate their honest lovesecrets although some are boastful enough of their conquests over the sex where there is no pretence of the heart being concerned but with young ladies this sort of information is the most prized of all there is a tacit if not an expressed understanding between female friends that the first genuine attachment formed by either shall at once be revealed to the other the expectation of that tender avowal is what is uppermost in their minds whenever they meet and when it has been made what an endless subject of sympathy does the unconscious swain become between these devoted young persons how the qualities of his mind are canvassed and the colour of his hair how his religious principles are eulogised and also his small feet and how in short the betrothed and her faithful confidante construct a mental and physical ideal for jones out of what they have read of the admirable crichton and the apollo belvedere betty lisgard was as good a girlin my opinionas ever drew breath but she was human and when she kissed rose the first time after she learned she had become her sister it was by no means the impassioned salute which it had used to be nor had her my dear although delivered with emphasis at all the genuine ring as for the other females at the abbey it was fortunate for rose that she had not to apply to them for a character for although mistress forest knew her place better than to circulate scandal miss anne rees no longer restrained by terror of the constabulary indemnified herself for previous reticence by favouring her fellowservants with some very curious details indeed with respect to mrs walter lisgard my ladys proposal that rose should take advantage of mr arthur haldanes escort on the morrow to her aunts house until she should receive her husbands directions as to her future place of abode was i think very generally welcomed and felt to be a relief by the whole house during the long railway journey to town however she made herself agreeable enough to her companion as she was well able to do when so disposed to all his sex the young barrister was prudent and sagacious beyond his years and what he knew of the ladys behaviour did not certainly prepossess him in her favour but nevertheless he was obliged to confess to himself although he omitted to do so to letty that mrs walter lisgard was a very charming person it is undeniable that a married woman may make herself twice as pleasant for any short interval like a railway journey as any single one can do she is not afraid of being considered too forward or of laying herself out to captivate while if you are a bachelor with whose tendresse for any fair one she is acquainted she will take you under her patronage notwithstanding that you may be twice her age and so sympathise with you and identify herself with your absent intended that you are half inclined to squeeze her hand and cover it with kisses mr arthur haldane had much too judicial a mind to give way to any impulse of that kind but it was very nice to hear rose eulogise her darling letty and protest that the man who married her would find himself united with an angel he quite forgot under this soothing treatment that his impression on leaving the abbey was that the two young ladies were not very good friends nor did it occur to him at all that this privilege of matronly talk was being exercised by a bride not two months wedded and whose surreptitious marriage had only been discovered about a week ago when they had reached london and were approaching her aunts residence in the late afternoon they found themselves suddenly in a broad stream of vehicles for the most part furnished with four horses but very unlike the usual spickandspan london equipages being covered with white dust and bearing traces of recent rapid travel i quite forgot it was the derby day exclaimed arthur these are the gentlemen of the road and i daresay your husband is among them rose turned quite pale and leaning back in the cab did not again look out of window until they arrived at her aunts door where the two companions parted very good friends indeed rose gave a little sigh as she thanked him for his escort which wentnot indeed to the young mans heart but a good way too i hope master walter does not illtreat that poor girl soliloquised arthur as he drove away but i am almost certain that she s afraid of him london after the derby is more like pandemonium even than on the night before the winners are wild with joy and inclined for any sort of dissipation the losers also crave for the circean cup that they may temporarily forget their misfortunes with the unusual roar of wheel and hoof in the streets there mixes a still more unusual shouting and from the open windows of places of entertainment there streams forth the tangled talk which is confined within doors at other times before arthur could reach the turf hotel he learned from these sources without further inquiry that the king had won the race in consequence of some mischance having happened to the jockey of menelaus he knew therefore that walter lisgard had lost money still when upon reaching his lodging he first set eyes upon the young dragoon moodily stretched upon the sofa with eyes staring straight before him and a face as pale as the tablecloth on which stood an untasted meal he was astonished and shocked for the momentsuch a rigidity was there about those exquisite featuresarthur thought with a shudder that he was dead even after he entered the room lit only from the glaring street not a limb stirred not a muscle moved to mark any consciousness of his presence but when he exclaimed walter whats the matter man the figure leapt up with a cry of pleasure and took both his hands in his i am glad to see you arthur cried he this is very kind of you and i do not deserve it i thought it was that infernal scoundrel derrick he is not here then no he may have come and gone for all i know for i believe i have been in a sort of nightmare only it was a horse that caused it derricks partneror derrick himself for what i knowsold the race i know what you are going to say that you always told me how it would be no indeed walter interrupted arthur kindly i am not come hither to reproach you i am only the bearer of good news i should like to hear some of that said the other bitterly where is it have you brought a loaded pistol with you that would be the most friendly action you could do me just now i believe walter you should not talk like that answered arthur very gravely for there was a look in his friends eyes which seemed to harmonise only too well with his despairing words when we kill ourselves so philosophically we forget how we wound others by that selfish act think of your mother lad yes she would be sorry would she not it would break her heart walter thats all and besides you have a wife nowyes we all know it and youre both forgivenand why you have not written to her in answer to the letter she wrote you none of us can imagine i only got it this very day groaned walter am i in a fit state to write upon business think you business echoed arthur contemptuously youre in a fit state to take a cab to mayfair and ask your poor wifes pardon i brought her up to her aunts house today myself thats well observed walter reflectively for between you and me arthur haldane well what exclaimed the barrister impatiently why i think shed better stay at her aunts house altogether the fact is ive got no money to keep her we know all about that man the devil you do ejaculated walter grimly then bad news must indeed fly apace look here haldaneive lost everything all that i have at present all that i was to have when i came of age all that i can expect from any human being who is fool enough to leave me anything in time to come i am a beggar and worse than that for i am a defaulter and shall be proclaimed as such in a few days that is the whole state of the case now do you not think that the kindest office which a friend could do me would be to help me with the means of blowing out what would be in another man his brains for not only do i recognise myself a scoundrel but as a senseless dolt and idiot a fool of the first quality and a you must owe then near seven thousand pounds interrupted arthur with something like a groan just about that so far as i have dared to look the thing in the face all lost within twentyfour hoursmost of it within three minutes we must keep this from your mother somehow walter she has been sadly tried and i doubt whether she could bear it she must know it sooner or later man even if she doesnt read it in the papers when your turf gentry do not get paid they make a noise about it you see that being all they can do ive a precious good mind to take myself off to cariboothats where this fellow derrick made his moneythe climates good and with a little capital one may do a good deal why should i not go there and never let them have a penny the law looks upon it as a swindle you know that well enough and it was a swindle by jove come you re a barrister haldane now what do you say about it no walter i cannot advise you to act in that manner and i am sure you did not propose it seriously yourself o no certainly not i was only having a bit of fun rejoined the other bitterly i am just in the humour for joking now and cant resist it thousand devils would you have me go to the workhouse man or where nothing of that sort is at all necessary walter answered the other quietly of course i was not prepared for this very unfortunate position of affairs i had brought news that through i must say the very generous behaviour of your elder brother your income as a married man would in future be a very tolerable one it has been made up to at least double what the interest of the sum you have lost would have produced thus in addition to your pay you would have had about six hundred a year besides whatever your wifes aunt might think proper to allow her your mother on the other hand undertakes if you should scruple to accept this kindness at sir richards hands scruple certainly not ejaculated walter angrily i confess that i did not think my brother would have had so much proper feeling and i am much obliged to him of course but after all he has only done his duty what is three hundred a year out of the lisgard rentroll still he was not obliged to do it observed arthur drily that is true and of course you take the lawyers view of it moreover when he comes to hear of these debts perhaps his serene highness may think proper to withdraw his gracious assistance you do him very wrong walter answered arthur with warmth your trouble makes you say things you ought to be ashamed ofyes ashamed of your brother with all his faults is incapable of committing such an act of cruelty he is quite willing that you should both return to mirk as soon as you please but particularly that you should be present at his coming of age which i am sure you will not fail to be but if you will take my advice you will not make your position known at mirk for as i have said before your mother has had enough to trouble her you must let your sporting friends understand it however and we must make the best arrangements we can for your paying your debts within a year and for the future till something turns up instead of six hundred per annum you must manage to do on three your wife i am sure is a most sensible young lady and will easily perceive the necessity for economy thank you answered the dragoon coldly perhaps you would like to run down to canterbury and choose our lodging for us or do you think we ought to be content to live in barracks i know that there is a great temptation to insult a man when he is down but for giving unpalatable advice in an offensive manner i do not know your equal mr arthur haldane well walter i have said what i thought right and i do not intend to quarrel with you i should wish on the contrary to remain your friend if it were only for your dear mothers sake and somebody elses interrupted the captain with a sneer yes for your sister lettys walter i frankly own that come give us your hand manwell another time then when you are more like yourselfbut before i go i want to find this man derrick for i have a letter for him of importance from mistress forest you had better ask as you go down stairs mr haldane i know nothing about him and with that captain walter lisgard deliberately turned his back upon his visitor and looked gloomily out of the window while his white hand stroked his silken moustaches as though it were a pumicestone and it was his intention to stroke them off arthur made his inquiry of the servant who opened the halldoor to let him out mr derrickif that was the gentleman with the large beardhad come and gone within the last quarter of an hour while he haldane had been talking with the other gentleman up stairs he had called for his bill and paid it and packed his portmanteau and there it was in the passage at the present moment then he must come back for that exclaimed arthur eagerly no he had left directions that it was to be sent on to him in a week or so to some place in the south he had said that he should be walking and therefore would not be there himself for several days he had taken a knapsack with him as for a regular tour he was a strange gentleman altogether arthur haldane stooped down and read the address on the portmanteaumr r derrick coveton then stepped very thoughtfully into the roaring street i dont know exactly why and i certainly have no desire to know muttered the young barrister to himself but of all the bad news i have learned tonight i fear ma mre will consider this the worst why the deuce should this fellow be going to coveton of all places least calculated to attract such a scampish vagabond coveton covetonyes that is the place where my lady came ashore from the wreck of the north star chapter xii the letter from paris it is the morning after the derby day and sir richard who has never had a shilling upon that national event yet reads with interest the prosepoem upon the subject in the times over the breakfasttable and even favours lettywhich is so unusual a piece of graciousness that it almost suggests the idea of making amends for somethingwith extracts from the same aloud he and his sister are alone at the morning meal for my lady as is often the case now has had her tea and dry toast sent up to her in her own room as also a couple of lettersone from arthur haldane and one with the paris postmark and in a foreign hand lord stonart is said to have netted forty thousand pounds just think of that letty yes richard but then think of the poor people that lost it poor people should not bet returned the baronet severely i am sorry for mr chifney since if he had not quarrelled with his lordship the winner would have come out of his stables as it was he very nearly accomplished it with that french horse menclausa success which i should as an englishman have much deplored dear me was not that the horse in which walter was so much interested i am sure i dont know letty i should think my brother had no money to spare for the racecourse under present circumstances he could surely never be such a fool very likely not richard i never said a word about his risking money i only said he was interested ah rejoined the baronet significantly i dare say and then he began to whistle as was not unusual with him when thoroughly displeased presently however recollecting that this was not a sociable sort of thing to do sir richard abruptly observed mamma had a letter from paris this morning and in a foreign hand i wonder who her correspondent is i do not think she has heard from abroad since immediately after our poor fathers death then i remember several of her old french friends wrote to her i hope it is no ill news of any kind for i am getting quite anxious about dear mamma richard ever since christmas last she has seemed to get more and more depressed i have only observed it lately answered the baronet rather stiffly and i am sure we have not far to look for the reasonby the by there was a letter for her from arthur haldane also oh was there said letty carelessly but turning a lively pink then after a short pause during which the baronet resumed his paper if you will not have another cup of coffee richard i think i will go up and see mamma at that moment the door opened and my lady herself entered the room her cheeks were ashy pale but her eyes were beaming with excitement and the hand in which she held an open letter trembled as she spoke oh i have got such good news richard what from arthur cried letty ah i thought he would arrange everything as it should be sir richard frowned and seemed about to speak but did not do so yes i have heard from arthur too said my lady and very satisfactorily although perhaps there may be matters which may require my presence in town for a day or two you may always command my services mother i can start at five minutes notice said sir richard gravely no my dear hoy if i have to go at allwhich is not certaini shall certainly go alone or rather with nobody but mary you will be full of preparations for your fte i know for one only comes of age once in ones lifetime and besides to tell you the truth you would be of no use at all here she kissed him tenderly and pushed her fingers through his brown curls lingeringly as though she was already wishing him farewell but the good news i speak of is a much more selfish affair than you dream of i have had a letter from my dear old friend madame de castellan who used to be so good to me when i was no older than you letty at dijon i remember her said sir richard she came to stay at the abbey when i was about nine did she not and took such a fancy to dear old belcomb she said that she and i would marry so soon as i got old enough and set up an establishment in the little cottage a charming old lady with snowwhite hair but a slight deficiency of teeth just so answered my lady she always vowed she would have nothing false about her as long as she lived and she is alive now and apparently very hearty but she has had some money losses as well as certain domestic misfortunes which induce her to seek an entire change of life it is a most singular thing that you should have recollected her passion for belcomb for it is about that very place that she has written she wishes to know whether she could be our tenant there at all events for the summer the matter is in your hands richard or will be so in a week or two but i confess i should like to have her for a neighbour exceedingly then by all means write and say come cried the baronet and why not let her have belcomb rent free i dare say she would not mind our having our picnics there occasionally and it is really no loss to me for i dont believe anybody but herself would dream of taking it except in the shooting season then that is arranged answered my lady joyfully i am to write by return of post she says and if the letter says yes that then we may expect her any day she will bring her own french maid and i will drive over today and arrange about old rachel and her husband who of course must be no losers if they have to leave that must be madames own affair if she is really to have the place for nothing see how affectionately the dear old lady writes and what a capital hand considering her advanced age yes indeed said sir richard elevating his eyebrows only to say the truth i am not good at french manuscript although a master of that language when in printed books interrupted letty well the fact is they didnt teach that sort of thing at eton in my time answered the baronet frankly or at all events they didnt teach me however french is not so bad as german that i will say one can pronounce it without speaking from the pit of ones stomach yes one canafter a fashion laughed letty a little scornfully but her elder brother seemed resolved to take all her bantering in good part that morning as the imperial lion will sometimes tolerate the gambols of a companion kitten i dont think however she continued madame de castellan who comes from paris will quite understand you richardhow nicely she speaks of mary mamma why how comes she to know so much about her why when i went to dijon before my marriage mary forest went with me you know and remained there several years ah yes of course i had forgotten and when we were at thethe college continued my lady with a slight tinge of colour madame took pity upon us both being foreigners and was kind to us beyond all measure many a happy day have we passed in her pretty chateau together and indeed i think i owe my parisian pronunciationof which you seem to make so much lettyat least as much to madame de castellan as to my paid teachers she never could speak english if you remember richard everything she addressed to you had to be translated dear me answered the baronet hastily i dont like that i hope she has learned english since then it places one in a very humiliating position to be talked to in a language one does not understand unless you can treat the person as a savage which to say the truth i always feel inclined to do well richard said my lady smiling if i am not at your elbow when madame de castellan calls there will be always letty here who is cunning in such tonguefence to protect you but as a matter of fact we shall see my poor old friend but very seldom she is a good deal broken i fear by time and still more by troublehere my ladys own voice began to quaver a littleand all she seems to desire is quiet and seclusion before her day of rest at last shall dawn she will be very welcome answered sir richard tenderly i hope that you will cause everything for her comfort to be looked to at belcomb and i will again repeat my orders to rinkel that the place is to be kept quite free from trespassers he rose and kissed his mother then as he left the room delayed with his fingers on the doorhandle saying have walter andand his wife consented to be present at my coming of age certainly dear richard they will both be very pleased to comenay arthur thinks that they may return to the abbey immediately it is scarcely worth while for them to take a house or rather lodgings at canterbury since they are to be here so soon walter has leave now it seems and there will be no difficulty in getting it prolonged almost indefinitely he can do anything he likes with his colonel you know as indeed exactly interrupted sir richard drily then i suppose they will be back in a few days and with that he placed the door between himself and the threatened eulogy upon master walter was there any particular message for me mamma inquired letty demurely from walter no dear he sent his love to us all but of course he feels a little embarrassed and perhaps scarcely understands that he has been forgiven oh i forgot you meant was there any particular message from arthur haldane you exacting little puss why he only left us yesterday morning but dont be vexed my darling you have won the love of a man who knows your worth almost as well as i do he may not be so brilliant or so handsome as our darling walterand indeed who isbut i must say he has shewn much better taste in choosing a wife he has both wisdom and goodness my darling child and i firmly believe your future happiness is assured yes dearest mother i do believe it buthere lettys eyes began not only to sparkle but to distil pearls and diamonds in the most lavish and apparently uncalledfor profusion why what is the matter now my love inquired my lady nothing mammanothing at least that i should have thought it worth while to tell you had i not been overcome by your kind words i know you have got troubles enough of your own i did not mean to tell you indeed i did not i tried to forget it myself only last night after you had gone to bed richard sat up with me talking about his future and it seems he has made some plan for mine he spoke of mr charles vane as a person he would like to have for a brotherinlaw he bade me be particularly civil to him at the coming fte and when i said that i did not very much care about mr vaneand in fact that i had already o mamma richard said some very cruel things he reminded me that one member of the family had already made a disreputable marriage that was an ungenerous speech and very unlike my richard interposed my lady with emphasis why he would have married rose himself so i have sometimes thought replied letty simply but to do him justice i think he was referring to the clandestine character of the marriage rather than to the match itself however when he used the word disreputable in connection with arthur haldane he made me very angry i own i told him that arthur was worth all the vanes that had ever been born whether there might have been nineteen generations of them as he boasted or a hundred and ninety and i am afraid dear mamma that i snapped my fingers and said i did not care that when he accused dearest arthur of not having a greatgrandfather at all events richard stalked out of the drawingroom vastly offended and although he has been endeavouring to be extra civil to me this morning i know that it is only that he may again introduce the very objectionable subject of mr charles vane and when i say no with decision as of course i shall do i fear that he may take it upon himself to write to arthur and then dearest mother the haldanes are so proud you know that i dont know what may happen strange as it may seem there had flitted across my ladys face during this recital a look of something like relieffor it surely could not have been satisfactionbut it speedily gave place to that expression of distress that had become only too habitual to her once serene and comely features perhaps accustomed to mischance as she now was she had expected even more unwelcome news and had felt momentarily thankful matters were no worse but now all was gloom again you were quite right to tell me this letty even though it does give me a new cause for grief if i know arthur haldane he will not desert his betrothed wife on account of any slight that may be put upon him by any other human being you may be quite at ease about that i am very sure but these dissensions and disagreements among my own childreni know it is not your fault dear lettybut i feel that i cannot bear up under them you will not have me with you here much longer o mammadear dear mamma how selfish it was of me thus to afflict you further but dont dont talk like that what should we do without youyou the sole bond that unites your boys together and i o mother what would become of me you dont know how i love you yes darling i do you are tenderhearted as you are dutiful and my boys to do them justice they love me too but they are wearing me into my grave at least i feel it would be far better if i were lying there o mamma mamma sighed letty covering my ladys tearful face with kisses you will break my heart if you talk so you will have somebody better able totake care of you even than i dear child when i am gone and i will see that it is so yes i will leave directions behind meyou will find them in my desk letty remember this should anything happen to meabout that matter as well as other things richard will respect my wishes in such a case i know and will offer no opposition but dearest mother do you feel ill cried letty in an agony that you talk of such things as these let us send for the doctor from dalwynch how i wish that arthurs father could be prevailed on to come and see you o mamma i would rather die than you although i am sure i am not half so fit for death dear child dear child sobbed my lady it will be a bitter parting indeed for both of uswhen the time comes perhaps it may not be so near at hand as i feared in the meantime rest assured love that if i feel a doctor can do me any good he shall be sent for at once but it is the mind and not the body which has need of medicinethere dry your eyes and let us hope for the best you will drive over with me this afternoon will you not to belcomb there is no time to lose in getting things ready there for our new tenant end of vol ii

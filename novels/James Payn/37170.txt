prefatory in these days when every man and woman becomes an author upon the least provocation it is not necessary to make an apology for appearing in print perhaps there was always something affected in those prefatorial justifications although they did disclaim any literary merit it is probable that the writers would have been indignant enough had the critics taken them at their word and perhaps the publication was not entirely owing to the warmlyexpressed wishes of numerous friends but at all events we have done with all such excuses now not to have written anything for the press is no small claim to being an original neither sex nor age seems to exempt from the universal passion of authorship my niece jessie iaetati sixteen writes heartrending narratives for the liliputian magazine her brother whom i have always looked upon as a violent healthy hobbledehoy whose highest virtue was endurance and whose darkest experience was skittles produces the most thrilling romances for the home companion even my housekeeper makes no secret of forwarding her most admired recipes to the family intelligencer while my stableboy it is well known is a prominent poetical contributor to the turf times having also the gift of prophecy with reference to the winner of all the racing events of any importance and yet i believe my household is not more addicted to publication than those of my neighbours what becomes of authors by profession in such a state of things literary as this i shudder to think i feel it almost a sin to add one more to the long list of competitors with whom they have to struggle but still if i do not now set down the story which i have in my mind i am certain that sooner or later my nephew will do so for me and very likely spoil it in the telling he writes in a snappy jerky pyrotechnic way which they tell me is now popular but which is not suited to my oldfashioned taste and although he dare not make at present what he calls copy of the stories with which i am perhaps too much accustomed to regale his ears he keeps a notebook and a new terror is added to death from that circumstance when i am gone he will publish my best things under some such title as afterdinner tales i feel certain and they will appear at the railway bookstalls in a yellow cover bordered with red or with even a frontispiece displaying a counterfeit and libellous presentment of his departed relative in the very act of narration the gem of that collection would undoubtedly be the story which i am now about to anticipate the young gentleman by relating myself if i am somewhat oldworld in my style perhaps it may be forgiven me in consideration of the reality of the circumstances narrated and the very strong interest which i do not doubt they will arouse it is not necessary to state the exact locality where they occurred nor the number of years which have elapsed since their occurrence it is enough to premise that what i tell is true and that some of the principal personages in thewell the melodrama if you willare yet alive and will peruse these words before they meet the public eye if nothing therein offends ithemi therefore it need not upon the score of indiscreet revelation at least offend my readers chapter i giant despair in a midland county not as yet scarred by factories there stands a village called fairburn which at the time i knew it firstmany many years agohad for its squire its lord its despot one sir massingberd heath its rector at that date was the rev matthew long and at the rectory when my story commences there was in pupilage to the said rector a youth one peter meredith who has since grown up to be the present writer when we are small all things seem vast to our young minds good men are saints and evil ones are demons i loved mr long therefore although he was my tutor and oh how i feared and hated sir massingberd it was not however my boyhood alone that caused me to hold this man as a monster of iniquity it was the opinion which the whole county entertained of him more or less the people of fairburn trembled before him as a ships company before some cruel captain of fifteen years backi mean of fifteen years before the period of which i write pressgangs had not very long ceased to do their cruel mission there were old men in our village who had served their time in his majestys ships very much against their will there were gaps in poor families still which might or might not be filled up empty chairs that had so stood for a score of years perhaps waiting for still expected occupiers fathers of families or the props of families in sons and brothers had been spirited away from fairburn even a little while ago and had not come back again yet they had been poachers or radicals or sectaries as dissenters were then called or something else distasteful to sir massingberds father and they had been carried off to sea at his command let not my young readers imagine that i am exaggerating matters i write of a state of things of which they have not the remotest conception but which i remember perfectly well they have reason to thank heaven that they did not live in those times if they happen to belong to those unprosperous classes which were then termed collectively the mob there were no such things as skilled workmen or respectable artisans in those days the people were the great unwashed to build a crystal palace for such as they were held to be would have seemed to be the height of folly they would have taken no other pleasure in it than to smash every pane with brickbatsfor were they not the dangerous classes such opinions were beginning to die out indeed but they were held still by many great people and sir massingberd heath was one of them reared in a clergymans family and a clergyman myself i have been a conservative in politics all my life and in that belief i shall die but rank and power are no excuse with me for evil deeds in the chamber of my nephew john who takes in everything as the phrase goes i once discovered a democratic magazine edited by a gentleman whose surname i forget but who had a great multitude of initials all the poor people described in this work were pious and moral and all the rich people were infidel and profligate but for the noblemenand there were a good many persons of high rank in the various storieswere reserved all the choicest invectives and most superlative abuse nothing of course can be more unfair than this treatment of a class of persons who considering their temptations are really more than respectable as a general rule the portraits were extravagantly malicious but they had this attraction for methey were all exceedingly like sir massingberd heath he was the very type of that bloated aristocracy that is held up in scarecrow fashion by republican writers there were not many living specimens to be met with even at the date of my tale and the old baronet perhaps himself perceiving that he was one of the last of them determined that he should not be the least in infamy like the unjust judge he neither feared god nor regarded man and worse than he he would not perform a good action on account of the importunity of any person she must have been a brave woman who importuned sir massingberd heath and could scarcely have been brought up in fairburn whether george iv was king or not at the period of which i write it matters not for his connection with our squire had terminated years before but at one time they had been fast very fast friends when a king and a baronet run a race of extravagance the king generally wins and so it had been in this case his majesty or rather his royal highness the regent had idistancedi sir massingberd and they were not now upon even speaking terms friendships of this sort do not last when one of the parties has spent all his money what was the use of a poor man at whites who could only look on while his old friends played whist for one hundred pound points and five hundred pounds upon the rubber what businesslet alone pleasurecould one have in london when howard and gribbs would not lend one fifty pounds even at fifty per cent sir massingberd had left that gay wicked world for good that is to say for ever and was obliged to live at his beautiful countryseat in spite of himself he was irretrievably ruined so far as his court prospects were concerned for he had no ready money he owned all fairburn and many hundreds of rich acres about it beside the park and the river he had the great tithes of the place and manorial rights which he exercised too innumerable nobody quite knewhe did not know himselfwhat privileges he had or had not what pathways he could close at pleasure what heriots he could demand or what precise property he had in fairburn gravelpits but in all cases he gave himself the benefit of the doubt it was a very foolish thing to leave any disputed point to the sense of justice or the good feeling of our squire and yet this was generally done where it was not done where some honest fellow had ventured to oppose his high prerogative even though he gained his end he was always as the village people said paid out for it i dont mean to say sir massingberd murdered himalthough he would have done that i am confident without the slightest scruple if it could have been effected with safety to himselfbut he took his revenge of him sooner or later in a very simple way he caught his children trespassinghaving caused them to be enticed upon his landand committed them to prison or he broke down his fences and spoiled his corn in the night for he had dependents devoted to his wicked will and upon whose false witness he could always rely and yet with all this power the baronet as i have said was a poor man he had borrowed all the money he could and was even said to have overreached the london jews in these transactions and it was all goneabsolutely all it was seldom that this great lord of acres had a tenpound note in his pocket for his house and land were all entailed upon his nephew marmaduke and he had only a lifeinterest in anything poverty perhaps made him bitterer and more savage than he would otherwise have been but for my part i cannot imagine him to have been agreeable under any circumstances i have heard however that at carlton house he was once the first favouriteafter brummelland that of course made him sought after by many people he had a wicked wit which was doubtless acceptable in some circles and his tongue it may be was not quite so coarse in those days of prosperity he took a delight in his old age in retailing his infamous experiences before women if possible and if not before clergymen or boys i remember to have heard of mr long once venturing to reprove his squire upon an occasion of this very kind the rector had been dining at the hallan exceptional occurrence and under exceptional circumstanceswhen after dinner the host began one of his disgraceful reminiscences whereupon my tutor rose and said sir massingberd you should be ashamed to talk of such matters to me but before this boy it is infamous i thank you for your hospitality but i shall go home very well go and be hanged replied the baronet and marmaduke and i will make a jolly night of it marmaduke heath was mr longs pupil as well as myself and he resided with his uncle at the hall he would very much rather have retired with his tutor on that occasion and indeed have resided at the rectory for he dreaded his relative beyond measure all the pretended frankness with which the old man sometimes treated the boy was unable to hide the hate with which sir massingberd really regarded him but for this heirpresumptive to the entail this milkandwater lad of seventeen the baronet might raise money to any extent nay sell all fairburn if he chose and so might once more take his rightful station in the world rejoin the fourinhand club and demand his revenge from my lord thanet at ecarte he could still drink for the cellars of fairburn hall were wellnigh inexhaustible but if that chit of a lad was but carried off he might have the best in the land to drink with him it is true that a ruined man in sir massingberds position can still afford a good table game is plentiful with him and fish and he grows his own mutton and venison so that neither himself nor his friends need starve but servants must be maintained to wait upon these and a great countryhouse without a carriage is as a lobster without a claw consequently except in the shootingseason there were no guests at fairburn hall the folks that did come were men of a certain stamp current indeed in good society but only in that of males a real lady had not set foot in the park far less the house for the last twelve years the manner in which sir massingberd lived forbade such a thing a few bachelors of the county hunt and halfadozen roues from town were all the company that could be enticed to fairburn in september and october all the rest of the year the grass grew in the avenue untouched by wheel or hoof and even sprang up among the stone steps that led to the frontdoor somehow or other i never saw it thus without thinking of the parable of the sower and the seed with some distant and uncharitable reference to our squire i wondered whether it was possible that in any farback time any good seed of any sort had found its way into the crannies of his stony heart and if so what had become of it i used to try and picture that violent wicked man as a child in his cot or saying his prayers at his mothers knee i believe she had died soon after her marriage and that short as her wedded life had been it was a very unhappy one fairburn hall had never been a house for tender honest women the heaths who are celebrated like another noble race of the same sort for their hard hearts and excellent digestions had never been good husbands fortunately daughters were rare in the family how sir massingberd would have brought up a daughter i shudder to think one son had been the sole offspring vouchsafed to the baronets of this line for many generations except the last and in the present case there was no such direct heir some said sir massingberd had married secretly but was separated from his wife and some said he had not but it seemed somehow certain that with him the immediate succession from father to son would cease his brother gilbert had married young in italy and had died in that country within the same year his widow had brought his posthumous child when a few months old to the hall at the invitation of sir massingberd and had remained there for some time the villagers still spoke of the dark foreign lady as being the most beautiful creature they had ever beheld the park keepers used to come upon her in solitary glades singing sweetly but ah so sorrowfully to her child in a tongue that they did not understand the baronet himself was absent not yet cast out of the court whirlpool and the lonely vastness of the place was not displeasing to the young widow wishing perhaps to be left undisturbed with her grief but after sir massingberd came down she remained but a very few days it was said that she fled with her babe in a winters night and that her little footprints were traced in the snow to the crossroads where the mail went by by which she had arrived she was not rich and had come down in a manner quite different from that of her brotherinlaw who broken and ruined though he was had posted with four horses that was how all gentlefolks of the county travelled in those days even the very barristers on circuit indulged and were obliged to do so in a chaise and a pair the mother of marmaduke heath however who was heirpresumptive to the largest landed property in midshire was very poor whether the late baronet had omitted to make a proper provision for his younger son or whether gilbert had made away with it after the usual manner of the heaths i do not know but his widow and child betook themselves into devonshireselected perhaps from its climate approaching nearer than any other part of england to that of her native landand there lived in a very humble fashion how marmaduke ever got into his uncles hands i never could clearly understand his mother had died suddenly whereupon the family lawyer mr clint of russell square who had the entire management of the heath property had in the first instance taken possession of the lad but sir massingberd had claimed his right to be the guardian of his nephew and it could not be disallowed such were mainly the circumstances i believe but all sorts of stories were in circulation concerning giant despair as the savage old baronet was called and his nephew the general opinion agreeing only upon one pointthat no sane person would change places with master marmaduke heath at doubting castle notwithstanding the greatness of his expectations chapter ii my first interview my own history has little or nothing to do with the present narrative and therefore i will not allude to it except where it is absolutely necessary suffice it to say that my parents were in india and that for many years fairburn rectory was my home i had no vacations in the sense that the word is generally understood to mean i had nowhere else to go to nor did i wish to go anywhere no father could have been kinder or have done his duty better by me than did mr long how poor marmaduke used to envy me my wardship to that good man i well remember the first day i came to fairburn it was early summer its great woods were in all their glory and to me fresh from shipboard and the vast waste of sea the place seemed a bower of bliss first the grey old church tower upon the hill and then the turrets of the hall halfhidden in oak and last the lowroofed blossomentangled cottage where i found so bright a welcomethat was the order in which fairburn was introduced to visitors from town the church and the hall and the rectory all lay together the churchyard dark with yews encroached upon the rectory garden and that bright spot so trimly kept that one was moved to pick up a fallen leaf if such were on its lawn sloped down into the heart of the park a light iron railing with wires to prevent the hares and rabbits from entering in and nibbling the flowers alone divided the great mans land from mr longs trim demesne the deer came up and pushed their velvet horns against it in copse and fern twinkled the innumerable ear and tail i had never seen such animals before and they delighted me hugely after dinner on the very day that i arrived i fed them through the rails and they ate the bread from my open hand they take you for marmaduke said mr long smiling for otherwise they would be shy of a stranger and who is marmaduke sir he is your fellow pupil and i make no doubt will be your friend i wish that he was resident with me like yourself but his uncle who lives at the hall yonder will not part with him he reads with me morning and afternoon however does he like reading sir inquired i with hesitation for i for my part did not my education such as it was had been fitful incomplete and in a word indian and i had come back much older than most european boys have to come home a sad dunce yes marmaduke is very fond of reading pursued my tutor that is reading of a certain sort he always does his work well with me so i must not be hard on him but he is certainly too fond of novels and yonder he comes see with a book in his hand even as he walks my tutor pointed to the park and there coming slowly down a long broad ride with his eyes fixed upon a volume he held in his hand was a youth of seventeen years old or so which was about my own age as he came nearer i began to see why the deer had mistaken me for him not indeed because he was very handsome which was not at all the case with me but inasmuch as his complexion was as olive as my own why he has been to india too whispered i to my tutor rather disappointed than otherwise for i had had enough of indian playmates and to spare no returned he in the same low voice his mother was an italian then he introduced us and i began to hang my head and play with the buttons of my waistcoat as is the graceful manner of hobbledehoys upon such a ceremony but marmaduke completely selfpossessed asked about my journey and particularly what i had seen at sea he knew so much about sharks and porpoises that i thought he must have made some long voyage himself but he told me that such was not the case though i should like to go to sea of all things said he and i would cruise about that capewhats its nameuntil i met with the flying dutchman that is the vessel which i wish to see i have never heard of her said i proud of that nautical use of the feminine is she one of the companys ships at this my tutor began to rub his hands and chuckle inwardly as was his wont when vastly amused but perceiving that the colour came into my cheeks he laid his hand upon my shoulder kindly and said that he was glad to find imyi head at least was not stuck full of foolish stories as some peoples heads were while marmaduke without triumphing in the least over my ignorance explained to me all about that phantom ship which glides full sail upon the astonished voyager and passes through his vessel without shock or noise he told the tale exactly as if he had heard it straight from the lips of an eyewitness and believed it himself he never laughed and if he smiled he seemed to be sorry that he had done so directly afterwards some melancholy thought appeared to occupy his mind at all times and if a bright fancy crossed it it was but for an instant like lightning through the cloud i am not describing an interesting youth after the manner of romancewriters no secret sorrow obscured the young existence of marmaduke heath but simply as i subsequently discovered vulgar abject terror his whole being was oppressed by reason of one man the shadow of sir massingberd cast itself over him alike when he went out from his hated presence and when he was about to return to it he was never free from its nightmare influencenever his passion for reading was not so much a love of books as a desire to escape in them from the circumstances of his actual life if he ever forgot him in earnest talkand he was the most earnest talker as a boy i ever knewthe mention of his uncles name was a medusas head to turn him into stony silence on the instant if marmaduke heath could only have got away from fairburn hall when i first knew him his mind might have regained its natural vigour and elasticity but as it was it grew more sombre and morbid every day his hungry intellect was nourished upon what associations happened to be at hand and they were very unhealthy food the wickedness of sir massingberd was of course sufficiently present to him like some hateful picture hung at a beds foot which the eyes of a sleepless man cannot avoid while every tongue about the hall was ready to tell him of the evil deeds of his forefathers at first i thought my young friends constant allusion to his family was the result of aristocratic pride although indeed there was nothing to be proud of in what he told me but very much the reverse but i soon found that this was not the case the history of the heaths was what interested him most of all histories and he favoured me with extracts from it solely upon that account as for the fact of their noble blood running in his own veins he would i am confident have far rather been the son of mrs myrtle the kind old housekeeper at the rectory we are a doomed race peter he once said to me not long after we had made friendship with one another generation after generation of us have sinned and sinned the corsicans have their family feuds transmitted to them but they are hostile only to their fellow men the heaths have ever fought against heaven itself each successor to the title seems to have said like the descendants of tubal cain we will not hear we will not know the god that was our fathers foe there is the church said he pointing to that glorious pile which at fairburn was almost a cathedral in magnitude and beauty and there is the hall they are antagonistic they are devoted to opposite purposes i tell you yes our family residence is consecrated to the devil i am afraid i could not help laughing at this singular notion nay cried he looking round him furtively but you shall see that it is so we were in the rectory garden which communicated with the churchyard by a wicket he led the way into it and in a distant corner upon the north side of the chancel he showed me a sombre buryingground separated from the rest of the gods acre and imprisoned in dark purgatorial rails do you know why we are all put there asked he instead of with the otherchristianfolks you are too proud to lie with the poor perhaps returned i who had still that idea in my mind with regard to marmaduke himself no said he it is not thatit is because the heaths will not be buried in consecrated ground but you have a family vault underneath the chancel have you not yes but it is not snug lying none of us have been put there since old sir hugh in queen annes time when they opened the vault for him they found his fathers coffin with its plate to the ground it had turned over the witty parson would have it that it was only natural that it should have done so since its tenant during life had fought alternately for parliament and king and was addicted to changing sides bat when sir hughs successor demanded lodging in the place in his turn they found sir hughs coffin had turned over likewise the circumstance so terrified the dead mans heirwho had not been on the best terms with him during life and perhaps thought he owed him some amendsthat he swore his father should not lie in such restless company and as the late baronet had been at feud with the then rector he determined to dispense with any assistance from the church at all and buried him in an adjoining field which was subsequently made the last restingplace of all our race as you perceive the burial service is dispensed with of course it would be mere mockery to address such words as hope and faith to the corpse of a heath of fairburn my dear marmaduke said i you make my very blood run cold but surely you exaggerate these things some of your people have been catholics and been buried in their own chapel at the hall have they not only one of them replied the boy with bitterness my greatgrandfather sir nicholas abjured his infidelity and became a papist in order to secure his bride he turned the chapel into a banquetinghall however and used the sacramental plate in his unholy revels but after death the priests got hold of him at last and nick the younger as he was called now lies under the altar which he so often profaned the beginning of his funeral ceremonies was not conducted so decently as the last rites he had got outlawed i believe or at all events was driven abroad in his latter days and died there nobody at fairburn had heard of him for many months when one october night as oliver bradford who is now the headkeeper but was then a very young man was watching in the homepreserves he heard a terrible noise in the highroad and making his way out came upon this spectacle two men in black and upon black horses rode by him at full speed and close behind them came a hearseandfour likewise at the gallop the plumes upon it waved backwards he says like corn and all the black trappings of the thing fluttered and flapped as it went by another man on horseback singing to himself a drunken song closed this horrid procession it moved up towards the village and oliver listened to it until the noise seemed to cease about opposite to the park gates the solitary witness frightened enough before was now doubly terrified for he made sure that what he had seen was the news of sir nicholass decease brought over in this ghastly and characteristic fashion he did not for a single moment imagine that it was a palpable vision and yet he had seen a veritable funeral pass by the old baronet had died in france leaving directions and the money to carry them out that his corpse should be taken at night and at full gallop through every town that lay between dover and fairburnalive or dead added marmaduke grimly the heaths are a charming family at all events my dear fellow said i laying my hand upon his arm you will have nothing to fear from comparison with your forefathers you may make a good reputation at a cheap price a very little virtue will go a great way with the next tenant of fairburn hall if half the tales we hear be true and what tales are those inquired a deep low voice at my very elbow i believe i jumped a foot or two in the air myself so great was my alarm but as far my companion if those grassgrown tombs which we were contemplating had given up their wicked skeletons before his eyes he could not have exhibited a greater excess of terror beside me stood a man of herculean proportions who by his dress might have been taken for an undergamekeeper but for a very massive gold chain which hung from the top buttonhole of his waistcoat down to its deepflapped pocket what is now i believe called an albert guard resembles it on a smaller scale but at the time i speak of such an ornament was altogether unique his face too evidently belonged to one who was used to command on the forehead was a curious indented curve like the letter u while his lip curled contemptuously upwards also in somewhat the same shape the two together gave him a weird and indeed a demoniacal look which his white beard although long and flowing had not enough of dignity to do away with i had never heard sir massingberds personal appearance described but even if i had not had before me his shrinking nephew i should have recognized at once the features of giant despair and what tales are those which are told against the present tenant of fairburn hall reiterated the baronet scanning me from head to foot with his cold glittering eyes and who is this young gentleman who comes to listen to them from the lips of my loving ward sir said i your nephew was saying nothing whatever against you i do assure you i was merely referring to the gossip of the village which indeed does not make you out to be entirely a saint i was angry at having been frightened by this man who after all could not hurt imei i had been accustomed too to indian life which without making one bolder than other people indisposes one to submit to dictation which is only the duty of the natives sir massingberd reached forth one iron finger and rocked me with it to and fro though i stood as firm as i could take care young gentleman take care said he that spirit of yours will not do down at fairburn mr long does not seem to have taught you humility i think marmaduke go home he spoke these last words exactly as a man speaks to his dog who has injudiciously followed him to church on sunday in the hope that he was bent on partridge shooting the boy instantly obeyed he shrank away passing as closely to the churchyard railing as he could as though he almost feared a blow from his uncle there is humility there is docility sneered the baronet looking after him and if i had iyoui up at the hall my young bantam for four and twenty hours or so id make you docile too he strode away with a laugh like the creaking of an iron hinge for he saw that i did not dare to answer him he strode away over the humble graves setting his foot deep into their daisied mounds as though in scorn and his laugh echoed again and again from the sepulchral walls for it was joy to sir massingberd heath to know that he was feared i am told by an able friend who is good enough to revise for me this manuscript that it is not likely that a mere boy as i then was would have made such an observation as the above i do not doubt that this remark is altogether just but i am afraid it will apply to so much else in this narrative that it is scarcely worth while to make an alteration i am not used to literary composition i cannot weigh whether this or that is characteristic of a speaker i am merely a garrulous person who has however such a striking story to tell that i trust the matter will atone for the manner chapter iii the dream by the brook although my story must needs be sombre wherever it has to do with that person whose name it bears yet i hope there will be found some sunny spots in it during the first few months after my arrival at fairburn there was nothing to sadden life there that i knew of i passed my days under green leaves and not only in a metaphorical sense for every fine afternoon immediately after study was over i betook myself to the park the whole place was watched as zealously even in summer as the gardens of the hesperides but mr long had obtained permission for me to roam at large therein to me vexed from childhood by indian suns fairburn chaseas that part of the demesne most remote from the hall was calledwas far more delightful than it could have been to any mere english boy its stately avenues of oaks tapering into infinite distance with their checker work of beam and shade was the realization of my dreams of forest beauty nor was its delicious coolness marred by the broad strips of sunlight at long but equal distances like the golden stairs of the angels ladder for those i knew marked the interlacing of the rides themselves as fair and leading not as the avenue did to the outer world but into secret bowers known only to the deer and me when marmaduke was not with me which often enough happened poor fellow and particularly after that unfortunate meeting with his uncle in the churchyardthe whole chase seemed abandoned to myself i dare say it was not really so and that if i had not been a privileged person i should soon have found out my mistake but for days and days i never saw any human being there now and then the figure of a gamekeeper dwarfed by distance would make its appearance for a moment to be lost the next in some leafy glade but the sense of solitude was thereby rather increased than otherwise just as the poet tells us in a case where the ear and not the eye was concerned the busy woodpecker imade stilleri by his sound the inviolable quietness lying couched in fern in that lordly pleasureplace i have myself entertained some poetic thoughts although they never found expression even now as i shut my eyes i make an inward picture of some such restingplace nothing to be seen but the long green feathery stems which the summer air just stirs about my brow and the broad branches of the oak that stretch themselves motionless between me and the sun nothing to be heard but the coo of the ringdove and the swift stealthy bite of the dappled deer nor did fairburn chase lack water to complete its beauty in front of the hall itself moved a broad slow stream which presently slid rather than fell down ledges of mossy stone into a wilderness of trees and shrubs through which it wandered on like one who has lost his way but singing blithely nevertheless another stream which was my favourite burst springlike from the very heart of the chase having been artificially conveyed beneath the avenue and ran quite a little river and at a great rate to form the island where the herons lived after which as though it had done its work it went its way tranquilly enough if it had nothing to boast of but the heronry it might have been a proud little brook for never did colony of those solemn birds take their sad pleasure in a more lovely spot but besides it had a certain bend in itessential to the beauty of a brook as straightness is to that of a treewhich i have never seen rivalled elsewhere its right bank rose there though not abruptly and left half its bed of brown sand and loose tinkling shingle bare to the sunlight save so much of it as the shade of a cluster of lime trees could cover here the bee and the bird brought their songs and the dragonflies the glory of their turquoise armour and glittering wings throughout the summer noons the cool fragrant smell of the limes and the drowsy music of the insects that haunted them were inexpressibly pleasant to me who i am afraid had not a little of the asiatic indolence in my nature sometimes a group of swans sailed by on the unruffled stream themselves a slumbrous pageant fit enough to herald sleep but at all events swans or no swans i often did sleep there one july afternoon in particular when the heat was almost as intense as at calcutta and no punkahs to cool one i went to this place with malice prepense to lie there and do nothing which from my youth up has always been synonymous with a isiestai i cannot do absolutely nothing and yet keep awake i very much admire the people whom i often meet in railway carriages who endure without books or newspapers hundreds of miles of weary travel and who do it with their eyes open i wonder they do not break out into a melody or at least a whistle they cannot possibly be thinking all that time and indeed they have no appearance of employing themselves in that way but stare right on with calm eternal eyes with no more speculation in them than those of the sphinx herself i envy but i cannot imitate those happy persons there is no such state of coma with me i either wake or sleep i lay then beneath the limes by the brook in fairburn chase halfburied in the soft brown sand and even while i looked upon the glancing stream with the grand old willow opposite that bent its hoary honours halfway oer the scene dissolved and changed the brook became a river and the willow a palmtree and the chase a sandy tract and the firclump on the distant hill the snowcapped himalaya i saw tooand alas i was never more to see them except as then in dreamsmy father and my mother but they passed by me with pitiful loving looks and went their way then the ayah the black nurse who was watching over mefor i was once more a childstole down to the riverbrink and drew a fluted dagger from her bosom and dipped it in the sacred flood and i felt that i was to die i knew her well we two had loved one another as nurse and child do love where the nurse perforce takes half the mothers part as the child grows up his affection at the best congeals to gratitude but not so with the breast that suckled himgod forgive us men and the pain of my dream was sharpest because it was my own dear ayah who was about to slay me i had offended vishnu or else she would not have done it her gods demanded my life of her but she was sorry i felt her cold lips upon my brow and then a large round tear fell upon my cheek like icy hail and i awoke there was a tumult of sounds in the air the birds and the bees and the bubbling wave silent while i had slept seemed to have burst out together in chorus at my waking i was bewildered and knew not where i was my dream was more distinct at first than the realities about me if i had but closed my eyes again i knew that it would be continued at the spot where it had left off that the fluted dagger would have drunk my lifeblood and therefore i made an effort to rouse myself wondrous are dreams and wondrous the borderland twixt life and sleep if my existence had depended upon it i could not for some seconds have told for certain whether i was in england or in india then reason began to reassume her sway and the vague mysterious powers of whom we shall one day perhaps have a more certain knowledge withdrew reluctant from their usurped dominion over me i remembered however most distinctly every incident that they had brought about and i placed my hand mechanically upon my left cheeki had been lying upon my rightupon which the tear had seemed to fall great heaven iit was still weti i was really startled the cloudless sky forbade the idea of a drop of rain having fallen i had shed no tear myself while dreaming for my eyes were dry and even if i had it could scarcely have dropped as it did making a cool round spot in the centre of the cheekit would have slid down and left a little frigid line there were no stones for the stream to splash against and thus besprinkle me it was very odd still i did not imagine for a moment that my poor black nurse had really come across the seas to drop the tributary tear upon her sleeping boy moreover she could scarcely have got away so suddenly without leaving some trace of her departure somemy heart all of a sudden ceased to beat a shiver ran through me as runs from stem to stern through a doomed ship that comes end on at speed upon a sunken rock my eyes had fallenwhile i thus reasoned with myselfupon a sight to terrify an older man than i after such a dream ithe print of a womans bare feet in the sandi had there been any footprintsthose of a keeper or watcher for instancei should have been startled to know that some one had passed by while i slumbered for most certainly the sand had been untrodden up to the moment i had lost consciousness but that a woman with naked feet had been really present while i dreamed that horrible dream was something more than startling in scotland such a circumstance would have been less remarkable but in fairburn i had not yet seen any person without shoes there were a considerable number of footprints but only of one individual she had stood beside me for some time for they were deeper close to the place where i had lain and there was also one impression there which looked as though the mysterious visitor had knelt they had come and returned the same way which was not the one that i had come myself and they began and ended at the streamside a few yards beyond and out of sight of the bend which was my favourite haunt the woman had doubtless crossed and recrossed by means of some natural steppingstones that showed their heads above water there was no path on the other side but only a tangled thicket through which it would have been impossible to track her even had i been so disposed which i was not to say truth i was terribly discomposed for a minute or two i clung to the notion that the footprints were my own made perhaps under the influence of somnambulism i took off my shoes and measured the tracks with my own feet but i found boy as i was that mine effaced them they were certainly the marks of a woman smaller than those of a grown male yet firmer set than those of a child never since the days of robinson crusoe was ever man so panicstruck by footprints in the sand as i although it was broad daylight and the air was alive with sounds i fairly trembled the many evil stories which during my short stay at fairburn i had already heard of the old hall a corner of which i could discern from where i stood crowded in upon my brain the whole demesne seemed under a malign influenceenchanted ground i turned from the spot whose lonely beauty had once so won my soul with fear and loathing and as i turned there rang outit may have been from the thicket across the stream but the echoes took it up so suddenly that it seemed to ring all around mea laugh so terrible so demoniacally mocking that i could scarcely believe it came from mortal throat again and again it rose and circled about as though it would have headed my fleeing steps and driven me back upon some dreadful thing while i fled through the fern towards home at my topmost speed and the whitetailed rabbits scampered to left and right less frightened than i chapter iv the dumb witness a sentiment of shame prevented my mentioning the affair of the footprints to my tutor and as for marmaduke although we were by this time very intimate i would not have furnished him with a new occasion for detesting fairburn chase upon any account not only however was my favourite haunt by the brook become an object of aversion to me but i confess i took much less delight in any part of the heath demesne i kept my eyes about me even in the great avenue and upon the whole preferred the rectors little garden if at any time i had a mind for sleeping out of doors meredith observed mr long to me one morninghe called me peter generally but when he had anything serious to say it was meredithit appears to me that you dont take nearly so much exercise as you used to do your appetite is failing i am really concerned about you thank you sir i am pretty well nonsense peter no boy should be pretty well he should be in the rudest vulgarest health or else he is in a bad way your good father advised me that if you seemed the least to need it i should get you a nag it is crittenden fair next week what say you to my buying you a horse thank you sir that is just what i should like cried i i am certainly getting tired of walking about alone and then i began to blush a little for of late rather than go into the chase i had been accompanying my tutor in his favourite diversion of fishing which i cared nothing about or else in his parochial expeditions dont be afraid to speak out my boy said mr long with a kind smile you will not hurt my feelings you and i are very good friends but you want somebody of your own age to be your companion isnt that it and very natural too no young gentleman except in storybooks enjoys the society of his tutors even sandford and merton got a little tired of good mr barlow i fancy he was so desperately full of information you want a fellow who can shy stones and climb trees no sir indeed i dont said i a little indignantly for i was getting too old i flattered myself for any boyish escapades of that sort but i do wish that marmaduke was allowed to come out with me a little more would not sir massingberd let him have a horse also mr long shook his head and was silent for a little then as if in continuation of his thought he added and yet i dont know well go over to the hall and see about it this very morning iii sir inquired i in astonishment for i had never set foot in doubting castle or seen it from any nearer spot than the heronry did i say we said mr long reflectively i didnt mean to do so but i really see no reason why you shouldnt come you would wait a considerable time if you waited for an invitation from sir massingberd buttush if poor marmaduke lives there and yet remains a good boy half an hours visit will not be the ruin of the lad the latter part of this remark was uttered aloud although intended to be strictly private which was not an uncommon occurrence with my worthy tutor and i have noticed the same peculiarity in other persons of studious habits he led the way into the road at once pursuing which under the park wall we presently came upon a little door which my tutor opened with a private key this admitted us into the wallgarden or as it was sometimes called from the quantities of that fruit which it contained the peachgarden an enormous area was here entirely given up to the cultivation of fruits in the centre were strawberrybeds gooseberries melonbeds the glasses of which dazzled you to behold and raspberries upon trelliswork on so extensive a scale that it looked like a maze the northern end was occupied by an enormous greenhouse which in those days was rather a rare adjunct even to a rich mans garden but the most surprising sight was that of the walls covered with spreadeagled fruit trees or as schoolboys then called them lawkadaisies laden with the most exquisite daintiespeaches nectarines apricots and bloomy plums a number of men were busily employed about this teeming scene why do they say sir massingberd is poor inquired i is not all this his yes it is all his well but what valuable fruit and what enormous quantities of it why he would make a large income even if he was to sell it he does sell it replied my tutor smiling nineteen out of twenty of all these peaches will find their way to covent garden why how could he eat them you foolish boy even if he gave them away to all fairburn he would introduce the cholera a baronet and a market gardener exclaimed i well that seems very odd mr long did not choose to inform me at that time that almost all the income sir massingberd had was drawn from this source and from the selling of game with which his great preserves were overflowing the staff of gardeners and of keepers was retained mainly upon this account in the interest of marmaduke mr clint the family lawyer did i believe contribute a certain annual sum for keeping up the gardens and the chase but this was by private arrangement and at his own risk and responsibility thus it was that while some parts of the fairburn demesne were as admirably maintained as possible others were suffered to fall into decay just as we emerged from the wallgarden for instance there was a small artificial hollow planted with trees and within it peering above ground a thatched roof covered moss and mildew and with great gaps and holes in it this was the icehousein these wenham lake and refrigerator days an almost obsolete building but in the time i write of considered a necessary appendage to every country seat next we entered an arcade of immense length which the noonday rays would have striven in vain to penetrate but for the spaces where the trelliswork had given way through age and neglect and the ivy trailed down from rusted nails and obstructed the way seats were placed in niches at unequal intervals upon one side of this arcade but they looked very unattractive damp wormeaten cracked and here and there with a slug upon them making slimy paths yet from one of these alcoves there started up while we were still a long way off a female figure and stood for a moment looking at us in great surprise above her happened to be one of those broken portions of the leafy roof and through it the sunlight poured right down in a golden flood as a glory sometimes does in ancient pictures a tall dark woman who must have been exquisitely beautiful in her youth and even now retained considerable attractions her eyes were large and lustrous and her hairnever even in india had i seen hair more dark or so luxuriant it was not rolled tight at the back in a great pillow as was then the fashion or indeed confined in any way but streamed down over her shoulders and far below that place where it was the pleasure of our ancestresses to consider that their waists occurred she cast upon us at first a glance haughty and almost defiant but upon recognizing my companion quenched her fiery looks stop here my lad whispered mr long laying his hand firmly upon my shoulder wait till she has gone away the woman saw the gesture although she could not have heard the words i shall not bite the boy mr long cried she with a shrill laugh however i will make myself scarce she took a few rapid steps to an opening on the right of the arcade which led to the lawn and flowergarden and was lost to us in a moment i did not know there were any ladies at the hall said i my tutor did not answer but walked on muttering to himself as if annoyed i did not repeat the remark for i was wondering within myself whether it could be this woman who had watched my sleep and knelt by me dagger in hand according to my dream she looked just the sort of female to drive such an instrument home if she entertained that fancya judith equal to the slaying of any holofernes and far more of a slight built overgrown indian lad like me there was certainly something uncanny about her and i thought it very strange that marmaduke had never spoken to me of her existence the arcade brought us out into a sunk garden which was a rosary on to which opened the tall windows of a noblelooking room the walls i could see were lined with books and on the numerous tables lay portfolios and volumes that gave promise of great store of plates this was the library where marmaduke had told me he passed his only happy hours at fairburn his uncle rarely so much as entered it although he was not without some reputation for learning in particular it was said that he was well acquainted with divinity and could quote chapter and verse of the bible against the parson i have since had reason to believe that his talents in this way were greatly exaggerated what he had ever read he doubtless recollected if his memory served him as well in literary matters as when he had a grudge to pay but i cannot think that he ever studied divinity if he had any knowledge of the bible at all it doubtless astonished all who knew him and they made the most of it a few steps further brought us to the north face of the mansion in which was the principal entrance notwithstanding the broad sweep in front of the steps and the avenue branching right and left there did not seem space enough as contrasted with the vast mass of trees the scene was like a clearing in a forest where the openings are artificial and the wood comes by nature rather than the converse and even in that september day the air struck chill the griffins that guarded the great stone steps had lost the one an ear and the other a wing and the steps themselves were chipped and cracked the grass which grew there unchecked at other seasons had however been scraped out because sir massingberds guests were expected immediately for the shooting none of them however had as yet arrived the great bell which answered our summons clanged through the place as though there had been neither furniture nor people within it the vast door was opened long before its echoes ceased and indeed with marvellous quickness when the man saw who we were he looked vexed at having put himself in a flurry without necessity he thought doubtless it was his master who demanded admittance and had come post haste from the pantry it being very dangerous to keep the baronet waiting we were ushered into the great hall and left there while the man went to seek sir massingberd this huge apartment was evidently used as a sittingroom there were couches and comfortable chairs in profusion and a fine aroma of tobacco pervaded everything the walls were ornamented with antlers and the heads of foxes a number of fishing rods stood in one corner in another lay some of those clubs that are used for exercising the muscles on the table was an open pocketbook stuck full of gorgeous artificial flies presently the man reappeared sir massingberd would see us in his private sittingroom we walked over polished oak on which i could with difficulty keep my footing down a long passage hung with grim portraits of the heath familyall dead and judged as marmaduke subsequently informed meuntil we came to a short flight of steps on the left hand these we descended and following the footsteps of our conductor in almost perfect darkness came upon double doors the inner of which a baize one admitted us into the presence of the proprietor the baronet was in his shirtsleeves cleaning a doublebarrelled gun this is my pupil peter meredith said mr long iii know the young gentleman replied sir massingberd curtly and the horseshoe upon his brow contracted as he spoke what makes you bring him here well sir massingberd observed my tutor forcing a laugh that is scarcely a hospitable observation i bring this friend of your nephews because what i have to propose concerns them both it is good for these boys to be together not to live solitary lives and to keep them mewed up at home as they are now is a positive cruelty marmaduke is getting thinner and paler every day and meredith do iyou reallyi think so parson asked the baronet eagerly omitting for a moment to use the dirtylooking piece of oiled flannel which had previously monopolized his attention i do indeed sir massingberd i believe that if a doctor was to give his opinion about that boy the heaths never send for doctors or for clergymen interrupted the baronet with a sneer and yet they have often needed advice both spiritual and temporal quoth my tutor stoutly i say you should get a horse for your nephews riding it need be no trouble to you whatever i am going over to crittenden fair next week myself to purchase one for my pupil now let me get one for your nephew also at first sir massingberds countenance expressed nothing but angry impatience but presently he began to rub the gunbarrel less and less violently and who is to find the money inquired he i think that can be managed sir massingberd mr clint will doubtless listen to such an application on behalf of marmaduke he will risk advancing a few pounds for thirtyfive guineas one can get a very good pony observed the baronet reflectively or even for less returned mr long drily and then to my excessive terror he added in quite as loud a key he wants to keep the difference thats his plan and he means to do it too observed sir massingberd grimly no you neednt apologize parson for your thinking aloud you dont suppose i am going to do anything without being paid for it do you then theres the keep of the animal now what will mr clint allow me for that do you suppose oats and beans are very expensive and you wouldnt have me feed my dear nephews pony upon hay sir massingberd was a formidable object at all times but i really think he inspired more fear when he was pleasedwhen some wicked notion tickled himthan even when he was in wrath i think sir massingberd the question of expense can be managed to your satisfaction said my tutor not a little overwhelmed by having thus involuntarily expressed his suspicion of the baronet and as i have said i will save you all trouble by selecting the horse myself certainly not sir exclaimed sir massingberd savagely i suffer no man to choose my horses for me very good replied mr long biting his lip i have only to stipulate then that if your nephew gets the horse he is to ride it i shall have to make myself answerable for that much to mr clint oh he shall ride it quoth the baronet with a horrid imprecation you may take your oath of that and by the by since you are here parson i want to have some talk with you about that same fellow clint who has been behaving devilish ill to me i think you may go away young gentleman iyoui may youll find your future riding companionhe has about as much notion of riding as old grimjaw yondersulking in his own room i dare say grimjaw show the young gentleman up to marmadukes room at these words a dog of horrible aspect came out from under the very sofa on which i sat and trotted off towards the door he was the oldest and ugliest dog i ever beheld he had only one eye which was green he had no teeth and was therefore not to be feared as a combatant but his aspect was loathsome and repulsive to the last degree the people of fairburn imagined this animal to be sir massingberds familiar demon and until of late years when the creature had become incapacitated by age from accompanying him much the two were scarcely ever seen apart old as he was however the hideous grimjaw had some instinct left which after the word marmaduke had been once more shrieked at him caused him painfully to precede me up the oak staircase and along another gallery to a chamber door at which he sat and whined this was immediately opened by his young master who with a come in grim was only giving sufficient space for the entrance of the dog when i cried out laughing what have you no welcome for your friend like uncle like nephew what a pair of curmudgeons inhabit fairburn hall the astonishment of marmaduke at hearing my voice was excessive notwithstanding his pleasure his first thought as usual was did sir massingberd know yes said i coolly of course he knows he received me downstairs with his usual politeness mr long and he are conversing upon some private matters so i came up here to see you it is arranged that each of us is to have a horse and that we are to go out riding together a horse oh impossible exclaimed marmaduke clapping his hands how did the good parson ever persuade my uncle what ididi he give him i could not help laughing at this naive inquiry which my friend had made in perfect seriousness i told him all that had occurred including our tutors ivivavocei soliloquy at which marmaduke cried heavens in terror it is marvellous notwithstanding that my uncle should have consented observed my companion musing he told me indeed that i should be a great nuisance in the house this month while his friends were down here shooting but that he should have entered into an arrangement which gives me pleasure as well as gets rid of me that seems so very strange he has doubtless some base motive returned i smiling let us console ourselves with that reflection but what have we here watercolour paintings why have you never told me you were an artist i merely amuse myself with the paintbrush i have had no lessons of course so that my perspective is quite chinese nay but i recognize almost all these scenes well you know i have been nowhere else but at fairburn so that it is from thence i must take my subjects the one you have there is taken from the bend in the stream beyond the heronry it is admirable said i and indeed it was so like the scene of my dream that it gave me a shudder would you like to have it replied marmaduke carelessly you may take any that the portfolio contains i only wish they were more worth your acceptance thank you said i nervously i will certainly take this one then and i rolled the sketch tightly up and placed it in my pocket but here is a pretty face why master marmaduke you have your secrets i see you have never mentioned to me this young lady what beautiful hair the eyes too how glorious and yet how tender it is surely not the lady whom we just met in the ar silence sir cried marmaduke in a voice of thunder his face was lurid with rage and for the first time i remarked upon his forehead a faint reflection of the horseshoe that made so terrible the brow of his uncle do not speak of that wretched woman in the same breath with with he did not complete the sentence but added in his usual soft musical tones pardon me my friend i am sorry to have been so hasty but that picture is the portrait of my mother it was stupid in me not to have known that at once said i the likeness is most remarkable but not the expression returned he sadly i know that just now i looked like one of my own race she was always an angel even when she was upon earth and the boy looked up with his hands clasped as though he beheld her through his tears in heaven did you paint that from a picture marmaduke no from memory sleeping or waking i often see her sweet face i had evidently raised by my thoughtlessness a long train of melancholy thoughts in my companion the situation was embarrassing and i did not know how to escape from it as often happens with wellintentioned but blundering persons i made the most inopportune remark that could be framed forgetting what i had heard of the infamous treatment which mrs heath had received while under her brotherinlaws roof i observed your mother was once at fairburn was she not that should at least make the hall more endurable to you again marmadukes handsome face was disfigured with concentrated passion yes she was here returned he speaking through his teeth for what she suffered alone the place would be cursed coward scoundrel why does god suffer such men to live it was terrible to see how like this young lad grew to the man he was execrating he went on using such language as i could not have conceived him capable of employing marmaduke said i soothingly for heavens sake be calm providence will one day reward this man it is not for you to curse him come now that i pay you a visit for the first time you should play the host and show me over the mansion why that queer old dog seems to understand what one says he rises as though he were the chatelain and kept the keys of doubting castle he brought me here as true as a blind mans cur i cannot say however that he is beautiful he is hideous weird it would be strange indeed if he were like other dogs returned marmaduke gravely he is the sole living repository of a most frightful secret if he could but speak he could perhaps send a man to the gallows what man exclaimed i pray explain to me this mystery i do not know what man returned my companion solemnly i only conjecture i will relate to you what is known of the matter and you shall judge for yourself marmaduke opened the door to see that no one was in the passage without and then seating himself close beside me commenced as followsmy grandfather and the present baronet lived on bad terms with one another for the last ten years of his life sir wentworth and his eldest son never metbut onceif they met at all he had been very profligate and extravagant in his young days but in his old age he grew miserly when my father saw him last it was in a small house in bedford place in london where he lived in a couple of illfurnished rooms and without a servant grimjaw and he slept there alone but a charwoman came in every morning for a few hours sir wentworth then gave it as his reason for this kind of life that he was retrenching in order to leave some suitable provision for his second son look here gilbert said he upon one occasion to my father i have begun to lay by for you already and he showed him a quantity of banknotes amounting to several thousand pounds he had never been an affectionate parent or exhibited any selfdenial for the benefit of his sons and my father did not believe him he thanked him of course but he came away without any idea that he would be really better off at sir wentworths death this was fortunate for him for he never received a farthing but i am not so certain as he was that the baronet did not intend to do what he promised while the old man was living in this sordid fashion his son massingberd was passing his time very gaily at court he played high and there were few who could beat him with the cardsbut there were some it is no use being a good player you see unless you are the best you only win from those whom you can beat to lose it in your turn to the man who can beat you thus it was with my uncle who played as i say high with everybody but highest as is often the case with his superiors in skill however he paid his debts of honour with money raised at an enormous sacrifice he lived well but it was upon his future prospects at last being harder pressed than usual he wrote to his fatherthe first letter he had penned to him for yearsand demanded pecuniary help sir wentworth wrote back a cynical harsh reply a copy of which i have seenfor all these details came out in the course of the inquest he bade his son come to call upon him and judge from his style of living whether he was in a condition to comply with his request he appointed a day and an hourabout five oclock it was in december and quite dark of course by that time at six oclock on the appointed day sir massingberdfor he had got his title by that time whether he knew it or notcalled at the policestation near bedford place and gave information that the house which his father occupied was shut up and that he could not obtain admittance although he had arrived there by appointment the house was always shut up they told him although not untenanted they could not explain why his summons had not been answered a couple of policemen accompanied him to break open the door while they were thus engaged a dog howled at them from inside my uncle had made no mention of having heard this before there was only one lock to force the door being neither bolted nor chained and they soon got in the only two furnished rooms in the house opened upon the hall in the sleeping room they found my grandfather dressed but lying on the bed quite deadsuffocated as the surgeons subsequently averred in the sittingroom with which it communicated they found this dog here crouching on the top of the mantelpiece which was very lofty how he got there nobody could tell if he leaped thither even from a chair it must have been in an agony of terror he was whining pitifully when they entered but upon seeing my uncle he ceased to whimper and absolutely seemed to shrink into himself with fear poor grimjaw could give no witness at the inquest however so the jury returned an open verdict it was probable that sir wentworth had had a fit of apoplexy which carried him off well said i and is not that probable enough yes but it could not have carried off the banknoteswhich were all gonelikewise could it grimjaw thus appealed to the ancient dog set up a quavering howl which might easily have been mistaken for the cry of an accusing spirit good heavens this is too horrible cried i be careful marmaduke that you do not mention this to others it is a frightful slander slander returned my companion calmly it is you who slander if you suspect anybody i have only told you what everybody knew at the time the murwell then when sir wentworth had his fit the thing strikes you as it does me that is all but is it not inconceivable urged i if the crime was committed by the person we are thinking of that he should retain this dumb witness of his atrocity that he should let it live far less should keep it in his private sittingroom no interrupted marmaduke firmly on the contrary it strengthens my suspicions you do not know the man as i do it gives him gratification to subdue even a dog this creature has no love for my uncle but its excessive terror of him which endured for months nay years has gradually worn off he obeys him now whereas as i have been told it was long before it could do anything but shiver at the sound of his voice after dinner when i have been sitting with sir massingberd alone he will sometimes give the dog a biscuit saying with an awful smile here grimjaw you and i know something that nobody else knows dont we great heavens cried i in horror and what does he do that for because replied marmaduke bitterly he loves to see me tremble chapter v the state bedroom marmaduke had scarcely concluded his narration when steps were heard in the passage i daresay i turned pale at the thought of seeing the man of whom i had just heard such frightful things for my companion observed as if to reassure me it is only mr long are you quite sure said i marmaduke smiled sadly do you think that i do not know my uncles step i should recognize it amongst a score of others if he overtook me in a crowded street i should feel that he was coming and shudder as he passed beside mepray come in sir well cried my tutor entering radiant with his good news no more moping at home my lads you are to be henceforth cavaliersyou are to scour the country boot and saddle boot and saddle your uncle will not trust me to get you a steed marmaduke there are none good enough for you it seems at crittenden he is going to send to london for an animal worthy of you but never mind peter you shall have the best mount that can be got in midshire and we will pit the country nag against the town my tutors voice revived me like a cordial after the morbid horrors i had been listening to his cheery talk was inexpressibly grateful as the dawn and ordinary sounds of waking life are welcome to one who has suffered from a nightmare i was just about to show meredith the hall said marmaduke well it is time that we should be at our work like good boys observed mr long consulting his watch but still for one morning it does not matter if you would like to stay peter i would rather go home sir cried i with involuntary eagerness i was sorry the next moment even before i saw the pained expression of my young companion he has had enough of fairburn hall already said he bitterly then his face softened sadly as though he would have said am i not therefore to be pitied who pass every day and night under this accursed roof come exclaimed mr long gaily i do not believe master meredith in this newborn devotion to your books let us go over the house first i will accompany you as cicerone for i once knew every hole and corner of ita great deal better i will venture to affirm than the heir himself here with these words he led the way into the passage every chamber on this floor is the facsimile of its neighbour said marmaduke since you have seen mine you have seen allan immense bed a piece of carpet islanded amid a black sea of oak a cupboard or two large enough to live in and shepherdesses with swains in ruffles occupying the walls there was indeed no appreciable difference in any of the rooms except with regard to their aspect when i first came to fairburn i slept here continued marmaduke as we entered an apartment looking to the north and had that long illness which you doubtless remember sir heavens what dreams i have had in this room i have seen people standing by my bedside at night as clearly as i see you now they called me delirious but i believe i was stark mad i remember it well said mr long although i did not recollect that you occupied this room how was it that you came to change your quarters oh the doctor recommended the removal very strongly sir massingberd said it was all nonsense about the lookout from my window and that the east was as bad as the north for a boy in a fever but he was obliged to give way and i certainly benefited by the change the park is a much more cheerful sight than that forest of firs and one is glad to see the sun even when one cannot get out of doors at all events i had no such evil dreams yet this is what always used to be held the statechamber replied my tutor charles i occupied that bed while he was yet king and before your ancestor sir hugh turned puritana part he was very unfitted to playit is said he used to swear through his nose peter the great too is said to have passed a night here your dreams therefore should have been historical and noteworthy i forget which of these smiling phyllises is so complaisant as to make way when you would leave the room without using the door two fulllength female portraits were painted in panel one on either side of the huge chimneypiece a circlet of roses carved in oak surrounded each by way of frame mr long advanced towards the one on the right and touched the bottom rose it did not move he went to the other and did likewise the rose revolved in his fingers and presently with a creak and a groan the whole picture slid sideways over the wall disclosing a narrow flight of wooden stairs that is charming cried i that is the mysteries of udolpho realized where does it lead to marmaduke there was no answer mr long and i looked round simultaneously the lad was ghastly pale he stared into the dusty gaping aperture as though it had been a graves mouth i do not know he gasped with difficulty not know cried my tutor do you mean to say that you have never been told of jacobs ladder the foot of it is in the third bookcase on the left of the library door the spring is somewhere in the index to josephus it is evident you never attempted to take down that interesting work which in this case is solid wood the idea of your not knowing that and yet sir massingberd is so reticent that with the exception of gilmore the butler i dare say nobody idoesi know it now it is twenty years ago since i made phyllis move aside to the astonishment of mr clint who came down here on business with poor sir wentworth i dare say nobody has moved her since yes yes cried marmaduke passionately my uncle has moved her those visions were not dreams i see it all now he wanted to frighten me to death or to make me mad when i knew the door was fast locked he would come and stand by my bedside and stare at me cruel cruel coward hush hush marmaduke this is monstrousthis is impossible cried mr long endeavouring to pacify the boy who was rocking himself to and fro in an agony of distress and rage see how you terrify peter be calm for heavens sake your uncle will hear you presently and you know how he hates to be disturbed at the mention of his uncle marmaduke subdued his cries by a great effort but he still sobbed and panted as if for breath oh moaned he consider how i came hither from my dead mothers arms to this mans housemy only living relative my fathers brotherand was taken ill here a mere child then this wretch this demon my host myoh mr long could you conceive it even of a heath he came up to my lonely room by that secret way and stood without speaking by my pillow while i lay speechless powerless imagining myself to be out of my mind i do remember now said my tutor gravely how you harped upon that theme of your evil dreams and how the doctor thought you were in reality losing your reason let us be thankful however that you were preserved from so sad a fate you are no longer a child now sir massingberd can frighten you no more even if he had the wish it was a wicked hateful act whatever was the motive but let us forget it in a few years you will be of age then you will leave the hall and in the meantime your uncle will annoy you no more it will be his interest to make a friend of you even now you see he provides you with the means of enjoyment you will ride out with your friend whenever you please and i will take measures so that you shall be more with us at the rectory and less at this melancholy place which is totally unfit for you mr clint shall be spoken with if necessary yes yes added mr long reversing the rose and thereby replacing the shepherdess but quite unaware that he was still speaking aloud there must be a limit to the power of such a guardian the chancellor shall interfere and sir massingberd be taught nay sir cried marmaduke in turn for heavens sake let no complaint be made against my uncle upon my account perhaps as you say i may now meet with better treatment i will be patient say nothing of this i pray you meredith mr long you know yes i know all interrupted my tutor with excitement you have a friend in me marmaduke remember who will stick by you i have shut my eyes and my ears long enough and perhaps too long if things get worse with you my lad do not forget that you have a home at the rectory once there you will not return to this house again i will give evidence myself i will thank you thank you replied marmaduke hurriedly all will now be well doubtless but my uncle will wonder at your long delayhe will suspect something i think it will be better if you left he led the way down the great staircase throwing an involuntary glance over his shoulder as we crossed the mouth of the dark passage leading to the baronets room this is a wretched welcome meredith some day perhaps i may take your hand at this hall door under different circumstances goodby goodby and so we parted between the two grim griffins peter said my tutor gravely as we went our way whatever you may think of what has passed today say nothing i am not so ignorant of the wrongs of that poor boy as i appear to be but there is nothing for it but patience chapter vi head over heels i obeyed my tutor and my friend in keeping all i knew regarding sir massingberd to myself but the knowledge weighed heavily upon my spirits for several days soon however my mind recovered its youthful elasticity i began to think that marmadukes morbid disposition had perhaps exaggerated matters that the baronet was not so black as was painted that my friend would soon be his own master and in short i laid all that flattering unction to my soul which is so abundant in the case of the misfortunes of others and so difficult to be procured when the calamity is our own moreover in a few days i was in possession of an excellent horse and there is nothing more antagonistic to melancholyespecially when it is vicariousthan a good gallop nay more after a little marmaduke had a horse also he came to call for me that we should go out for a ride together the first day and i shall not easily forget it how handsome and happy he looked as if the highconditioned animal he bestrode had imparted to him some of his own fire and freedom he wore scarcely any trace of his habitual depression this is our th of july said he gaily my day of independence as the rebels say it happened to be his birthday also he was seventeen so that all things conspired to make it a galaday my tutor who was a judge of horseflesh examined the new steed with great attention he is superb said he and you sit him marmaduke considering your scanty experience like a young centaur no one could imagine that your equestrianism had been heretofore limited to a keepers pony and moreover olivers ponies are not apt to be very highcouraged but what a tight curb has this bucephalus he will not give you much trouble to hold him soho soho my nag are you a hypocrite then that you need be so alarmed at being inspected the sleek bay plunged and curveted so that my own sober brown began to dance in rivalry by the by continued mr long as though a sudden thought had struck him i have occasion to visit mr jervis of the farm at staplehurst some day this week if it is the same to you let us go there today it will be an object for your ride while i shall have the pleasure of your company in a few minutes my tutors old white mare was brought round to the rectory door by the gardener who was groom and butler also and we set out together at a foots pace mr long never took his eyes off the bay and therefore did not observe sir massingberd who with his huge arms resting on a gate by the roadside watched us pass with a grim smile well parson exclaimed heand at the sound of his voice i perceived my tutor start in his saddlewhat think you of the little londoner i cannot say at present sir massingberd returned my tutor with deliberation he is a beauty to look at and if he has no vice is a bargain at fiveandthirty pounds vice why should he have vice man a child might ride him for that matter i got him with the best of characters but youll never teach those lads to ride if you are always at their stirrupleather like this let them ride alone and race together dont treat them like a brace of mollycoddles why at their age i could have backed any horse in christendom without a saddle i wonder you dont give miss marmaduke a leadingrein the colour which had faded from the lads cheeks returned to them again at this sneer but mr long only remarked if you had had a leadingrein yourself sir massingberd at seventeen it would have been a great deal better for you and rode on without the least consciousness as i believe of having made any such observation when we had advanced about a mile and had left the village quite behind us my tutor expressed a wish to change horses with marmaduke i want to try his paces said he and certainly if he had been a horsebreaker by profession he could not have taken more pains with the animal he trotted he cantered he galloped he took him into a field and over some fences he forced him by a windmill in full work and in short he left no means untried to test his temper in the end he expressed himself highly satisfied really said he sir massingberd has got you a firstrate steed with plenty of courage yet without vice he makes me quite dissatisfied with my poor old mare the next day and the next we rode again without my tutor and on the fourth day it was agreed that we should take an expedition as far as crittenden some ten miles away where mr long wished us to do some commissions for him by this time marmaduke was quite accustomed to his recent acquisition enjoyed the exercise greatly and since sir massingberd was much engaged with his guests passed altogether more agreeable days on the afternoon in question the hall party were out shooting and had taken with them all the stable domestics except a raw lad who scarcely knew how to saddle a horse i cannot think what is the matter this afternoon with panther we so called his skittish animal exclaimed marmaduke as he rode up to the rectory door i could scarcely get him to start from the yard and he came here mostly upon his hindlegs is there anything wrong with his girths think you ned did not know where to lay his hands on anything and my uncle has taken william with him to mark nay said i i see nothing the matter we will soon take off his superfluous energy over crittenden common long however before we reached that spot we had had galloping enough and to spare twice had panther fairly taken the bit between his teeth as the romancewriters term it and heaven forbid that a mere sportsman should correct them and sped along the hard highroad at racing pace and twice had marmaduke by patience and hard pulling recovered the mastery albeit with split gloves and blistered hands it was not enjoyment to ride in this fashion of course and had it not been for the commissions which had been entrusted to us it is probable that we should have returned home it puzzled us beyond measure to account for the change of conduct in the bay the difference was as decided as that between a highspirited child who requires as we say careful treatment and a vicious dwarf heretofore he had been frisky now he was positively fiendish he shied and started not only at every object on the roadside but before he arrived at them at the end of the high tableland which is called crittenden common and descends into the quiet little markettown of the same name there really was something to shy at a gipsy encampment with fire and caldron and tethered donkey which had been concealed in a hollow came suddenly into view as we cantered by an old crone with a yellow handkerchief in lieu of a bonnet and shading her beady eyes with her hand watched with malicious enjoyment the struggle between man and horse which her own appearance had gone far to excite in a very few moments marmadukes already overtaxed muscles gave way and the bay maddened with resistance and released from all control rushed at headlong speed down the steep chalkroad that led by many a turn and zigzag into crittenden it was frightful to watch from the summit of this tamed precipicethis cliff compelled into a roadthe descent of that doomed pair no mule could be surer footed than was panther but the laws of gravitation had nevertheless to be obeyed at the second turning the bay after one vain effort to follow the winding of the road pitched head first down the grassy wall which everywhere separated the zigzags from one another over and over rolled horse and rider to the hard road below and there lay their horrible and abnormal movements exchanged for a stony quiet i jumped off my horse and ran down the two steep slopes which at another time i should have descended hand over hand yet on my way i had time to think with what sorrow this news would be received at fairburn rectory with what joy at the hall marmadukes hand still held the rein which i disentangled from it with feverish haste lest that fourfooted fiend which snorted yet through its fiery nostrils and glared defiance from its glazing eyes should arise and drag the dear lads corpse among the cruel stones after what i had seen of his fall i had scarcely a hope that he was alive there was blood at his mouth blood at his ears blood everywhere upon the white and dazzling road marmaduke marmaduke cried i speak speak if it be but a single word great heaven he is dead dead no not he answered a hoarse cracked voice at my ear hell live to do a power of mischief yet to woman and man the devil would never suffer a heath of fairburn to die at his age woman cried i for it was the old gipsy crone who had somehow transported herself to the spot with incredible speed for gods sake go for help there is a house yonder among those trees and why should i stir a foot replied she fiercely for the child of a race that has ever treated me and mine as though we were dogs because said i at a venture you have children yourself you are right exclaimed she clapping her skinny hands together and seating herself calmly on the turf it is well that you have mentioned my kith and kin one lad is across the seas and will never see the green lanes and breezy commons of england more another lies caged in yonder jailand both for taking the wild creatures of the earth and air to which such men as massingberd heath lay claim while my little sisterah my sinnamenta my fair pearlmay the lightning strike him in his wickedest hour nay let him perish inch by inch within reach of the aid that shall never come ere the god of the poor takes him into his handboy you may talk to that flintstone and it will rise up and get you help for that lad therebonny as he is and the bonnier the worse for them he sets his wilful eyes onbefore you get this hand to wag a finger for him woman said i despairingly if you hate massingberd heath and want to do him the worst service that lies in your power flee flee to that house and bid them save this boys life which alone stands between his beggared uncle and untold riches is it so cried the old woman rising up with an agility for which no one would have given her credit and looking at me with furious eyes is it indeed so boy yes woman upon my soul revenge accomplished what pity had failed to work in an instant she was with me down by marmadukes side from her pocket she produced a spiritflask in a leathern case and applied it to his lips after a painful attempt to swallow he succeeded his eyelids began tremulously to move and the colour to return to his pallid lips keep his head up cried she and give him another drop of this if assistance does not arrive within five minutes before she had finished speaking she had lifted the latch of the gate that opened from the road into the grounds of the house in question and in another instant i was alonealone with what i believed to be a dying man and surrounded with the blood that had flowed in a mingled stream from him and the dead horse for panther had ceased to movealone with recollections and anticipations scarcely less horrible than the visible scene and yet so strangely constituted is the human mind that i could not forbear to glance with some sort of curiosity at the flask the gipsy had left with me and to wonder exceedingly that its worn and tarnished top of silver bore upon it a facsimile of one of those identical griffins which guarded each side of the broad stone steps that led to fairburn hall chapter vii at the dovecot after an interval which doubtless appeared much longer than it really was there issued from the gate a groom and butler bearing between them a small sofa and accompanied by a young and lovely girl the scene that presented itself was enough to shock persons even of strong nerves and i hastily exclaimed the young lady had better not see this but she came on nevertheless i am not afraid of blood said she and perhaps i may be of use then she directed her servants how to handle the wounded man and when he was gently lifted on to the couch she applied a handkerchief dipped in eaudecologne to his forehead and walked by his side regulating the pace of his bearers like some miss nightingale of a generation and a half ago let him be placed in your masters room james and then take my pony thomas and ride as fast as you can for dr sitwell and as you come backbut think of nothing but bringing the doctor firstcall at the nurserygarden for your master he said he should go there about those roses and some other directions she gave as the men moved on with their ghastly burden like one who knew the value of time notwithstanding this presence of mind her anxious eyes betrayed that she was not wanting in sensibility and with every groan which the motion of the fitter extracted from the sufferer her own lip quivered i dare say that i saw nothing of her exceeding beauty at that dreadful time but while i write of lucy gerard now a vision of surpassing loveliness perforce presents itself before me a tall lithe graceful form a face nay rather a soft sad smile overspreading and pervading every featurea smile that i never saw surpassed save on her own fair countenance after love had taken her sweet soul captivea smile the reflex of all good and kindly thoughts that dwelt within there are some so great and noble that they smile where other good folks can only weep and wail the true sympathizer with human griefs wears no lugubrious aspect the angels smile when they weep over human wretchednessthey know that it is only for a little while for that the gates of heaven are standing open very very near and some such knowledge or happy faith seems to influence the best of mortals or how should they go smiling through this world so marmaduke was carried along the graveldrive and across a little flowerstudded lawn to the room in mr gerards house which was called the masters room it being half a sleepingchamber and half a library which lucys father used both night and day this was so evident from the appearance of the place that when i had with james help put marmaduke to bed there where he lay breathing heavily but quite unconscious i went to the young lady of the house and expressed my apprehension that my poor friend being in that apartment would cause additional inconvenience in the household i understand said i that it is mr gerards room ah sir said she with a glance of pride more becoming if that were possible than even her ordinary modest look you do not know my father when i say that it will give him the greatest pleasure to find that his favourite room has been of service to your friend i use a conventional phrase which literally expresses what he will feel please to forget that there is anybody in this house but yourselves it is only right that sickness should be considered before health though alas every room to those who are ill is but an hospital this little drawingroom which your glance tells me you think pretty with its conservatory and fountain and the rest my poor young sister was very very weary of before she died on yonder sofa after fourteen months of the gay prison her voice trembled as she spoke and i thought i detected in it that shade of bitterness with which some affectionate persons speak of the sufferings of those they love as though they would almost arraign that providence for unnecessary harshness which might inflict any misery upon themselves without evoking one impatient thought then you are left all alone here miss gerard with such a sad reminiscence this spot must alone interrupted she with astonishment what when i have my father see he is coming through the shrubbery now and dr sitwell with him let us meet them how glad i am that he has lost no time it was easy to distinguish the doctor with his cane his ruffles and stiff professional appearance a little impaired however by hot haste moreover his companion indicated him with his finger as we rapidly approached one another exclaiming this is your man young gentleman dont waste one word on me at present so rapidly detailing what had happened as we went i took the man of physic to marmadukes bedside as we entered the room and first caught sight of his pale features distorted with pain my companion stood for an instant aghast great heaven murmured he i thought the horse had trodden upon the poor lads forehead but now i see it is an old scar no returned i it is not a scar it is only a mark which in moments of pain or anger comes out more distinctly than at other times all the heath family have it this is mr marmaduke heath the nephew of sir massingberd indeedindeed sir exclaimed the doctor with an accession of sympathy dear me how sad what a fine property to risk losing at his time of life but the eye you see gives us hope the brain has suffered but slightly he has not been sick you saynot been sick he has not been sick sir it was the worthy doctors habit to reiterate his last sentence in an arrogant manner as though he had been contradicted on a matter of fact while in reality his mind was entirely occupied by quite other thoughts thus at the present speaking he was engaged in manipulating marmadukes head and examining his ribs and limbs with the greatest attention i waited for his verdict in anxious silence and presently it was delivered it is my opinion sir that the young man will live to be a baronet life and death the immortalities of heaven and hell were matters that had but small space in doctor sitwells mind compared to this allimportant futurity he was accustomed to ithemi in connection with the merest paupers and persons of no sort of consequence but it was not every day in the week that a gentleman of marmadukes condition was pitched on his head within the crittenden doctors professional orbit mr marmaduke heath must be kept perfectly quiet he must not be moved from hence upon any considerationit may be for weeks what science can do through my humble agency shall be done for the young gentleman but rest and quiet are essential sir massingberd should be sent for instantly the responsibility upon my shoulders would otherwise be too great he will doubtless yearn to be by the bedside of his beloved nephew you had better arrange with mr gerard for this being done as i have my round to make which today is allimportant the hon mrs flinthertwidow of the late admiral you knowshe requires constant supervision nature has to be supported but for brandy she must have sunk before this then mr broadacres who lives fairburn wayby the by that is a very curious case however my post is here of course until my assistant arrives who will remain in my absence you may leave your friend now without the least anxiety when he awakes to consciousness you shall be sent foryou shall be sent for sir upon this i returned to the drawingroom to give a much more cheerful report of the patients case than i had ventured to anticipate i found our host issuing orders for his comfort and attendance as though he had quite made up his mind to make him his guest for a lengthened period a noblelooking gentleman he was as like his daughter as an old man can be to a young girl harvey gerards face was wrinkled neither by years nor care though marked here and there with those deep lines which indicate the thinkerone whom the gods have placed above the drudgery of life with a disposition to philosophizea man among men rather than of them who stands apart from the highroad somewhere halfway up the hill of fortune and watches the toilers above and below with a quiet but not cynical smile the news you bring me of our patient mr meredith said he is most welcome but i think we should still lose no time in communicating with his friends that is also the opinion of dr sitwell sir he too recommends that my poor friends nearest relative should be sent for but in circumstances of this kind it would be wrong not to say at once that that relative and the invalid here are on the worst of terms and that his coming would most certainly aggravate any bad symptoms and retard his cure i am sorry to hear returned mr gerard gravely that the young gentleman is not on good terms with his own flesh and blood that is a bad sign however that maybe sir generally replied i with warmth it is not so in this instance mr long the rector of fairburn and tutor to my friend will certify to his being a most wellconducted and excellent youth his uncle however sir massingberd heath i will not have that person under my roof interrupted mr gerard under any circumstances whatsoever this he said without the least trace of irritation but with a firmness and decision which left me nothing to apprehend upon marmadukes account then turning to his daughter as if in explanation he added the man i speak of my love is a wicked ruffianworse than any poor fellow who has ever dangled yonder outside of crittenden jail miss gerard did not answer except by a look of gentle remonstrance which seemed to me to murmur but dear papa for all we know this gentleman may be a friend of his i hastened therefore to observe with energy that mr gerards view of the baronets character was a perfectly just one as far as i knew or if anything rather lenient i recommended that mr long should be apprised of what had happened and that he should give sir massingberd to understand that while his nephew was receiving every attention at the dovecotfor so i had learned the house was calledits doors were immutably closed against himself it was not a pleasant task to impose upon the good rector but it was a necessary one for independently of mr gerards determination i felt it was absolutely essential to marmadukes life that his uncle should be kept away from his bedside if in health his presence terrified him how much worse would it be for him in his prostrate and perilous condition it was arranged too that i should remain to look after my sick friend and the messenger was instructed to bring back with him all that we required from the rectory and the hall mr long arrived at the dovecot late that same afternoon in a state of great anxiety he had come away almost on the instant after receiving the news of marmadukes mischance and without seeing sir massingberd who had not yet returned from shooting but he had left a letter for him explaining the circumstances as well as he could my only fear said he after visiting his pupil who still lay in a lethargic slumber is that he will come here immediately and insist on seeing his nephewa desire that would appear to be natural enough to persons who are unacquainted with the circumstances nay said i but surely he cannot do this in the face of mr gerards prohibition ah my boy you do not know sir massingberd yet observed my tutor gravely he will come where and when he will nay returned i but neither do you know mr harvey gerard from what i have seen of that gentleman he understands how to say no and to suit to the word the action when the strong man armed keepeth his house his goods including his sick guest are in peace but where a stronger than he cometh added the rector shaking his head what then we shall see said i what will happen it is plain at all events that our host is well aware of the sort of man with whom he has to deal mr gerard is a most pleasant person and his daughter is charming beyond measure they are far the most interesting people i have yet seen about fairburn how is it i have never heard any mention of them the gerards have always lived a very retired life returned my tutor the old gentleman entertains it is said some strange opinions in fact i have never met them myself but once and that on some public occasion so you must introduce me peter i had been watching for mr long at the entrancegate and taken him straight into marmadukes room upon his arrival so that he had seen neither our host nor hostess and i thought it strange that my tutor did not speak of them with more enthusiasm after their great kindness to marmaduke something evidently a little chilled his feelings towards them when he and mr gerard met i thought there was more cordiality upon the part of the latter than of the former the expression of mr longs gratitude was earnest but not genial his admiration of miss lucy although not to be concealed was mitigated as it seemed by some sort of compassion he regarded her with a shade of sadness boy as i was it was evident to me that some antagonism existed between my hostfor whom i naturally entertained most kindly feelingsand my respected tutor and this troubled me more than i should have liked to say miss lucy presently left the drawingroom and then i was continually appealed to by one or the other on various trifling matters as though they found a third party a relief to their conversation at last mr long requested me to narrate particularly the circumstances of marmadukes accident and i did so down to the period when i found him bleeding on the road well observed my tutor i am totally at a loss to account for poor panthers behaviour i confess upon the first day i saw him i did not like the look of his eye you remember peter that i made marmaduke exchange horses with me and endeavoured by every means in my power to find out the peculiarities of the animal i wish sir massingberd had permitted me to choose a horse for his nephew myself when i bought your honest brown sir massingberd selected his nephews horse himself did he inquired mr gerard carelessly yes replied my tutor he sent for him from town a few weeks ago he was a mettlesome frisky creature it is true but his curb was a very powerful one and seemed quite sufficient to subdue him does sir massingberd himself ride when he is in the field observed our host he must be a great weight for a shooting pony well if you had asked me yesterday i should have said he almost never rides but it so happens that he did take the keepers nag with him this morning his great stables are all empty now for as probably you are aware things are not kept up as they used to be at the hall old dobbin is the only representative of the magnificent stud that was once maintained there now that panther is dead by the by what has been done with him the carcass has been taken into the town said mr gerard he must have been a fine creature his mouth however was of iron said i poor marmaduke had no control over him whatever at last he had almost pulled his arms off notwithstanding the powerful bit observed mr gerard yes replied my tutor the bit was not only powerful i should have almost called it cruel but sir massingberd is a very good judge of all things belonging to a horse and seems to have known that at all events no less was required it was a townmade article and came down from london with the animal ah indeed remarked mr gerard but you have never told us mr meredith how you managed to give the alarm here without leaving your poor friend i am ashamed to say i had never given the old gipsy crone a thought from the moment that help arrived although it was of her sending the very woman whose appearance frightened the horse repaired as far as she could accomplish it that mischief she left in my hands too this fine old casebottle of which i should be sorry to rob her and very curious is it that it has the heath griffin or some crest very like that upon its stopper it is the very crest said the rector i am quite sure of that although it is long since it last saw platepowder it is but too likely that the dark lady came wrongfully by it let us not be hasty to impute crime observed mr gerard gravely this is a shootingflask carried about the person and gipsies are rarely pickpockets when the owner is at home it lies in someplace of safety and gipsies are not burglars ably reasoned observed mr long it may however have been a case of findings keepings as the schoolboys say i should think the cingari claimed for themselves all flotsam and jetsam it is too heavy and has too much bulk not to have been missed by him who carried it as soon as it fell continued mr gerard taking up the flask it has but very little spirit left in itseeand yet how here the butler entered somewhat hurriedly and was about to speak when a figure brushed by him and set him aside the daylight was beginning to wane but it was impossible to mistake that herculean form and its irresistible motion even if i had not heard the harsh decisive voice of sir massingberd saying by your leave sirrah but in this good company i will announce imyselfi chapter viii meeting his match sir massingberds unlookedfor entrance into the drawingroom at the dovecot had a result that must seem almost farcical to those who read it but which to me who dwelt among big trembling vassals and had learned day by day to fear and hate him more and more had nothing in it extraordinary i peter meredith bolted straightway into the conservatory and there ensconced myself within the shadow of an orangetree while the rev matthew long left the room with equal celerity by the door as for me i confess that i was actuated by panic on my own account my tutors apprehensions were aroused on behalf of another the instant after he disappeared i heard the lock of the library door shot into its staple and knew that marmaduke was in a friends keeping and safe from any incursion of his uncle i could see that mr gerard knew this too for a gleam of pleasure passed over his face and then left it determined defiant and almost mocking as when he had first set eyes upon the intruder there was a fire in the otherwise darkening room and from my place of concealment i could watch the lineaments of both its inmatesand two more resolved and haughty countenances i had never beheld is it the custom of your respectable family sir massingberd heath observed my host to force themselves into houses whose owners do not desire the honour of their presence it is their custom to hold their own sir answered the baronet curtly and i am come after my nephew it is impossible to convey the effect which this audacious speech had upon me its unseen hearer unblushing scornfully open as it was an awful threat seemed to lie within it and above all a consciousness of the power to carry it into effect even mr gerard who could have had no knowledge of the things that i knew and had never heard the history of grimjaw seemed to feel a tremor as he listened your nephew sir is not in a condition to receive you returned my host the consequences of seeing you might i do not hesitate to say be fatal to him the opinion of his medical man is different observed sir massingberd with a sneer dr sitwella most estimable person i should say and endowed with excellent sensehas been so very kind as to ride over himself to fairburn as soon as he could leave his patient in order to apprise me exactly how the matter stands he recommends my seeing marmaduke in his first lucid intervalthere is no knowing said he whether that may not be your poor dear nephews last your poor dear nephew repeated mr gerard with great distinctness very dear doubtless but not what one would call poor at least in the matter of expectations poor or rich sir retorted the other he has been placed in my hands as being those most fitted to take care of him mr gerard shrugged his shoulders and smiled sardonically you seem to conceive that confidence misplaced sir continued the baronet the want of your good opinion afflicts me beyond measure i am aware that i fail to satisfy pious persons in some particulars but that mr harvey gerards susceptibilities should be offended is indeed a serious consideration it is as though the devil himself should cry for shame sir massingberd heath you are under my roof although unbidden and unwelcome returned my host your tongue therefore is chartered so far as i am concerned i could not i confess help my countenance expressing some astonishment when you spoke of your fitness for the education of youth there was a pause here for which i could not account sir massingberds eyes were riveted upon something on which the firelight danced and shone i should very much misrepresent the baronets character and probably even exaggerate his capabilities if i said he blushed but certainly his countenance changed then he broke out fiercely i live as i choose sir and am answerable to no man least of all to you the parsons had their say and have got their reply long ago but am i also to be arraigned by you cannot justify yourself by any quarrel with me interrupted mr gerard i have as you say although not for the foolish reason you would mention no right to be either your judge or accuser but sir massingberd there is a god whom we have both good cause to fear so you make your own sermons i perceive exclaimed the other bitterly that is the reason is it why the good folks never see you at church cant amuses me always but religion out of your mouth is humorous indeed pray go on sir if my dear nephew can wait a little for i should be sorry to miss him altogether you were affirming i think the existence of a god i was about to urge continued mr gerard with grave severity since howsoever persons differ on religious matters they generally acknowledge a common father that if there is one crime more hateful to him than another it is the deliberate debauchery of the mind of youth i had no intention of making any particular accusation such as the sight of this flask seems to have suggested to you i know nothingbut what i guessof its history it has only been in my hands a very few minutes the person by whose means it came into this house was i believe an old gipsy woman and you are doubtless well aware how it got into her possession mr gerard paused sir massingberd who though smiling scornfully had been beating the ground with his foot here observed with a forced calmness she is a liar she is a thief and the mother of thieves did she steal this flask inquired mr gerard regarding the other attentively it has your crest upon it she did not good it was then i suppose only a igage damouri of yours a lurid light came over sir massingberds evil face for a moment i trembled for the man who dared to speak such words to him but almost instantly he recovered his usual cruel calm your sagacity mr gerard returned he is truly admirable is it the result of experience or intuition or has this old gingerfaced harridan made you her favoured confidant with your fondness for all such vagabonds i am well acquainted the reprobation of a man like you sir massingberd should be dearer than the praise of ordinary mortals but this matter does not concern myself in any way the baronet muttered something between his set teeth pshaw man continued mr gerard with unutterable scorn think not to frighten imei i am stronger than you because i am richer you are as poor as those very vagabonds whom you despise your very existence depends upon the alms of a stranger that you are unscrupulous in your revenges i do not doubt but you would have to deal in harvey gerard with one who only uses honourable weapons with an honourable foe if you did me or mine a mischief i swear to you that i would shoot you like a dog the frame of the speaker shook with contemptuous passion defiant as was his language it fell far short of the disdain expressed in his tone and manner it was not in sir massingberds nature to be overawed but his truculent features no longer maintained their grimnesstheir cruel humour he could not put aside a man like gerard with a brutal jest i do not say that he was conscious of his own inferiority but he knew that his opponent not only did not fear but actually despised him this was wormwood i am ashamed continued mr gerard after a pause to have lost my temper with you sir massingberd upon my own account i wish to have nothing in common with younot even a quarrel we were speaking of this gipsy woman and you called her thief and what not whatever may be her faults however it does not become you to dwell on them but for her and her prompt assistance your nephew would not at this moment be alive out of this very flask she administered to him so frightful an execration here broke from the baronets lips that i anticipated it to be the prelude to a personal assault upon my host mr gerard however stood quietly stirring the fire with his eyes fixed firmly but calmly on those of sir massingberd just as a mad doctor might regard a dangerous patient that is a very singular exclamation of gratitude observed mr gerard sardonically to one who has just performed youor at least iyoursiso great a service it really seems as though you almost regretted that it iwasi performed a look of deadly hatred had now taken the place of all other expressions on the baronets face it forgot even to wear its sneer i have been insulted enough i think said he with a calmness more terrible than wrath even as it is i shall scarcely be able to requite you though be sure i will do my best but with respect to my errand i am come here to see my nephew and that i will do that you shall not do sir massingberd so surely as this house is mine and who shall prevent me exclaimed the baronet contemptuously measuring his foe from head to foot not i sir indeed returned mr gerard but i will see that my servants put you out of doors by force and as he spoke he laid his hand upon the bell before night then i shall send for marmaduke and he shall be carried back to fairburn which after all is his proper home and be there nursed nursed repeated my host hoarsely nursed by the gravedigger you mean sir massingberd turned livid and sat down then as one who acts in his sleep he passed his handkerchief once or twice across his forehead how dare you speak such things to me said he looking round about him to hear you talk one would think that i had tried to murder the boy i iknowi you did cried mr gerard solemnly laying his finger upon the baronets arm if your nephew marmaduke dies his blood is on your head on mine how on mine how in the name of all the devils could i have hindered the lads horse from running away with him i will tell you how you might have suffered mr long to purchase a horse for the boy as he offered to do and not have sent to london for a confirmed runaway he rode it half a dozen times without any harm replied sir massingberd sullenly yes with a curb that would have tamed a wild horse fresh from the lasso but when you took that curb for the keepers pony riding with gun in hand for the first time in your lifeand sent your nephew forth upon that devil with a snafflebridlenay i have it yonder sirdont lie you calculated that if what you wished should happen all would be laid to chance a change of bridles is an accident like enough to happen lads are thrown from horseback every day see i track your thoughts like slime base ruffian rise begone from beneath this roof false coward sir massingberd started up like one stung by an adder yes i say coward heavens that this creature should still feel the touch of shame be off be off molest not any one within this house at peril of your lifemurderermurderer without a word without a glance of reply sir massingberd seized his hat and hurried from the room i felt some alarm lest he should make some violent effort to visit marmaduke but mr gerards countenance gave me comfort he stood quite still listening with grim satisfaction to the baronets retreating footsteps they were heard for an instant striding along the floor of the hall and then were exchanged for the sound of his horses hoofs urged to speed along the carriagedrive sir massingberd heath had met for once with his matchand more chapter ix mr harvey gerard so entirely engrossed had i been with the action and dialogue of the speakers in the preceding scene that it scarcely struck me while it was going on that i had not paid for my place in the pit in the usual fashion but was a mere eavesdropper under an orangetree so soon as sir massingberd was really gone however i became conscious of the impropriety of my situation and not wishing to own what i had done i stole noiselessly out into the garden and then reentered the conservatory and thereby the drawingroom as though i had been out of sight and hearing all the time it was not quite a chivalrous act but i do not think that the boys of my time myself included were quite so honourable and frank as mr tom brown describes those of the present day to be there was something moreover about mr harvey gerard which told me he would have loathed a listener nor would have been very ready to have accepted fear as any excuse for my conduct he was a man of noble bearing nearly six feet in height and extremely well formed he was dressed in a blue lapelled coat light waistcoat and kerseys and hessian boots these last i had not seen before upon any person and i remember them well i think they were the most graceful covering for the leg that has yet been devised although i own they may not have been so convenient as the modern knickerbockers he wore his own grey hairwhich was not very usual with persons of his rank of lifeand rather long his features were large but handsome and there was a kind of youthful blandness about them which gave his face a most agreeable expression in ordinary when excited by passion however as i had lately seen him his appearance greatly changed his thin lips parted contemptuously and showed his threatening teeth while his blue eyes gentle almost to dreaminess became bloodstreaked and almost started from their sockets as i now beheld him calmly kindling a lamp on the drawingroom table no one could have been a greater contrast than himself to the man who had just driven sir massingberd heath from the room with such a hailstorm of invective well young gentleman exclaimed he cheerfully the enemy is repulsed you see although i confess your friend the baronet is rather a formidable fellow hes uncommonly like front de boeuf i daresay you have read the new romance of ivanhoe have you not marmaduke has sir i believe replied i but i am sorry to say i am no great reader that is not well mr meredith youth is the time for reading a knowledge of books if they are sufficiently varied is halfway towards the knowledge of men it is true that a student may turn out a fool because he may have been a bookworm but the probability is greater of that misfortune befalling one who has been no great reader i would not say so much if you were older than you are and had not plenty of time before you to redeem the past there is nothing more contemptible than ignorance save perhapshere he sighedthan knowledge misapplied what a dangerous villain would that man be for instance who has just been here had his natural powers been cultivated by study as it is he rushes headlong like the bull here he turned upon me gaily did he ever toss you my young friend well sir returned i remembering that interview in the churchyard he bellowed at me once a little did he my boy did hethe cowardly brute well ive put a ring through his nose for a considerable time to come i flatter myself i ilikei a bullfight i think i should have made a capital matador cried mr gerard rubbing his hands and laughing how did youhow did you manage to iringi him sir inquired i with hesitation for i was curious to see whether mr gerard would make me a confidant of what had passed oh i watched him carefullynever took my eyes off him for a moment when he was calm in his white malice then i irritated him by waving my red flagthis silverheaded brandyflask put him in a horrible rage when he made his rushes i stood aside and let him go where he would when he had exhausted himself i stepped in and gave him the steel i wonder soliloquized mr gerard aloud as he slowly paced up and down the roomi wonder if it would be safe to give him the icoup de gracei but said i were you not afraid my dear young friend said my host with seriousness but placing his hand kindly upon my shoulder an honest man should never be afraid of a fellowcreature fear god it is written but even the king is only to be honoured it is impossible to express the grave and noble air with which mr gerard spoke those words i felt such an affectionate awe of him from that moment as no other person has ever inspired within me but continued i supposing he had made a personal assault upon you he is perfectly reckless and a much more powerful man i should think very true my young friend and indeed at one time i thought he would certainly have done it that was why i placed the poker in the fire it would not have been a romantic action but so sure as he laid finger upon me i would have played bailie nicol jarvie and burned a hole in him one might put a kailpat through it would have give me genuine pleasure burned a hole in sir massingberd cried i aghast ay that would i as it was i threatened him with my servants and had he ventured to force his way into yonder room they should have flogged him though he were ten times sir massingberd better men than he are often flogged for less offences did you hear of admiral flintherts funeral at crittenden a month ago or so you did and i daresay you were told that he was a good man and a brave sailor so it was said indeed sir replied i mr long attended the funeral out of respect and i believe a great number of gentlemen of the county yet for all that he was a bad man and a coward returned mr gerard his voice rising and his blue eyes flashing with indignation one part of the naval creedto hate the frenchit is true he did believe and acted in that faith but he omitted the other and the more important to hate the devil he loved and served the devil of his own arrogant passions he made the men miserable over whom he ruled his ship was called the floating hell when the carriage of the lordlieutenant had driven away from the church with all its load of sympathyfor there was nothing else inside itand the county gentry were rolling homewards congratulating themselves that they had paid due reverence to a gallant officer and a friend of order and good government i will tell you what happened the very evening those honoured remains were laid in their restingplace a sailor called at the house of old marks the sexton and begged to be shown the admirals coffin i have sailed with him for years said he and i have made right away from portsmouth on purpose to do this and though i cannot see his face i should like at least to look upon that which contains it now old marks did not fancy unlocking the church and descending into a damp vault beside which he had really no right to enter the last home of the flintherts without due occasion so said he i cannot admit you to where the admiral lies and certainly not at this hour it is as much as my place is worth then the sailor who was as fine and heartylooking a man said marks as need be held up half a sovereign between his finger and thumb i have been just paid off said he and will gladly give you this for your trouble while as for your scruples why dont you think the admirals family here and all his great friends who came to do him honour today would be glad enough that a poor tar should pay a humble tribute to his memory well said marks regarding i daresay the halfsovereign rather wistfully what you have just said seems certainly to alter the matter i will take you to the church and you shall see the coffin for the vault is not yet sealed so they started with a lantern and marks was for going first to show the way but the sailor went ahead saying that he knew the road blindfold for that he had been brought up in that neighbourhood and knew it well well said old marks i thought i recognized something about you although you are much changed in the last twenty years you are will moody who got into trouble with sir wentworth heath about poaching only he couldnt quite prove it agin you no returned the sailor but he went to work by a surer way than even the lawhe got me pressed when i went to visit my sister down at deal that my young friend observed mr gerard interrupting himself is a method by which not only we man our fleet but rid the country of a number of obnoxious persons yes continued the sailor i was pressed if it had not been for that i should not have sailed under admiral flinthert he spoke no more till they had entered the church and had moved away the stone which had been only dropped and not yet fastened over the mouth of the vault then they descended the steps and old marks turned his lantern on to the spot where the firstthat is the latestcoffin of the long row was lying that is the admirals said he you may read his name upon the silver plate william moody spelled it out aloud so as to be quite sure well said he i will tell you a little story about that dead man and then we will come away tell us the story when we get home replied the sexton no no man i will tell it here else you would think ill of me may be for what i am going to do now listen for a long time after i was pressed i hated and detested what i had to do and also those who gave me my orders but after a bit i got more used to the work and some of the officers i learned to like very well especially our captain i was a strong active fellow without hometies to think upon and sadden me for mother had other sons to maintain her and in that respect i was luckier than most there were pressed men on board of the same ship man whose wives and helpless children were starving because their breadwinner was taken from them and who knew not whether he was dead or alive however as i say i soon got used to my new position and became so good a sailor that i was made what is called captain of the maintop when our ship was paid off which was not however for a long time i liked the salt water so well that after i had been home for a little i volunteered to serve again my next captain was this man who lies here he was as cruel a tyrant as ever trod a quarterdeck and a terror to good and bad alike you could never please him do what you would if an officer is worth his salt at all he knows and respects those men who do their duty well under him captain flinthert knew but did not respect them on the contrary he behaved towards them as though he resented some imaginary claims on their part to his consideration i held in his ship the same position that i held in the last for it did not contain a more active sailor yet he found occasioni should rather say he made itto get me punished i swear to you that i had not committed even that slight fault which he laid to my charge if i had done so it was one for which the stopping of a days grog would have been chastisement enough this ruffianhere he smote the coffin with his clenched handordered me three dozen lashes now i had never been flogged yet and when i went to the captain with almost tears in my eyes and told him so and that i had never even been reported for misconduct he replied with a sneer that i was too good by half and that it was high time i should become acquainted with the catonine tails to prevent mistakes you shall have it at once said he call up the boatswains mate now i thought to myself in the pride of my manliness and independence that such a disgrace should never happen to william moody but that i would die first so i walked straight from that part of the deck where i had been speaking with captain flinthert and leaped from the bulwarks into the sea i believed i tried at first to drown myself but i was a strong swimmer and nature compelled me presently to strike out the cry of a man overboard had caused the boat to be lowered at once and though we had been sailing very fast i was picked up not much exhausted and almost in spite of myself as soon as i had got on board and put on dry things the captain sent for me on deck where i found the boatswains mate at the grating and all hands piped for punishment william moody said that ruffian in a mocking voice i had ordered you three dozen lashes for a certain offence but you have now committed a much graver one in endangering by your late act the life of one of his majestys sailors you will therefore now receive isixi dozen instead boatswain do your duty i was therefore tied up and punished i dont think i suffered much at the time although i was laid up in the sick ward for long afterwards i was entirely occupied with thoughts of revenge when i was able to get about again captain flinthert had got another ship and was away out of my reach i never met him again or he would not have lived to the age that is inscribed on yonder plate but as soon as i heard that he was dead i swore to come and spit upon the tyrants coffin then the sailor suited the action to the word and turned from the dishonoured corpse with a lighter step than that with which he had approached it and old marks followed him from the vault as he confessed to me himself half frightened out of his wits i do not wonder said i to mr gerard it was a terrible revenge ay but how much worse was the provocation from the very man too placed in authority of him whose duty was to foster not to oppress him verily they that are in honour and understand not are as the beasts that perish true returned i but then the wretch was dead just so young sir replied mr gerard impetuously was dead and never felt the insult the sailor felt both the insult and the lashes how is it that at your age you have already learned to be the apologist of the rich in high places nay sir i yes iyoui continued my host with vehemence your pity is for the admiral and does not descend to the captain of the maintop still added he in a milder tone i should not judge you harshly even if you so judge others you were brought up in india were you not where in the eyes of the cowering natives to be white is to be powerful and wise and all in allsave to be good great heavens what a retribution is waiting for us there again my host paced the room but this time rapidly wildly and uttering exclamations like a sibyl inspired by her god if the nabobs we see here are specimens of those who rule the east heaven help the ruled what blindness what infatuation do you know young man the very men that cause revolutions am the last to believe in them this was an observation so entirely beyond me that i could only murmur that such was doubtless the case although i did not remember having heard it remarked before it is so continued mr gerard positively and it always has been so it was so in france i suppose you have always been taught to consider the french republicans the vilest and wickedest of men and the revolution to be the mother that produced them at one monstrous birth yes when the day of reckoning comes and the ruin is undeniable democracy forsooth is blamed the taunt is hurled behold the harvest that we reap from popular government and equality whereas in truth tis neither these nor aught of wild belief ingrafted on their names by false philosophy have caused the woe but a terrific reservoir of guilt and ignorance filled up from age to age that can no longer hold its loathsome charge but bursts and spreads in deluge through the land high truth embalmed in noble verse yet no one heeds the author of those lines my friend is the greatest poet in great britain and has never possessed an income of a hundred pounds a year they say that my lord castlereagh has thirty thousandstay do you not hear wheels that must be sitwells gig i have not the patience to see him now his sycophantic officiousness in fetching sir massingberd was too contemptible how can a man who has two legs given him to stand upright upon persist in grovelling through life upon allfours heaven grant the man some noble nook for rest his soul hed rather be genteelly damned beside a duke than saved in vulgar company do you receive him mr meredith and tell him from me that it is no thanks to him that his patient is yet alive now that the siege is raised i will just step in and see how the lad is getting on my host had left the room only a few seconds when dr sitwell entered it my dear young friend exclaimed he in an excited manner what on earth has happened to sir massingberd heath he very nearly rode me down ten minutes ago on crittenden common and when i inquired after his nephew he repliedwell i cannot repeat the exact words because they are so excessively shocking why he must be out of his mind with grief i trust he did nothing impetuous nothing that is to be regretted here no sir replied i he did not thanks to our good host who withstood all his attempts to see his nephew it was however most indiscreet of you to send him hither mr harvey gerard was exceedingly annoyed by your doing so my dear young friend observed dr sitwell sinking his voice to a confidential whisper mr harvey gerard is annoyed at many things which would give most sensible persons a great deal of pleasure he would as soon admit a rattlesnake within his doors as a man of title unless indeed it be his friend sir charles wolseley by the by it is to sir charles that my dear patient mr broadacres is indirectly indebted for his wound if sir charles had not convened that revolutionary meeting at bangton mr broadacres would not have had to read the riot act and eventually got shot by mistake by his own men it is denied by the government i perceive that ball was fired by the troops at the first discharge but between ourselves such was certainly the case for i extracted the bullet from poor mr b myself and he has had to lie upon his face ever since good heavens sir what a position for a man whose family came in with the conqueror is this sir charles wolseley then of whom one reads so much in the papers a friend of mr gerards said i i have heard mr long remark that he was a very dangerous man so he is sir hell be hung some day as sure as he lives and the gentleman in whose house we stand is tarred with the same brush its terrible to think of why do you know mr meredith that mr harvey gerard goes the lengthhere the doctor looked about him to be sure that we were alone and placing his lips close to my ear whispered solemnly of wearing a white hat gracious goodness returned i why shouldnt he my father always wears a white hat in india yes but ilet me tell you thisi india is not england observed the doctor sagaciously a white hat here is the badge of radicalism republicanism atheismi dont say that mr gerard is a downright atheist but hes a sectary and thats nearly as bad and hark ye i know this for certain the only reason why henry hunt himself is not hand and glove with our friend is this that when hunt was tried for his life for sedition he came into the dock like a prudent man with a black hat and that is the one act of caution and good sense for which mr gerard has never forgiven him this sarcasm was founded on literal truth i myself remember a time when englishmen submitted to a system of oppression almost precisely similar to that which has of late driven the poles to insurrection and enlisted for them the sympathies of europenamely a forced conscription the subjects of which are iselectedi chapter x love the lifegiver it was about four oclock in the morning or nearly twelve hours after his frightful fall that marmaduke heath first woke to consciousness mr long and myself were passing the night in his apartment which was a very roomy one my tutor upon a sofa and i in a comfortable armchair i had begged that for that once at least it should be so for i knew the dear lad would like to set his eyes upon me when he first opened them dr sitwell and his assistant both agreed that if he woke at all from his heavy stertorous slumber it would be in his sane mind and it was so mr long was asleep but i had so much to think about in the occurrences and disclosures of the preceding evening that slumber had refused to visit me i was as unused as happy youth in general is to sleeplessness i did not know at that time what it is to lay head upon pillow only to think upon the morrow with a brain that has done its days work and would fain be at rest or worse only to let the past reenact itself under the wearied eyelids to watch the long procession of vanished forms again fill the emptied scenes and yet to be conscious of their unreality how different in this respect alone is the experience of age and youth and again of poverty and competence a young man in tolerable circumstances and who does not chance to be a sportsman may never have seen the sun rise that commonest of splendid spectacles to all men of humble station for my own part i had never done so in england until the occasion of which i speak and i remember it very particularly the weary time spent in listening to the various noises of the house now to those consequent upon the retiring to rest of its inmates and then to those more mysterious ones which do not begin till afterwardsthe crickets on the hearth the mice in the wainscot the complaining of chairs and wardrobes and the clocks which discourse in quite another fashion than they do in the day the slow hours consumed in watching the rushlight spots first on the floor and then on the wall and at last exchanged for the cool grey dawn stealing in through cranny and crack and showing my companions still in the land of dreams later yet the drowsy crowing of cocks and presently as the light grows and grows notwithstanding shutter and curtain the indescribably welcome song of the early robin the busy chirping of the housesparrow followed by the whole tuneful choir of birds then the lowing of cattle in the distance and the distant barking of the watchdog so strangely different from that sad and solitary howl with which the same animal breaks the awful stillness of the night about four i say as i looked for the thousandth time towards marmadukes bed i saw him sitting up supporting himself on his elbow and pushing his other hand across his brow as if trying to call to mind where he was in an instant i was at his bedside marmaduke i am here said i peter meredith i am not at fairburn hall am i asked he in a hoarse whisper no marmaduke you are amongst friends then ihei is not here gasped henowhere near he is miles away my friend and he will never come under this roof thank heaventhank heaven cried the poor boy sinking back upon the pillow it was only a dreadful dream then i shall die happy you need not talk of dying marmaduke on the contrary let us hope you are about to begin a life unshadowed natural without fear no peter i must die i feel that but what is death to what i have been dreaming do you remember that poem which came down in the box of books from mr clint last week about a wretched man that was bound upon a wild horse and sent adrift in the ukraine and then he repeated with some difficulty how fast we fled away away and i could neither sigh nor pray and my cold sweatdrops fell like rain upon the coursers bristling mane but snorting still with rage and fear he flew upon his far career at times i almost thought indeed he must have slackened in his speed but no my bound and slender frame was nothing to his angry might and merely like a spur became well peter that was i but instead of the wolves which followed upon ihisi track it was my uncle massingberd who followed imei he had chosen to kill me as the count palatine would have killed mazeppa but he wanted also to see it done all through the night i heard his feet their stealing rustling step repeat great heaven i hear them now nay marmaduke it is only i your old tutor said mr long tenderly who had not been able to leave his sofa entirely without noise you must not give way to these fancies you had a fall from panther that is all ay returned the poor boy it iwasi panther only i thought he was a wild horse and not my pony at all but though my cords were wet with gore which oozing through my limbs ran oer and in my tongue the thirst became a something fiercer far than flame that was nothing nothing to the knowledge that that man was close behind now that i am awake i feel bruised from head to heel my bones ache my head seems as though it were about to burst but that is nothing to the poor lad could not finish the sentence but exclaimed with piteous vehemencedo mr long do promise me that i shall never see him more you shall never see him more if i can help it returned my tutor with unusual energy yes i think i can promise that you never shall i well knew that so cautious a man as mr long would not have said so much without full warrant it was evident to me at once that he had heard from mr gerard all that had passed between that gentleman and the baronet in the drawingroom and was now determined to act with vigour in marmadukes behalf perhaps the coincidence of the lads dream with what had in fact occurred may have helped my tutors decision but now that he had once passed his word i felt sure that he would stand by marmaduke to the last the sick boy seemed to feel this too for he uttered many expressions of gratitude and contentment while he kept fast hold of his new protectors hand but mind marmaduke you must now make haste and get well and not give way to despondency about yourself i am going for the doctor who is sleeping in the house and whom i promised to call as soon as you awoke and peter dont you let him talk too much for a boy like that to talk of death added mr long aloud as he drew on his slippers is to go halfway to meet it marmaduke smiled feebly at this remark of his unconscious tutors and when he had left the room observed there is no need of any doctors this is my deathbed meredith i know marmaduke replied i gravely i will not listen to such dreadful things it is wrong it is wicked it will do you harm no peter there is nothing dreadful in the thing i mean and it seems to soothe me when i speak of it since i have been ill i have had a sign that tells me i must go we shall not grow up together to be friends through life as we had planned i shall watch you perhapsi hope i shalland be happy in your happiness but you will soon forget imei there will be a thousand things for you to think of there have been such even now for you while iiiit seems hard does it not peter that i should have grown up under the shadow of that man and never felt the sunshine they say that boyhood is the blithest time of life but i have never been a boy i think i could almost tell him if he stood here now how he has poisoned my young life and sent me to the grave without one pleasant memory to moisten my dying eyes yes my friend dying i have seen a vision in the night far too sweet and fear not to have been sent from heaven itself if there indeed be angels such was she they say the heaths have always ghastly warnings when their hour is come but this was surely a gentle messenger i close my eyes and see that smile once more has she hair of golden brown inquired i gravely and hazel eyes large and pitiful and does she smile sad and sweet as though ones pain would soon be over that is she that is she exclaimed marmaduke eagerly while from his heavy eyelids the light flashed forth as from a thundercloud oh tell me who and what she is her name is lucy gerard replied i quietly and we are at this moment in her fathers house marmadukes mention of her smile had revealed to me the secret alike of dream and vision he must have been dimly conscious of the catastrophe that had occurred to him throughout although he had confused himself poor fellow with mazeppa and the daughter of our host with a vision from the skies his eyes were now closed and with features as pale as the pillow on which he lay he was repeating to himself her name as though it were a prayer marmaduke said i we will talk no more since it exhausts you thus i hear mr long returning with the doctor be of good heart and keep your thoughts from dwelling yes interrupted he as though he would prevent the very mention of that grisly king of whom he had been but now conversing so familiarly i will i will it would indeed be bitter to die inowi chapter xi wooing by proxy the medical report of marmaduke heath was more than cheering it was confident one of the very best features of that young mans case is this said dr sitwell he does not give way foolish youths of his age will sometimes as it were fall in love with death until it is absolutely close beside them poor fellows when they shrink from him like the best of us you should rather say the worst of us dr sitwell observed my tutor well sir as far as my experience goes returned the doctor cheerfully and i have assisted as mr gerard here will have it at the demise of many persons of the very first respectability few of us are apt to welcome death the majority contrary to what is vulgarly believed pay him no sort of attention whatsoever and yet remarked mr harvey gerard slily he came over before the conqueror and possesses a considerable amount of land all over the country true sir true replied the doctor gravely and those are attributes which should always command respect with regard however to our young patient he seems determined notwithstanding his sufferings to be cheerful and bear up i have told him how essential it is to do so and the young gentleman is most reasonable i am sure i do not want to die i wish to live were his very wordsa most satisfactory and sensible state of mind fairburn hallhe did not say this but i knew what was passing through his brain quite wellfairburn hall and one of the oldest baronetcies in the kingdom are something to live iforithat is a great point in cases of this kind i am sure i felt thankful and glad to hear this account of my dear friend yet i could not help wishing that dr sitwell had been as correct in the cause of marmadukes clinging to life as in the fact itself for i too was stricken with love for lucy gerard and would have laid down my life to kiss her finger tip it is the fashion now to jeer at that which is called first love as though affection were not worth having until it has first exhausted itself upon a score of objects nay perhaps the thing itself is as extinct as the dodo in my day however the great threehundredayear marriagequestion was not yet broached and gentlemen did not complainingly publish their rejections at the hands of the fair sex in the times newspaper nearly half a century has passed over my head since the time of which i write and has not spared its snows and yet i swear to you my old heart glows again and on my withered cheek there comes a blush as i call to mind the time when first i met that pure and fair young girl the worship of a lad is never lasting it is said although i know not upon what authoritysociety so seldom permitting the experiment to be made that the idictumi can hardly be established but while it does last at least how clear and steady is the incense how honest is the devotion how complete the sacrifice since i have been an old fogey it has been confided to me by more than one ancient flirt that they still experience a rapture when they chance to catch the affection of a boy they are kinder to him than they are to older men they let him down easy they respect the infatuation which they themselves have long lost the power of entertaining how delicious then must such a conquest be to a maiden of seventeen i claim for myself the possession of no tenderer nor truer feelings than other lads but i know that a queen might have accepted the hearthomage which i paid to lucy gerard and never was fealty more disinterested i have written down not a little to my discredit let me then say this much in my own favour from the moment that marmaduke heath spoke to me as he did upon his bed of sickness of our hosts daughter i determined within myself not only to stand aside and let him win her if he could but to help him by all means within my power if he lived for her alone should i endeavour to slay him if a promise however distant of a bright and happy future seemed at length to be held out for him whose life had been so saddened and so bitter should i strive to make it void i could not iaffordi to lose her no i would have given all that i had in the world to hear her whisper i love you i would have beggared myself i say for those mere words but could ihei poor lad afford the loss of her so well doubtless in modern eyes we both appear mere foolish victims of calflove green hobbardyhoys dazzled with the first flutter of a petticoat as for me let it be so received and welcome although my young male readers this is to be said you never saw lucy gerard otherwise you would wonder little at mywell at my poor folly but with respect to marmaduke it must be admitted that his was not an ordinary case although a boy in years he had long been sitting on the shores of old romance and had probably more of the divine faculty for love within him than all the ardent souls of fiveandthirty put together who are at this moment turning their eyes about them for a suitable young person with whose income to unite their own since his mother died he had scarcely beheld a virtuous woman with the exception of dear mrs myrtle the housekeeper at the rectory whose appearance was calculated to excite respect rather than the sentimental emotions and now he had suddenly been brought face to face with one whose equal for form and feature for gentleness and graciousness for modesty and courage these eyes have never yet beheld i have done there shall be no more ecstasies reader an old man thanks you that you have borne with his doting garrulity even thus long since the days of earl athelwold and probably long before them the wooing by proxy has been held to be a perilous undertaking we cannot take the fingers of a fair lady within our own and say this is not my hand at all as though we were bishop berkeley or still more this is somebody elses hand which it manifestly is not if credit is to be given to such protestations at all there is no knowing where to stop and yet we must be doing something tender or we are not performing our duty as deputy but how tenfold are the dangers of this enterprise when the delegate of another has at one time contemplated performing the mission in question upon his own account of this perilalthough fully determined to speak a good word for marmadukei was well aware i even considered within myself whether it would not be safer upon the whole to return at once to fairburn rectory lest i should do my friend an involuntary wrong yes i was walking in the garden at the dovecot after breakfast considering this when i came upon lucy gerard herself and flight became impossible to me being mortal i was pacing a winding path that ran beside the lawn but was hidden from it by a glittering wall of laurel and lo there she stood unconscious of my advent besidewhat a statue a sundial no a rosetree striving upwards by help of a little cross of white marble her face was westward so that the morning sun shone like a glory on the wealth of hair that rippled down her shoulders beside her indoor garments she wore only a little braided apron full of pockets that held scissors pruningknife the thing which is called bass i believe and other horticultural weapons and on her head the tiniest strawhat with a brim obviously intended to shelter more than onea perfect gardensaint and at her prayers for while i looked she knelt upon the grassborder to shake some insect from a rose i at first thought or remove a faded leaf and so with bowed head remained for several minutes when she arose and saw me hesitating whether to advance or retreat she blushed a little but in her usual quiet tone begged me not to be disturbed you could not know that this is forbidden ground here it was my fault who ought to have told you our own folks all know it and so few guests ever come to the dovecot that it never struck me mr meredith to give you a trespass notice but since i am here miss gerard and the intrusion has been mademost innocently i assure youmay i not be suffered to satisfy what believe me is not a mere vulgar curiosity i do not think returned the young lady with some hesitation that my father would object to your knowing our little secret you are going to remain with us some time he hopes andyes i am sure you will respect what with us is held so secret this cross and rosetree are set above my little sisters grave see that is what we used to call herlittle ella she of whom i spoke to you in the drawingroom yesterday i daresay my stupid face exhibited more of astonishment than sympathy no wonder thought i that the doctor called mr gerard a sectary and that mr long was so cold and distant in his manner you seem surprised mr meredith that my father should have acted thusshould have placed the tomb of his dear child where he can always come to weep and pray at it and not amid the long dank grasses in crittenden churchyard is it so very rare a thing to bury those we love elsewhere than in a churchyard i only know one other instance said i and that is in the heath family indeed replied miss gerard gravely moving away as though not wishing to converse of ordinary things in that sacred neighbourhood i trust we have but little in common with ithemi truly i can scarcely imagine that you and they are of the same species replied i with irrepressible admiration you who do not even know what wickedness is what i oh but i am sometimes very very wicked i assure you replied miss gerard she looked so serious nay so sad that i could have taken up her little hand and kissed it there and then to comfort her but would such a course of conduct assist poor marmaduke thought i and fortunately in time there is one of the heath family said i at all events whose good qualities will go far to atone for the shortcomings of his adversaries if he only lives to exercise them that if he only lives i considered to be very diplomatic it was enlisting a tender sympathy for his perilous condition to start with dr sitwell says that there is little danger replied miss gerard quietly i know better observed i confidentially his life or death hangs upon a thread a chance good heavens mr meredith what can you mean the brain we are assured is quite uninjured my dear miss gerard returned i it is not his brain that is affected it is his heart his recovery i am positively certain depends upon you upon me mr meredith replied she while a blush sprung from neck to forehead on the instant as though a white rose should become a red oneupon imei yes dear young lady that is upon you and your good father this lad will find here for the first time in his young life peace and tendernessa new existence if you only choose will expand around him such as he has never even dreamt of i do not ask you to be kind to him for you cannot be otherwise than kind but consider his sad conditionfatherless motherless and having for his only relative a wretch whose atrocity is unspeakable what reason has he to wish for life but you you may teach him to feel that existence has something else to offer than sorrow and shame and fear alas sir i am nothing returned miss gerard but if your friend desire a teacher to whom fear and shame are unknown and whom sorrow has rendered wise not sad he will find one in my dear father oh mr meredith if you knew him as i know him how tender he is as well as strong you would go straight to ihimi what i have of help within me if i have anything is derived from him alone there are some maladies said i against which not the most skilful physician can avail without a gentle nurse to smooth the pillow i am sure i need say no more except to assure you that what ever kind offices you may bestow upon marmaduke heath will not be wasted upon an unworthy object he is most honourable generous warmhearted and very fortunate interrupted miss gerard cordially in having a friend to be thus enthusiastic for him in his absence her eyes sparkled with pleasure and she held out her hand frankly as she spoke i took it and pressed it for an instant a shock of joy passed through my frame my whole being trembled with ecstasy passion took me by storm and for one glorious moment held the very citadel of my soul but it was for the last time believe me marmaduke the last time in all my life fifty years have come and gone with their full share of pleasure and pain but have never brought a moment of bliss like that nor such icy despair as the thought of thee my friend caused to succeed it i write not in selfpraise i was not so mad as to suppose that lucy gerard would have ever stooped to love peter meredith when once she had known marmaduke heath if he had so endeared himself to imei a selfish boy who knew not half his gifts or at least knew not how to value themthat i thus rudely broke my own brief lovedream for his sake would he not draw iheri towards him laden with all her wealth of heart and brain as the moon draws the wave it was so afterwards but i knew it then as though it had already been yet marmaduke yet i gave you something for it was all i had when i laid at your feet to form a steppingstone for you my own heart you trod upon it my dear and faithful friendbut thank heaven you never knew that you did so i wonder whether lucy ever knew chapter xii the council of war on the second morning after our arrival at the dovecot mr long called me into the diningroom where i found mr gerard and a third gentleman who had come down by the nightmail as i understood from london although i should think not less than seventy years of age he was dressed in the height of the then prevailing mode he wore a snuffcoloured coat the tails of which trailed from his chair upon the ground whenever he was so fortunate as not to be sitting upon them the brass buttons at his back were nearly as large as the handles of an ordinary chest of drawers a bunch of seals each about the size of that peculiar to the lord high chancellor of great britain dangled from his fob his pantaloons which seemed to have shrunk in the washing set off a pair of legs that were still not uncomely but what was most remarkable was an enormous muslin cravat which in combination with the ruffles of his shirt gave him the aspect of a pouter pigeon unaccustomed as i then was to the toilet of persons of distinction mr clint of russell squarefor he it wasmade a very strong impression upon me as the family lawyer of the heaths and one who had always greatly interested himself in marmaduke he had been sent for by my tutor to give his opinion as to what steps should be taken respecting the future disposal of the poor lad i guessed by his grave face that he had been put in possession not only of all that had happened through the agency of sir massingberd but of all that had been designed to happen if you have any doubt still remaining mr clint as to the propriety of removing marmaduke heath from the custody of his uncle observed my tutor after introducing me to this venerable beau i think this gentleman can dissipate it now peter tell us in confidence what sort of footing do you consider your young friend and sir massingberd to stand upon are they good stop stop mr long interrupted the lawyer taking an enormous pinch of snuff from a silverbox and holding up his laden fingers in a prohibitory manner we must not have any leading questions if you please mr meredith it is most important that you state to us the truth without mitigation or exaggeration you heard your tutors first inquiry which was a most correct one how does mr marmaduke heath stand with respect to his uncle well sir said i quietly he stands as it were upon the brink of a deep river with his back towards a person who is bent upon pushing him in a total silence ensued upon this remark mr long and mr gerard interchanged very meaning glances very good returned the lawyer coolly administering half the snuff to his nose and dropping the other half among his shirtruffles that is a form of speech i suppose by which you would imply that marmaduke is afraid of his uncle very much said i afraid of his life and you have had no previous conversation upon this subject with either of these gentlemen that isyou must forgive me if i press this somewhat hardlythey have never asked your opinion on the matter before certainly not sir you are speaking too i conclude from your own observation of course from your own knowledge of mr marmaduke heaths sentiments and position and not from any hearsay rumour i am perfectly convinced mr clint returned i gravely that sir massingberd heath wishes to get rid of his nephew and that marmaduke knows it then sir massingberd shall be gratified observed mr gerard with energy he shall get rid of him from this day stop stop my dear sir interposed the lawyer even supposing that all this is true both the facts that i have received from you and mr long and the surmises entertained by this young gentleman we are still only at the threshold of the matter from the manner in which sir massingberd expressed himself when he wrote to me to demand the custody of the boy and from his whole conduct since i am certain that he will not give up his position as guardian without a severe struggle we must steadily look our difficulties in the face supposing that having been assured of marmadukes convalescence he should send a postchaise over here next week or the week after with a note insisting upon his immediate return to fairburn park what is to be done then i should send the postchaise back again returned mr gerard calmly with the verbal reply that mr marmaduke was not coming but suppose he wrote to marmaduke himself the reply would come from me all the same mr clint but if sir massingberd appeals to the law he dare not exclaimed my host his audacity great as it is stops short of that if he did as sure as the sun is shining i would meet him with the charge of attempted murder mr clint took out of his other coattail a second snuffbox which he never made use of except in cases of great emergency you are prepared to go that length are you i am sir returned mr gerard firmly you have not a shadow of foundation for such an assertion pursued mr clint reflectively the slander will be pronounced malicious you will be cast in swingeing damages that is possible remarked my host but there nevertheless will be such revelations of sir massingberds mode of life as may well cause the chancellor to reflect whether fairburn hall is a fitting educational establishment for a minor john lord eldon is not an ascetic i know it sir broke forth mr gerard i am well aware that he is a heartless scoundrel as dissipated as dishonest and sir interrupted mr clint with irritation i will not listen to such mad words you may utter them of course in your own house but not to me this is the talk of those who would subvert all authority they are not afraid to speak evil of dignities murmured my tutor i do not speak evil of dignities my dear sir but only of the rogues who fill them exclaimed mr gerard laughing however i beg your pardon gentlemen the remark escaped me quite involuntarily you are aware mr clint that my lord eldon is not absolutely an ascetic i was about to say sir observed the old lawyer stiffly that his lordship is not so tenderly alive to the necessity of moral training as some of his friends would wish and he has a strong respect for natural authority he would lean therefore towards sir massingberds view of the questionwith whom indeed he is personally not unacquaintedand be induced to palliate his way of life sadder than orphans yet not fatherless are those in eldons charge murmured mr gerard still continued he in a louder tone the charge of attempted murder mr clint would have this effect that even if marmaduke were reconsigned to his uncles carewhich heaven forbidthe eyes of the world would be upon sir massingberd and he would not venture to work him a mischief in the meantime it rests with us to take good care that he has not the chance of doing so and now resumed mr clint after a pause supposing that all is arranged thus far to repel sir massingberds claims there is another matter to be considered it would take long to explain the details of the case but you must understand that the heath property is very peculiarly situated sir massingberd who is in the enjoyment of it for life cannot raise a shilling upon it while marmaduke does not possess a shilling although the prospective heir of such vast wealth they would be in short at present a couple of beggars but by a special arrangement with a certain person whom i need not name a small annual sum has been allotted for the benefit of the boy but practically quite as much so for that of his uncle a certain annuity i say is paid to sir massingberd for the maintenance of his nephew and another solely on the latters behalf for that of the estate it is a most beautifully intricate affair from first to last pursued the lawyer with unction here are two relatives who mutually support one another and have yet every reason looking at the matter in a rather worldly way of course to wish each other dead sir massingberd could borrow plenty of money if the usurers were only confident that he could as well as would make away with his nephew there would be even less difficulty under ordinary circumstances in procuring a loan for marmaduke but a delicate boy whose uncle and guardian is bent upon putting a violent end to himyou see that renders the security so very slight altogether it is certainly one of the nicest cases it is not only a question of responsibility there are always plenty of people ready to take any amount of ithati at a sufficient premium but who will undertake the pecuniary charge of the lad if he is withdrawn from his uncles roof sir massingberd of course will never give up one tittle of the allowance entrusted to him to expend except upon such compulsion as we should scarcely venture to employ there are three years wanting to the boys majority and even when he has arrived at that and should be willing to promise ample repayment he may die before his uncle still who has a constitution of adamant when those who have maintained him may whistle for the money they have expended the expression may be coarse added mr clint apologetically but i think it conveys my meaning i thank you mr clint observed my tutor after a little pause for putting this matter before us so bluntly and decidedly for my part i am far from being a rich man but on the other hand there are no persons who have a better claim upon my resources than my dear young friend and pupil marmaduke heath that he will repay me if he survives his uncle i am more than assured and if he die early i shall not regret that the remainder of his young life has been rendered happy through my means although it may have cost me a few comforts i stooped down and said a few words in my tutors ear no peter no continued he you are a good lad and your father is doubtless generous enough to comply with your wishes but we must not resort to such a distant source in this emergency indeed mr clint do you think that a hundred and forty to a hundred and sixty pounds a year might be made sufficient to keep marmaduke with respectability half your annual stipend eh mr long eh ejaculated the lawyer bless my soul how this snuff gets in ones eyes such a sum should be quite sufficient i think that would be found more than enough he cannot live at your rectory of course that would be almost as bad as at the hall but there are plenty of spare rooms in my house in town he has stayed there before so that that can be done we know marmaduke and i are old friendsno no it will not hurt me such a course cannot bring me into greater antagonism with sir massingberd than i am in already i am always at daggersdrawn with him he is for ever cutting down trees that dont belong to him or selling heirlooms that are no more his than mine or embroiling himself with me the appointed guardian of the property in some way or other yes ill take the lad mr long come what will of it you will do nothing of the kind exclaimed my host energetically you honest lawyer and very worthy man and you you good priestcontradictions in terms both of youyou shall not give away half your annual stipend or my name is not harvey gerard i have done each of you a very grievous wrong in thought if not in word and i hereby beg your pardon it is possible i perceive to be a tory and yet preserve if not a conscience at least a heart my tutor smiled mr clint bowed his acknowledgments with regard to mr marmaduke heath however pursued our host that young gentleman must be my especial charge from this day until the period when he comes into his property or lies in need of decent interment as the case may be he is my guest or if my house is distasteful to him i will advance him whatever sums he may reasonably require for his maintenance elsewhere please to consider that that is settled gentlemen whatever we may think of the political opinions of mr harvey gerard observed mr clint with feeling his name has always been associated with acts of matchless generosity always always echoed mr long then added reflectively he has paid the fines of half the rogues in the country and bailed the other half who have been committed to prison a simultaneous burst of merriment from his three hearers greeted this naive remark of my unconscious tutor i have done so upon one occasion i confess replied mr gerard goodnaturedly i became surety in for the good behaviour of a poor birmingham rioter as i thought who turned out to be a government spy however i assure you generosity has nothing to do with my present intentions with respect to young heath my income is sufficiently large to admit of my accommodating the poor lad with ease even if the repayment sooner or later were not almost certain as it really is but besides all this i must confess that the undertaking affords me exceeding satisfaction mr long you are i have heard an enthusiastic fisherman that is no common pleasure which you feel when your rod is bowed by some enormous trout cunning and strong who may break the whole of your tackle and get away after all but who also may be landed helpless on the bank a victim to your skill and patience that is exactly the sport which i promise myself with sir massingberd heath if he were one whit less greedy less formidable less pitiless i should feel less hostility towards him he has fortunately no redeeming point i have hated tyranny all my life and i hate this man who seems to be the very embodiment of it he makes his boast that no one has ever stood between himself and his wicked will let us see what he will make of harvey gerard the speaker drew himself up proudly but certainly not with unbecoming pride his form dilated as he spoke his voice grew deep without losing its distinctness and into his mild eyes a sternness crept as when the frost congeals the lake but for a spice of haughtiness which to some might have appeared even arrogance he could have stood for st michael in his contest with the foul fiendhave personified the spirit of good defying the spirit of evil chapter xiii the gipsy camp after not a little opposition upon the part of mr long who would have willingly borne his share in marmadukes expenses it was settled that mr gerard should be the young mans host if he could only contrive to retain him in defiance of the power of sir massingberd his home however was not to be the dovecot which was judged to be too much exposed by its proximity to fairburn to the machinations of the enemy the gerards were to remove to their town residence in harley street as soon as their guest was fit to accompany them at first his progress was tedious but he grew rapidly convalescent as soon as he was able to exchange his bed for a sofa never was sick man more hospitably treated or so graciously tended mr gerard possessed that almost feminine gentleness of manner which is generally found in persons of his peculiar organization his sympathy at least as easily aroused as his antagonism was now deeply enlisted in favour of marmaduke for his own sake he recognized his talents and the beauty and tenderness of his mind and won him by pleasant studious talk from the melancholy that overhung it and the young mans heart thrilling response to every touch of kindness turned towards him and expanded like a flower in the sun as for lucy what rudest health would i not have exchanged for marmadukes languor as he lay and listened to her clear sweet voice now singing some cheerful ballad to enliven him now reading aloud some tale so musically that itself seemed song he could read to himself but little as yet and if he did take up a book his eyes refused to regard it but followed the lovely girl wherever she moved with worship this happiness is too great to last peter he would often say it will all fade one day i know and leave me desolate what man living is worthy to possess yon glorious creature i feel as though i had no right even to love her yet great heaven how i idoi love her how unconscious she is of her perfect sweetness how she graces the meanest thing which she may set herself to do her presence seems to breathe very life into me i then forget everything but hereven sir massingberd to return to him would be death indeeddeath death then he would sink back as if prostrated with the thought and so remain despairingly despondent until he heard lucys voice or laugh or footstep all this was bitter for me to bear i was glad when mr long suggested to me that he thought it was no longer necessary for me to remain with marmaduke and that i should return to fairburn rectory and my studies still my heart was heavy upon that morning which was to be the last i was to spend under the same roof with lucy gerard within the last few weeksnay it happened in a few hoursi had loved and i had lost if there be any to read this in whose eyes these words have meaning they will pity me i do not match such grief indeed for a single instant against the sorrow a man must feel for the loss of the loved companion of his life against the lone wretchedness of recent widowhood but it is a grievous blow i wished marmaduke and mr gerard goodbye without quite knowing that i did so goodbye mr meredith said lucy and though her voice was even lower and sweeter than usual it wounded me like a knife why dont you call him peter lucy exclaimed her father laughing i think it would be more civil now that we are going to lose him thank you sir said i gratefully and she did say god bless you peter very very kindly ever since that morning she called me so but i was peter to all of them you see as well as to her then i called her lucy and though for the first and last time i shall never forget it i couldna say mair but just fare ye weel lucy yet that i will mind till the day that i dee then i mounted my horse my luggage having already preceded me and slowly took my way towards fairburn my lifeblood seemed to ebb with every step the clang of the gate that shut me out from the last foot of ground belonging to the dovecot sent a shudder through me like a knell i was on the very spot where marmaduke had met with the accident that had been so nearly fatal supposing it had killed him supposingi thanked god that i was able to thank him from an honest heart that it had not done so then i felt a little better having ascended the hill i put my horse into a sharp canter upon the common and the cool air through which i swiftly passed refreshed me the hollow in which the encampment had been was now deserted and only the round bare spot amid the green which is the gipsy autograph announced that it had ever been there some miles further on however a little brownlegged boy evidently of that wandering fraternity suddenly emerged from a fir plantation and stood before me in the road as if to beg i was already feeling in my pocket for a penny when showing his white teeth in gratitude he shook his head and coming close to my stirrup exclaimed you are the gentleman from mr gerards sir are you not would you please to come and see granny rachel in an instant i remembered the pocketflask which i had entirely forgotten since the day in which it came into my possession for all i knew it was then lying yet in the drawingroom at the dovecot yes my boy that will i returned i but i fear i have not brought her what she wants he looked up in the bright interrogative manner peculiar to his tribe so different to the stolid wonder of the agriculturist she wants iyoui sir as i understood this is the sixth day that she has set me to watch for you by this roadside will you please to follow me the boy started off at a pace which compelled me to move too fast for further questioning and skirting the plantation for a hundred yards stopped at the entrance of a roadway leading through the wood the coming winter had not yet turned the broad green track to sand and it ran so straight and far that the pine trees seemed to stand on either sidea solid wallwith nothing but the blue heaven for their limit this landscape of right lines would have delighted a painter of the preraphaelite school it looked so stiff and unnatural but pursuing the track for a little distance and then plunging over a ditch and bank into the plantation itself we suddenly came upon a scene which would have suited morland a low tent with halfnaked but merry children crawling in and out a sheass and her foal a handsome male epicurean lying on his back smoking a short wellcoloured pipe the hue of which precisely resembled that of his own skin a young girl in scarlet mantle and with earrings of great splendour gathering fircones to feed the flames which licked around an iron pot suspended on four sticks piled musketfashion and an old crone sitting by the same and picking the feathers from a bird which had the time of year been beyond the end of september i should have certainly taken for a henpheasant but to suppose this would have been to suppose an infraction of the game laws the walnutstained children stopped their play as i approached and stood in various attitudes of wonder like beauteous bronzes the man turned over on his side and opened his slumbrous eyes a hairbreadth the girl flashed one quick comprehensive glance upon me and then resumed her occupation the old woman nodded familiarly without rising and observed quietly so you are come at last peter meredith i trust you have brought good news of marmaduke heath he is better said i much better and he knows who brought him help and is very grateful you have been expected daily at the dovecot where something more substantial than mere thanks is waiting for you rachel liversedge desires neither silver nor gold returned the old woman she has had her reward already if what you say be true it was not for love of the boy that i acted as i did he has too much evil blood in him to earn my liking but i am glad as though he were my own son that he will live carew cried she triumphantly no wonder iburai sir massingberd looked ikaloi as ourselves oh the great man looks black does he said i the old woman dropped the bird the girl her fircones and both stared wildly at me as though my voice had come from the clouds the man sprung to his feet and uttered a cry of wonder what do you speak our tongue cried he nay you speak mine returned i calmly iburai is great and ikalai which you call ikaloi is black of course everybody knows that who knows hindustanee then the three burst out together in a language one word out of four of which seemed to be more or less familiar to me as for understanding what they said of course it was simply impossible but no matter i had established my reputation from that moment i felt myself to be the honoured guest of the family would i smoke would i eat would i drink i was thirsty and i said that i would gladly take some waterwhich at a venture i called ipaincei ipauncei cried they extravagantly delighted he talks like a true cingari and only look is he not darkskinned the few words that my old ayah had taught me in india had thus procured me a hearty welcome in a midshire firplantation sit down by me peter meredith my son exclaimed the old woman and do you fetch him water mina i dismounted and did as i was bid while the young girl took a pitcher and presently brought it filled from a running stream near by and offered it to me like another rebecca but her grandmotherfor such she wascried stop let me put something in it and produced from her pocket the selfsame flask which she herself had given me a few weeks ago and which i had thought was left behind at the dovecot why i was blaming myself for not having brought you that thing back today said i i never heard of your coming to claim it nor did i young gentleman returned the old woman proudly harvey gerard is too kind a man to visit when one is not in need that was why i left his house that day directly i had told what had befallen marmaduke heath i did not wish him to think i waited for my reward he returned me this with his own hands he is not one of your proud ones when we had the fever heremina darling you remember who came to see you and saved your life ah yes cried the girl clasping her dark hands which gleamed with tawdry rings and his daughter too how i love her there was a little pause i felt my ears tingle my cheeks burn i did not dare look up from the ground lucy gerard is very fair whispered the old woman she will make a good and loving wife then she added roguishly and in that gipsy tone which smacks so of the racecourse shall i tell your fortune my pretty gentleman no i thank you said i hastily i have no great confidence in your information as to the future with respect to the past on the other hand you can doubtless satisfy me if you will i have a great curiosity to know how you became possessed of yonder flask with the heath griffin peter meredith returned the old woman very gravely you have asked me to tell you a sad story and one to relate which will cost me much it is not our custom however to refuse the first request of a new friend but before i begin let me ask you a question in my turn has it never struck you why sir massingberd heath has not long ago taken to himself a young wife and begotten an heir for the bonny lands of fairburn in despite of his nephew until that moment the idea had never crossed my brain but no sooner was it thus mooted than i wondered greatly at the shortsightedness of those among whom marmadukes affairs had been so lately discussed and in particular at that of mr clint who as a lawyer should surely have at once foreseen such a contingency well said i i confess that for my part i have never thought of it but there cannot be much danger of sir massingberds becoming a wooer now why what young woman would be won by such as he what young woman would inoti be won replied rachel liversedge grimly think you that his white head and stony heart would weigh too heavy in the balance against his title and the reversion of his lands remember all that is around us and all that we could see from yonder hill to the right hand and to the leftpasture and cornfield farm and parkwould fall to the offspring of her who would venture for a few years to be lady heath peter there is one maiden in midshire known to you and me who would not consent to do this thing though the offer were thrice as splendid but i doubt if there be more than one if that be so said i why does not sir massingberd marry the answer to that is the story i am about to tell you returned rachel chapter xiv why sir massingberd did not marry i suppose you have heard peter meredith young as you are began the old woman a great deal of illspeaking against us wanderers we not only kill game but even domestic poultry if the opportunity is given to us we not only steal wood but horseflesh and since we are so partial to carrion it is not to be wondered at that we sometimes suffocate a sheep with a piece of his own wool in order to get the carcass cheap from the farmer yet whatever false charges are current about us now these are nothing either in gravity or number to what they were when i was a young girlthat is fifty years ago every mans hand every womans tongue was against us magistrates committed us without testimony rogues made a trade of accusing us solely to get bloodmoney our name was more than a byword it was a brand to call a man a gipsy was to say vagabond and thief in one under these circumstances massingberd heath left his fathers house yonder and came to live with us as congenial company we were in this very wood the day he did so the sun shone as brightly as now the streamlet ran just as blithe the air was filled as now with the sweetsmelling pine the people only are changedah me how changedwho made up that scene there was my father he died ten years younger than i am now is not that strange boy his brother morris dead poor stanley carew you shall hear of him presently a handsomer lad by far than his nephew there my beautiful sinnamenta compared to little mina yonder though she is pretty enough like a blushrose to a mere peony the flower of womankind if there are ladies and women born into the world then she was a lady there are no such beauties now no friend not even at the dovecot let me see i have counted four then i was there also comely enough twas said but not to be spoken of for looks with my younger sister we were occupied pretty much as you see us now for life in the greenwood possesses but little variety when massingberd heath strode in among us with his gun upon his shoulder we knew him well but were not inclined to dislike him he was a dissipated wild young fellow but as yet his heart was thought as the saying is to be in the right place his popularity however was principally owing to his antagonism to his father sir wentworth had long passed through the spendthrift stage and was very close with respect to moneymatters a harsh and griping landlord and it is probable enough a niggard parent his sons extravagances were at that time insignificant compared to what they afterwards became yet the old man was for ever complaining he persecuted all who were poor and in his power but the gipsies especially he feared for his deer for his game for his fences and besides i verily believe he detested us for our improvidence i remember he sent two of my young brothers to prison for tossing for halfpence upon a sundayhe who made not even a pretence of religion himself and had been used invariably to pass his day of rest in town at tattersalls betting his thousands on some approaching race it is said that this wretched old man used to horsewhip young massingberd almost daily until a certain occasion when the latter found himself stronger than he imagined and reversed the process after that sir wentworth confined himself to cursing his offspring whenever they quarrelled it was after some dreadful outbreak of passion on the part of the old man that massingberd heath left house and home and elected to join our wandering fortunes we were very unwilling that this should be it was by no means so unusual a proceeding then as now for persons of good birth but broken fortunes to become gipsies but such had usually their private reasons for remaining so for life they were very rarely criminals but generally social outlaws for whom there could be no reconciliation at home or younger sons of respectable families with quite a mountain of debt upon their shoulders these were regularly nationalized among us and if they conducted themselves for sufficient time in accordance with our regulations they were permitted to intermarry with us now it was certain that massingberd heath sought only a temporary home as soon as his father died or even offered terms to him he would leave us and resume his proper station moreover how was the maintenance of discipline and obedience to the chief of our tribe absolutely essential as it is to be kept up in the case of this newcomer even at that time he was a headstrong wilful man to whom all authority however lawful or natural was hateful was it to be expected that he who defied his own father himself a man of iron will would obey morris liversedge on the other hand uncle morris rather liked the young fellow he had connived at many a raid on his fathers own preservesto such a pitch had the quarrel grown between themand kept our pot boiling with bird and beast many and many a time had he led the fairburn keepers to one extremity of the preserves while the slaughter was going on in the other moreover it would be of great importance could we make a friend of the man who would one day own all these pleasant haunts of ours and who could say a good word and a strong one for the poor persecuted gipsies when it was needed poor morris did not know that the rebel but too often turns out a tyrant when he gets his chance he could not foresee sir massingberd heath sending folks to prison or getting them kidnapped and sent across the seas for snaring the hares that he held so cheaply when they did not happen to belong to himself if you want to find a gentleman who in his youth and landless has been a poacher whenever the opportunity offered look you among the gamepreservers on the bench of justices this however is among the least of the basenesses of him of whom i speak it is not for his bitter guardianship of bird and beast or his hateful oppression of his fellowcreatures that my heart cries out for judgment against this man that i look with eager longing for that hour when god shall take him into his own hand the old woman paused a moment with closed eyes and muttered something that was inaudible to me rocking herself at the same time to and fro massingberd heath became one of us peter meredith as far as it is possible for such a wretch to be so he ate with us and drank with us which they say is a sacred bond among even savages it was not so with him he cast his evil eyes upon sinnamenta to love her after the fashion of his accursed race perhaps you may think peter meredith that such an occurrence should have been foreseen by her father or her uncle morris and for my part i always thought that it was the presence of my lovely sister which mainly caused this man to join our company but at all events neither they nor i dreaded any ill consequences a gipsy girl is not a lightoflove maiden like those of fairer skins heaven who gives her beauty gives her virtue also this is not denied even by our enemies when you call your sweetheart gipsy it is in love not in reproach massingberd heath knew this well and therefore it was foe took such pains in the matter it is true that we do not marry in church but when we wed among ourselves the marriage is not less sacred it was a wedding of this sort indissoluble by one party but not by the other which this man wished to compass he did not gain his end the old womans eyes sparkled with triumph for a moment as she said these words but her voice sank low as she continued peter meredith if you have a sister think of her while i speak of mine she cannot be more pure than little sinnamenta nor less designing her weakness was one common to all women but especially to those of our unhappy race she was fond of fineryfine clothing jewels shawls they became her she looked like any princess when attired in them stanley carew who loved her in all honesty could give her no such costly gifts as massingberd heath showered upon her and to help his end even upon me the gipsys ragged coat looked mean and poor beside that of our guest this man too whom you know but as a scowling tyrant with a face scarred with passion and excesses was then a handsome youth you smile peter at the wonder of it it is however not less true than that the wrinkled hag to whom you are now listening was then a bonny girl imagine ithati peter and you can imagine anything ah time time surely at the end of you there will be something to recompense us for all that you have taken away once more rachel liversedge paused as if in pain then with eyes whose sight seemed to receive but little of what was present but were fixed on the unreturning past continued as follows yes massingberd heath was handsome enough unless when enraged his wrath always brought the horseshoe out upon his forehead ay and he was agreeable enough too he could smile as though he had a heart and vow as though he owned a god by his devilish art he managed to ingratiate himself with sinnamenta he caused her to treat poor stanley ill and then pretending to take his part got credit for generosity there are many who call us gipsies a base people yet this excess of meanness was quite new to us my little sisterthat was what i always called her because i loved her soshe believed him she would have trusted to his word and married him according to our rites and been his wife and drudge for all her life but since this could not be without the consent both of her father and morris he had to ask it of them he might as well have asked it of sir wentworth they had got to know him well by close companionship for men fathom men better than women doeven gipsy women who foretell mens fortunes for themand they answered no they did not believe that he had the least intention of being with us longer that it suited him and they peremptorily refused his request after one burst of passionate threats the young man pretended to yield assent to their decision morris was inclined to think this acquiescence genuine but my father more warmly interested in the matter and therefore perhaps less credulous kept on his guard finding out that massingberd heath had secretly made overtures of reconciliation to his father and missing him one night from the camp he caused morris to strike tent at once and before morning we had put twenty miles between us and fairburn nor was this effected too soon for as we heard long afterwards the constables were searching this very wood for us at daybreak our company was bound on a long travel to kirkyetholm roxburghshire one of the few places in scotland although but one mile from the frontier of northumberland where the gipsies reside in any number there we should meet with friends and be safe from all molestation it was late in the year to travel so far and into such a climate but there was no help for it and moreover some of the carews had a house there to which stanley said we should be welcome and so it turned out i believe sinnamenta would rather that we had camped out of doors even in that northern clime so disinclined was she to be beholden to him or his friends after what had happened although she did not dare to say so poor stanley imagined that now we had removed from the neighbourhood of his rival he might renew his suit with success but the proud girl would not listen to him she did not exactly pine after the man whose wiles she had so narrowly escaped but her life seemed henceforth saddened the domestic duties which had hitherto sat so lightly upon her became burdensome and she set about them languidly the whole of the time we remained at kirkyetholm and it was many many months she never mentioned massingberd heath but never ceased to think of him it was fated that she was to be undeceived about that man too late i am reminded by a friendly critic of the suspicious coincidence of a horseshoe on the forehead in the case of redgauntlet i never think of sir massingberd without thinking of that worthy and it has been a matter of doubt with me whether sir walter scott might not himself have seen the squire of fairburn and drawn him from the lifeboth as to mind and featurein his famous novel chapter xv the reason continued about a year after our departure from fairburn sinnamenta and i had been to sell some baskets the making of which was a great trade with us at that time at wooler in northumberland and on our return from the fair that was being held there we met a number of gentlemen driving home from shooting in the cheviots they went by very rapidly yet not so fast but that i recognized one of their number i had only to look at my little sisters cheeks to see that she had recognized him also the very next day came massingberd heath to our camp professing himself injured by our abrupt withdrawal from his society volunteering his companionship as before and reiterating his vows and promises to sinnamenta she expressed herself in such a manner as to lead us almost to fear she might be induced to elope with him while he upon his side seemed prepared to sacrifice everything to obtain her his very selfishness caused him as it were to forget himself and i do believe if it had been insisted upon he would have had the banns published in wooler church in the hearing of the fine friends with whom he was staying and been married by the parson however he again proposed to go through the cingari ceremony and this time imorris and my father agreed to iti having acknowledged himself to be an adopted gipsy massingberd heath was joined in wedlock to sinnamenta liversedge the ordinary ceremonies were dispensed with by command of morris the bride and bridegroom only pledging themselves to one another solemnly in the presence of the assembled tribe it was then since he could not purchase suitable presents in such an outoftheway district that i received from that mans hand this shootingflask as a remembrance of that day my uncle commanded me to accept it although i vehemently disapproved of what had been done and i therefore keep it now when every other gift of that accursed man has long been committed to the flames for my part i could not understand this novel pliancy on the part of morris and my father while sinnamenta as i think implicitly believed in her lovers protestation that for her sake he would all his life be a wanderer like ourselves that very day however he took her away southward on his road to london for beauty as i have said and for gentleness there never breathed the equal of my little sister and yet in six short months this heath grew weary of her like a spoiled child tired with a fragile toy he cared not what became of her so long as it vexed his eyes no more it is not necessary to tell what brutal insult he put upon her enough to say that she fled from him in terror as he had intended her to do and returned to us heartstricken woebegone about to become a mother with nothing but wretchedness in the future and even her happy past a dream dispelled it was dreadful to look upon my little sister and compare her to what she had been so short a time before she felt the cold after her luxurious life in town but she was far more ill at ease in mind than body above all she sorrowed because her lovers desertion had left her disgracedthat she had brought shame upon all who belonged to her incited by the poor girls misery morris and my father put into effect an audacious design which they had privately had long in hand we were back again at fairburnall but stanley carew who was away about a new horse for our covered cartnot camping in the plantation as of old for fear of sir wentworth but upon the common hard by on a certain morning neither my father nor uncle went forth as usual but sat at home smoking and watching at the opening of the tent not long after breakfast there appeared a wayfarer in the distance whose form showed gigantic in the summer haze that must be a big fellow little sister said i drawing her attention to it she was sitting huddled up as usual in front of the fire but no sooner had she caught sight of the object in question than she ran with a cry to her fathers knee and besought him to save her from massingberd heath ah even then at that last moment if father or uncle had but consulted me or let me into their plans i should not have my little sisters shuddering face before me as now the large eyes wild the full lips pale with terror he had beaten her poor darling even before the scene that was coming but she had even more reason than she knew for fear this man came striding on to the entrance of the tent and stood there looking at its inmates with a withering scowl why dont you speak said he you vagabonds for what is it that you have dared to send for me my father pointed towards sinnamentais not that cause enough massingberd heath no retorted the ruffian coolly what is she to me the drab has come to her thieving friends again it seemsthe more fool she for there was more than one who had a fancy for her in town and would have taken her off my hands my fathers fingers mechanically sought the knife which lay beside his halffinished basket but my uncle morris stood up between him and the speaker and thus replied massingberd heath i sent for you to tell you something which concerns both us and you many months ago you came to us uninvited and unwelcome and elected to be a gipsy like ourselves this makes you smile very scornfully yet if you did not mean the thing you said you lied however we believed you you were admitted into what however wretched and debased it may seem to you was our home and all we had to offer you was at your service you fell in love with that poor girl yonder and she did not tremble at your voice as now but trusted to your honour it is true your position in the world was high and hers was what you saw it to be still you wooed her and not she you that is so and you know it do not slander her sir lest presently you should be sorry for it again and again then you demanded her hand in marriagesuch marriage that is as prevails among our peoplenot so ceremonious indeed as with the rest of the world but not less binding this we would not grant because we disbelieved your protestations on your honour and before your god and disbelieved them as it has turned out with reason then we fled from you and your false solicitations to the north hundreds of miles away even thither you followed us or else accidentally fell in with us i know not which you renewed your offers and your oaths we found all worthless as you are that the poor girl loved you still and yielding to your repeated importunity we suffered her to become your wife wife repeated the renegade contemptuously do you suppose then that i valued your gipsy mummeries at a pins head you might as well attempt to tie these wrists of mine with the gossamer from yonder furze we knew that massingberd heath although the girl did not know it she trusted you although your every word was false she is fool enough for anything returned the other brutally but i know all this have you dared to bring me here merely to repeat so stale a story a story with an ending that you have yet to learn pursued my uncle sternly you were wedded by no gipsy mummeries as you call them you took sinnamenta liversedge in the presence of many persons solemnly to wife ay and i might take her sister there and marry her today after the same fashion and no law could say me nay yes iherei massingberd heath but not at kirkyetholm and why not inquired the ruffian with a mocking laugh that had however something shrill and wavering in it because kirkyetholm is over the border and by the laws of scotland my niece sinnamenta is your wife proud man and nothing but death can dissever the bond an awful silence succeeded my uncles words massingberd heath turned livid and twice in vain essayed to speak he was well nigh strangled by passion i thank heaven rachel murmured my little sister that i am not that shame to thee and to my race which i thought myself to be you shall have but little to thank heaven for girl if this be true cried her husband hoarse with concentrated rage somebody shall pay for this it iisi true quoth my father and you feel it to be so nothing remains then but to make the best of it we do not seek anything at your hands nor only the right of camping undisturbed about fairburn interposed my uncle morris who was of a grasping disposition and had planned the whole matter i fear not without an eye to the advantage of his tribe you wouldnt treat your wifes family as trespassers certainly not returned massingberd heath with bitterness they shall be most welcome i should be extremely sorry if they were to leave my neighbourhood just yet in the meantime however i want my wifemy wife come along with me my pretty one he looked like a wild beast within springing distance of his prey oh father uncle defend me cried the miserable girl what have you done to bring this mans vengeance upon me ay you are right there answered her husband in a voice that froze my veins that is still left for mevengeance come along i say i hunger until it shall begin massingberd heath cried i throwing myself at his feet for gods sake have mercy upon her it is not her fault she knew no more than you of all these things look how ill and pale she isyou above all men should have pity on her wretched condition oh leave her with us leave my little sister here and neither she nor we will ever trouble you ever come near you it shall be just the same as though you had never set eyes upon us it shall indeed oh you would not icouldi not surely be cruel to such a one as she i pointed to her as she stood clinging to her fathers arm as much for support as in appeal so beautiful so pitiful so weak a spectacle to move a heart of stone could i not be cruel returned he with a grating laugh ay to even such a one as she ask iheriask iheri there was no occasion to put the question you saw the answer in her shrinking form her trembling limbs his every word fell upon her like a blow she has not yet known however what i can be to my iwifei continued he come my pretty one come she shall not cried my father vehemently it shall never be in his power to hurt her what and i her husband exclaimed the other mockingly both one until death us do part not come he will kill her murmured my father her blood will be on my head are you coming wife cried massingberd heath in a terrible voice he stepped forward and grasped her slender wrist with fingers of steel morris and my father rushed forward but the man had swung her behind him placing himself between her and them and at the same instant he had taken from his pocket a lifepreserverhe carries it to this dayarmed with which he was a match for five such men and now cried he what man shall stop me from doing what i will with my own i exclaimed a sudden voice and with the word some dark mass launched itself so violently against the throat of massingberd heath that the giant toppled and fell upon his huge breast knife in hand knelt stanley carew his eyes gleaming with hate his lithe body working like a panthers he was not hesitating not he he was only drinking in a delicious draught of revenge before he struck strike cried i strike hard and quick carew but while the blade was in air morris and my father plucked him backwards and suffered his intended victim to rise although despoiled of his weapon no carew that will never do quoth morris we should have the whole country upon us in an hour and they would hang us altogether carew is that mans name is it exclaimed massingberd heath i will not forget it be sure you shall all pay for this trust me but he and ithis onei more than all come away wife come away yes she must go carew interposed my uncle checking a furious movement of the young mans he knows all now and has a right to what he demands ay but if he lays one finger upon her cried the passionate gipsy if he dares to harm her even by a word and i hear of it as sure as i see the sun this day i will know what is the colour of his lifeblood you may take her away across the seas but i will follow you you may surround yourself with precautions but i will come at you you may go day and night in mail but this knife shall find your heart out massingberd heath nodded contempuously without speaking and striding from the tent signed to sinnamenta to follow him which she did moaning and weeping and casting backward ever and anon pitiful glances upon the home and friends she had exchanged for such an evil lot i never saw my little sister more as if the remembrance of this sad scene had utterly overcome her rachel liversedge hid her face in her hands and wept until the tears welled through her tanned and shrivelled fingers i am indeed distressed said i to have caused you so much pain i will not make you sad by telling me more nay my boy since i have begun it let me finish with it i shall think of it all the same and it is better to speak than think that very night stanley carew was arrested upon the charge of stealing the horse which he had bought in open market and ridden home just in time to play the part i have described in the days i speak of forty pound was given as a reward to those who gave such evidence as produced a capital conviction and many a gipsy perished innocently in consequence of that wicked ordinance it is possible that this accusation was made by one of those who made a practice of earning bloodmoney but i am positively certain the false witness was set on by massingberd heath even if that man did not originate the charge it was pressed against poor carew very harshly and although the farmer of whom he bought the animal came honestly forward and swore to its being the same which he had sold the prisoner his evidence was rejected on account of some slight mistake in the description you must have heard tell of that awful execution long ago at crittenden jail when the wretched victim to perjury and revenge uttered these terrible words o god if thou dost not deliver me i will not believe there is a god that unhappy man was stanley carew my father and uncle were pitilessly persecuted and imprisoned and died before their time these wrists have worn fetters this back has suffered stripes nor did the vengeance of our enemy cease even with one generation one of my boys is beyond seas and another within stone walls yet i know that the hate of sir massingberd heath is not yet slaked but what became of your little sister poor sinnamenta i know not what she suffered immediately after she was taken from us heaven only knows her husband carried her a great way off out of our ken but this i have heard that when he told her of the death of stanley carew she fell down like one dead and presently being delivered of a son the infant died after a few hours the mother liveda maniac yes massingberd heath you did not kill my little sister after all yonder she lives but recks not whether you are kind or cruel she drinks no more the bitter cup of loves betrayal she is surely not at fairburn asked i is she what else should keep us here boy to be harried by keepers to be vexed by constables and justices what else should keep me here in a place that tortures me with memories of my youth and of loving faces that have crumbled into dust what else but the hope of one day seeing my little sister yet and the vengeance of heaven upon him who has worked her ruin the old woman rose up as she spoke and looked menacingly towards fairburn hall i could almost exclaim with poor carew cried she that if massingberd heath escape some awful end there is no avenger on high i am old but i shall see it yes i shall see it before i die if there had been more to tell which fortunately there was not i do not think rachel liversedge could have spoken further her emotion far more than her exertions had reduced her strength so far that though she uttered the last words energetically enough i had had for some time a difficulty in hearing what she said i thank you for listening to the tediousness of an ancient dame so long murmured she if you were not a good boy and half a gipsy you would never have been so patient i have told you all this to put you on your guard it is no secret but still you may not have heard it distrust despise detest massingberd heath and warn his nephew if you be his friend not to venture again within his uncles reach i will i will cried i and i thank you in his name i held out my hand and she turned it over in her own an honest palm quoth she without a stain there is one unlucky cross about it peter that is all you must not fret for that i mounted my horse amid cordial goodbyes from the gipsies who had been pursuing their usual avocations during the above recital as though nothing was more common than that the head of the family should have a secret of two hours long to communicate to a strange young gentleman and throwing a shilling to the boy who had shown me the way i took my leave it was not till i left the plantation far behind me and had ridden at speed for some distance on the open road that i was able to shake off the sombre feelings that oppressed me and to meet mrs myrtles welcome to the rectory with an answering smile chapter xvi i do sir massingberd a little favour upon my return to fairburn i became the object of immense curiosity and attraction i was stared at in the rectors pew at church and in my solitary rides whithersoever i went as the repository of the great secret of the disruption between sir massingberd and his nephew it was even whispered that i was the prime mover of the young mans rebellion and had planned the very manner of his escape upon panther including the accident at all events i knew all that had happened which nobody else knew except my tutor himself now mr long was as close as wax many an invitation had mrs myrtle obtained of late to take a dish of tea upon grounds which her hosts had since stigmatized as false pretences as the housekeeper and confidential servant of the rector she had been asked by mrs arabel of the grange farm to take evening refreshment with her in a friendly way also by mrs remnants who kept that extensive emporium in the village which supplied snuff to the aged of both sexes though not gratuitously becoming cambrics to the young and lollipops to those who had not yet reached that period of life wherein outward adornment is preferred to inward gratification also by the excisemans wife nay there was not anybodys wife in fairburn having the wherewithal to make a teatable alluring and being in a sufficiently high position in life to venture upon the step who did not invite mrs myrtle to visit her and proceed to treat her like a refractory pump they poured a little down in hopes to be more than remunerated for the outlay but alas although the dear good lady was willing enough being indeed a gossip born she had nothing to tell them she was not equal to the task of invention and of facts even to trade upon in tea and toast she had absolutely none conceive then how every face was turned interrogatively towards master meredithno imri meredith now that the object of everybody was to please him how the dames dropped courtesies and hoped my honour was well and my honours friend too mr marmaduke he was well too they trustedheaven bless him and he was staying away from fairburn a good bit was he not and how did has uncle like that who had always kept him at home so strictand was it true that he was residing with mr harvey gerard well dear me and how odd that was an atheist and a democrat people did say but there there were some again as spoke well of him sedate mr arabel set on without doubt by his inquisitive lady even waylaid me in a narrow lane and insisted upon my looking in at the farm and partaking of casual hospitality yell just have three drars and a spet said he meaning by that farm of expression a few whiffs of a pipe and take a glass of ale and when i declined the first offer upon the ground of not being a smoker and the second on the plea that it was only eleven oclock am and consequently rather early for ale he confessed that his missus was awaiting for me with a bottle of cowslip wine and a seedcake of her own making it was rather difficult to escape from hospitable snares of this kind but i revealed as little as possible without giving absolute offence on the other hand i received some information the details of which had not been confided to me by mr long well sir remarked mrs arabel after i had told her all i meant to tell which was not much and its no wonder as mr marmaduke ishouldi have run away im sure my good lady observed i pray be particular i never said he ran away i said his horse ran away yes of course sir responded the mistress of the grange winking in a manner that made me quite uncomfortable you are very right to say that mr meredith very right but sir massingberds opinion is that it was all planned from first to last only he says you nearly overdid it ah indeed said i how was that well it seems sir massingberd was quite deceived about that horse he bought for his nephew instead of being quiet and fit for the lad it was a perfect demon and it was sheer madness of you young gentlemen to go racing in order to make it run away then to arrange with mr gerard all beforehand well i must say i shouldnt have thought that either of you would have had the depth thank you mrs arabel said i laughing i am sorry you entertained so low an idea of our intelligence well sir returned the farmers wife with an air of excessive candour my husband you see he often has said to me says he that young squire marmaduke im darned if he aint little better than a fool he dont know what shot to use for rabbits that he dont i never saw his equal for ignorance and as for that lad from the ingiesthat was you you know sirwell of all the young fellows turned of seventeen as i ever saw hes the here mrs arabel crimsoned and stopped short as if she had been very nearly betrayed into saying something which was not entirely complimentary pray go on my dear madam said i of all the young fellows turned of seventeen whom he had ever seen i was the well sir hed just the same opinion of you as he had of master marmaduke but for my part i always said that although you might neither on you know so much as you ought to and though you might seem as it were ay you always stood our friend and said we were not such fools as we looked did you just so replied mrs arabel simply and so you see it has turned out if mr marmaduke can only live elsewhere till something happens to sir massingberdalthough indeed he looks as if nothing ever could hurt himhis life will doubtless be much pleasanter than at the hall it is no place for a young gentleman like him sureilyi although indeed things are better there than they were the darkeyed foreigneeringlooking young person although indeed she was old enough to know better well ishesi gone so i have heard said i drily yes she went away in a whirlwind ishei did continued mrs arabel reflectively dear me replied i i never heard that ah indeed i daresay not why you see mr long was a little mixed up in it perhaps he thought it better not to tell you take another glass of cowslip wine sir it has been more than ten years in bottle and the cake is as good a cake as you will put teeth into in all midshire though i say it as shouldnt say it well the thing happened in this way you see the foreigneering female she used to throw things at folks dishes plates whatever came first to hand whenever she was in her tantrums mr gilmore he had his head opened with a slopbasin so that you could lay your finger in it and oliver bradford i believe she fired a gun at him charged with swanshot however at times she was quite otherwise crying and submissive as a child they said it was religion up at the hall but they knows nothing about that how should they it was hysterics i daresay and serve her right too well who should come here the very sunday after mr marmaduke had run away and when sir massingberd was like a wild man with rage and couldnt speak without blaspheming but one of them methodee preachers as sometimes hold forth upon our common now the foreigneering female was awalking in the park shrubbery with one of her hysterical fits upon her i suppose and what does she hear through the palings but words as i suppose the poor creature never listened to before and presently out she comes upon the common and stands up among all the people with her great eyes swollen with weeping and her painted cheeksand i always said they were painteddaubed and smeared with tears carter john who is very much given to that sort of worship he was there and he told me she looked for all the world like the woman in the great picture over the communiontable in crittenden church who is wiping the feet of our lord with her hair then the preacher he bade her repent while there was yet time and fear nothing but only god but sir massingberd he came out and dragged her in from the very preachers hand and presently back again he comes with a horsewhip and swears there shall be no methodees in his parish and if he caught the hypocritical ranteras he called himwithin hearing again hed split his ears now i dont go with him there pursued mrs arabel gravely it isnt for us mr meredith to say as nobody cant pick up good unless its in church and least of all should such things be said by sir massingberd who lets that beautiful family pew get damp and mouldy with the fireplace always empty all the winter long and never puts his nose into it from years end to years end however what does the foreigneering female do but declare she would starve herself to death before she would eat the bread of unrighteousness any longer and not one morsel of food would she take though they locked her up and tried to tempt her with her most favourite dishes so sir massingberd being at his wits end came over to the parson and begged him to come and persuade the woman to be reasonable and take some refreshment and mr longhe at first declined to interfere in such a matter at all but presently thinking the poor creature might be really penitent although it came about through a methodee and hoping to do her some good although not in the way sir massingberd intended he accompanied him to the hall and what do you think why they found the poor woman was in such earnest that she had cut off the whole of her beautiful black hair and there it lay on the carpet like so much rubbish so the squire he swore that he didnt care now whether she starved or not and turned her out of the house as i said at first in a whirlwind she was very faint and weak and mr long who would never exchange a syllable with her before made mrs myrtle give her a good meal and gave her some good words himself and sent her away to her friendsfor it seems she had some friends poor wretch and this has made sir massingberd wilder than ever against the rector whom he had already accused of aiding and abetting young mr marmaduke in his running away so that altogether the squire is ready to make an end of everybody this last statement although a little highly coloured as mrs arabels descriptions usually were was really not far from the truth it did almost seem as if the baronet was so transported with passion as to be capable of any enormity what the law permitted him to do in the way of oppression that of course he practised to the uttermost his morality never very diffuse had concentrated itself upon one positionthe defence of the game and trespass laws his keepers were exhorted to increased vigilance the worst characters in the parish were constituted his spies every night it was now the custom of their lord and master to go the rounds in his own preserves and visit the outposts to see that the sentinels did their duty he employed no warnings or trespass boards in fairburn park his object was not to deter but to catch the contemners of the sacred rights of property in the very act the pursuit of his life had become manhunting i write that word without any reference to marmaduke heath for indeed at that time i thought that sir massingberd had given up all hope of recovering possession of his nephew a considerable period had now elapsed since the young mans convalescence and yet the baronet had taken no steps to compel his return he had written indeed to marmaduke a letter of anything but a conciliatory character and calculated to rearouse the lads most morbid fears but mr harvey gerard had intercepted the dispatch and returned it with an answer of his own composition he had stated briefly the results of the late conference at the dovecot respecting his young guest he had reiterated his intention of bringing in a court of justice the gravest charges against the baronet in case of any legal molestation from him and he had finished with a personal recommendation to that gentleman to rest satisfied with the enjoyment of the allowance that was supposed to go to the maintenance of his nephew epistolary communication by hand was rendered impracticable on the part of the baronet by the removal of the dovecot household to town this was a bitter blow to the lord of fairburn he knew so well the abject fear which he had inspired in my unhappy friend that notwithstanding all that had come and gone yet he did not doubt that a few words in his own handwriting would bring the truant back however loath we are living now in such quiet times and under the protection of such equal laws that i am aware my younger readers will have a difficulty in conceiving how one human being however powerful could be held in such terror by others i was aware from the first that the present universal security would give my narrative an air of improbability and i fear that this must increase as it proceeds i have only to say that at the period of which i write there was no poor man in fairburn parish however honest however prudent who might not have been lodged in jail at the instance of his squire and would have found it difficult to clear himself or who might not on a hint from the same quarter have been pressed if he did but give the opportunity on board a manofwar i am likewise certain that had sir massingberd ventured upon such a step he might have recovered possession of his nephew or at least withdrawn him from his protector by the strong hand of the law upon the ground of mr gerards professing revolutionary principles in these days of palmerston and derby of tweedledum and tweedledee it is impossible for those who are not old enough to have witnessed it to imagine the rancour of political parties half a century ago or the despotism and flagrant injustice that were sanctioned under the convenient name of order for the haughty baronet to be thus cut off from all intercourse with his victim was to be foiled indeed at first he stung himself wellnigh to frenzy like a scorpion within its circle of flame but after a time the white heat of his wrath began apparently to abate he seemed to have made up his mind to sit down quietly under his defeat and to content himself with tyrannizing over those who were yet in his power this comparatively peaceful state of things was looked upon by mr long and myself at first with suspicion but at last with real satisfaction when sir massingberd sent over five pineapples and some splendid grapes to the rectory with his compliments for the first time within twenty years we shook our heads and my tutor addressed the messenger of his bounty in these words tell your master i am exceedingly obliged to him for his kindness timeo danaos et dona ferentes would you be so good as to write that down sir said the man you may give him the message without the tail replied the rector a little discomfited at his own indiscretion but congratulating himself very much that he had expressed his thoughts so classically but when pineapples and grapes became common presents from the hall we began really to think that the stubborn old baronet had come to the conclusion that it was as pleasant to be on good terms with his neighbour as not and that he was genuinely bent on reconciliation a soft answer is said to be efficacious to this end but it is nothing compared to hothouse dainties out of season and notwithstanding all i knew and all i suspected i began to regard sir massingberd heath not indeed with less contempt and dislike but with less positive loathing and certainly with less fear i had not set foot upon his property since marmadukes departure and the baronet took occasion to stop me as i rode by his gate one day and remonstrate upon the incivility of such a course of conduct it can do me no damage young gentleman that you should take your pleasure in my park more especially as you are not a sportsman who would covet my hares and pheasants and i cannot but think that your omission to do so is a proof of illfeeling towards me which i am not conscious of having deserved at your hands he spoke stiffly and without condescension as a man might speak to an equal between himself and whom a misunderstanding existed unexplained but capable of explanation and foolish boy as i was i felt flattered by his behaviour if the least notion of making myself out to be a hero had existed in my brain when i began to write these recollections it has been dissipated long ago i have been quite as much surprised during this recital as any of my readers have been at the contemplation of my own meannesses if i had known how many and how serious they were to be perhaps i should have hesitated to recall them but i commenced with as strong a determination nothing to extenuate with respect to myself as to set nothing down in malice with respect to others and thus i shall proceed to the end while then matters were on this less antagonistic footing and when marmaduke had been away about a year business happened to take mr long from fairburn and i was left a day and a night my own master he had not been gone an hour when mrs myrtle came into the study where i was employed at my books with a letter in her hand she looked quite pale and frightened as she said lor mr peter if this note aint from sir massingberd hisself for iyoui i feels all of a tremble so as you might knock me down with a peacocks feather well said i forcing a laugh but i am not going to use any such weapon mrs myrtle what on earth is there to be afraid of in the squires handwriting it cant bite but i felt in a cold perspiration nevertheless and my fingers trembled as they undid the missive it was a polite invitation to dine with the baronet that evening you are not going sir i idoi hope exclaimed the housekeeper eagerly as soon as i had acquainted her with the contents of the note why such a thing hasnt happened for this quarter of a century hell poison you as sure as my names martha myrtle i never saw you and master eating his pineapples without a shudder the rector iwasi uncommon ill after one of them one day yes mrs myrtle said i quietly and i have suffered also from the same cause myself but i dont think the squire was to blame but you aint agoing sir i am sure as master wouldnt like it oh pray say you aint agoing well then i wont go mrs myrtle the fact is i feel one of my colds coming on they generally begin with a lump in my throat so i shall write to excuse myself i really had a lump in my throat my heart had jumped up and stopped there at the mere notion of a iteteatetei with sir massingberd diversifiedno intensifiedby the presence of grimjaw i wouldnt have gone through it for a thousand pounds so i wrote to decline the honour upon the ground of indisposition i was compelled to keep the house i said for the entire day half an hour afterwards another letter arrived from the hall since sir massingberd might not enjoy the pleasure of my company at dinner would i permit him to come over to the rectory that morning and have a few words of conversation with me upon a matter deeply interesting to both of us there was no getting out of this if i had gone to bed on plea of illness i felt that even that course would have been no protection to me sir massingberd would have forced a dying man to play with him at pitchandtoss if so inopportune a game had happened to take his fancy on the other hand mrs myrtles suggestion that i should mount my horse and ride away after mr long was really too pusillanimous a proceeding i therefore wrote back to the baronet a polite falsehood to the effect that i should be very happy to see him and in a very few minutes afterwards i was face to face with marmadukes foe he came in unusheredmrs myrtle not being equal to such an occasionfilling the doorway with his gigantic form and wellnigh touching the ceiling of the lowroofed room with his head i am sorry to intrude upon an invalid said he but what i had to say was of a private nature and i was not sure of finding you alone at any other time i bowed and begged my visitor to be seated it is something thought i that this man is civil at least for there is this great advantage in being habitually insolent and overbearing that when one does condescend to behave decently people appreciate ones good maimers very much i have called upon you continued the baronet with respect to my nephew and your friend marmaduke heath it is idle to deny that he and i have not been to one another what our mutual relationship should have led us to be i am naturally a hard man losses and poverty have doubtless rendered me more morose marmaduke on the other hand is of an oversensitive and morbid nature we did not get on together at all well there were faults on both sides it was six of one and i shook my head very well then resumed sir massingberd with candour let us say that it was i who was in the wrong i have not the patience and gentleness requisite for dealing with a character like him my temper is arbitrary i have behaved with but little courtesy even to yourself you are polite enough to contradict me but nevertheless it is true for ithati however reparation can be made i wish that i could as easily make atonement in the other quarter this however i feel is utterly impossible things have gone too far i make no complaint of my nephews having been encouraged in his rebellious course by one whose duty it was on the contrary to reconcile us i wish to say nothing that could only lead to fruitless discussion and perhaps a disagreement between you and me that would be most impolitic on my part since i come here to solicit your good offices mine sir massingberd mine yes i desire your kindly assistance in bringing about a better understanding between marmaduke and myself sir said i what you ask is a sheer impossibility marmaduke heath may be wrong in his estimate of your character but it will remain unchanged to his dying day i am as certain of this as that yonder yellowing tree will presently lose its leaves you speak frankly mr meredith returned the baronet calmly and i do not respect you less upon that account it is not however as a mediator that i need your assistance i ask a much less favour than that i simply wish you to inclose a letter from me to my nephew sir massingberd heath said i with some indignation you have done me the favour of calling upon me in my tutors absence in the expectation of finding me so weak as to be unable to refuse whatever you chose to ask or so treacherous as to be willing to deceive those who are generously protecting my best friend from one whom he has every cause to fear i am extremely obliged to you for the compliment and with that i laid my hand upon the bell one moment observed the baronet quietly nay with suavity though the letter u upon his forehead deepened visibly and the veins of his great hand as it rested on the table grew big with passion one moment before you ring i am sorry you should have taken such a view of my conduct as you have described you young men are somewhat hasty in the imputation of motive i am a straightforward rough fellow and may have displeased you but i am not aware that i have done anything to justify you in accusing me of meanness and duplicity those persons who have charge of my nephew are in my judgment deeply culpable but i do not wish you to act deceitfully towards them on that account matters have come to that pass however that i cannot even communicate with my nephew even though i have that to say which would give him genuine pleasure this mr harvey gerardhis deep voice shook with hatred as he mentioned that namehas taken upon himself to return my letters to marmaduke unopened i know not how to convey to him even such a one as this sir massingberd threw across to me a folded sheet directed to his nephew and motioned that i should open it it ran as follows nephew marmadukeit seems that you are fully determined never again to seek the shelter of my roof i am given to understand that the time for reconciliation has gone by and that any attempt to effect it would only cause you annoyance and make the breach wider between us if so so be it i am an old man now and i wish my last years to be passed in peace i wish to make no allusion to the character of the person with whom you have chosen to reside further than to express a hope that when i am gone and it will be your part to exercise the rights of a great landowner that you will not employ your influence to subvert the laws and the government it is as mad in those who possess authority to countenance revolution as for a man seated on a lofty branch to lop it off with his own hands i do not say this as your uncle but merely as one of an ancient race with whom we are both connected and in whose welfare we should take an equal interest mr meredith is kind enough to enclose this parting word of advicethe last communication that will probably ever pass between usfrom massingberd heath psburn this when you have read it lest your friend should get into trouble upon my account i read and reread this strange epistle with great care before i made any comment upon it there was nothing to my mind objectionable in any of the contents i had been twice to harley street during the summer and found marmaduke as morbidly apprehensive as ever of some course of conduct to be adopted by his uncle with reference to regaining the custody of his person he was haunted still by the shadow of this terrible man the words i held before me were certainly calculated to reassure him no news could be more gratifying than this positive resignation of the baronets claim to be his guardian this final goodbye under sir massingberds own hand as for the political advice i thought that very healthy i was then as now a staunch conservative and although i did not sympathize in the least with the harsh acts of the government in respect to poor misguided men not without their wrongs yet i did think mr gerards views both visionary and dangerous i trust observed sir massingberd gravely that the sentiments which you are now perusing are in accordance with your own i am speaking i believe to a gentleman and consequently to a natural friend of order i bowed in assent there certainly seems nothing in this epistle which marmaduke might not read muttered i musing iseemsi cried the baronet why not say iisi at once a sudden idea gleaned from some romance which i had been lately reading flashed across my brain why did the postscript say burn this when you have read it i let my hand with the letter in it drop below my knee so that the missive was held close to the fire there is no writing in lemonjuice i do assure you observed sir massingberd quietly you will only scorch the paper i coloured at the exposure of my suspicions and in my confusion it did not strike me that the speaker must himself have at least entertained such a project or he never could have unmasked me so readily i was a little ashamed of myself and rather sorry for my incredulity sir massingberd saw this and pressed his point since there is nothing concealed and no harm in what is visible i do hope you will grant the favour i requested and inclose that note to my nephew well sir said i after a little hesitation i will inclose it i give you warning however that i shall send a line by the same post to let mr gerard know that i have done so by all means responded sir massingberd i am only anxious that my nephews own eyes should read what i have written have you a taper and wax asked he folding up the sheet i might as well stamp it with my seal i rose and brought what he required from a writingtable sir massingberd sealed the letter and gave it into my hand mr meredith said he rising you have done me a great service i think i have said that the oftener you make use of my grounds the better i shall be pleased did i add that the bowlinggreen is entirely at your service i am too stiff in the back to have a game with you myself but i will give directions to gilmore to be your antagonist whenever you may feel inclined the baronet took his leave in a stately but not unfriendly manner he certainly iwasi stiff in the back but that was his nature as he smiled his lip turned upwards instead of the usual way but so it always did yet i did not feel quite comfortable as i stood by myself over the fire balancing sir massingberds goodbye to his nephew in my hand and questioning within myself whether it wouldnt be better to inclose it to mr harvey gerard after all however in the end i kept my promise end of vol i

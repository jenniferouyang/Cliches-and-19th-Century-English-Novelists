reproduced in any form without the permission of charles scribners sons illustration the whole of the story i do not know whether many people realize how much more than is ever written there really is in a storyhow many parts of it are never toldhow much more really happened than there is in the book one holds in ones hand and pores over stories are something like letters when a letter is written how often one remembers things omitted and says ah why did i not tell them that in writing a book one relates all that one remembers at the time and if one told all that really happened perhaps the book would never end between the lines of every story there is another story and that is one that is never heard and can only be guessed at by the people who are good at guessing the person who writes the story may never know all of it but sometimes he does and wishes he had the chance to begin again when i wrote the story of sara crewe i guessed that a great deal more had happened at miss minchins than i had had time to find out just then i knew of course that there must have been chapters full of things going on all the time and when i began to make a play out of the book and called it a little princess i discovered three acts full of things what interested me most was that i found that there had been girls at the school whose names i had not even known before there was a little girl whose name was lottie who was an amusing little person there was a hungry scullerymaid who was saras adoring friend ermengarde was much more entertaining than she had seemed at first things happened in the garret which had never been hinted at in the book and a certain gentleman whose name was melchisedec was an intimate friend of saras who should never have been left out of the story if he had only walked into it in time he and becky and lottie lived at miss minchins and i cannot understand why they did not mention themselves to me at first they were as real as sara and it was careless of them not to come out of the story shadowland and say here i amtell about me but they did notwhich was their fault and not mine people who live in the story one is writing ought to come forward at the beginning and tap the writing person on the shoulder and say hallo what about me if they dont no one can be blamed but themselves and their slouching idle ways after the play of a little princess was produced in new york and so many children went to see it and liked becky and lottie and melchisedec my publishers asked me if i could not write saras story over again and put into it all the things and people who had been left out before and so i have done it and when i began i found there were actually pages and pages of things which had happened that had never been put even into the play so in this new little princess i have put all i have been able to discover frances hodgson burnett contents chapter page i sara ii a french lesson iii ermengarde iv lottie v becky vi the diamondmines vii

than once she had been known to have a teaparty the children crowded clamoring around her she seldom cried she did not cry now the sparrows twittered and hopped about quite without fear the beggar girl was still huddled up in the corner she sat down and held him on her knee noticed that his companion sat gazing into the fire a little princess chapter i sara once on a dark winters day when the yellow fog hung so thick and heavy in the streets of london that the lamps were lighted and the shop windows blazed with gas as they do at night an oddlooking little girl sat in a cab with her father and was driven rather slowly through the big thoroughfares she sat with her feet tucked under her and leaned against her father who held her in his arm as she stared out of the window at the passing people with a queer oldfashioned thoughtfulness in her big eyes she was such a little girl that one did not expect to see such a look on her small face it would have been an old look for a child of twelve and sara crewe was only seven the fact was however that she was always dreaming and thinking odd things and could not herself remember any time when she had not been thinking things about grownup people and the world they belonged to she felt as if she had lived a long long time at this moment she was remembering the voyage she had just made from bombay with her father captain crewe she was thinking of the big ship of the lascars passing silently to and fro on it of the children playing about on the hot deck and of some young officers wives who used to try to make her talk to them and laugh at the things she said principally she was thinking of what a queer thing it was that at one time one was in india in the blazing sun and then in the middle of the ocean and then driving in a strange vehicle through strange streets where the day was as dark as the night she found this so puzzling that she moved closer to her father papa she said in a low mysterious little voice which was almost a whisper papa what is it darling captain crewe answered holding her closer and looking down into her face what is sara thinking of is this the place sara whispered cuddling still closer to him is it papa yes little sara it is we have reached it at last and though she was only seven years old she knew that he felt sad when he said it it seemed to her many years since he had begun to prepare her mind for the place as she always called it her mother had died when she was born so she had never known or missed her her young handsome rich petting father seemed to be the only relation she had in the world they had always played together and been fond of each other she only knew he was rich because she had heard people say so when they thought she was not listening and she had also heard them say that when she grew up she would be rich too she did not know all that being rich meant she had always lived in a beautiful bungalow and had been used to seeing many servants who made salaams to her and called her missee sahib and gave her her own way in everything she had had toys and pets and an ayah who worshipped her and she had gradually learned that people who were rich had these things that however was all she knew about it during her short life only one thing had troubled her and that thing was the place she was to be taken to some day the climate of india was very bad for children and as soon as possible they were sent away from itgenerally to england and to school she had seen other children go away and had heard their fathers and mothers talk about the letters they received from them she had known that she would be obliged to go also and though sometimes her fathers stories of the voyage and the new country had attracted her she had been troubled by the thought that he could not stay with her couldnt you go to that place with me papa she had asked when she was five years old couldnt you go to school too i would help you with your lessons but you will not have to stay for a very long time little sara he had always said you will go to a nice house where there will be a lot of little girls and you will play together and i will send you plenty of books and you will grow so fast that it will seem scarcely a year before you are big enough and clever enough to come back and take care of papa she had liked to think of that to keep the house for her father to ride with him and sit at the head of his table when he had dinnerparties to talk to him and read his booksthat would be what she would like most in the world and if one must go away to the place in england to attain it she must make up her mind to go she did not care very much for other little girls but if she had plenty of books she could console herself she liked books more than anything else and was in fact always inventing stories of beautiful things and telling them to herself sometimes she had told them to her father and he had liked them as much as she did well papa she said softly if we are here i suppose we must be resigned he laughed at her oldfashioned speech and kissed her he was really not at all resigned himself though he knew he must keep that a secret his quaint little sara had been a great companion to him and he felt he should be a lonely fellow when on his return to india he went into his bungalow knowing he need not expect to see the small figure in its white frock come forward to meet him so he held her very closely in his arm as the cab rolled into the big dull square in which stood the house which was their destination it was a big dull brick house exactly like all the others in its row but that on the front door there shone a brass plate on which was engraved in black letters miss minchin select seminary for young ladies here we are sara said captain crewe making his voice sound as cheerful as possible then he lifted her out of the cab and they mounted the steps and rang the bell sara often thought afterward that the house was somehow exactly like miss minchin it was respectable and well furnished but everything in it was ugly and the very armchairs seemed to have hard bones in them in the hall everything was hard and polishedeven the red cheeks of the moon face on the tall clock in the corner had a severe varnished look the drawingroom into which they were ushered was covered by a carpet with a square pattern upon it the chairs were square and a heavy marble timepiece stood upon the heavy marble mantel as she sat down in one of the stiff mahogany chairs sara cast one of her quick looks about her i dont like it papa she said but then i dare say soldierseven brave onesdont really like going into battle captain crewe laughed outright at this he was young and full of fun and he never tired of hearing saras queer speeches oh little sara he said what shall i do when i have no one to say solemn things to me no one else is quite as solemn as you are but why do solemn things make you laugh so inquired sara because you are such fun when you say them he answered laughing still more and then suddenly he swept her into his arms and kissed her very hard stopping laughing all at once and looking almost as if tears had come into his eyes it was just then that miss minchin entered the room she was very like her house sara felt tall and dull and respectable and ugly she had large cold fishy eyes and a large cold fishy smile it spread itself into a very large smile when she saw sara and captain crewe she had heard a great many desirable things of the young soldier from the lady who had recommended her school to him among other things she had heard that he was a rich father who was willing to spend a great deal of money on his little daughter it will be a great privilege to have charge of such a beautiful and promising child captain crewe she said taking saras hand and stroking it lady meredith has told me of her unusual cleverness a clever child is a great treasure in an establishment like mine sara stood quietly with her eyes fixed upon miss minchins face she was thinking something odd as usual why does she say i am a beautiful child she was thinking i am not beautiful at all colonel granges little girl isobel is beautiful she has dimples and rosecolored cheeks and long hair the color of gold i have short black hair and green eyes besides which i am a thin child and not fair in the least i am one of the ugliest children i ever saw she is beginning by telling a story she was mistaken however in thinking she was an ugly child she was not in the least like isobel grange who had been the beauty of the regiment but she had an odd charm of her own she was a slim supple creature rather tall for her age and had an intense attractive little face her hair was heavy and quite black and only curled at the tips her eyes were greenish gray it is true but they were big wonderful eyes with long black lashes and though she herself did not like the color of them many other people did still she was very firm in her belief that she was an ugly little girl and she was not at all elated by miss minchins flattery i should be telling a story if i said she was beautiful she thought and i should know i was telling a story i believe i am as ugly as she isin my way what did she say that for after she had known miss minchin longer she learned why she had said it she discovered that she said the same thing to each papa and mamma who brought a child to her school sara stood near her father and listened while he and miss minchin talked she had been brought to the seminary because lady merediths two little girls had been educated there and captain crewe had a great respect for lady merediths experience sara was to be what was known as a parlorboarder and she was to enjoy even greater privileges than parlorboarders usually did she was to have a pretty bedroom and sittingroom of her own she was to have a pony and a carriage and a maid to take the place of the ayah who had been her nurse in india i am not in the least anxious about her education captain crewe said with his gay laugh as he held saras hand and patted it the difficulty will be to keep her from learning too fast and too much she is always sitting with her little nose burrowing into books she doesnt read them miss minchin she gobbles them up as if she were a little wolf instead of a little girl she is always starving for new books to gobble and she wants grownup booksgreat big fat onesfrench and german as well as englishhistory and biography and poets and all sorts of things drag her away from her books when she reads too much make her ride her pony in the row or go out and buy a new doll she ought to play more with dolls papa said sara you see if i went out and bought a new doll every few days i should have more than i could be fond of dolls ought to be intimate friends emily is going to be my intimate friend captain crewe looked at miss minchin and miss minchin looked at captain crewe who is emily she inquired tell her sara captain crewe said smiling saras greengray eyes looked very solemn and quite soft as she answered she is a doll i havent got yet she said she is a doll papa is going to buy for me we are going out together to find her i have called her emily she is going to be my friend when papa is gone i want her to talk to about him miss minchins large fishy smile became very flattering indeed what an original child she said what a darling little creature yes said captain crewe drawing sara close she is a darling little creature take great care of her for me miss minchin sara stayed with her father at his hotel for several days in fact she remained with him until he sailed away again to india they went out and visited many big shops together and bought a great many things they bought indeed a great many more things than sara needed but captain crewe was a rash innocent young man and wanted his little girl to have everything she admired and everything he admired himself so between them they collected a wardrobe much too grand for a child of seven there were velvet dresses trimmed with costly furs and lace dresses and embroidered ones and hats with great soft ostrich feathers and ermine coats and muffs and boxes of tiny gloves and handkerchiefs and silk stockings in such abundant supplies that the polite young women behind the counters whispered to each other that the odd little girl with the big solemn eyes must be at least some foreign princessperhaps the little daughter of an indian rajah and at last they found emily but they went to a number of toyshops and looked at a great many dolls before they finally discovered her i want her to look as if she wasnt a doll really sara said i want her to look as if she listens when i talk to her the trouble with dolls papaand she put her head on one side and reflected as she said itthe trouble with dolls is that they never seem to hear so they looked at big ones and little onesat dolls with black eyes and dolls with blueat dolls with brown curls and dolls with golden braids dolls dressed and dolls undressed you see sara said when they were examining one who had no clothes if when i find her she has no frocks we can take her to a dressmaker and have her things made to fit they will fit better if they are tried on after a number of disappointments they decided to walk and look in at the shop windows and let the cab follow them they had passed two or three places without even going in when as they were approaching a shop which was really not a very large one sara suddenly started and clutched her fathers arm oh papa she cried there is emily a flush had risen to her face and there was an expression in her greengray eyes as if she had just recognized some one she was intimate with and fond of she is actually waiting for us she said let us go in to her dear me said captain crewe i feel as if we ought to have some one to introduce us you must introduce me and i will introduce you said sara but i knew her the minute i saw herso perhaps she knew me too perhaps she had known her she had certainly a very intelligent expression in her eyes when sara took her in her arms she was a large doll but not too large to carry about easily she had naturally curling goldenbrown hair which hung like a mantle about her and her eyes were a deep clear gray blue with soft thick eyelashes which were real eyelashes and not mere painted lines of course said sara looking into her face as she held her on her kneeof course papa this is emily so emily was bought and actually taken to a childrens outfitters shop and measured for a wardrobe as grand as saras own she had lace frocks too and velvet and muslin ones and hats and coats and beautiful lacetrimmed underclothes and gloves and handkerchiefs and furs i should like her always to look as if she was a child with a good mother said sara im her mother though i am going to make a companion of her captain crewe would really have enjoyed the shopping tremendously but that a sad thought kept tugging at his heart this all meant that he was going to be separated from his beloved quaint little comrade he got out of his bed in the middle of that night and went and stood looking down at sara who lay asleep with emily in her arms her black hair was spread out on the pillow and emilys goldenbrown hair mingled with it both of them had laceruffled nightgowns and both had long eyelashes which lay and curled up on their cheeks emily looked so like a real child that captain crewe felt glad she was there he drew a big sigh and pulled his mustache with a boyish expression heighho little sara he said to himself i dont believe you know how much your daddy will miss you the next day he took her to miss minchins and left her there he was to sail away the next morning he explained to miss minchin that his solicitors messrs barrow skipworth had charge of his affairs in england and would give her any advice she wanted and that they would pay the bills she sent in for saras expenses he would write to sara twice a week and she was to be given every pleasure she asked for she is a sensible little thing and she never wants anything it isnt safe to give her he said then he went with sara into her little sittingroom and they bade each other goodby sara sat on his knee and held the lapels of his coat in her small hands and looked long and hard at his face are you learning me by heart little sara he said stroking her hair no she answered i know you by heart you are inside my heart and they put their arms round each other and kissed as if they would never let each other go when the cab drove away from the door sara was sitting on the floor of her sittingroom with her hands under her chin and her eyes following it until it had turned the corner of the square emily was sitting by her and she looked after it too when miss minchin sent her sister miss amelia to see what the child was doing she found she could not open the door i have locked it said a queer polite little voice from inside i want to be quite by myself if you please miss amelia was fat and dumpy and stood very much in awe of her sister she was really the betternatured person of the two but she never disobeyed miss minchin she went downstairs again looking almost alarmed i never saw such a funny oldfashioned child sister she said she has locked herself in and she is not making the least particle of noise it is much better than if she kicked and screamed as some of them do miss minchin answered i expected that a child as much spoiled as she is would set the whole house in an uproar if ever a child was given her own way in everything she is ive been opening her trunks and putting her things away said miss amelia i never saw anything like themsable and ermine on her coats and real valenciennes lace on her underclothing you have seen some of her clothes what do you think of them i think they are perfectly ridiculous replied miss minchin sharply but they will look very well at the head of the line when we take the schoolchildren to church on sunday she has been provided for as if she were a little princess and upstairs in the locked room sara and emily sat on the floor and stared at the corner round which the cab had disappeared while captain crewe looked backward waving and kissing his hand as if he could not bear to stop chapter ii a french lesson when sara entered the schoolroom the next morning everybody looked at her with wide interested eyes by that time every pupilfrom lavinia herbert who was nearly thirteen and felt quite grown up to lottie legh who was only just four and the baby of the schoolhad heard a great deal about her they knew very certainly that she was miss minchins show pupil and was considered a credit to the establishment one or two of them had even caught a glimpse of her french maid mariette who had arrived the evening before lavinia had managed to pass saras room when the door was open and had seen mariette opening a box which had arrived late from some shop it was full of petticoats with lace frills on themfrills and frills she whispered to her friend jessie as she bent over her geography i saw her shaking them out i heard miss minchin say to miss amelia that her clothes were so grand that they were ridiculous for a child my mamma says that children should be dressed simply she has got one of those petticoats on now i saw it when she sat down she has silk stockings on whispered jessie bending over her geography also and what little feet i never saw such little feet oh sniffed lavinia spitefully that is the way her slippers are made my mamma says that even big feet can be made to look small if you have a clever shoemaker i dont think she is pretty at all her eyes are such a queer color she isnt pretty as other pretty people are said jessie stealing a glance across the room but she makes you want to look at her again she has tremendously long eyelashes but her eyes are almost green illustration she was not abashed at all by the many pairs of eyes watching her sara was sitting quietly in her seat waiting to be told what to do she had been placed near miss minchins desk she was not abashed at all by the many pairs of eyes watching her she was interested and looked back quietly at the children who looked at her she wondered what they were thinking of and if they liked miss minchin and if they cared for their lessons and if any of them had a papa at all like her own she had had a long talk with emily about her papa that morning he is on the sea now emily she had said we must be very great friends to each other and tell each other things emily look at me you have the nicest eyes i ever sawbut i wish you could speak she was a child full of imaginings and whimsical thoughts and one of her fancies was that there would be a great deal of comfort in even pretending that emily was alive and really heard and understood after mariette had dressed her in her darkblue schoolroom frock and tied her hair with a darkblue ribbon she went to emily who sat in a chair of her own and gave her a book you can read that while i am downstairs she said and seeing mariette looking at her curiously she spoke to her with a serious little face what i believe about dolls she said is that they can do things they will not let us know about perhaps really emily can read and talk and walk but she will only do it when people are out of the room that is her secret you see if people knew that dolls could do things they would make them work so perhaps they have promised each other to keep it a secret if you stay in the room emily will just sit there and stare but if you go out she will begin to read perhaps or go and look out of the window then if she heard either of us coming she would just run back and jump into her chair and pretend she had been there all the time comme elle est drole mariette said to herself and when she went downstairs she told the head housemaid about it but she had already begun to like this odd little girl who had such an intelligent small face and such perfect manners she had taken care of children before who were not so polite sara was a very fine little person and had a gentle appreciative way of saying if you please mariette thank you mariette which was very charming mariette told the head housemaid that she thanked her as if she was thanking a lady elle a lair dune princesse cette petite she said indeed she was very much pleased with her new little mistress and liked her place greatly after sara had sat in her seat in the schoolroom for a few minutes being looked at by the pupils miss minchin rapped in a dignified manner upon her desk young ladies she said i wish to introduce you to your new companion all the little girls rose in their places and sara rose also i shall expect you all to be very agreeable to miss crewe she has just come to us from a great distancein fact from india as soon as lessons are over you must make each others acquaintance the pupils bowed ceremoniously and sara made a little courtesy and then they sat down and looked at each other again sara said miss minchin in her schoolroom manner come here to me she had taken a book from the desk and was turning over its leaves sara went to her politely as your papa has engaged a french maid for you she began i conclude that he wishes you to make a special study of the french language sara felt a little awkward i think he engaged her she said because hehe thought i would like her miss minchin i am afraid said miss minchin with a slightly sour smile that you have been a very spoiled little girl and always imagine that things are done because you like them my impression is that your papa wished you to learn french if sara had been older or less punctilious about being quite polite to people she could have explained herself in a very few words but as it was she felt a flush rising on her cheeks miss minchin was a very severe and imposing person and she seemed so absolutely sure that sara knew nothing whatever of french that she felt as if it would be almost rude to correct her the truth was that sara could not remember the time when she had not seemed to know french her father had often spoken it to her when she had been a baby her mother had been a frenchwoman and captain crewe had loved her language so it happened that sara had always heard and been familiar with it ii have never really learned french butbut she began trying shyly to make herself clear one of miss minchins chief secret annoyances was that she did not speak french herself and was desirous of concealing the irritating fact she therefore had no intention of discussing the matter and laying herself open to innocent questioning by a new little pupil that is enough she said with polite tartness if you have not learned you must begin at once the french master monsieur dufarge will be here in a few minutes take this book and look at it until he arrives saras cheeks felt warm she went back to her seat and opened the book she looked at the first page with a grave face she knew it would be rude to smile and she was very determined not to be rude but it was very odd to find herself expected to study a page which told her that le pere meant the father and la mere meant the mother miss minchin glanced toward her scrutinizingly you look rather cross sara she said i am sorry you do not like the idea of learning french i am very fond of it answered sara thinking she would try again but you must not say but when you are told to do things said miss minchin look at your book again and sara did so and did not smile even when she found that le fils meant the son and le frere meant the brother when monsieur dufarge comes she thought i can make him understand monsieur dufarge arrived very shortly afterward he was a very nice intelligent middleaged frenchman and he looked interested when his eyes fell upon sara trying politely to seem absorbed in her little book of phrases is this a new pupil for me madame he said to miss minchin i hope that is my good fortune her papacaptain creweis very anxious that she should begin the language but i am afraid she has a childish prejudice against it she does not seem to wish to learn said miss minchin i am sorry of that mademoiselle he said kindly to sara perhaps when we begin to study together i may show you that it is a charming tongue little sara rose in her seat she was beginning to feel rather desperate as if she were almost in disgrace she looked up into monsieur dufarges face with her big greengray eyes and they were quite innocently appealing she knew that he would understand as soon as she spoke she began to explain quite simply in pretty and fluent french madame had not understood she had not learned french exactlynot out of booksbut her papa and other people had always spoken it to her and she had read it and written it as she had read and written english her papa loved it and she loved it because he did her dear mamma who had died when she was born had been french she would be glad to learn anything monsieur would teach her but what she had tried to explain to madame was that she already knew the words in this bookand she held out the little book of phrases when she began to speak miss minchin started quite violently and sat staring at her over her eyeglasses almost indignantly until she had finished monsieur dufarge began to smile and his smile was one of great pleasure to hear this pretty childish voice speaking his own language so simply and charmingly made him feel almost as if he were in his native landwhich in dark foggy days in london sometimes seemed worlds away when she had finished he took the phrasebook from her with a look almost affectionate but he spoke to miss minchin ah madame he said there is not much i can teach her she has not learned french she is french her accent is exquisite you ought to have told me exclaimed miss minchin much mortified turning on sara ii tried said sara ii suppose i did not begin right miss minchin knew she had tried and that it had not been her fault that she was not allowed to explain and when she saw that the pupils had been listening and that lavinia and jessie were giggling behind their french grammars she felt infuriated silence young ladies she said severely rapping upon the desk silence at once and she began from that minute to feel rather a grudge against her show pupil chapter iii ermengarde on that first morning when sara sat at miss minchins side aware that the whole schoolroom was devoting itself to observing her she had noticed very soon one little girl about her own age who looked at her very hard with a pair of light rather dull blue eyes she was a fat child who did not look as if she were in the least clever but she had a goodnaturedly pouting mouth her flaxen hair was braided in a tight pigtail tied with a ribbon and she had pulled this pigtail round her neck and was biting the end of the ribbon resting her elbows on the desk as she stared wonderingly at the new pupil when monsieur dufarge began to speak to sara she looked a little frightened and when sara stepped forward and looking at him with the innocent appealing eyes answered him without any warning in french the fat little girl gave a startled jump and grew quite red in her awed amazement having wept hopeless tears for weeks in her efforts to remember that la mere meant the mother and le pere the fatherwhen one spoke sensible englishit was almost too much for her to suddenly find herself listening to a child her own age who seemed not only quite familiar with these words but apparently knew any number of others and could mix them up with verbs as if they were mere trifles she stared so hard and bit the ribbon on her pigtail so fast that she attracted the attention of miss minchin who feeling extremely cross at the moment immediately pounced upon her miss st john she exclaimed severely what do you mean by such conduct remove your elbows take your ribbon out of your mouth sit up at once upon which miss st john gave another jump and when lavinia and jessie tittered she became redder than everso red indeed that she almost looked as if tears were coming into her poor dull childish eyes and sara saw her and was so sorry for her that she began to rather like her and want to be her friend it was a way of hers always to want to spring into any fray in which some one was made uncomfortable or unhappy if sara had been a boy and lived a few centuries ago her father used to say she would have gone about the country with her sword drawn rescuing and defending every one in distress she always wants to fight when she sees people in trouble so she took rather a fancy to fat slow little miss st john and kept glancing toward her through the morning she saw that lessons were no easy matter to her and that there was no danger of her ever being spoiled by being treated as a show pupil her french lesson was a pathetic thing her pronunciation made even monsieur dufarge smile in spite of himself and lavinia and jessie and the more fortunate girls either giggled or looked at her in wondering disdain but sara did not laugh she tried to look as if she did not hear when miss st john called le bon pain lee bong pang she had a fine hot little temper of her own and it made her feel rather savage when she heard the titters and saw the poor stupid distressed childs face it isnt funny really she said between her teeth as she bent over her book they ought not to laugh when lessons were over and the pupils gathered together in groups to talk sara looked for miss st john and finding her bundled rather disconsolately in a windowseat she walked over to her and spoke she only said the kind of thing little girls always say to each other by way of beginning an acquaintance but there was something nice and friendly about sara and people always felt it what is your name she said to explain miss st johns amazement one must recall that a new pupil is for a short time a somewhat uncertain thing and of this new pupil the entire school had talked the night before until it fell asleep quite exhausted by excitement and contradictory stories a new pupil with a carriage and a pony and a maid and a voyage from india to discuss was not an ordinary acquaintance my names ermengarde st john she answered mine is sara crewe said sara yours is very pretty it sounds like a storybook do you like it fluttered ermengarde ii like yours miss st johns chief trouble in life was that she had a clever father sometimes this seemed to her a dreadful calamity if you have a father who knows everything who speaks seven or eight languages and has thousands of volumes which he has apparently learned by heart he frequently expects you to be familiar with the contents of your lessonbooks at least and it is not improbable that he will feel you ought to be able to remember a few incidents of history and to write a french exercise ermengarde was a severe trial to mr st john he could not understand how a child of his could be a notably and unmistakably dull creature who never shone in anything good heavens he had said more than once as he stared at her there are times when i think she is as stupid as her aunt eliza if her aunt eliza had been slow to learn and quick to forget a thing entirely when she had learned it ermengarde was strikingly like her she was the monumental dunce of the school and it could not be denied she must be made to learn her father said to miss minchin consequently ermengarde spent the greater part of her life in disgrace or in tears she learned things and forgot them or if she remembered them she did not understand them so it was natural that having made saras acquaintance she should sit and stare at her with profound admiration you can speak french cant you she said respectfully sara got on to the windowseat which was a big deep one and tucking up her feet sat with her hands clasped round her knees i can speak it because i have heard it all my life she answered you could speak it if you had always heard it oh no i couldnt said ermengarde i never could speak it why inquired sara curiously ermengarde shook her head so that the pigtail wabbled you heard me just now she said im always like that i cant say the words theyre so queer she paused a moment and then added with a touch of awe in her voice you are clever arent you sara looked out of the window into the dingy square where the sparrows were hopping and twittering on the wet iron railings and the sooty branches of the trees she reflected a few moments she had heard it said very often that she was clever and she wondered if she wasand if she was how it had happened i dont know she said i cant tell then seeing a mournful look on the round chubby face she gave a little laugh and changed the subject would you like to see emily she inquired who is emily ermengarde asked just as miss minchin had done come up to my room and see said sara holding out her hand they jumped down from the windowseat together and went upstairs is it true ermengarde whispered as they went through the hallis it true that you have a playroom all to yourself yes sara answered papa asked miss minchin to let me have one becausewell it was because when i play i make up stories and tell them to myself and i dont like people to hear me it spoils it if i think people listen they had reached the passage leading to saras room by this time and ermengarde stopped short staring and quite losing her breath you make up stories she gasped can you do thatas well as speak french can you sara looked at her in simple surprise why any one can make up things she said have you never tried she put her hand warningly on ermengardes let us go very quietly to the door she whispered and then i will open it quite suddenly perhaps we may catch her she was half laughing but there was a touch of mysterious hope in her eyes which fascinated ermengarde though she had not the remotest idea what it meant or whom it was she wanted to catch or why she wanted to catch her whatsoever she meant ermengarde was sure it was something delightfully exciting so quite thrilled with expectation she followed her on tiptoe along the passage they made not the least noise until they reached the door then sara suddenly turned the handle and threw it wide open its opening revealed the room quite neat and quiet a fire gently burning in the grate and a wonderful doll sitting in a chair by it apparently reading a book oh she got back to her seat before we could see her sara exclaimed of course they always do they are as quick as lightning ermengarde looked from her to the doll and back again can shewalk she asked breathlessly yes answered sara at least i believe she can at least i pretend i believe she can and that makes it seem as if it were true have you never pretended things no said ermengarde never itell me about it she was so bewitched by this odd new companion that she actually stared at sara instead of at emilynotwithstanding that emily was the most attractive doll person she had ever seen let us sit down said sara and i will tell you its so easy that when you begin you cant stop you just go on and on doing it always and its beautiful emily you must listen this is ermengarde st john emily ermengarde this is emily would you like to hold her oh may i said ermengarde may i really she is beautiful and emily was put into her arms never in her dull short life had miss st john dreamed of such an hour as the one she spent with the queer new pupil before they heard the lunchbell ring and were obliged to go downstairs sara sat upon the hearthrug and told her strange things she sat rather huddled up and her green eyes shone and her cheeks flushed she told stories of the voyage and stories of india but what fascinated ermengarde the most was her fancy about the dolls who walked and talked and who could do anything they chose when the human beings were out of the room but who must keep their powers a secret and so flew back to their places like lightning when people returned to the room we couldnt do it said sara seriously you see its a kind of magic once when she was relating the story of the search for emily ermengarde saw her face suddenly change a cloud seemed to pass over it and put out the light in her shining eyes she drew her breath in so sharply that it made a funny sad little sound and then she shut her lips and held them tightly closed as if she was determined either to do or not to do something ermengarde had an idea that if she had been like any other little girl she might have suddenly burst out sobbing and crying but she did not have you aa pain ermengarde ventured yes sara answered after a moments silence but it is not in my body then she added something in a low voice which she tried to keep quite steady and it was this do you love your father more than anything else in all the whole world ermengardes mouth fell open a little she knew that it would be far from behaving like a respectable child at a select seminary to say that it had never occurred to you that you could love your father that you would do anything desperate to avoid being left alone in his society for ten minutes she was indeed greatly embarrassed ii scarcely ever see him she stammered he is always in the libraryreading things i love mine more than all the world ten times over sara said that is what my pain is he has gone away she put her head quietly down on her little huddledup knees and sat very still for a few minutes shes going to cry out loud thought ermengarde fearfully but she did not her short black locks tumbled about her ears and she sat still then she spoke without lifting her head i promised him i would bear it she said and i will you have to bear things think what soldiers bear papa is a soldier if there was a war he would have to bear marching and thirstiness and perhaps deep wounds and he would never say a wordnot one word ermengarde could only gaze at her but she felt that she was beginning to adore her she was so wonderful and different from any one else presently she lifted her face and shook back her black locks with a queer little smile if i go on talking and talking she said and telling you things about pretending i shall bear it better you dont forget but you bear it better ermengarde did not know why a lump came into her throat and her eyes felt as if tears were in them lavinia and jessie are best friends she said rather huskily i wish we could be best friends would you have me for yours youre clever and im the stupidest child in the school but ioh i do so like you im glad of that said sara it makes you thankful when you are liked yes we will be friends and ill tell you whata sudden gleam lighting her facei can help you with your french lessons chapter iv lottie if sara had been a different kind of child the life she led at miss minchins select seminary for the next ten years would not have been at all good for her she was treated more as if she were a distinguished guest at the establishment than as if she were a mere little girl if she had been a selfopinionated domineering child she might have become disagreeable enough to be unbearable through being so much indulged and flattered if she had been an indolent child she would have learned nothing privately miss minchin disliked her but she was far too worldly a woman to do or say anything which might make such a desirable pupil wish to leave her school she knew quite well that if sara wrote to her papa to tell him she was uncomfortable or unhappy captain crewe would remove her at once miss minchins opinion was that if a child were continually praised and never forbidden to do what she liked she would be sure to be fond of the place where she was so treated accordingly sara was praised for her quickness at her lessons for her good manners for her amiability to her fellowpupils for her generosity if she gave sixpence to a beggar out of her full little purse the simplest thing she did was treated as if it were a virtue and if she had not had a disposition and a clever little brain she might have been a very selfsatisfied young person but the clever little brain told her a great many sensible and true things about herself and her circumstances and now and then she talked these things over to ermengarde as time went on things happen to people by accident she used to say a lot of nice accidents have happened to me it just happened that i always liked lessons and books and could remember things when i learned them it just happened that i was born with a father who was beautiful and nice and clever and could give me everything i liked perhaps i have not really a good temper at all but if you have everything you want and every one is kind to you how can you help but be goodtempered i dont knowlooking quite serioushow i shall ever find out whether i am really a nice child or a horrid one perhaps im a hideous child and no one will ever know just because i never have any trials lavinia has no trials said ermengarde stolidly and she is horrid enough sara rubbed the end of her little nose reflectively as she thought the matter over well she said at last perhapsperhaps that is because lavinia is growing this was the result of a charitable recollection of having heard miss amelia say that lavinia was growing so fast that she believed it affected her health and temper lavinia in fact was spiteful she was inordinately jealous of sara until the new pupils arrival she had felt herself the leader in the school she had led because she was capable of making herself extremely disagreeable if the others did not follow her she domineered over the little children and assumed grand airs with those big enough to be her companions she was rather pretty and had been the bestdressed pupil in the procession when the select seminary walked out two by two until saras velvet coats and sable muffs appeared combined with drooping ostrich feathers and were led by miss minchin at the head of the line this at the beginning had been bitter enough but as time went on it became apparent that sara was a leader too and not because she could make herself disagreeable but because she never did theres one thing about sara crewe jessie had enraged her best friend by saying honestlyshes never grand about herself the least bit and you know she might be lavvie i believe i couldnt help beingjust a littleif i had so many fine things and was made such a fuss over its disgusting the way miss minchin shows her off when parents come dear sara must come into the drawingroom and talk to mrs musgrave about india mimicked lavinia in her most highly flavored imitation of miss minchin dear sara must speak french to lady pitkin her accent is so perfect she didnt learn her french at the seminary at any rate and theres nothing so clever in her knowing it she says herself she didnt learn it at all she just picked it up because she always heard her papa speak it and as to her papa there is nothing so grand in being an indian officer well said jessie slowly hes killed tigers he killed the one in the skin sara has in her room thats why she likes it so she lies on it and strokes its head and talks to it as if it was a cat shes always doing something silly snapped lavinia my mamma says that way of hers of pretending things is silly she says she will grow up eccentric it was quite true that sara was never grand she was a friendly little soul and shared her privileges and belongings with a free hand the little ones who were accustomed to being disdained and ordered out of the way by mature ladies aged ten and twelve were never made to cry by this most envied of them all she was a motherly young person and when people fell down and scraped their knees she ran and helped them up and patted them or found in her pocket a bonbon or some other article of a soothing nature she never pushed them out of her way or alluded to their years as a humiliation and a blot upon their small characters if you are four you are four she said severely to lavinia on an occasion of her havingit must be confessedslapped lottie and called her a brat but you will be five next year and six the year after that and opening large convicting eyes it only takes sixteen years to make you twenty dear me said lavinia how we can calculate in fact it was not to be denied that sixteen and four made twentyand twenty was an age the most daring were scarcely bold enough to dream of illustration more than once she had been known to have a teaparty so the younger children adored sara more than once she had been known to have a teaparty made up of these despised ones in her own room and emily had been played with and emilys own teaservice usedthe one with cups which held quite a lot of muchsweetened weak tea and had blue flowers on them no one had seen such a very real dolls teaset before from that afternoon sara was regarded as a goddess and a queen by the entire alphabet class lottie legh worshipped her to such an extent that if sara had not been a motherly person she would have found her tiresome lottie had been sent to school by a rather flighty young papa who could not imagine what else to do with her her young mother had died and as the child had been treated like a favorite doll or a very spoiled pet monkey or lapdog ever since the first hour of her life she was a very appalling little creature when she wanted anything or did not want anything she wept and howled and as she always wanted the things she could not have and did not want the things that were best for her her shrill little voice was usually to be heard uplifted in wails in one part of the house or another her strongest weapon was that in some mysterious way she had found out that a very small girl who had lost her mother was a person who ought to be pitied and made much of she had probably heard some grownup people talking her over in the early days after her mothers death so it became her habit to make great use of this knowledge the first time sara took her in charge was one morning when on passing a sittingroom she heard both miss minchin and miss amelia trying to suppress the angry wails of some child who evidently refused to be silenced she refused so strenuously indeed that miss minchin was obliged to almost shoutin a stately and severe mannerto make herself heard what is she crying for she almost yelled ohohoh sara heard i havent got any mammaa oh lottie screamed miss amelia do stop darling dont cry please dont oh oh oh lottie howled tempestuously haventgotanymammaa she ought to be whipped miss minchin proclaimed you shall be whipped you naughty child lottie wailed more loudly than ever miss amelia began to cry miss minchins voice rose until it almost thundered then suddenly she sprang up from her chair in impotent indignation and flounced out of the room leaving miss amelia to arrange the matter sara had paused in the hall wondering if she ought to go into the room because she had recently begun a friendly acquaintance with lottie and might be able to quiet her when miss minchin came out and saw her she looked rather annoyed she realized that her voice as heard from inside the room could not have sounded either dignified or amiable oh sara she exclaimed endeavoring to produce a suitable smile i stopped explained sara because i knew it was lottieand i thought perhapsjust perhaps i could make her be quiet may i try miss minchin if you can you are a clever child answered miss minchin drawing in her mouth sharply then seeing that sara looked slightly chilled by her asperity she changed her manner but you are clever in everything she said in her approving way i dare say you can manage her go in and she left her when sara entered the room lottie was lying upon the floor screaming and kicking her small fat legs violently and miss amelia was bending over her in consternation and despair looking quite red and damp with heat lottie had always found when in her own nursery at home that kicking and screaming would always be quieted by any means she insisted on poor plump miss amelia was trying first one method and then another poor darling she said one moment i know you havent any mamma poor then in quite another tone if you dont stop lottie i will shake you poor little angel therethere you wicked bad detestable child i will smack you i will sara went to them quietly she did not know at all what she was going to do but she had a vague inward conviction that it would be better not to say such different kinds of things quite so helplessly and excitedly miss amelia she said in a low voice miss minchin says i may try to make her stopmay i miss amelia turned and looked at her hopelessly oh do you think you can she gasped i dont know whether i can answered sara still in her halfwhisper but i will try miss amelia stumbled up from her knees with a heavy sigh and lotties fat little legs kicked as hard as ever if you will steal out of the room said sara i will stay with her oh sara almost whimpered miss amelia we never had such a dreadful child before i dont believe we can keep her but she crept out of the room and was very much relieved to find an excuse for doing it sara stood by the howling furious child for a few moments and looked down at her without saying anything then she sat down flat on the floor beside her and waited except for lotties angry screams the room was quite quiet this was a new state of affairs for little miss legh who was accustomed when she screamed to hear other people protest and implore and command and coax by turns to lie and kick and shriek and find the only person near you not seeming to mind in the least attracted her attention she opened her tightshut streaming eyes to see who this person was and it was only another little girl but it was the one who owned emily and all the nice things and she was looking at her steadily and as if she was merely thinking having paused for a few seconds to find this out lottie thought she must begin again but the quiet of the room and of saras odd interested face made her first howl rather halfhearted ihaventanymamamaa she announced but her voice was not so strong sara looked at her still more steadily but with a sort of understanding in her eyes neither have i she said this was so unexpected that it was astounding lottie actually dropped her legs gave a wriggle and lay and stared a new idea will stop a crying child when nothing else will also it was true that while lottie disliked miss minchin who was cross and miss amelia who was foolishly indulgent she rather liked sara little as she knew her she did not want to give up her grievance but her thoughts were distracted from it so she wriggled again and after a sulky sob said where is she sara paused a moment because she had been told that her mamma was in heaven she had thought a great deal about the matter and her thoughts had not been quite like those of other people she went to heaven she said but i am sure she comes out sometimes to see methough i dont see her so does yours perhaps they can both see us now perhaps they are both in this room lottie sat bolt upright and looked about her she was a pretty little curlyheaded creature and her round eyes were like wet forgetmenots if her mamma had seen her during the last halfhour she might not have thought her the kind of child who ought to be related to an angel sara went on talking perhaps some people might think that what she said was rather like a fairy story but it was all so real to her own imagination that lottie began to listen in spite of herself she had been told that her mamma had wings and a crown and she had been shown pictures of ladies in beautiful white nightgowns who were said to be angels but sara seemed to be telling a real story about a lovely country where real people were there are fields and fields of flowers she said forgetting herself as usual when she began and talking rather as if she were in a dreamfields and fields of liliesand when the soft wind blows over them it wafts the scent of them into the airand everybody always breathes it because the soft wind is always blowing and little children run about in the lilyfields and gather armsful of them and laugh and make little wreaths and the streets are shining and no one is ever tired however far they walk they can float anywhere they like and there are walls made of pearl and gold all round the city but they are low enough for the people to go and lean on them and look down on to the earth and smile and send beautiful messages whatsoever story she had begun to tell lottie would no doubt have stopped crying and been fascinated into listening but there was no denying that this story was prettier than most others she dragged herself close to sara and drank in every word until the end camefar too soon when it did come she was so sorry that she put up her lip ominously i want to go there she cried ihavent any mamma in this school sara saw the dangersignal and came out of her dream she took hold of the chubby hand and pulled her close to her side with a coaxing little laugh i will be your mamma she said we will play that you are my little girl and emily shall be your sister lotties dimples all began to show themselves shall she she said yes answered sara jumping to her feet let us go and tell her and then i will wash your face and brush your hair to which lottie agreed quite cheerfully and trotted out of the room and upstairs with her without seeming even to remember that the whole of the last hours tragedy had been caused by the fact that she had refused to be washed and brushed for lunch and miss minchin had been called in to use her majestic authority and from that time sara was an adopted mother chapter v becky of course the greatest power sara possessed and the one which gained her even more followers than her luxuries and the fact that she was the show pupil the power that lavinia and certain other girls were most envious of and at the same time most fascinated by in spite of themselves was her power of telling stories and of making everything she talked about seem like a story whether it was one or not any one who has been at school with a teller of stories knows what the wonder meanshow he or she is followed about and besought in a whisper to relate romances how groups gather round and hang on the outskirts of the favored party in the hope of being allowed to join it and listen sara not only could tell stories but she adored telling them when she sat or stood in the midst of a circle and began to invent wonderful things her green eyes grew big and shining her cheeks flushed and without knowing that she was doing it she began to act and made what she told lovely or alarming by the raising or dropping of her voice the bend and sway of her slim body and the dramatic movement of her hands she forgot that she was talking to listening children she saw and lived with the fairy folk or the kings and queens and beautiful ladies whose adventures she was narrating sometimes when she had finished her story she was quite out of breath with excitement and would lay her hand on her thin little quickrising chest and half laugh as if at herself when i am telling it she would say it doesnt seem as if it was only made up it seems more real than you aremore real than the schoolroom i feel as if i were all the people in the storyone after the other it is queer she had been at miss minchins school about two years when one foggy winters afternoon as she was getting out of her carriage comfortably wrapped up in her warmest velvets and furs and looking very much grander than she knew she caught sight as she crossed the pavement of a dingy little figure standing on the area steps and stretching its neck so that its wideopen eyes might peer at her through the railings something in the eagerness and timidity of the smudgy face made her look at it and when she looked she smiled because it was her way to smile at people but the owner of the smudgy face and the wideopen eyes evidently was afraid that she ought not to have been caught looking at pupils of importance she dodged out of sight like a jackinthebox and scurried back into the kitchen disappearing so suddenly that if she had not been such a poor little forlorn thing sara would have laughed in spite of herself that very evening as sara was sitting in the midst of a group of listeners in a corner of the schoolroom telling one of her stories the very same figure timidly entered the room carrying a coalbox much too heavy for her and knelt down upon the hearthrug to replenish the fire and sweep up the ashes she was cleaner than she had been when she peeped through the area railings but she looked just as frightened she was evidently afraid to look at the children or seem to be listening she put on pieces of coal cautiously with her fingers so that she might make no disturbing noise and she swept about the fireirons very softly but sara saw in two minutes that she was deeply interested in what was going on and that she was doing her work slowly in the hope of catching a word here and there and realizing this she raised her voice and spoke more clearly the mermaids swam softly about in the crystalgreen water and dragged after them a fishingnet woven of deepsea pearls she said the princess sat on the white rock and watched them it was a wonderful story about a princess who was loved by a prince merman and went to live with him in shining caves under the sea the small drudge before the grate swept the hearth once and then swept it again having done it twice she did it three times and as she was doing it the third time the sound of the story so lured her to listen that she fell under the spell and actually forgot that she had no right to listen at all and also forgot everything else she sat down upon her heels as she knelt on the hearthrug and the brush hung idly in her fingers the voice of the storyteller went on and drew her with it into winding grottos under the sea glowing with soft clear blue light and paved with pure golden sands strange sea flowers and grasses waved about her and far away faint singing and music echoed the hearthbrush fell from the workroughened hand and lavinia herbert looked round that girl has been listening she said the culprit snatched up her brush and scrambled to her feet she caught at the coalbox and simply scuttled out of the room like a frightened rabbit sara felt rather hottempered i knew she was listening she said why shouldnt she lavinia tossed her head with great elegance well she remarked i do not know whether your mamma would like you to tell stories to servant girls but i know my mamma wouldnt like me to do it my mamma said sara looking odd i dont believe she would mind in the least she knows that stories belong to everybody i thought retorted lavinia in severe recollection that your mamma was dead how can she know things do you think she doesnt know things said sara in her stern little voice sometimes she had a rather stern little voice saras mamma knows everything piped in lottie so does my mammacept sara is my mamma at miss minchinsmy other one knows everything the streets are shining and there are fields and fields of lilies and everybody gathers them sara tells me when she puts me to bed you wicked thing said lavinia turning on sara making fairy stories about heaven there are much more splendid stories in revelation returned sara just look and see how do you know mine are fairy stories but i can tell youwith a fine bit of unheavenly temperyou will never find out whether they are or not if youre not kinder to people than you are now come along lottie and she marched out of the room rather hoping that she might see the little servant again somewhere but she found no trace of her when she got into the hall who is that little girl who makes the fires she asked mariette that night mariette broke forth into a flow of description ah indeed mademoiselle sara might well ask she was a forlorn little thing who had just taken the place of scullerymaidthough as to being scullerymaid she was everything else besides she blacked boots and grates and carried heavy coalscuttles up and down stairs and scrubbed floors and cleaned windows and was ordered about by everybody she was fourteen years old but was so stunted in growth that she looked about twelve in truth mariette was sorry for her she was so timid that if one chanced to speak to her it appeared as if her poor frightened eyes would jump out of her head what is her name asked sara who had sat by the table with her chin on her hands as she listened absorbedly to the recital her name was becky mariette heard every one belowstairs calling becky do this and becky do that every five minutes in the day sara sat and looked into the fire reflecting on becky for some time after mariette left her she made up a story of which becky was the illused heroine she thought she looked as if she had never had quite enough to eat her very eyes were hungry she hoped she should see her again but though she caught sight of her carrying things up or down stairs on several occasions she always seemed in such a hurry and so afraid of being seen that it was impossible to speak to her but a few weeks later on another foggy afternoon when she entered her sittingroom she found herself confronting a rather pathetic picture in her own special and pet easychair before the bright fire beckywith a coal smudge on her nose and several on her apron with her poor little cap hanging half off her head and an empty coalbox on the floor near hersat fast asleep tired out beyond even the endurance of her hardworking young body she had been sent up to put the bedrooms in order for the evening there were a great many of them and she had been running about all day saras rooms she had saved until the last they were not like the other rooms which were plain and bare ordinary pupils were expected to be satisfied with mere necessaries saras comfortable sittingroom seemed a bower of luxury to the scullerymaid though it was in fact merely a nice bright little room but there were pictures and books in it and curious things from india there was a sofa and the low soft chair emily sat in a chair of her own with the air of a presiding goddess and there was always a glowing fire and a polished grate becky saved it until the end of her afternoons work because it rested her to go into it and she always hoped to snatch a few minutes to sit down in the soft chair and look about her and think about the wonderful good fortune of the child who owned such surroundings and who went out on the cold days in beautiful hats and coats one tried to catch a glimpse of through the area railing on this afternoon when she had sat down the sensation of relief to her short aching legs had been so wonderful and delightful that it had seemed to soothe her whole body and the glow of warmth and comfort from the fire had crept over her like a spell until as she looked at the red coals a tired slow smile stole over her smudged face her head nodded forward without her being aware of it her eyes drooped and she fell fast asleep she had really been only about ten minutes in the room when sara entered but she was in as deep a sleep as if she had been like the sleeping beauty slumbering for a hundred years but she did not lookpoor beckylike a sleeping beauty at all she looked only like an ugly stunted wornout little scullery drudge sara seemed as much unlike her as if she were a creature from another world on this particular afternoon she had been taking her dancinglesson and the afternoon on which the dancingmaster appeared was rather a grand occasion at the seminary though it occurred every week the pupils were attired in their prettiest frocks and as sara danced particularly well she was very much brought forward and mariette was requested to make her as diaphanous and fine as possible today a frock the color of a rose had been put on her and mariette had bought some real buds and made her a wreath to wear on her black locks she had been learning a new delightful dance in which she had been skimming and flying about the room like a large rosecolored butterfly and the enjoyment and exercise had brought a brilliant happy glow into her face when she entered the room she floated in with a few of the butterfly stepsand there sat becky nodding her cap sideways off her head oh cried sara softly when she saw her that poor thing it did not occur to her to feel cross at finding her pet chair occupied by the small dingy figure to tell the truth she was quite glad to find it there when the illused heroine of her story wakened she could talk to her she crept toward her quietly and stood looking at her becky gave a little snore i wish shed waken herself sara said i dont like to waken her but miss minchin would be cross if she found out ill just wait a few minutes she took a seat on the edge of the table and sat swinging her slim rosecolored legs and wondering what it would be best to do miss amelia might come in at any moment and if she did becky would be sure to be scolded but she is so tired she thought she is so tired a piece of flaming coal ended her perplexity for her that very moment it broke off from a large lump and fell on to the fender becky started and opened her eyes with a frightened gasp she did not know she had fallen asleep she had only sat down for one moment and felt the beautiful glowand here she found herself staring in wild alarm at the wonderful pupil who sat perched quite near her like a rosecolored fairy with interested eyes she sprang up and clutched at her cap she felt it dangling over her ear and tried wildly to put it straight oh she had got herself into trouble now with a vengeance to have impudently fallen asleep on such a young ladys chair she would be turned out of doors without wages she made a sound like a big breathless sob oh miss oh miss she stuttered i arst yer pardon miss oh i do miss sara jumped down and came quite close to her dont be frightened she said quite as if she had been speaking to a little girl like herself it doesnt matter the least bit i didnt go to do it miss protested becky it was the warm firean me bein so tired itit wasnt imperence sara broke into a friendly little laugh and put her hand on her shoulder you were tired she said you could not help it you are not really awake yet how poor becky stared at her in fact she had never heard such a nice friendly sound in any ones voice before she was used to being ordered about and scolded and having her ears boxed and this onein her rosecolored dancing afternoon splendorwas looking at her as if she were not a culprit at allas if she had a right to be tiredeven to fall asleep the touch of the soft slim little paw on her shoulder was the most amazing thing she had ever known aintaint yer angry miss she gasped aint yer goin to tell the missus no cried out sara of course im not the woful fright in the coalsmutted face made her suddenly so sorry that she could scarcely bear it one of her queer thoughts rushed into her mind she put her hand against beckys cheek why she said we are just the samei am only a little girl like you its just an accident that i am not you and you are not me becky did not understand in the least her mind could not grasp such amazing thoughts and an accident meant to her a calamity in which some one was run over or fell off a ladder and was carried to the orspital a accident miss she fluttered respectfully is it yes sara answered and she looked at her dreamily for a moment but the next she spoke in a different tone she realized that becky did not know what she meant have you done your work she asked dare you stay here a few minutes becky lost her breath again here miss me sara ran to the door opened it and looked out and listened no one is anywhere about she explained if your bedrooms are finished perhaps you might stay a tiny while i thoughtperhapsyou might like a piece of cake the next ten minutes seemed to becky like a sort of delirium sara opened a cupboard and gave her a thick slice of cake she seemed to rejoice when it was devoured in hungry bites she talked and asked questions and laughed until beckys fears actually began to calm themselves and she once or twice gathered boldness enough to ask a question or so herself daring as she felt it to be is that she ventured looking longingly at the rosecolored frock and she asked it almost in a whisper is that there your best it is one of my dancingfrocks answered sara i like it dont you for a few seconds becky was almost speechless with admiration then she said in an awed voice onct i see a princess i was standin in the street with the crowd outside covin garden watchin the swells go inter the operer an there was one every one stared at most they ses to each other thats the princess she was a growedup young lady but she was pink all overgownd an cloak an flowers an all i called her to mind the minnit i see you sittin there on the table miss you looked like her ive often thought said sara in her reflecting voice that i should like to be a princess i wonder what it feels like i believe i will begin pretending i am one becky stared at her admiringly and as before did not understand her in the least she watched her with a sort of adoration very soon sara left her reflections and turned to her with a new question becky she said werent you listening to that story yes miss confessed becky a little alarmed again i knowed i hadnt orter but it was that beautiful ii couldnt help it i liked you to listen to it said sara if you tell stories you like nothing so much as to tell them to people who want to listen i dont know why it is would you like to hear the rest becky lost her breath again me hear it she cried like as if i was a pupil miss all about the princeand the little white merbabies swimming about laughingwith stars in their hair sara nodded you havent time to hear it now im afraid she said but if you will tell me just what time you come to do my rooms i will try to be here and tell you a bit of it every day until it is finished its a lovely long oneand im always putting new bits to it then breathed becky devoutly i wouldnt mind how heavy the coalboxes wasor what the cook done to me ifif i might have that to think of you may said sara ill tell it all to you when becky went downstairs she was not the same becky who had staggered up loaded down by the weight of the coalscuttle she had an extra piece of cake in her pocket and she had been fed and warmed but not only by cake and fire something else had warmed and fed her and the something else was sara when she was gone sara sat on her favorite perch on the end of her table her feet were on a chair her elbows on her knees and her chin in her hands if i was a princessa real princess she murmured i could scatter largess to the populace but even if i am only a pretend princess i can invent little things to do for people things like this she was just as happy as if it was largess ill pretend that to do things people like is scattering largess ive scattered largess chapter vi the diamondmines not very long after this a very exciting thing happened not only sara but the entire school found it exciting and made it the chief subject of conversation for weeks after it occurred in one of his letters captain crewe told a most interesting story a friend who had been at school with him when he was a boy had unexpectedly come to see him in india he was the owner of a large tract of land upon which diamonds had been found and he was engaged in developing the mines if all went as was confidently expected he would become possessed of such wealth as it made one dizzy to think of and because he was fond of the friend of his schooldays he had given him an opportunity to share in this enormous fortune by becoming a partner in his scheme this at least was what sara gathered from his letters it is true that any other business scheme however magnificent would have had but small attraction for her or for the schoolroom but diamondmines sounded so like the arabian nights that no one could be indifferent sara thought them enchanting and painted pictures for ermengarde and lottie of labyrinthine passages in the bowels of the earth where sparkling stones studded the walls and roofs and ceilings and strange dark men dug them out with heavy picks ermengarde delighted in the story and lottie insisted on its being retold to her every evening lavinia was very spiteful about it and told jessie that she didnt believe such things as diamondmines existed my mamma has a diamond ring which cost forty pounds she said and it is not a big one either if there were mines full of diamonds people would be so rich it would be ridiculous perhaps sara will be so rich that she will be ridiculous giggled jessie shes ridiculous without being rich lavinia sniffed i believe you hate her said jessie no i dont snapped lavinia but i dont believe in mines full of diamonds well people have to get them from somewhere said jessie laviniawith a new gigglewhat do you think gertrude says i dont know im sure and i dont care if its something more about that everlasting sara well it is one of her pretends is that she is a princess she plays it all the timeeven in school she says it makes her learn her lessons better she wants ermengarde to be one too but ermengarde says she is too fat she is too fat said lavinia and sara is too thin naturally jessie giggled again she says it has nothing to do with what you look like or what you have it has only to do with what you think of and what you do i suppose she thinks she could be a princess if she was a beggar said lavinia let us begin to call her your royal highness lessons for the day were over and they were sitting before the schoolroom fire enjoying the time they liked best it was the time when miss minchin and miss amelia were taking their tea in the sittingroom sacred to themselves at this hour a great deal of talking was done and a great many secrets changed hands particularly if the younger pupils behaved themselves well and did not squabble or run about noisily which it must be confessed they usually did when they made an uproar the older girls usually interfered with scoldings and shakes they were expected to keep order and there was danger that if they did not miss minchin or miss amelia would appear and put an end to festivities even as lavinia spoke the door opened and sara entered with lottie whose habit was to trot everywhere after her like a little dog there she is with that horrid child exclaimed lavinia in a whisper if shes so fond of her why doesnt she keep her in her own room she will begin howling about something in five minutes it happened that lottie had been seized with a sudden desire to play in the schoolroom and had begged her adopted parent to come with her she joined a group of little ones who were playing in a corner sara curled herself up in the windowseat opened a book and began to read it was a book about the french revolution and she was soon lost in a harrowing picture of the prisoners in the bastillemen who had spent so many years in dungeons that when they were dragged out by those who rescued them their long gray hair and beards almost hid their faces and they had forgotten that an outside world existed at all and were like beings in a dream she was so far away from the schoolroom that it was not agreeable to be dragged back suddenly by a howl from lottie never did she find anything so difficult as to keep herself from losing her temper when she was suddenly disturbed while absorbed in a book people who are fond of books know the feeling of irritation which sweeps over them at such a moment the temptation to be unreasonable and snappish is one not easy to manage it makes me feel as if some one had hit me sara had told ermengarde once in confidence and as if i want to hit back i have to remember things quickly to keep from saying something illtempered she had to remember things quickly when she laid her book on the windowseat and jumped down from her comfortable corner lottie had been sliding across the schoolroom floor and having first irritated lavinia and jessie by making a noise had ended by falling down and hurting her fat knee she was screaming and dancing up and down in the midst of a group of friends and enemies who were alternately coaxing and scolding her stop this minute you crybaby stop this minute lavinia commanded im not a crybabyim not wailed lottie sara sara if she doesnt stop miss minchin will hear her cried jessie lottie darling ill give you a penny i dont want your penny sobbed lottie and she looked down at the fat knee and seeing a drop of blood on it burst forth again sara flew across the room and kneeling down put her arms round her now lottie she said now lottie you promised sara she said i was a crybaby wept lottie sara patted her but spoke in the steady voice lottie knew but if you cry you will be one lottie pet you promised lottie remembered that she had promised but she preferred to lift up her voice i havent any mamma she proclaimed i haventa bitof mamma yes you have said sara cheerfully have you forgotten dont you know that sara is your mamma dont you want sara for your mamma lottie cuddled up to her with a consoled sniff come and sit in the windowseat with me sara went on and ill whisper a story to you will you whimpered lottie will youtell meabout the diamondmines the diamondmines broke out lavinia nasty little spoiled thing i should like to slap her sara got up quickly on her feet it must be remembered that she had been very deeply absorbed in the book about the bastille and she had had to recall several things rapidly when she realized that she must go and take care of her adopted child she was not an angel and she was not fond of lavinia well she said with some fire i should like to slap youbut i dont want to slap you restraining herself at least i both want to slap youand i should like to slap youbut i wont slap you we are not little gutter children we are both old enough to know better here was lavinias opportunity ah yes your royal highness she said we are princesses i believe at least one of us is the school ought to be very fashionable now miss minchin has a princess for a pupil sara started toward her she looked as if she were going to box her ears perhaps she was her trick of pretending things was the joy of her life she never spoke of it to girls she was not fond of her new pretend about being a princess was very near to her heart and she was shy and sensitive about it she had meant it to be rather a secret and here was lavinia deriding it before nearly all the school she felt the blood rush up into her face and tingle in her ears she only just saved herself if you were a princess you did not fly into rages her hand dropped and she stood quite still a moment when she spoke it was in a quiet steady voice she held her head up and everybody listened to her its true she said sometimes i do pretend i am a princess i pretend i am a princess so that i can try and behave like one lavinia could not think of exactly the right thing to say several times she had found that she could not think of a satisfactory reply when she was dealing with sara the reason of this was that somehow the rest always seemed to be vaguely in sympathy with her opponent she saw now that they were pricking up their ears interestedly the truth was they liked princesses and they all hoped they might hear something more definite about this one and drew nearer sara accordingly lavinia could only invent one remark and it fell rather flat dear me she said i hope when you ascend the throne you wont forget us i wont said sara and she did not utter another word but stood quite still and stared at her steadily as she saw her take jessies arm and turn away after this the girls who were jealous of her used to speak of her as princess sara whenever they wished to be particularly disdainful and those who were fond of her gave her the name among themselves as a term of affection no one called her princess instead of sara but her adorers were much pleased with the picturesqueness and grandeur of the title and miss minchin hearing of it mentioned it more than once to visiting parents feeling that it rather suggested a sort of royal boardingschool to becky it seemed the most appropriate thing in the world the acquaintance begun on the foggy afternoon when she had jumped up terrified from her sleep in the comfortable chair had ripened and grown though it must be confessed that miss minchin and miss amelia knew very little about it they were aware that sara was kind to the scullerymaid but they knew nothing of certain delightful moments snatched perilously when the upstairs rooms being set in order with lightning rapidity saras sittingroom was reached and the heavy coalbox set down with a sigh of joy at such times stories were told by instalments things of a satisfying nature were either produced and eaten or hastily tucked into pockets to be disposed of at night when becky went upstairs to her attic to bed but i has to eat em careful miss she said once cos if i leaves crumbs the rats come out to get em rats exclaimed sara in horror are there rats there lots of em miss becky answered in quite a matteroffact manner there mostly is rats an mice in attics you gets used to the noise they makes scuttling about ive got so i dont mind em s long as they dont run over my piller ugh said sara you gets used to anythin after a bit said becky you have to miss if youre born a scullerymaid id rather have rats than cockroaches so would i said sara i suppose you might make friends with a rat in time but i dont believe i should like to make friends with a cockroach sometimes becky did not dare to spend more than a few minutes in the bright warm room and when this was the case perhaps only a few words could be exchanged and a small purchase slipped into the oldfashioned pocket becky carried under her dress skirt tied round her waist with a band of tape the search for and discovery of satisfying things to eat which could be packed into small compass added a new interest to saras existence when she drove or walked out she used to look into shop windows eagerly the first time it occurred to her to bring home two or three little meatpies she felt that she had hit upon a discovery when she exhibited them beckys eyes quite sparkled oh miss she murmured them will be nice an fillin its fillinness thats best spongecakes a evingly thing but it melts away likeif you understand miss thesell just stay in yer stummick well hesitated sara i dont think it would be good if they stayed always but i do believe they will be satisfying they were satisfyingand so were beef sandwiches bought at a cookshopand so were rolls and bologna sausage in time becky began to lose her hungry tired feeling and the coalbox did not seem so unbearably heavy however heavy it was and whatsoever the temper of the cook and the hardness of the work heaped upon her shoulders she had always the chance of the afternoon to look forward tothe chance that miss sara would be able to be in her sittingroom in fact the mere seeing of miss sara would have been enough without meatpies if there was time only for a few words they were always friendly merry words that put heart into one and if there was time for more then there was an instalment of a story to be told or some other thing one remembered afterward and sometimes lay awake in ones bed in the attic to think over sarawho was only doing what she unconsciously liked better than anything else nature having made her for a giverhad not the least idea what she meant to poor becky and how wonderful a benefactor she seemed if nature has made you for a giver your hands are born open and so is your heart and though there may be times when your hands are empty your heart is always full and you can give things out of thatwarm things kind things sweet thingshelp and comfort and laughterand sometimes gay kind laughter is the best help of all becky had scarcely known what laughter was through all her poor little harddriven life sara made her laugh and laughed with her and though neither of them quite knew it the laughter was as fillin as the meatpies a few weeks before saras eleventh birthday a letter came to her from her father which did not seem to be written in such boyish high spirits as usual he was not very well and was evidently overweighted by the business connected with the diamondmines you see little sara he wrote your daddy is not a business man at all and figures and documents bother him he does not really understand them and all this seems so enormous perhaps if i was not feverish i should not be awake tossing about one half of the night and spend the other half in troublesome dreams if my little missus were here i dare say she would give me some solemn good advice you would wouldnt you little missus one of his many jokes had been to call her his little missus because she had such an oldfashioned air he had made wonderful preparations for her birthday among other things a new doll had been ordered in paris and her wardrobe was to be indeed a marvel of splendid perfection when she had replied to the letter asking her if the doll would be an acceptable present sara had been very quaint i am getting very old she wrote you see i shall never live to have another doll given me this will be my last doll there is something solemn about it if i could write poetry i am sure a poem about a last doll would be very nice but i cannot write poetry i have tried and it made me laugh it did not sound like watts or coleridge or shakespeare at all no one could ever take emilys place but i should respect the last doll very much and i am sure the school would love it they all like dolls though some of the big onesthe almost fifteen onespretend they are too grown up captain crewe had a splitting headache when he read this letter in his bungalow in india the table before him was heaped with papers and letters which were alarming him and filling him with anxious dread but he laughed as he had not laughed for weeks oh he said shes better fun every year she lives god grant this business may right itself and leave me free to run home and see her what wouldnt i give to have her little arms round my neck this minute what wouldnt i give the birthday was to be celebrated by great festivities the schoolroom was to be decorated and there was to be a party the boxes containing the presents were to be opened with great ceremony and there was to be a glittering feast spread in miss minchins sacred room when the day arrived the whole house was in a whirl of excitement how the morning passed nobody quite knew because there seemed such preparations to be made the schoolroom was being decked with garlands of holly the desks had been moved away and red covers had been put on the forms which were arrayed round the room against the wall when sara went into her sittingroom in the morning she found on the table a small dumpy package tied up in a piece of brown paper she knew it was a present and she thought she could guess whom it came from she opened it quite tenderly it was a square pincushion made of not quite clean red flannel and black pins had been stuck carefully into it to form the words menny hapy returns oh cried sara with a warm feeling in her heart what pains she has taken i like it so itit makes me feel sorrowful but the next moment she was mystified on the under side of the pincushion was secured a card bearing in neat letters the name miss amelia minchin sara turned it over and over miss amelia she said to herself how can it be and just at that very moment she heard the door being cautiously pushed open and saw becky peeping round it there was an affectionate happy grin on her face and she shuffled forward and stood nervously pulling at her fingers do yer like it miss sara she said do yer like it cried sara you darling becky you made it all yourself becky gave a hysteric but joyful sniff and her eyes looked quite moist with delight it aint nothin but flannin an the flannin aint new but i wanted to give yer somethin an i made it of nights i knew yer could pretend it was satin with diamond pins in i tried to when i was makin it the card miss rather doubtfully t warnt wrong of me to pick it up out o the dustbin was it miss meliar had throwed it away i hadnt no card o my own an i knowed it wouldnt be a proper presink if i didnt pin a card onso i pinned miss meliars sara flew at her and hugged her she could not have told herself or any one else why there was a lump in her throat oh becky she cried out with a queer little laugh i love you beckyi do i do oh miss breathed becky thank yer miss kindly it aint good enough for that thethe flannin wasnt new chapter vii the diamondmines again when sara entered the hollyhung schoolroom in the afternoon she did so as the head of a sort of procession miss minchin in her grandest silk dress led her by the hand a manservant followed carrying the box containing the last doll a housemaid carried a second box and becky brought up the rear carrying a third and wearing a clean apron and a new cap sara would have much preferred to enter in the usual way but miss minchin had sent for her and after an interview in her private sittingroom had expressed her wishes this is not an ordinary occasion she said i do not desire that it should be treated as one so sara was led grandly in and felt shy when on her entry the big girls stared at her and touched each others elbows and the little ones began to squirm joyously in their seats silence young ladies said miss minchin at the murmur which arose james place the box on the table and remove the lid emma put yours upon a chair becky suddenly and severely becky had quite forgotten herself in her excitement and was grinning at lottie who was wriggling with rapturous expectation she almost dropped her box the disapproving voice so startled her and her frightened bobbing courtesy of apology was so funny that lavinia and jessie tittered it is not your place to look at the young ladies said miss minchin you forget yourself put your box down becky obeyed with alarmed haste and hastily backed toward the door you may leave us miss minchin announced to the servants with a wave of her hand becky stepped aside respectfully to allow the superior servants to pass out first she could not help casting a longing glance at the box on the table something made of blue satin was peeping from between the folds of tissuepaper if you please miss minchin said sara suddenly maynt becky stay it was a bold thing to do miss minchin was betrayed into something like a slight jump then she put her eyeglass up and gazed at her show pupil disturbedly becky she exclaimed my dearest sara sara advanced a step toward her i want her because i know she will like to see the presents she explained she is a little girl too you know miss minchin was scandalized she glanced from one figure to the other my dear sara she said becky is the scullerymaid scullerymaidserare not little girls it really had not occurred to her to think of them in that light scullerymaids were machines who carried coalscuttles and made fires but becky is said sara and i know she would enjoy herself please let her staybecause it is my birthday miss minchin replied with much dignity as you ask it as a birthday favorshe may stay rebecca thank miss sara for her great kindness becky had been backing into the corner twisting the hem of her apron in delighted suspense she came forward bobbing courtesies but between saras eyes and her own there passed a gleam of friendly understanding while her words tumbled over each other oh if you please miss im that grateful miss i did want to see the doll miss that i did thank you miss and thank you maamturning and making an alarmed bob to miss minchinfor letting me take the liberty miss minchin waved her hand againthis time it was in the direction of the corner near the door go and stand there she commanded not too near the young ladies becky went to her place grinning she did not care where she was sent so that she might have the luck of being inside the room instead of being downstairs in the scullery while these delights were going on she did not even mind when miss minchin cleared her throat ominously and spoke again now young ladies i have a few words to say to you she announced shes going to make a speech whispered one of the girls i wish it was over sara felt rather uncomfortable as this was her party it was probable that the speech was about her it is not agreeable to stand in a schoolroom and have a speech made about you you are aware young ladies the speech beganfor it was a speechthat dear sara is eleven years old today dear sara murmured lavinia several of you here have also been eleven years old but saras birthdays are rather different from other little girls birthdays when she is older she will be heiress to a large fortune which it will be her duty to spend in a meritorious manner the diamondmines giggled jessie in a whisper sara did not hear her but as she stood with her greengray eyes fixed steadily on miss minchin she felt herself growing rather hot when miss minchin talked about money she felt somehow that she always hated herand of course it was disrespectful to hate grownup people when her dear papa captain crewe brought her from india and gave her into my care the speech proceeded he said to me in a jesting way i am afraid she will be very rich miss minchin my reply was her education at my seminary captain crewe shall be such as will adorn the largest fortune sara has become my most accomplished pupil her french and her dancing are a credit to the seminary her mannerswhich have caused you to call her princess saraare perfect her amiability she exhibits by giving you this afternoons party i hope you appreciate her generosity i wish you to express your appreciation of it by saying aloud all together thank you sara the entire schoolroom rose to its feet as it had done the morning sara remembered so well thank you sara it said and it must be confessed that lottie jumped up and down sara looked rather shy for a moment she made a courtesyand it was a very nice one thank you she said for coming to my party very pretty indeed sara approved miss minchin that is what a real princess does when the populace applauds her laviniascathinglythe sound you just made was extremely like a snort if you are jealous of your fellowpupil i beg you will express your feelings in some more ladylike manner now i will leave you to enjoy yourselves the instant she had swept out of the room the spell her presence always had upon them was broken the door had scarcely closed before every seat was empty the little girls jumped or tumbled out of theirs the older ones wasted no time in deserting theirs there was a rush toward the boxes sara had bent over one of them with a delighted face these are books i know she said the little children broke into a rueful murmur and ermengarde looked aghast does your papa send you books for a birthday present she exclaimed why hes as bad as mine dont open them sara i like them sara laughed but she turned to the biggest box when she took out the last doll it was so magnificent that the children uttered delighted groans of joy and actually drew back to gaze at it in breathless rapture she is almost as big as lottie some one gasped lottie clapped her hands and danced about giggling shes dressed for the theatre said lavinia her cloak is lined with ermine oh cried ermengarde darting forward she has an operaglass in her handa blueandgold one here is her trunk said sara let us open it and look at her things illustration the children crowded clamoring around her she sat down upon the floor and turned the key the children crowded clamoring around her as she lifted tray after tray and revealed their contents never had the schoolroom been in such an uproar there were lace collars and silk stockings and handkerchiefs there was a jewelcase containing a necklace and a tiara which looked quite as if they were made of real diamonds there was a long sealskin and muff there were ball dresses and walking dresses and visiting dresses there were hats and teagowns and fans even lavinia and jessie forgot that they were too elderly to care for dolls and uttered exclamations of delight and caught up things to look at them suppose sara said as she stood by the table putting a large blackvelvet hat on the impassively smiling owner of all these splendorssuppose she understands human talk and feels proud of being admired you are always supposing things said lavinia and her air was very superior i know i am answered sara undisturbedly i like it there is nothing so nice as supposing its almost like being a fairy if you suppose anything hard enough it seems as if it were real its all very well to suppose things if you have everything said lavinia could you suppose and pretend if you were a beggar and lived in a garret sara stopped arranging the last dolls ostrich plumes and looked thoughtful i believe i could she said if one was a beggar one would have to suppose and pretend all the time but it mightnt be easy she often thought afterward how strange it was that just as she had finished saying thisjust at that very momentmiss amelia came into the room sara she said your papas solicitor mr barrow has called to see miss minchin and as she must talk to him alone and the refreshments are laid in her parlor you had all better come and have your feast now so that my sister can have her interview here in the schoolroom refreshments were not likely to be disdained at any hour and many pairs of eyes gleamed miss amelia arranged the procession into decorum and then with sara at her side heading it she led it away leaving the last doll sitting upon a chair with the glories of her wardrobe scattered about her dresses and coats hung upon chair backs piles of lacefrilled petticoats lying upon their seats becky who was not expected to partake of refreshments had the indiscretion to linger a moment to look at these beautiesit really was an indiscretion go back to your work becky miss amelia had said but she had stopped to reverently pick up first a muff and then a coat and while she stood looking at them adoringly she heard miss minchin upon the threshold and being smitten with terror at the thought of being accused of taking liberties she rashly darted under the table which hid her by its tablecloth miss minchin came into the room accompanied by a sharpfeatured dry little gentleman who looked rather disturbed miss minchin herself also looked rather disturbed it must be admitted and she gazed at the dry little gentleman with an irritated and puzzled expression she sat down with stiff dignity and waved him to a chair pray be seated mr barrow she said mr barrow did not sit down at once his attention seemed attracted by the last doll and the things which surrounded her he settled his eyeglasses and looked at them in nervous disapproval the last doll herself did not seem to mind this in the least she merely sat upright and returned his gaze indifferently a hundred pounds mr barrow remarked succinctly all expensive material and made at a parisian modistes he spent money lavishly enough that young man miss minchin felt offended this seemed to be a disparagement of her best patron and was a liberty even solicitors had no right to take liberties i beg your pardon mr barrow she said stiffly i do not understand birthday presents said mr barrow in the same critical manner to a child eleven years old mad extravagance i call it miss minchin drew herself up still more rigidly captain crewe is a man of fortune she said the diamondmines alone mr barrow wheeled round upon her diamondmines he broke out there are none never were miss minchin actually got up from her chair what she cried what do you mean at any rate answered mr barrow quite snappishly it would have been much better if there never had been any any diamondmines ejaculated miss minchin catching at the back of a chair and feeling as if a splendid dream was fading away from her diamondmines spell ruin oftener than they spell wealth said mr barrow when a man is in the hands of a very dear friend and is not a business man himself he had better steer clear of the dear friends diamondmines or goldmines or any other kind of mines dear friends want his money to put into the late captain crewe here miss minchin stopped him with a gasp the late captain crewe she cried out the late you dont come to tell me that captain crewe is hes dead maam mr barrow answered with jerky brusqueness died of jungle fever and business troubles combined the jungle fever might not have killed him if he had not been driven mad by the business troubles and the business troubles might not have put an end to him if the jungle fever had not assisted captain crewe is dead miss minchin dropped into her chair again the words he had spoken filled her with alarm what were his business troubles she said what were they diamondmines answered mr barrow and dear friendsand ruin miss minchin lost her breath ruin she gasped out lost every penny that young man had too much money the dear friend was mad on the subject of the diamondmine he put all his own money into it and all captain crewes then the dear friend ran awaycaptain crewe was already stricken with fever when the news came the shock was too much for him he died delirious raving about his little girland didnt leave a penny now miss minchin understood and never had she received such a blow in her life her show pupil her show patron swept away from the select seminary at one blow she felt as if she had been outraged and robbed and that captain crewe and sara and mr barrow were equally to blame do you mean to tell me she cried out that he left nothing that sara will have no fortune that the child is a beggar that she is left on my hands a little pauper instead of an heiress mr barrow was a shrewd business man and felt it as well to make his own freedom from responsibility quite clear without any delay she is certainly left a beggar he replied and she is certainly left on your hands maamas she hasnt a relation in the world that we know of miss minchin started forward she looked as if she was going to open the door and rush out of the room to stop the festivities going on joyfully and rather noisily that moment over the refreshments it is monstrous she said shes in my sittingroom at this moment dressed in silk gauze and lace petticoats giving a party at my expense shes giving it at your expense madam if shes giving it said mr barrow calmly barrow skipworth are not responsible for anything there never was a cleaner sweep made of a mans fortune captain crewe died without paying our last billand it was a big one miss minchin turned back from the door in increased indignation this was worse than any one could have dreamed of its being that is what has happened to me she cried i was always so sure of his payments that i went to all sorts of ridiculous expenses for the child i paid the bills for that ridiculous doll and her ridiculous fantastic wardrobe the child was to have anything she wanted she has a carriage and a pony and a maid and ive paid for all of them since the last cheque came mr barrow evidently did not intend to remain to listen to the story of miss minchins grievances after he had made the position of his firm clear and related the mere dry facts he did not feel any particular sympathy for irate keepers of boardingschools you had better not pay for anything more maam he remarked unless you want to make presents to the young lady no one will remember you she hasnt a brass farthing to call her own but what am i to do demanded miss minchin as if she felt it entirely his duty to make the matter right what am i to do there isnt anything to do said mr barrow folding up his eyeglasses and slipping them into his pocket captain crewe is dead the child is left a pauper nobody is responsible for her but you i am not responsible for her and i refuse to be made responsible miss minchin became quite white with rage mr barrow turned to go i have nothing to do with that madam he said uninterestedly barrow skipworth are not responsible very sorry the thing has happened of course if you think she is to be foisted off on me you are greatly mistaken miss minchin gasped i have been robbed and cheated i will turn her into the street if she had not been so furious she would have been too discreet to say quite so much she saw herself burdened with an extravagantly broughtup child whom she had always resented and she lost all selfcontrol mr barrow undisturbedly moved toward the door i wouldnt do that madam he commented it wouldnt look well unpleasant story to get about in connection with the establishment pupil bundled out penniless and without friends he was a clever business man and he knew what he was saying he also knew that miss minchin was a business woman and would be shrewd enough to see the truth she could not afford to do a thing which would make people speak of her as cruel and hardhearted better keep her and make use of her he added shes a clever child i believe you can get a good deal out of her as she grows older i will get a good deal out of her before she grows older exclaimed miss minchin i am sure you will maam said mr barrow with a little sinister smile i am sure you will good morning he bowed himself out and closed the door and it must be confessed that miss minchin stood for a few moments and glared at it what he had said was quite true she knew it she had absolutely no redress her show pupil had melted into nothingness leaving only a friendless beggared little girl such money as she herself had advanced was lost and could not be regained and as she stood there breathless under her sense of injury there fell upon her ears a burst of gay voices from her own sacred room which had actually been given up to the feast she could at least stop this but as she started toward the door it was opened by miss amelia who when she caught sight of the changed angry face fell back a step in alarm what is the matter sister she ejaculated miss minchins voice was almost fierce when she answered where is sara crewe miss amelia was bewildered sara she stammered why shes with the children in your room of course has she a black frock in her sumptuous wardrobein bitter irony a black frock miss amelia stammered again a black one she has frocks of every other color has she a black one miss amelia began to turn pale noyees she said but it is too short for her she has only the old black velvet and she has outgrown it go and tell her to take off that preposterous pink silk gauze and put the black one on whether it is too short or not she has done with finery then miss amelia began to wring her fat hands and cry oh sister she sniffed oh sister what can have happened miss minchin wasted no words captain crewe is dead she said he has died without a penny that spoiled pampered fanciful child is left a pauper on my hands miss amelia sat down quite heavily in the nearest chair hundreds of pounds have i spent on nonsense for her and i shall never see a penny of it put a stop to this ridiculous party of hers go and make her change her frock at once i panted miss amelia mmust i go and tell her now this moment was the fierce answer dont sit staring like a goose go poor miss amelia was accustomed to being called a goose she knew in fact that she was rather a goose and that it was left to geese to do a great many disagreeable things it was a somewhat embarrassing thing to go into the midst of a room full of delighted children and tell the giver of the feast that she had suddenly been transformed into a little beggar and must go upstairs and put on an old black frock which was too small for her but the thing must be done this was evidently not the time when questions might be asked she rubbed her eyes with her handkerchief until they looked quite red after which she got up and went out of the room without venturing to say another word when her older sister looked and spoke as she had done just now the wisest course to pursue was to obey orders without any comment miss minchin walked across the room she spoke to herself aloud without knowing that she was doing it during the last year the story of the diamondmines had suggested all sorts of possibilities to her even proprietors of seminaries might make fortunes in stocks with the aid of owners of mines and now instead of looking forward to gains she was left to look back upon losses the princess sara indeed she said the child has been pampered as if she were a queen she was sweeping angrily past the corner table as she said it and the next moment she started at the sound of a loud sobbing sniff which issued from under the cover what is that she exclaimed angrily the loud sobbing sniff was heard again and she stooped and raised the hanging folds of the tablecover how dare you she cried out how dare you come out immediately it was poor becky who crawled out and her cap was knocked on one side and her face was red with repressed crying if you please mits me mum she explained i know i hadnt ought to but i was lookin at the doll muman i was frightened when you come inan slipped under the table you have been there all the time listening said miss minchin no mum becky protested bobbing courtesies not listenini thought i could slip out without your noticin but i couldnt an i had to stay but i didnt listen mumi wouldnt for nothin but i couldnt help hearin suddenly it seemed almost as if she lost all fear of the awful lady before her she burst into fresh tears oh please m she said i dare say youll give me warnin mumbut im so sorry for poor miss saraim so sorry leave the room ordered miss minchin becky courtesied again the tears openly streaming down her cheeks yes m i will m she said trembling but oh i just wanted to arst you miss sarashes been such a rich young lady an shes been waited on and and foot an what will she do now mum without no maid ifif oh please would you let me wait on her after ive done my pots an kettles id do em that quickif youd let me wait on her now shes poor ohbreaking out afreshpoor little miss sara mumthat was called a princess somehow she made miss minchin feel more angry than ever that the very scullerymaid should range herself on the side of this childwhom she realized more fully than ever that she had never likedwas too much she actually stamped her foot nocertainly not she said she will wait on herself and on other people too leave the room this instant or youll leave your place becky threw her apron over her head and fled she ran out of the room and down the steps into the scullery and there she sat down among her pots and kettles and wept as if her heart would break its exactly like the ones in the stories she wailed them pore princess ones that was drove into the world miss minchin had never looked quite so still and hard as she did when sara came to her a few hours later in response to a message she had sent her even by that time it seemed to sara as if the birthday party had either been a dream or a thing which had happened years ago and had happened in the life of quite another little girl every sign of the festivities had been swept away the holly had been removed from the schoolroom walls and the forms and desks put back into their places miss minchins sittingroom looked as it always didall traces of the feast were gone and miss minchin had resumed her usual dress the pupils had been ordered to lay aside their party frocks and this having been done they had returned to the schoolroom and huddled together in groups whispering and talking excitedly tell sara to come to my room miss minchin had said to her sister and explain to her clearly that i will have no crying or unpleasant scenes sister replied miss amelia she is the strangest child i ever saw she has actually made no fuss at all you remember she made none when captain crewe went back to india when i told her what had happened she just stood quite still and looked at me without making a sound her eyes seemed to get bigger and bigger and she went quite pale when i had finished she still stood staring for a few seconds and then her chin began to shake and she turned round and ran out of the room and upstairs several of the other children began to cry but she did not seem to hear them or to be alive to anything but just what i was saying it made me feel quite queer not to be answered and when you tell anything sudden and strange you expect people will say somethingwhatever it is nobody but sara herself ever knew what had happened in her room after she had run upstairs and locked her door in fact she herself scarcely remembered anything but that she walked up and down saying over and over again to herself in a voice which did not seem her own my papa is dead my papa is dead once she stopped before emily who sat watching her from her chair and cried out wildly emily do you hear do you hearpapa is dead he is dead in indiathousands of miles away when she came into miss minchins sittingroom in answer to her summons her face was white and her eyes had dark rings around them her mouth was set as if she did not wish it to reveal what she had suffered and was suffering she did not look in the least like the rosecolored butterfly child who had flown about from one of her treasures to the other in the decorated schoolroom she looked instead a strange desolate almost grotesque little figure she had put on without mariettes help the castaside blackvelvet frock it was too short and tight and her slender legs looked long and thin showing themselves from beneath the brief skirt as she had not found a piece of black ribbon her short thick black hair tumbled loosely about her face and contrasted strongly with its pallor she held emily tightly in one arm and emily was swathed in a piece of black material put down your doll said miss minchin what do you mean by bringing her here no sara answered i will not put her down she is all i have my papa gave her to me she had always made miss minchin feel secretly uncomfortable and she did so now she did not speak with rudeness so much as with a cold steadiness with which miss minchin felt it difficult to copeperhaps because she knew she was doing a heartless and inhuman thing you will have no time for dolls in future she said you will have to work and improve yourself and make yourself useful sara kept her big strange eyes fixed on her and said not a word everything will be very different now miss minchin went on i suppose miss amelia has explained matters to you yes answered sara my papa is dead he left me no money i am quite poor you are a beggar said miss minchin her temper rising at the recollection of what all this meant it appears that you have no relations and no home and no one to take care of you for a moment the thin pale little face twitched but sara again said nothing what are you staring at demanded miss minchin sharply are you so stupid that you cannot understand i tell you that you are quite alone in the world and have no one to do anything for you unless i choose to keep you here out of charity i understand answered sara in a low tone and there was a sound as if she had gulped down something which rose in her throat i understand that doll cried miss minchin pointing to the splendid birthday gift seated nearthat ridiculous doll with all her nonsensical extravagant thingsi actually paid the bill for her sara turned her head toward the chair the last doll she said the last doll and her little mournful voice had an odd sound the last doll indeed said miss minchin and she is mine not yours everything you own is mine please take it away from me then said sara i do not want it if she had cried and sobbed and seemed frightened miss minchin might almost have had more patience with her she was a woman who liked to domineer and feel her power and as she looked at saras pale little steadfast face and heard her proud little voice she quite felt as if her might was being set at naught dont put on grand airs she said the time for that sort of thing is past you are not a princess any longer your carriage and your pony will be sent awayyour maid will be dismissed you will wear your oldest and plainest clothesyour extravagant ones are no longer suited to your station you are like beckyyou must work for your living to her surprise a faint gleam of light came into the childs eyesa shade of relief can i work she said if i can work it will not matter so much what can i do you can do anything you are told was the answer you are a sharp child and pick up things readily if you make yourself useful i may let you stay here you speak french well and you can help with the younger children may i exclaimed sara oh please let me i know i can teach them i like them and they like me dont talk nonsense about people liking you said miss minchin you will have to do more than teach the little ones you will run errands and help in the kitchen as well as in the schoolroom if you dont please me you will be sent away remember that now go sara stood still just a moment looking at her in her young soul she was thinking deep and strange things then she turned to leave the room stop said miss minchin dont you intend to thank me sara paused and all the deep strange thoughts surged up in her breast what for she said for my kindness to you replied miss minchin for my kindness in giving you a home sara made two or three steps toward her her thin little chest heaved up and down and she spoke in a strange unchildishly fierce way you are not kind she said you are not kind and it is not a home and she had turned and run out of the room before miss minchin could stop her or do anything but stare after her with stony anger she went up the stairs slowly but panting for breath and she held emily tightly against her side i wish she could talk she said to herself if she could speakif she could speak she meant to go to her room and lie down on the tigerskin with her cheek upon the great cats head and look into the fire and think and think and think but just before she reached the landing miss amelia came out of the door and closed it behind her and stood before it looking nervous and awkward the truth was that she felt secretly ashamed of the thing she had been ordered to do youyou are not to go in there she said not go in exclaimed sara and she fell back a pace that is not your room now miss amelia answered reddening a little somehow all at once sara understood she realized that this was the beginning of the change miss minchin had spoken of where is my room she asked hoping very much that her voice did not shake you are to sleep in the attic next to becky sara knew where it was becky had told her about it she turned and mounted up two flights of stairs the last one was narrow and covered with shabby strips of old carpet she felt as if she were walking away and leaving far behind her the world in which that other child who no longer seemed herself had lived this child in her short tight old frock climbing the stairs to the attic was quite a different creature when she reached the attic door and opened it her heart gave a dreary little thump then she shut the door and stood against it and looked about her illustration she seldom cried she did not cry now yes this was another world the room had a slanting roof and was whitewashed the whitewash was dingy and had fallen off in places there was a rusty grate an old iron bedstead and a hard bed covered with a faded coverlet some pieces of furniture too much worn to be used downstairs had been sent up under the skylight in the roof which showed nothing but an oblong piece of dull gray sky there stood an old battered red footstool sara went to it and sat down she seldom cried she did not cry now she laid emily across her knees and put her face down upon her and her arms around her and sat there her little black head resting on the black draperies not saying one word not making one sound and as she sat in this silence there came a low tap at the doorsuch a low humble one that she did not at first hear it and indeed was not roused until the door was timidly pushed open and a poor tearsmeared face appeared peeping round it it was beckys face and becky had been crying furtively for hours and rubbing her eyes with her kitchen apron until she looked strange indeed oh miss she said under her breath might iwould you allow mejest to come in sara lifted her head and looked at her she tried to begin a smile and somehow she could not suddenlyand it was all through the loving mournfulness of beckys streaming eyesher face looked more like a childs not so much too old for her years she held out her hand and gave a little sob oh becky she said i told you we were just the sameonly two little girlsjust two little girls you see how true it is theres no difference now im not a princess any more becky ran to her and caught her hand and hugged it to her breast kneeling beside her and sobbing with love and pain yes miss you are she cried and her words were all broken whatsever appens to youwhatseveryoud be a princess all the samean nothin couldnt make you nothin different chapter viii in the attic the first night she spent in her attic was a thing sara never forgot during its passing she lived through a wild unchildlike woe of which she never spoke to any one about her there was no one who would have understood it was indeed well for her that as she lay awake in the darkness her mind was forcibly distracted now and then by the strangeness of her surroundings it was perhaps well for her that she was reminded by her small body of material things if this had not been so the anguish of her young mind might have been too great for a child to bear but really while the night was passing she scarcely knew that she had a body at all or remembered any other thing than one my papa is dead she kept whispering to herself my papa is dead it was not until long afterward that she realized that her bed had been so hard that she turned over and over in it to find a place to rest that the darkness seemed more intense than any she had ever known and that the wind howled over the roof among the chimneys like something which wailed aloud then there was something worse this was certain scufflings and scratchings and squeakings in the walls and behind the skirting boards she knew what they meant because becky had described them they meant rats and mice who were either fighting with each other or playing together once or twice she even heard sharptoed feet scurrying across the floor and she remembered in those after days when she recalled things that when first she heard them she started up in bed and sat trembling and when she lay down again covered her head with the bedclothes the change in her life did not come about gradually but was made all at once she must begin as she is to go on miss minchin said to miss amelia she must be taught at once what she is to expect mariette had left the house the next morning the glimpse sara caught of her sittingroom as she passed its open door showed her that everything had been changed her ornaments and luxuries had been removed and a bed had been placed in a corner to transform it into a new pupils bedroom when she went down to breakfast she saw that her seat at miss minchins side was occupied by lavinia and miss minchin spoke to her coldly you will begin your new duties sara she said by taking your seat with the younger children at a smaller table you must keep them quiet and see that they behave well and do not waste their food you ought to have been down earlier lottie has already upset her tea that was the beginning and from day to day the duties given to her were added to she taught the younger children french and heard their other lessons and these were the least of her labors it was found that she could be made use of in numberless directions she could be sent on errands at any time and in all weathers she could be told to do things other people neglected the cook and the housemaids took their tone from miss minchin and rather enjoyed ordering about the young one who had been made so much fuss over for so long they were not servants of the best class and had neither good manners nor good tempers and it was frequently convenient to have at hand some one on whom blame could be laid during the first month or two sara thought that her willingness to do things as well as she could and her silence under reproof might soften those who drove her so hard in her proud little heart she wanted them to see that she was trying to earn her living and not accepting charity but the time came when she saw that no one was softened at all and the more willing she was to do as she was told the more domineering and exacting careless housemaids became and the more ready a scolding cook was to blame her if she had been older miss minchin would have given her the bigger girls to teach and saved money by dismissing an instructress but while she remained and looked like a child she could be made more useful as a sort of little superior errand girl and maid of all work an ordinary errand boy would not have been so clever and reliable sara could be trusted with difficult commissions and complicated messages she could even go and pay bills and she combined with this the ability to dust a room well and to set things in order her own lessons became things of the past she was taught nothing and only after long and busy days spent in running here and there at everybodys orders was she grudgingly allowed to go into the deserted schoolroom with a pile of old books and study alone at night if i do not remind myself of the things i have learned perhaps i may forget them she said to herself i am almost a scullerymaid and if i am a scullerymaid who knows nothing i shall be like poor becky i wonder if i could quite forget and begin to drop my hs and not remember that henry the eighth had six wives one of the most curious things in her new existence was her changed position among the pupils instead of being a sort of small royal personage among them she no longer seemed to be one of their number at all she was kept so constantly at work that she scarcely ever had an opportunity of speaking to any of them and she could not avoid seeing that miss minchin preferred that she should live a life apart from that of the occupants of the schoolroom i will not have her forming intimacies and talking to the other children that lady said girls like a grievance and if she begins to tell romantic stories about herself she will become an illused heroine and parents will be given a wrong impression it is better that she should live a separate lifeone suited to her circumstances i am giving her a home and that is more than she has any right to expect from me sara did not expect much and was far too proud to try to continue to be intimate with girls who evidently felt rather awkward and uncertain about her the fact was that miss minchins pupils were a set of dull matteroffact young people they were accustomed to being rich and comfortable and as saras frocks grew shorter and shabbier and queererlooking and it became an established fact that she wore shoes with holes in them and was sent out to buy groceries and carry them through the streets in a basket on her arm when the cook wanted them in a hurry they felt rather as if when they spoke to her they were addressing an under servant to think that she was the girl with the diamondmines lavinia commented she does look like an object and shes queerer than ever i never liked her much but i cant bear that way she has now of looking at people without speakingjust as if she was finding them out i am said sara promptly when she heard of this thats what i look at some people for i like to know about them i think about them over afterward the truth was that she had saved herself annoyance several times by keeping her eye on lavinia who was quite ready to make mischief and would have been rather pleased to have made it for the exshow pupil sara never made any mischief herself or interfered with any one she worked like a drudge she tramped through the wet streets carrying parcels and baskets she labored with the childish inattention of the little ones french lessons as she became shabbier and more forlornlooking she was told that she had better take her meals downstairs she was treated as if she was nobodys concern and her heart grew proud and sore but she never told any one what she felt soldiers dont complain she would say between her small shut teeth i am not going to do it i will pretend this is part of a war but there were hours when her child heart might almost have broken with loneliness but for three people the first it must be owned was beckyjust becky throughout all that first night spent in the garret she had felt a vague comfort in knowing that on the other side of the wall in which the rats scuffled and squeaked there was another young human creature and during the nights that followed the sense of comfort grew they had little chance to speak to each other during the day each had her own tasks to perform and any attempt at conversation would have been regarded as a tendency to loiter and lose time dont mind me miss becky whispered during the first morning if i dont say nothin polite some un d be down on us if i did i means please an thank you an beg pardon but i dassnt to take time to say it but before daybreak she used to slip into saras attic and button her dress and give her such help as she required before she went downstairs to light the kitchen fire and when night came sara always heard the humble knock at her door which meant that her handmaid was ready to help her again if she was needed during the first weeks of her grief sara felt as if she were too stupefied to talk so it happened that some time passed before they saw each other much or exchanged visits beckys heart told her that it was best that people in trouble should be left alone the second of the trio of comforters was ermengarde but odd things happened before ermengarde found her place when saras mind seemed to awaken again to the life about her she realized that she had forgotten that an ermengarde lived in the world the two had always been friends but sara had felt as if she were years the older it could not be contested that ermengarde was as dull as she was affectionate she clung to sara in a simple helpless way she brought her lessons to her that she might be helped she listened to her every word and besieged her with requests for stories but she had nothing interesting to say herself and she loathed books of every description she was in fact not a person one would remember when one was caught in the storm of a great trouble and sara forgot her it had been all the easier to forget her because she had been suddenly called home for a few weeks when she came back she did not see sara for a day or two and when she met her for the first time she encountered her coming down a corridor with her arms full of garments which were to be taken downstairs to be mended sara herself had already been taught to mend them she looked pale and unlike herself and she was attired in the queer outgrown frock whose shortness showed so much thin black leg ermengarde was too slow a girl to be equal to such a situation she could not think of anything to say she knew what had happened but somehow she had never imagined sara could look like thisso odd and poor and almost like a servant it made her quite miserable and she could do nothing but break into a short hysterical laugh and exclaimaimlessly and as if without any meaning oh sara is that you yes answered sara and suddenly a strange thought passed through her mind and made her face flush she held the pile of garments in her arms and her chin rested upon the top of it to keep it steady something in the look of her straightgazing eyes made ermengarde lose her wits still more she felt as if sara had changed into a new kind of girl and she had never known her before perhaps it was because she had suddenly grown poor and had to mend things and work like becky oh she stammered howhow are you i dont know sara replied how are you imim quite well said ermengarde overwhelmed with shyness then spasmodically she thought of something to say which seemed more intimate are youare you very unhappy she said in a rush then sara was guilty of an injustice just at that moment her torn heart swelled within her and she felt that if any one was as stupid as that one had better get away from her what do you think she said do you think i am very happy and she marched past her without another word in course of time she realized that if her wretchedness had not made her forget things she would have known that poor dull ermengarde was not to be blamed for her unready awkward ways she was always awkward and the more she felt the more stupid she was given to being but the sudden thought which had flashed upon her had made her oversensitive she is like the others she had thought she does not really want to talk to me she knows no one does so for several weeks a barrier stood between them when they met by chance sara looked the other way and ermengarde felt too stiff and embarrassed to speak sometimes they nodded to each other in passing but there were times when they did not even exchange a greeting if she would rather not talk to me sara thought i will keep out of her way miss minchin makes that easy enough miss minchin made it so easy that at last they scarcely saw each other at all at that time it was noticed that ermengarde was more stupid than ever and that she looked listless and unhappy she used to sit in the windowseat huddled in a heap and stare out of the window without speaking once jessie who was passing stopped to look at her curiously what are you crying for ermengarde she asked im not crying answered ermengarde in a muffled unsteady voice you are said jessie a great big tear just rolled down the bridge of your nose and dropped off at the end of it and there goes another well said ermengarde im miserableand no one need interfere and she turned her plump back and took out her handkerchief and boldly hid her face in it that night when sara went to her attic she was later than usual she had been kept at work until after the hour at which the pupils went to bed and after that she had gone to her lessons in the lonely schoolroom when she reached the top of the stairs she was surprised to see a glimmer of light coming from under the attic door nobody goes there but myself she thought quickly but some one has lighted a candle some one had indeed lighted a candle and it was not burning in the kitchen candlestick she was expected to use but in one of those belonging to the pupils bedrooms the some one was sitting upon the battered footstool and was dressed in her nightgown and wrapped up in a red shawl it was ermengarde ermengarde cried sara she was so startled that she was almost frightened you will get into trouble ermengarde stumbled up from her footstool she shuffled across the attic in her bedroom slippers which were too large for her her eyes and nose were pink with crying i know i shallif im found out she said but i dont carei dont care a bit oh sara please tell me what is the matter why dont you like me any more something in her voice made the familiar lump rise in saras throat it was so affectionate and simpleso like the old ermengarde who had asked her to be best friends it sounded as if she had not meant what she had seemed to mean during these past weeks i do like you sara answered i thoughtyou see everything is different now i thought youwere different ermengarde opened her wet eyes wide why it was you who were different she cried you didnt want to talk to me i didnt know what to do it was you who were different after i came back sara thought a moment she saw she had made a mistake i am different she explained though not in the way you think miss minchin does not want me to talk to the girls most of them dont want to talk to me i thoughtperhapsyou didnt so i tried to keep out of your way oh sara ermengarde almost wailed in her reproachful dismay and then after one more look they rushed into each others arms it must be confessed that saras small black head lay for some minutes on the shoulder covered by the red shawl when ermengarde had seemed to desert her she had felt horribly lonely afterward they sat down upon the floor together sara clasping her knees with her arms and ermengarde rolled up in her shawl ermengarde looked at the odd bigeyed little face adoringly i couldnt bear it any more she said i dare say you could live without me sara but i couldnt live without you i was nearly dead so tonight when i was crying under the bedclothes i thought all at once of creeping up here and just begging you to let us be friends again you are nicer than i am said sara i was too proud to try and make friends you see now that trials have come they have shown that i am not a nice child i was afraid they would perhapswrinkling her forehead wiselythat is what they were sent for i dont see any good in them said ermengarde stoutly neither do ito speak the truth admitted sara frankly but i suppose there might be good in things even if we dont see it there mightdoubtfullybe good in miss minchin ermengarde looked round the attic with a rather fearsome curiosity sara she said do you think you can bear living here sara looked round also if i pretend its quite different i can she answered or if i pretend it is a place in a story she spoke slowly her imagination was beginning to work for her it had not worked for her at all since her troubles had come upon her she had felt as if it had been stunned other people have lived in worse places think of the count of monte cristo in the dungeons of the chateau dif and think of the people in the bastille the bastille half whispered ermengarde watching her and beginning to be fascinated she remembered stories of the french revolution which sara had been able to fix in her mind by her dramatic relation of them no one but sara could have done it a wellknown glow came into saras eyes yes she said hugging her knees that will be a good place to pretend about i am a prisoner in the bastille i have been here for years and yearsand years and everybody has forgotten about me miss minchin is the jailerand beckya sudden light adding itself to the glow in her eyesbecky is the prisoner in the next cell she turned to ermengarde looking quite like the old sara i shall pretend that she said and it will be a great comfort ermengarde was at once enraptured and awed and will you tell me all about it she said may i creep up here at night whenever it is safe and hear the things you have made up in the day it will seem as if we were more best friends than ever yes answered sara nodding adversity tries people and mine has tried you and proved how nice you are chapter ix melchisedec the third person in the trio was lottie she was a small thing and did not know what adversity meant and was much bewildered by the alteration she saw in her young adopted mother she had heard it rumored that strange things had happened to sara but she could not understand why she looked differentwhy she wore an old black frock and came into the schoolroom only to teach instead of to sit in her place of honor and learn lessons herself there had been much whispering among the little ones when it had been discovered that sara no longer lived in the rooms in which emily had so long sat in state lotties chief difficulty was that sara said so little when one asked her questions at seven mysteries must be made very clear if one is to understand them are you very poor now sara she had asked confidentially the first morning her friend took charge of the small french class are you as poor as a beggar she thrust a fat hand into the slim one and opened round tearful eyes i dont want you to be as poor as a beggar she looked as if she was going to cry and sara hurriedly consoled her beggars have nowhere to live she said courageously i have a place to live in where do you live persisted lottie the new girl sleeps in your room and it isnt pretty any more i live in another room said sara is it a nice one inquired lottie i want to go and see it you must not talk said sara miss minchin is looking at us she will be angry with me for letting you whisper she had found out already that she was to be held accountable for everything which was objected to if the children were not attentive if they talked if they were restless it was she who would be reproved but lottie was a determined little person if sara would not tell her where she lived she would find out in some other way she talked to her small companions and hung about the elder girls and listened when they were gossiping and acting upon certain information they had unconsciously let drop she started late one afternoon on a voyage of discovery climbing stairs she had never known the existence of until she reached the attic floor there she found two doors near each other and opening one she saw her beloved sara standing upon an old table and looking out of a window sara she cried aghast mamma sara she was aghast because the attic was so bare and ugly and seemed so far away from all the world her short legs had seemed to have been mounting hundreds of stairs sara turned round at the sound of her voice it was her turn to be aghast what would happen now if lottie began to cry and any one chanced to hear they were both lost she jumped down from her table and ran to the child dont cry and make a noise she implored i shall be scolded if you do and i have been scolded all day itsits not such a bad room lottie isnt it gasped lottie and as she looked round it she bit her lip she was a spoiled child yet but she was fond enough of her adopted parent to make an effort to control herself for her sake then somehow it was quite possible that any place in which sara lived might turn out to be nice why isnt it sara she almost whispered sara hugged her close and tried to laugh there was a sort of comfort in the warmth of the plump childish body she had had a hard day and had been staring out of the windows with hot eyes you can see all sorts of things you cant see downstairs she said what sort of things demanded lottie with that curiosity sara could always awaken even in bigger girls chimneysquite close to uswith smoke curling up in wreaths and clouds and going up into the skyand sparrows hopping about and talking to each other just as if they were peopleand other attic windows where heads may pop out any minute and you can wonder who they belong to and it all feels as high upas if it was another world oh let me see it cried lottie lift me up sara lifted her up and they stood on the old table together and leaned on the edge of the flat window in the roof and looked out illustration the sparrows twittered and hopped about quite without fear any one who has not done this does not know what a different world they saw the slates spread out on either side of them and slanted down into the rain gutterpipes the sparrows being at home there twittered and hopped about quite without fear two of them perched on the chimneytop nearest and quarrelled with each other fiercely until one pecked the other and drove him away the garret window next to theirs was shut because the house next door was empty i wish some one lived there sara said it is so close that if there was a little girl in the attic we could talk to each other through the windows and climb over to see each other if we were not afraid of falling the sky seemed so much nearer than when one saw it from the street that lottie was enchanted from the attic window among the chimneypots the things which were happening in the world below seemed almost unreal one scarcely believed in the existence of miss minchin and miss amelia and the schoolroom and the roll of wheels in the square seemed a sound belonging to another existence oh sara cried lottie cuddling in her guarding arm i like this attici like it it is nicer than downstairs look at that sparrow whispered sara i wish i had some crumbs to throw to him i have some came in a little shriek from lottie i have part of a bun in my pocket i bought it with my penny yesterday and i saved a bit when they threw out a few crumbs the sparrow jumped and flew away to an adjacent chimneytop he was evidently not accustomed to intimates in attics and unexpected crumbs startled him but when lottie remained quite still and sara chirped very softlyalmost as if she were a sparrow herselfhe saw that the thing which had alarmed him represented hospitality after all he put his head on one side and from his perch on the chimney looked down at the crumbs with twinkling eyes lottie could scarcely keep still will he come will he come she whispered his eyes look as if he would sara whispered back he is thinking and thinking whether he dare yes he will yes he is coming he flew down and hopped toward the crumbs but stopped a few inches away from them putting his head on one side again as if reflecting on the chances that sara and lottie might turn out to be big cats and jump on him at last his heart told him they were really nicer than they looked and he hopped nearer and nearer darted at the biggest crumb with a lightning peck seized it and carried it away to the other side of his chimney now he knows said sara and he will come back for the others he did come back and even brought a friend and the friend went away and brought a relative and among them they made a hearty meal over which they twittered and chattered and exclaimed stopping every now and then to put their heads on one side and examine lottie and sara lottie was so delighted that she quite forgot her first shocked impression of the attic in fact when she was lifted down from the table and returned to earthly things as it were sara was able to point out to her many beauties in the room which she herself would not have suspected the existence of it is so little and so high above everything she said that it is almost like a nest in a tree the slanting ceiling is so funny see you can scarcely stand up at this end of the room and when the morning begins to come i can lie in bed and look right up into the sky through that flat window in the roof it is like a square patch of light if the sun is going to shine little pink clouds float about and i feel as if i could touch them and if it rains the drops patter and patter as if they were saying something nice then if there are stars you can lie and try to count how many go into the patch it takes such a lot and just look at that tiny rusty grate in the corner if it was polished and there was a fire in it just think how nice it would be you see its really a beautiful little room she was walking round the small place holding lotties hand and making gestures which described all the beauties she was making herself see she quite made lottie see them too lottie could always believe in the things sara made pictures of you see she said there could be a thick soft blue indian rug on the floor and in that corner there could be a soft little sofa with cushions to curl up on and just over it could be a shelf full of books so that one could reach them easily and there could be a fur rug before the fire and hangings on the wall to cover up the whitewash and pictures they would have to be little ones but they could be beautiful and there could be a lamp with a deep rosecolored shade and a table in the middle with things to have tea with and a little fat copper kettle singing on the hob and the bed could be quite different it could be made soft and covered with a lovely silk coverlet it could be beautiful and perhaps we could coax the sparrows until we made such friends with them that they would come and peck at the window and ask to be let in oh sara cried lottie i should like to live here when sara had persuaded her to go downstairs again and after setting her in her way had come back to her attic she stood in the middle of it and looked about her the enchantment of her imaginings for lottie had died away the bed was hard and covered with its dingy quilt the whitewashed wall showed its broken patches the floor was cold and bare the grate was broken and rusty and the battered footstool tilted sideways on its injured leg the only seat in the room she sat down on it for a few minutes and let her head drop in her hands the mere fact that lottie had come and gone away again made things seem a little worsejust as perhaps prisoners feel a little more desolate after visitors come and go leaving them behind its a lonely place she said sometimes its the loneliest place in the world she was sitting in this way when her attention was attracted by a slight sound near her she lifted her head to see where it came from and if she had been a nervous child she would have left her seat on the battered footstool in a great hurry a large rat was sitting up on his hind quarters and sniffing the air in an interested manner some of lotties crumbs had dropped upon the floor and their scent had drawn him out of his hole he looked so queer and so like a graywhiskered dwarf or gnome that sara was rather fascinated he looked at her with his bright eyes as if he were asking a question he was evidently so doubtful that one of the childs queer thoughts came into her mind i dare say it is rather hard to be a rat she mused nobody likes you people jump and run away and scream out oh a horrid rat i shouldnt like people to scream and jump and say oh a horrid sara the moment they saw me and set traps for me and pretend they were dinner its so different to be a sparrow but nobody asked this rat if he wanted to be a rat when he was made nobody said wouldnt you rather be a sparrow she had sat so quietly that the rat had begun to take courage he was very much afraid of her but perhaps he had a heart like the sparrow and it told him that she was not a thing which pounced he was very hungry he had a wife and a large family in the wall and they had had frightfully bad luck for several days he had left the children crying bitterly and felt he would risk a good deal for a few crumbs so he cautiously dropped upon his feet come on said sara im not a trap you can have them poor thing prisoners in the bastille used to make friends with rats suppose i make friends with you how it is that animals understand things i do not know but it is certain that they do understand perhaps there is a language which is not made of words and everything in the world understands it perhaps there is a soul hidden in everything and it can always speak without even making a sound to another soul but whatsoever was the reason the rat knew from that moment that he was safeeven though he was a rat he knew that this young human being sitting on the red footstool would not jump up and terrify him with wild sharp noises or throw heavy objects at him which if they did not fall and crush him would send him limping in his scurry back to his hole he was really a very nice rat and did not mean the least harm when he had stood on his hind legs and sniffed the air with his bright eyes fixed on sara he had hoped that she would understand this and would not begin by hating him as an enemy when the mysterious thing which speaks without saying any words told him that she would not he went softly toward the crumbs and began to eat them as he did it he glanced every now and then at sara just as the sparrows had done and his expression was so very apologetic that it touched her heart she sat and watched him without making any movement one crumb was very much larger than the othersin fact it could scarcely be called a crumb it was evident that he wanted that piece very much but it lay quite near the footstool and he was still rather timid i believe he wants it to carry to his family in the wall sara thought if i do not stir at all perhaps he will come and get it she scarcely allowed herself to breathe she was so deeply interested the rat shuffled a little nearer and ate a few more crumbs then he stopped and sniffed delicately giving a side glance at the occupant of the footstool then he darted at the piece of bun with something very like the sudden boldness of the sparrow and the instant he had possession of it fled back to the wall slipped down a crack in the skirting board and was gone i knew he wanted it for his children said sara i do believe i could make friends with him a week or so afterward on one of the rare nights when ermengarde found it safe to steal up to the attic when she tapped on the door with the tips of her fingers sara did not come to her for two or three minutes there was indeed such a silence in the room at first that ermengarde wondered if she could have fallen asleep then to her surprise she heard her utter a little low laugh and speak coaxingly to some one there ermengarde heard her say take it and go home melchisedec go home to your wife almost immediately sara opened the door and when she did so she found ermengarde standing with alarmed eyes upon the threshold whowho are you talking to sara she gasped out sara drew her in cautiously but she looked as if something pleased and amused her you must promise not to be frightenednot to scream the least bit or i cant tell you she answered ermengarde felt almost inclined to scream on the spot but managed to control herself she looked all round the attic and saw no one and yet sara had certainly been speaking to some one she thought of ghosts is itsomething that will frighten me she asked timorously some people are afraid of them said sara i was at firstbut i am not now was ita ghost quaked ermengarde no said sara laughing it was my rat ermengarde made one bound and landed in the middle of the little dingy bed she tucked her feet under her nightgown and the red shawl she did not scream but she gasped with fright oh oh she cried under her breath a rat a rat i was afraid you would be frightened said sara but you neednt be i am making him tame he actually knows me and comes out when i call him are you too frightened to want to see him the truth was that as the days had gone on and with the aid of scraps brought up from the kitchen her curious friendship had developed she had gradually forgotten that the timid creature she was becoming familiar with was a mere rat at first ermengarde was too much alarmed to do anything but huddle in a heap upon the bed and tuck up her feet but the sight of saras composed little countenance and the story of melchisedecs first appearance began at last to rouse her curiosity and she leaned forward over the edge of the bed and watched sara go and kneel down by the hole in the skirting board hehe wont run out quickly and jump on the bed will he she said no answered sara hes as polite as we are he is just like a person now watch she began to make a low whistling soundso low and coaxing that it could only have been heard in entire stillness she did it several times looking entirely absorbed in it ermengarde thought she looked as if she were working a spell and at last evidently in response to it a graywhiskered brighteyed head peeped out of the hole sara had some crumbs in her hand she dropped them and melchisedec came quietly forth and ate them a piece of larger size than the rest he took and carried in the most businesslike manner back to his home you see said sara that is for his wife and children he is very nice he only eats the little bits after he goes back i can always hear his family squeaking for joy there are three kinds of squeaks one kind is the childrens and one is mrs melchisedecs and one is melchisedecs own ermengarde began to laugh oh sara she said you are queerbut you are nice i know i am queer admitted sara cheerfully and i try to be nice she rubbed her forehead with her little brown paw and a puzzled tender look came into her face papa always laughed at me she said but i liked it he thought i was queer but he liked me to make up things ii cant help making up things if i didnt i dont believe i could live she paused and glanced round the attic im sure i couldnt live here she added in a low voice ermengarde was interested as she always was when you talk about things she said they seem as if they grew real you talk about melchisedec as if he was a person he is a person said sara he gets hungry and frightened just as we do and he is married and has children how do we know he doesnt think things just as we do his eyes look as if he was a person that was why i gave him a name she sat down on the floor in her favorite attitude holding her knees besides she said he is a bastille rat sent to be my friend i can always get a bit of bread the cook has thrown away and it is quite enough to support him is it the bastille yet asked ermengarde eagerly do you always pretend it is the bastille nearly always answered sara sometimes i try to pretend it is another kind of place but the bastille is generally easiestparticularly when it is cold just at that moment ermengarde almost jumped off the bed she was so startled by a sound she heard it was like two distinct knocks on the wall what is that she exclaimed sara got up from the floor and answered quite dramatically it is the prisoner in the next cell becky cried ermengarde enraptured yes said sara listen the two knocks meant prisoner are you there she knocked three times on the wall herself as if in answer that means yes i am here and all is well four knocks came from beckys side of the wall that means explained sara then fellowsufferer we will sleep in peace goodnight ermengarde quite beamed with delight oh sara she whispered joyfully it is like a story it is a story said sara everythings a story you are a storyi am a story miss minchin is a story and she sat down again and talked until ermengarde forgot that she was a sort of escaped prisoner herself and had to be reminded by sara that she could not remain in the bastille all night but must steal noiselessly downstairs again and creep back into her deserted bed chapter x the indian gentleman but it was a perilous thing for ermengarde and lottie to make pilgrimages to the attic they could never be quite sure when sara would be there and they could scarcely ever be certain that miss amelia would not make a tour of inspection through the bedrooms after the pupils were supposed to be asleep so their visits were rare ones and sara lived a strange and lonely life it was a lonelier life when she was downstairs than when she was in her attic she had no one to talk to and when she was sent out on errands and walked through the streets a forlorn little figure carrying a basket or a parcel trying to hold her hat on when the wind was blowing and feeling the water soak through her shoes when it was raining she felt as if the crowds hurrying past her made her loneliness greater when she had been the princess sara driving through the streets in her brougham or walking attended by mariette the sight of her bright eager little face and picturesque coats and hats had often caused people to look after her a happy beautifully cared for little girl naturally attracts attention shabby poorly dressed children are not rare enough and pretty enough to make people turn around to look at them and smile no one looked at sara in these days and no one seemed to see her as she hurried along the crowded pavements she had begun to grow very fast and as she was dressed only in such clothes as the plainer remnants of her wardrobe would supply she knew she looked very queer indeed all her valuable garments had been disposed of and such as had been left for her use she was expected to wear so long as she could put them on at all sometimes when she passed a shop window with a mirror in it she almost laughed outright on catching a glimpse of herself and sometimes her face went red and she bit her lip and turned away in the evening when she passed houses whose windows were lighted up she used to look into the warm rooms and amuse herself by imagining things about the people she saw sitting before the fires or about the tables it always interested her to catch glimpses of rooms before the shutters were closed there were several families in the square in which miss minchin lived with which she had become quite familiar in a way of her own the one she liked best she called the large family she called it the large family not because the members of it were bigfor indeed most of them were littlebut because there were so many of them there were eight children in the large family and a stout rosy mother and a stout rosy father and a stout rosy grandmother and any number of servants the eight children were always either being taken out to walk or to ride in perambulators by comfortable nurses or they were going to drive with their mamma or they were flying to the door in the evening to meet their papa and kiss him and dance around him and drag off his overcoat and look in the pockets for packages or they were crowding about the nursery windows and looking out and pushing each other and laughingin fact they were always doing something enjoyable and suited to the tastes of a large family sara was quite fond of them and had given them names out of booksquite romantic names she called them the montmorencys when she did not call them the large family the fat fair baby with the lace cap was ethelberta beauchamp montmorency the next baby was violet cholmondeley montmorency the little boy who could just stagger and who had such round legs was sydney cecil vivian montmorency and then came lilian evangeline maud marion rosalind gladys guy clarence veronica eustacia and claude harold hector one evening a very funny thing happenedthough perhaps in one sense it was not a funny thing at all several of the montmorencys were evidently going to a childrens party and just as sara was about to pass the door they were crossing the pavement to get into the carriage which was waiting for them veronica eustacia and rosalind gladys in whitelace frocks and lovely sashes had just got in and guy clarence aged five was following them he was such a pretty fellow and had such rosy cheeks and blue eyes and such a darling little round head covered with curls that sara forgot her basket and shabby cloak altogetherin fact forgot everything but that she wanted to look at him for a moment so she paused and looked it was christmas time and the large family had been hearing many stories about children who were poor and had no mammas and papas to fill their stockings and take them to the pantomimechildren who were in fact cold and thinly clad and hungry in the stories kind peoplesometimes little boys and girls with tender heartsinvariably saw the poor children and gave them money or rich gifts or took them home to beautiful dinners guy clarence had been affected to tears that very afternoon by the reading of such a story and he had burned with a desire to find such a poor child and give her a certain sixpence he possessed and thus provide for her for life an entire sixpence he was sure would mean affluence for evermore as he crossed the strip of red carpet laid across the pavement from the door to the carriage he had this very sixpence in the pocket of his very short manowar trousers and just as rosalind gladys got into the vehicle and jumped on to the seat in order to feel the cushions spring under her he saw sara standing on the wet pavement in her shabby frock and hat with her old basket on her arm looking at him hungrily he thought that her eyes looked hungry because she had perhaps had nothing to eat for a long time he did not know that they looked so because she was hungry for the warm merry life his home held and his rosy face spoke of and that she had a hungry wish to snatch him in her arms and kiss him he only knew that she had big eyes and a thin face and thin legs and a common basket and poor clothes so he put his hand in his pocket and found his sixpence and walked up to her benignly here poor little girl he said here is a sixpence i will give it to you sara started and all at once realized that she looked exactly like poor children she had seen in her better days waiting on the pavement to watch her as she got out of her brougham and she had given them pennies many a time her face went red and then it went pale and for a second she felt as if she could not take the dear little sixpence oh no she said oh no thank you i mustnt take it indeed her voice was so unlike an ordinary street childs voice and her manner was so like the manner of a wellbred little person that veronica eustacia whose real name was janet and rosalind gladys who was really called nora leaned forward to listen but guy clarence was not to be thwarted in his benevolence he thrust the sixpence into her hand yes you must take it poor little girl he insisted stoutly you can buy things to eat with it it is a whole sixpence there was something so honest and kind in his face and he looked so likely to be heartbrokenly disappointed if she did not take it that sara knew she must not refuse him to be as proud as that would be a cruel thing so she actually put her pride in her pocket though it must be admitted her cheeks burned thank you she said you are a kind kind little darling thing and as he scrambled joyfully into the carriage she went away trying to smile though she caught her breath quickly and her eyes were shining through a mist she had known that she looked odd and shabby but until now she had not known that she might be taken for a beggar as the large familys carriage drove away the children inside it were talking with interested excitement oh donald this was guy clarences name janet exclaimed alarmedly why did you offer that little girl your sixpence im sure she is not a beggar she didnt speak like a beggar cried nora and her face didnt really look like a beggars face besides she didnt beg said janet i was so afraid she might be angry with you you know it makes people angry to be taken for beggars when they are not beggars she wasnt angry said donald a trifle dismayed but still firm she laughed a little and she said i was a kind kind little darling thing and i wasstoutly it was my whole sixpence janet and nora exchanged glances a beggar girl would never have said that decided janet she would have said thank yer kindly little gentlemanthank yer sir and perhaps she would have bobbed a courtesy sara knew nothing about the fact but from that time the large family was as profoundly interested in her as she was in it faces used to appear at the nursery windows when she passed and many discussions concerning her were held round the fire she is a kind of servant at the seminary janet said i dont believe she belongs to anybody i believe she is an orphan but she is not a beggar however shabby she looks and afterward she was called by all of them thelittlegirlwhoisnotabeggar which was of course rather a long name and sounded very funny sometimes when the youngest ones said it in a hurry sara managed to bore a hole in the sixpence and hung it on an old bit of narrow ribbon round her neck her affection for the large family increasedas indeed her affection for everything she could love increased she grew fonder and fonder of becky and she used to look forward to the two mornings a week when she went into the schoolroom to give the little ones their french lesson her small pupils loved her and strove with each other for the privilege of standing close to her and insinuating their small hands into hers it fed her hungry heart to feel them nestling up to her she made such friends with the sparrows that when she stood upon the table put her head and shoulders out of the attic window and chirped she heard almost immediately a flutter of wings and answering twitters and a little flock of dingy town birds appeared and alighted on the slates to talk to her and make much of the crumbs she scattered with melchisedec she had become so intimate that he actually brought mrs melchisedec with him sometimes and now and then one or two of his children she used to talk to him and somehow he looked quite as if he understood there had grown in her mind rather a strange feeling about emily who always sat and looked on at everything it arose in one of her moments of great desolateness she would have liked to believe or pretend to believe that emily understood and sympathized with her she did not like to own to herself that her only companion could feel and hear nothing she used to put her in a chair sometimes and sit opposite to her on the old red footstool and stare and pretend about her until her own eyes would grow large with something which was almost like fearparticularly at night when everything was so still when the only sound in the attic was the occasional sudden scurry and squeak of melchisedecs family in the wall one of her pretends was that emily was a kind of good witch who could protect her sometimes after she had stared at her until she was wrought up to the highest pitch of fancifulness she would ask her questions and find herself almost feeling as if she would presently answer but she never did as to answering though said sara trying to console herself i dont answer very often i never answer when i can help it when people are insulting you there is nothing so good for them as not to say a wordjust to look at them and think miss minchin turns pale with rage when i do it miss amelia looks frightened and so do the girls when you will not fly into a passion people know you are stronger than they are because you are strong enough to hold in your rage and they are not and they say stupid things they wish they hadnt said afterward theres nothing so strong as rage except what makes you hold it inthats stronger its a good thing not to answer your enemies i scarcely ever do perhaps emily is more like me than i am like myself perhaps she would rather not answer her friends even she keeps it all in her heart but though she tried to satisfy herself with these arguments she did not find it easy when after a long hard day in which she had been sent here and there sometimes on long errands through wind and cold and rain she came in wet and hungry and was sent out again because nobody chose to remember that she was only a child and that her slim legs might be tired and her small body might be chilled when she had been given only harsh words and cold slighting looks for thanks when the cook had been vulgar and insolent when miss minchin had been in her worst mood and when she had seen the girls sneering among themselves at her shabbinessthen she was not always able to comfort her sore proud desolate heart with fancies when emily merely sat upright in her old chair and stared one of these nights when she came up to the attic cold and hungry with a tempest raging in her young breast emilys stare seemed so vacant her sawdust legs and arms so inexpressive that sara lost all control over herself there was nobody but emilyno one in the world and there she sat i shall die presently she said at first emily simply stared i cant bear this said the poor child trembling i know i shall die im cold im wet im starving to death ive walked a thousand miles today and they have done nothing but scold me from morning until night and because i could not find that last thing the cook sent me for they would not give me any supper some men laughed at me because my old shoes made me slip down in the mud im covered with mud now and they laughed do you hear she looked at the staring glass eyes and complacent face and suddenly a sort of heartbroken rage seized her she lifted her little savage hand and knocked emily off the chair bursting into a passion of sobbingsara who never cried you are nothing but a doll she cried nothing but a dolldolldoll you care for nothing you are stuffed with sawdust you never had a heart nothing could ever make you feel you are a doll emily lay on the floor with her legs ignominiously doubled up over her head and a new flat place on the end of her nose but she was calm even dignified sara hid her face in her arms the rats in the wall began to fight and bite each other and squeak and scramble melchisedec was chastising some of his family saras sobs gradually quieted themselves it was so unlike her to break down that she was surprised at herself after a while she raised her face and looked at emily who seemed to be gazing at her round the side of one angle and somehow by this time actually with a kind of glassyeyed sympathy sara bent and picked her up remorse overtook her she even smiled at herself a very little smile you cant help being a doll she said with a resigned sigh any more than lavinia and jessie can help not having any sense we are not all made alike perhaps you do your sawdust best and she kissed her and shook her clothes straight and put her back upon her chair she had wished very much that some one would take the empty house next door she wished it because of the attic window which was so near hers it seemed as if it would be so nice to see it propped open some day and a head and shoulders rising out of the square aperture if it looked a nice head she thought i might begin by saying good morning and all sorts of things might happen but of course its not really likely that any one but under servants would sleep there one morning on turning the corner of the square after a visit to the grocers the butchers and the bakers she saw to her great delight that during her rather prolonged absence a van full of furniture had stopped before the next house the front doors were thrown open and men in shirt sleeves were going in and out carrying heavy packages and pieces of furniture its taken she said it really is taken oh i do hope a nice head will look out of the attic window she would almost have liked to join the group of loiterers who had stopped on the pavement to watch the things carried in she had an idea that if she could see some of the furniture she could guess something about the people it belonged to miss minchins tables and chairs are just like her she thought i remember thinking that the first minute i saw her even though i was so little i told papa afterward and he laughed and said it was true i am sure the large family have fat comfortable armchairs and sofas and i can see that their redflowery wallpaper is exactly like them its warm and cheerful and kindlooking and happy she was sent out for parsley to the greengrocers later in the day and when she came up the area steps her heart gave quite a quick beat of recognition several pieces of furniture had been set out of the van upon the pavement there was a beautiful table of elaborately wrought teakwood and some chairs and a screen covered with rich oriental embroidery the sight of them gave her a weird homesick feeling she had seen things so like them in india one of the things miss minchin had taken from her was a carved teakwood desk her father had sent her they are beautiful things she said they look as if they ought to belong to a nice person all the things look rather grand i suppose it is a rich family the vans of furniture came and were unloaded and gave place to others all the day several times it so happened that sara had an opportunity of seeing things carried in it became plain that she had been right in guessing that the newcomers were people of large means all the furniture was rich and beautiful and a great deal of it was oriental wonderful rugs and draperies and ornaments were taken from the vans many pictures and books enough for a library among other things there was a superb god buddha in a splendid shrine some one in the family must have been in india sara thought they have got used to indian things and like them i am glad i shall feel as if they were friends even if a head never looks out of the attic window when she was taking in the evenings milk for the cook there was really no odd job she was not called upon to do she saw something occur which made the situation more interesting than ever the handsome rosy man who was the father of the large family walked across the square in the most matteroffact manner and ran up the steps of the nextdoor house he ran up them as if he felt quite at home and expected to run up and down them many a time in the future he stayed inside quite a long time and several times came out and gave directions to the workmen as if he had a right to do so it was quite certain that he was in some intimate way connected with the newcomers and was acting for them if the new people have children sara speculated the large family children will be sure to come and play with them and they might come up into the attic just for fun at night after her work was done becky came in to see her fellowprisoner and bring her news its a nindian gentleman thats comin to live next door miss she said i dont know whether hes a black gentleman or not but hes a nindian one hes very rich an hes ill an the gentleman of the large family is his lawyer hes had a lot of trouble an its made him ill an low in his mind he worships idols miss hes an eathen an bows down to wood an stone i seen a idol bein carried in for him to worship somebody had oughter send him a trac you can get a trac for a penny sara laughed a little i dont believe he worships that idol she said some people like to keep them to look at because they are interesting my papa had a beautiful one and he did not worship it but becky was rather inclined to prefer to believe that the new neighbor was an eathen it sounded so much more romantic than that he should merely be the ordinary kind of gentleman who went to church with a prayerbook she sat and talked long that night of what he would be like of what his wife would be like if he had one and of what his children would be like if they had children sara saw that privately she could not help hoping very much that they would all be black and would wear turbans and above all thatlike their parentthey would all be eathens i never lived next door to no eathens miss she said i should like to see what sort o ways theyd have it was several weeks before her curiosity was satisfied and then it was revealed that the new occupant had neither wife nor children he was a solitary man with no family at all and it was evident that he was shattered in health and unhappy in mind a carriage drove up one day and stopped before the house when the footman dismounted from the box and opened the door the gentleman who was the father of the large family got out first after him there descended a nurse in uniform then came down the steps two menservants they came to assist their master who when he was helped out of the carriage proved to be a man with a haggard distressed face and a skeleton body wrapped in furs he was carried up the steps and the head of the large family went with him looking very anxious shortly afterward a doctors carriage arrived and the doctor went inplainly to take care of him there is such a yellow gentleman next door sara lottie whispered at the french class afterward do you think he is a chinee the geography says the chinee men are yellow no he is not chinese sara whispered back he is very ill go on with your exercise lottie non monsieur je nai pas le canif de mon oncle that was the beginning of the story of the indian gentleman chapter xi ram dass there were fine sunsets even in the square sometimes one could only see parts of them however between the chimneys and over the roofs from the kitchen windows one could not see them at all and could only guess that they were going on because the bricks looked warm and the air rosy or yellow for a while or perhaps one saw a blazing glow strike a particular pane of glass somewhere there was however one place from which one could see all the splendor of them the piles of red or gold clouds in the west or the purple ones edged with dazzling brightness or the little fleecy floating ones tinged with rosecolor and looking like flights of pink doves scurrying across the blue in a great hurry if there was a wind the place where one could see all this and seem at the same time to breathe a purer air was of course the attic window when the square suddenly seemed to begin to glow in an enchanted way and look wonderful in spite of its sooty trees and railings sara knew something was going on in the sky and when it was at all possible to leave the kitchen without being missed or called back she invariably stole away and crept up the flights of stairs and climbing on the old table got her head and body as far out of the window as possible when she had accomplished this she always drew a long breath and looked all round her it used to seem as if she had all the sky and the world to herself no one else ever looked out of the other attics generally the skylights were closed but even if they were propped open to admit air no one seemed to come near them and there sara would stand sometimes turning her face upward to the blue which seemed so friendly and nearjust like a lovely vaulted ceilingsometimes watching the west and all the wonderful things that happened there the clouds melting or drifting or waiting softly to be changed pink or crimson or snowwhite or purple or pale dovegray sometimes they made islands or great mountains enclosing lakes of deep turquoiseblue or liquid amber or chrysoprasegreen sometimes dark headlands jutted into strange lost seas sometimes slender strips of wonderful lands joined other wonderful lands together there were places where it seemed that one could run or climb or stand and wait to see what next was cominguntil perhaps as it all melted one could float away at least it seemed so to sara and nothing had ever been quite so beautiful to her as the things she saw as she stood on the tableher body half out of the skylightthe sparrows twittering with sunset softness on the slates the sparrows always seemed to her to twitter with a sort of subdued softness just when these marvels were going on there was such a sunset as this a few days after the indian gentleman was brought to his new home and as it fortunately happened that the afternoons work was done in the kitchen and nobody had ordered her to go anywhere or perform any task sara found it easier than usual to slip away and go upstairs she mounted her table and stood looking out it was a wonderful moment there were floods of molten gold covering the west as if a glorious tide was sweeping over the world a deep rich yellow light filled the air the birds flying across the tops of the houses showed quite black against it its a splendid one said sara softly to herself it makes me feel almost afraidas if something strange was just going to happen the splendid ones always make me feel like that she suddenly turned her head because she heard a sound a few yards away from her it was an odd sound like a queer little squeaky chattering it came from the window of the next attic some one had come to look at the sunset as she had there was a head and part of a body emerging from the skylight but it was not the head or body of a little girl or a housemaid it was the picturesque whiteswathed form and darkfaced gleamingeyed whiteturbaned head of a native indian manservanta lascar sara said to herself quicklyand the sound she had heard came from a small monkey he held in his arms as if he were fond of it and which was snuggling and chattering against his breast as sara looked toward him he looked toward her the first thing she thought was that his dark face looked sorrowful and homesick she felt absolutely sure he had come up to look at the sun because he had seen it so seldom in england that he longed for a sight of it she looked at him interestedly for a second and then smiled across the slates she had learned to know how comforting a smile even from a stranger may be hers was evidently a pleasure to him his whole expression altered and he showed such gleaming white teeth as he smiled back that it was as if a light had been illuminated in his dusky face the friendly look in saras eyes was always very effective when people felt tired or dull it was perhaps in making his salute to her that he loosened his hold on the monkey he was an impish monkey and always ready for adventure and it is probable that the sight of a little girl excited him he suddenly broke loose jumped on to the slates ran across them chattering and actually leaped on to saras shoulder and from there down into her attic room it made her laugh and delighted her but she knew he must be restored to his masterif the lascar was his masterand she wondered how this was to be done would he let her catch him or would he be naughty and refuse to be caught and perhaps get away and run off over the roofs and be lost that would not do at all perhaps he belonged to the indian gentleman and the poor man was fond of him she turned to the lascar feeling glad that she remembered still some of the hindustani she had learned when she lived with her father she could make the man understand she spoke to him in the language he knew will he let me catch him she asked she thought she had never seen more surprise and delight than the dark face expressed when she spoke in the familiar tongue the truth was that the poor fellow felt as if his gods had intervened and the kind little voice came from heaven itself at once sara saw that he had been accustomed to european children he poured forth a flood of respectful thanks he was the servant of missee sahib the monkey was a good monkey and would not bite but unfortunately he was difficult to catch he would flee from one spot to another like the lightning he was disobedient though not evil ram dass knew him as if he were his child and ram dass he would sometimes obey but not always if missee sahib would permit ram dass he himself could cross the roof to her room enter the windows and regain the unworthy little animal but he was evidently afraid sara might think he was taking a great liberty and perhaps would not let him come but sara gave him leave at once can you get across she inquired in a moment he answered her then come she said he is flying from side to side of the room as if he was frightened ram dass slipped through his attic window and crossed to hers as steadily and lightly as if he had walked on roofs all his life he slipped through the skylight and dropped upon his feet without a sound then he turned to sara and salaamed again the monkey saw him and uttered a little scream ram dass hastily took the precaution of shutting the skylight and then went in chase of him it was not a very long chase the monkey prolonged it a few minutes evidently for the mere fun of it but presently he sprang chattering on to ram dasss shoulder and sat there chattering and clinging to his neck with a weird little skinny arm ram dass thanked sara profoundly she had seen that his quick native eyes had taken in at a glance all the bare shabbiness of the room but he spoke to her as if he were speaking to the little daughter of a rajah and pretended that he observed nothing he did not presume to remain more than a few moments after he had caught the monkey and those moments were given to further deep and grateful obeisance to her in return for her indulgence this little evil one he said stroking the monkey was in truth not so evil as he seemed and his master who was ill was sometimes amused by him he would have been made sad if his favorite had run away and been lost then he salaamed once more and got through the skylight and across the slates again with as much agility as the monkey himself had displayed when he had gone sara stood in the middle of her attic and thought of many things his face and his manner had brought back to her the sight of his native costume and the profound reverence of his manner stirred all her past memories it seemed a strange thing to remember that shethe drudge whom the cook had said insulting things to an hour agohad only a few years ago been surrounded by people who all treated her as ram dass had treated her who salaamed when she went by whose foreheads almost touched the ground when she spoke to them who were her servants and her slaves it was like a sort of dream it was all over and it could never come back it certainly seemed that there was no way in which any change could take place she knew what miss minchin intended that her future should be so long as she was too young to be used as a regular teacher she would be used as an errand girl and servant and yet expected to remember what she had learned and in some mysterious way to learn more the greater number of her evenings she was supposed to spend at study and at various indefinite intervals she was examined and knew she would have been severely admonished if she had not advanced as was expected of her the truth indeed was that miss minchin knew that she was too anxious to learn to require teachers give her books and she would devour them and end by knowing them by heart she might be trusted to be equal to teaching a good deal in the course of a few years this was what would happen when she was older she would be expected to drudge in the schoolroom as she drudged now in various parts of the house they would be obliged to give her more respectable clothes but they would be sure to be plain and ugly and to make her look somehow like a servant that was all there seemed to be to look forward to and sara stood quite still for several minutes and thought it over then a thought came back to her which made the color rise in her cheek and a spark light itself in her eyes she straightened her thin little body and lifted her head whatever comes she said cannot alter one thing if i am a princess in rags and tatters i can be a princess inside it would be easy to be a princess if i were dressed in cloth of gold but it is a great deal more of a triumph to be one all the time when no one knows it there was marie antoinette when she was in prison and her throne was gone and she had only a black gown on and her hair was white and they insulted her and called her widow capet she was a great deal more like a queen then than when she was so gay and everything was so grand i like her best then those howling mobs of people did not frighten her she was stronger than they were even when they cut her head off this was not a new thought but quite an old one by this time it had consoled her through many a bitter day and she had gone about the house with an expression in her face which miss minchin could not understand and which was a source of great annoyance to her as it seemed as if the child were mentally living a life which held her above the rest of the world it was as if she scarcely heard the rude and acid things said to her or if she heard them did not care for them at all sometimes when she was in the midst of some harsh domineering speech miss minchin would find the still unchildish eyes fixed upon her with something like a proud smile in them at such times she did not know that sara was saying to herself you dont know that you are saying these things to a princess and that if i chose i could wave my hand and order you to execution i only spare you because i am a princess and you are a poor stupid unkind vulgar old thing and dont know any better this used to interest and amuse her more than anything else and queer and fanciful as it was she found comfort in it and it was a good thing for her while the thought held possession of her she could not be made rude and malicious by the rudeness and malice of those about her a princess must be polite she said to herself and so when the servants taking their tone from their mistress were insolent and ordered her about she would hold her head erect and reply to them with a quaint civility which often made them stare at her shes got more airs and graces than if she come from buckingham palace that young one said the cook chuckling a little sometimes i lose my temper with her often enough but i will say she never forgets her manners if you please cook will you be so kind cook i beg your pardon cook may i trouble you cook she drops em about the kitchen as if they was nothing the morning after the interview with ram dass and his monkey sara was in the schoolroom with her small pupils having finished giving them their lessons she was putting the french exercisebooks together and thinking as she did it of the various things royal personages in disguise were called upon to do alfred the great for instance burning the cakes and getting his ears boxed by the wife of the neatherd how frightened she must have been when she found out what she had done if miss minchin should find out that shesara whose toes were almost sticking out of her bootswas a princessa real one the look in her eyes was exactly the look which miss minchin most disliked she would not have it she was quite near her and was so enraged that she actually flew at her and boxed her earsexactly as the neatherds wife had boxed king alfreds it made sara start she wakened from her dream at the shock and catching her breath stood still a second then not knowing she was going to do it she broke into a little laugh what are you laughing at you bold impudent child miss minchin exclaimed it took sara a few seconds to control herself sufficiently to remember that she was a princess her cheeks were red and smarting from the blows she had received i was thinking she answered beg my pardon immediately said miss minchin sara hesitated a second before she replied i will beg your pardon for laughing if it was rude she said then but i wont beg your pardon for thinking what were you thinking demanded miss minchin how dare you think what were you thinking jessie tittered and she and lavinia nudged each other in unison all the girls looked up from their books to listen really it always interested them a little when miss minchin attacked sara sara always said something queer and never seemed the least bit frightened she was not in the least frightened now though her boxed ears were scarlet and her eyes were as bright as stars i was thinking she answered grandly and politely that you did not know what you were doing that i did not know what i was doing miss minchin fairly gasped yes said sara and i was thinking what would happen if i were a princess and you boxed my earswhat i should do to you and i was thinking that if i were one you would never dare to do it whatever i said or did and i was thinking how surprised and frightened you would be if you suddenly found out she had the imagined future so clearly before her eyes that she spoke in a manner which had an effect even upon miss minchin it almost seemed for the moment to her narrow unimaginative mind that there must be some real power hidden behind this candid daring what she exclaimed found out what that i really was a princess said sara and could do anythinganything i liked every pair of eyes in the room widened to its full limit lavinia leaned forward on her seat to look go to your room cried miss minchin breathlessly this instant leave the schoolroom attend to your lessons young ladies sara made a little bow excuse me for laughing if it was impolite she said and walked out of the room leaving miss minchin struggling with her rage and the girls whispering over their books did you see her did you see how queer she looked jessie broke out i shouldnt be at all surprised if she did turn out to be something suppose she should chapter xii the other side of the wall when one lives in a row of houses it is interesting to think of the things which are being done and said on the other side of the wall of the very rooms one is living in sara was fond of amusing herself by trying to imagine the things hidden by the wall which divided the select seminary from the indian gentlemans house she knew that the schoolroom was next to the indian gentlemans study and she hoped that the wall was thick so that the noise made sometimes after lesson hours would not disturb him i am growing quite fond of him she said to ermengarde i should not like him to be disturbed i have adopted him for a friend you can do that with people you never speak to at all you can just watch them and think about them and be sorry for them until they seem almost like relations im quite anxious sometimes when i see the doctor call twice a day i have very few relations said ermengarde reflectively and im very glad of it i dont like those i have my two aunts are always saying dear me ermengarde you are very fat you shouldnt eat sweets and my uncle is always asking me things like when did edward the third ascend the throne and who died of a surfeit of lampreys sara laughed people you never speak to cant ask you questions like that she said and im sure the indian gentleman wouldnt even if he was quite intimate with you i am fond of him she had become fond of the large family because they looked happy but she had become fond of the indian gentleman because he looked unhappy he had evidently not fully recovered from some very severe illness in the kitchenwhere of course the servants through some mysterious means knew everythingthere was much discussion of his case he was not an indian gentleman really but an englishman who had lived in india he had met with great misfortunes which had for a time so imperilled his whole fortune that he had thought himself ruined and disgraced forever the shock had been so great that he had almost died of brainfever and ever since he had been shattered in health though his fortunes had changed and all his possessions had been restored to him his trouble and peril had been connected with mines and mines with diamonds in em said the cook no savins of mine never goes into no minesparticular diamond oneswith a side glance at sara we all know somethin of them he felt as my papa felt sara thought he was ill as my papa was but he did not die so her heart was more drawn to him than before when she was sent out at night she used sometimes to feel quite glad because there was always a chance that the curtains of the house next door might not yet be closed and she could look into the warm room and see her adopted friend when no one was about she used sometimes to stop and holding to the iron railings wish him good night as if he could hear her perhaps you can feel if you cant hear was her fancy perhaps kind thoughts reach people somehow even through windows and doors and walls perhaps you feel a little warm and comforted and dont know why when i am standing here in the cold and hoping you will get well and happy again i am so sorry for you she would whisper in an intense little voice i wish you had a little missus who could pet you as i used to pet papa when he had a headache i should like to be your little missus myself poor dear good nightgood night god bless you she would go away feeling quite comforted and a little warmer herself her sympathy was so strong that it seemed as if it must reach him somehow as he sat alone in his armchair by the fire nearly always in a great dressinggown and nearly always with his forehead resting in his hand as he gazed hopelessly into the fire he looked to sara like a man who had a trouble on his mind still not merely like one whose troubles lay all in the past he always seems as if he were thinking of something that hurts him now she said to herself but he has got his money back and he will get over his brainfever in time so he ought not to look like that i wonder if there is something else if there was something elsesomething even servants did not hear ofshe could not help believing that the father of the large family knew itthe gentleman she called mr montmorency mr montmorency went to see him often and mrs montmorency and all the little montmorencys went too though less often he seemed particularly fond of the two elder little girlsthe janet and nora who had been so alarmed when their small brother donald had given sara his sixpence he had in fact a very tender place in his heart for all children and particularly for little girls janet and nora were as fond of him as he was of them and looked forward with the greatest pleasure to the afternoons when they were allowed to cross the square and make their wellbehaved little visits to him they were extremely decorous little visits because he was an invalid he is a poor thing said janet and he says we cheer him up we try to cheer him up very quietly janet was the head of the family and kept the rest of it in order it was she who decided when it was discreet to ask the indian gentleman to tell stories about india and it was she who saw when he was tired and it was the time to steal quietly away and tell ram dass to go to him they were very fond of ram dass he could have told any number of stories if he had been able to speak anything but hindustani the indian gentlemans real name was mr carrisford and janet told mr carrisford about the encounter with the littlegirlwhowasnotabeggar he was very much interested and all the more so when he heard from ram dass of the adventure of the monkey on the roof ram dass made for him a very clear picture of the attic and its desolatenessof the bare floor and broken plaster the rusty empty grate and the hard narrow bed carmichael he said to the father of the large family after he had heard this description i wonder how many of the attics in this square are like that one and how many wretched little servant girls sleep on such beds while i toss on my down pillows loaded and harassed by wealth that is most of itnot mine my dear fellow mr carmichael answered cheerily the sooner you cease tormenting yourself the better it will be for you if you possessed all the wealth of all the indies you could not set right all the discomforts in the world and if you began to refurnish all the attics in this square there would still remain all the attics in all the other squares and streets to put in order and there you are mr carrisford sat and bit his nails as he looked into the glowing bed of coals in the grate do you suppose he said slowly after a pausedo you think it is possible that the other childthe child i never cease thinking of i believecould becould possibly be reduced to any such condition as the poor little soul next door mr carmichael looked at him uneasily he knew that the worst thing the man could do for himself for his reason and his health was to begin to think in this particular way of this particular subject if the child at madame pascals school in paris was the one you are in search of he answered soothingly she would seem to be in the hands of people who can afford to take care of her they adopted her because she had been the favorite companion of their little daughter who died they had no other children and madame pascal said that they were extremely welltodo russians and the wretched woman actually did not know where they had taken her exclaimed mr carrisford mr carmichael shrugged his shoulders she was a shrewd worldly frenchwoman and was evidently only too glad to get the child so comfortably off her hands when the fathers death left her totally unprovided for women of her type do not trouble themselves about the futures of children who might prove burdens the adopted parents apparently disappeared and left no trace but you say if the child was the one i am in search of you say if we are not sure there was a difference in the name madame pascal pronounced it as if it were carew instead of crewebut that might be merely a matter of pronunciation the circumstances were curiously similar an english officer in india had placed his motherless little girl at the school he had died suddenly after losing his fortune mr carmichael paused a moment as if a new thought had occurred to him are you sure the child was left at a school in paris are you sure it was paris my dear fellow broke forth carrisford with restless bitterness i am sure of nothing i never saw either the child or her mother ralph crewe and i loved each other as boys but we had not met since our schooldays until we met in india i was absorbed in the magnificent promise of the mines he became absorbed too the whole thing was so huge and glittering that we half lost our heads when we met we scarcely spoke of anything else i only knew that the child had been sent to school somewhere i do not even remember now how i knew it he was beginning to be excited he always became excited when his still weakened brain was stirred by memories of the catastrophes of the past mr carmichael watched him anxiously it was necessary to ask some questions but they must be put quietly and with caution but you had reason to think the school was in paris yes was the answer because her mother was a frenchwoman and i had heard that she wished her child to be educated in paris it seemed only likely that she would be there yes mr carmichael said it seems more than probable the indian gentleman leaned forward and struck the table with a long wasted hand carmichael he said i must find her if she is alive she is somewhere if she is friendless and penniless it is through my fault how is a man to get back his nerve with a thing like that on his mind this sudden change of luck at the mines has made realities of all our most fantastic dreams and poor crewes child may be begging in the street no no said carmichael try to be calm console yourself with the fact that when she is found you have a fortune to hand over to her why was i not man enough to stand my ground when things looked black carrisford groaned in petulant misery i believe i should have stood my ground if i had not been responsible for other peoples money as well as my own poor crewe had put into the scheme every penny that he owned he trusted mehe loved me and he died thinking i had ruined himitom carrisford who played cricket at eton with him what a villain he must have thought me dont reproach yourself so bitterly i dont reproach myself because the speculation threatened to faili reproach myself for losing my courage i ran away like a swindler and a thief because i could not face my best friend and tell him i had ruined him and his child the goodhearted father of the large family put his hand on his shoulder comfortingly you ran away because your brain had given way under the strain of mental torture he said you were half delirious already if you had not been you would have stayed and fought it out you were in a hospital strapped down in bed raving with brainfever two days after you left the place remember that carrisford dropped his forehead in his hands good god yes he said i was driven mad with dread and horror i had not slept for weeks the night i staggered out of my house all the air seemed full of hideous things mocking and mouthing at me that is explanation enough in itself said mr carmichael how could a man on the verge of brainfever judge sanely carrisford shook his drooping head and when i returned to consciousness poor crewe was deadand buried and i seemed to remember nothing i did not remember the child for months and months even when i began to recall her existence everything seemed in a sort of haze he stopped a moment and rubbed his forehead it sometimes seems so now when i try to remember surely i must sometime have heard crewe speak of the school she was sent to dont you think so he might not have spoken of it definitely you never seem even to have heard her real name he used to call her by an odd pet name he had invented he called her his little missus but the wretched mines drove everything else out of our heads we talked of nothing else if he spoke of the school i forgoti forgot and now i shall never remember come come said carmichael we shall find her yet we will continue to search for madame pascals goodnatured russians she seemed to have a vague idea that they lived in moscow we will take that as a clue i will go to moscow if i were able to travel i would go with you said carrisford but i can only sit here wrapped in furs and stare at the fire and when i look into it i seem to see crewes gay young face gazing back at me he looks as if he were asking me a question sometimes i dream of him at night and he always stands before me and asks the same question in words can you guess what he says carmichael mr carmichael answered him in a rather low voice not exactly he said he always says tom old mantomwhere is the little missus he caught at carmichaels hand and clung to it i must be able to answer himi must he said help me to find her help me on the other side of the wall sara was sitting in her garret talking to melchisedec who had come out for his evening meal it has been hard to be a princess today melchisedec she said it has been harder than usual it gets harder as the weather grows colder and the streets get more sloppy when lavinia laughed at my muddy skirt as i passed her in the hall i thought of something to say all in a flashand i only just stopped myself in time you cant sneer back at people like thatif you are a princess but you have to bite your tongue to hold yourself in i bit mine it was a cold afternoon melchisedec and its a cold night quite suddenly she put her black head down in her arms as she often did when she was alone oh papa she whispered what a long time it seems since i was your little missus this was what happened that day on both sides of the wall chapter xiii one of the populace the winter was a wretched one there were days on which sara tramped through snow when she went on her errands there were worse days when the snow melted and combined itself with mud to form slush there were others when the fog was so thick that the lamps in the street were lighted all day and london looked as it had looked the afternoon several years ago when the cab had driven through the thoroughfares with sara tucked up on its seat leaning against her fathers shoulder on such days the windows of the house of the large family always looked delightfully cosey and alluring and the study in which the indian gentleman sat glowed with warmth and rich color but the attic was dismal beyond words there were no longer sunsets or sunrises to look at and scarcely ever any stars it seemed to sara the clouds hung low over the skylight and were either gray or mudcolor or dropping heavy rain at four oclock in the afternoon even when there was no special fog the daylight was at an end if it was necessary to go to her attic for anything sara was obliged to light a candle the women in the kitchen were depressed and that made them more illtempered than ever becky was driven like a little slave t warnt for you miss she said hoarsely to sara one night when she had crept into the attict warnt for you an the bastille an bein the prisoner in the next cell i should die that there does seem real now doesnt it the missus is more like the head jailer every day she lives i can jest see them big keys you say she carries the cook shes like one of the underjailers tell me some more please misstell me about the subtranean passage weve dug under the walls ill tell you something warmer shivered sara get your coverlet and wrap it round you and ill get mine and we will huddle close together on the bed and ill tell you about the tropical forest where the indian gentlemans monkey used to live when i see him sitting on the table near the window and looking out into the street with that mournful expression i always feel sure he is thinking about the tropical forest where he used to swing by his tail from cocoanuttrees i wonder who caught him and if he left a family behind who had depended on him for cocoanuts that is warmer miss said becky gratefully but someways even the bastille is sort of heatin when you gets to tellin about it that is because it makes you think of something else said sara wrapping the coverlet round her until only her small dark face was to be seen looking out of it ive noticed this what you have to do with your mind when your body is miserable is to make it think of something else can you do it miss faltered becky regarding her with admiring eyes sara knitted her brows a moment sometimes i can and sometimes i cant she said stoutly but when i can im all right and what i believe is that we always couldif we practised enough ive been practising a good deal lately and its beginning to be easier than it used to be when things are horriblejust horriblei think as hard as ever i can of being a princess i say to myself i am a princess and i am a fairy one and because i am a fairy nothing can hurt me or make me uncomfortable you dont know how it makes you forgetwith a laugh she had many opportunities of making her mind think of something else and many opportunities of proving to herself whether or not she was a princess but one of the strongest tests she was ever put to came on a certain dreadful day which she often thought afterward would never quite fade out of her memory even in the years to come for several days it had rained continuously the streets were chilly and sloppy and full of dreary cold mist there was mud everywheresticky london mudand over everything the pall of drizzle and fog of course there were several long and tiresome errands to be donethere always were on days like thisand sara was sent out again and again until her shabby clothes were damp through the absurd old feathers on her forlorn hat were more draggled and absurd than ever and her downtrodden shoes were so wet that they could not hold any more water added to this she had been deprived of her dinner because miss minchin had chosen to punish her she was so cold and hungry and tired that her face began to have a pinched look and now and then some kindhearted person passing her in the street glanced at her with sudden sympathy but she did not know that she hurried on trying to make her mind think of something else it was really very necessary her way of doing it was to pretend and suppose with all the strength that was left in her but really this time it was harder than she had ever found it and once or twice she thought it almost made her more cold and hungry instead of less so but she persevered obstinately and as the muddy water squelched through her broken shoes and the wind seemed trying to drag her thin jacket from her she talked to herself as she walked though she did not speak aloud or even move her lips suppose i had dry clothes on she thought suppose i had good shoes and a long thick coat and merino stockings and a whole umbrella and supposesupposejust when i was near a bakers where they sold hot buns i should find sixpencewhich belonged to nobody suppose if i did i should go into the shop and buy six of the hottest buns and eat them all without stopping some very odd things happen in this world sometimes it certainly was an odd thing that happened to sara she had to cross the street just when she was saying this to herself the mud was dreadfulshe almost had to wade she picked her way as carefully as she could but she could not save herself much only in picking her way she had to look down at her feet and the mud and in looking downjust as she reached the pavementshe saw something shining in the gutter it was actually a piece of silvera tiny piece trodden upon by many feet but still with spirit enough left to shine a little not quite a sixpence but the next thing to ita fourpenny piece in one second it was in her cold little redandblue hand oh she gasped it is true it is true and then if you will believe me she looked straight at the shop directly facing her and it was a bakers shop and a cheerful stout motherly woman with rosy cheeks was putting into the window a tray of delicious newly baked hot buns fresh from the ovenlarge plump shiny buns with currants in them it almost made sara feel faint for a few secondsthe shock and the sight of the buns and the delightful odors of warm bread floating up through the bakers cellar window she knew she need not hesitate to use the little piece of money it had evidently been lying in the mud for some time and its owner was completely lost in the stream of passing people who crowded and jostled each other all day long but ill go and ask the baker woman if she has lost anything she said to herself rather faintly so she crossed the pavement and put her wet foot on the step as she did so she saw something that made her stop it was a little figure more forlorn even than herselfa little figure which was not much more than a bundle of rags from which small bare red muddy feet peeped out only because the rags with which their owner was trying to cover them were not long enough above the rags appeared a shock head of tangled hair and a dirty face with big hollow hungry eyes sara knew they were hungry eyes the moment she saw them and she felt a sudden sympathy this she said to herself with a little sigh is one of the populaceand she is hungrier than i am the childthis one of the populacestared up at sara and shuffled herself aside a little so as to give her room to pass she was used to being made to give room to everybody she knew that if a policeman chanced to see her he would tell her to move on sara clutched her little fourpenny piece and hesitated a few seconds then she spoke to her are you hungry she asked the child shuffled herself and her rags a little more aint i jist she said in a hoarse voice jist aint i havent you had any dinner said sara no dinnermore hoarsely still and with more shuffling nor yet no brefastnor yet no supper no nothin since when asked sara dunno never got nothin todaynowhere ive axed an axed just to look at her made sara more hungry and faint but those queer little thoughts were at work in her brain and she was talking to herself though she was sick at heart if im a princess she was sayingif im a princesswhen they were poor and driven from their thronesthey always sharedwith the populaceif they met one poorer and hungrier than themselves they always shared buns are a penny each if it had been sixpence i could have eaten six it wont be enough for either of us but it will be better than nothing wait a minute she said to the beggar child she went into the shop it was warm and smelled deliciously the woman was just going to put some more hot buns into the window if you please said sara have you lost fourpencea silver fourpence and she held the forlorn little piece of money out to her the woman looked at it and then at herat her intense little face and draggled once fine clothes bless us no she answered did you find it yes said sara in the gutter keep it then said the woman it may have been there for a week and goodness knows who lost it you could never find out i know that said sara but i thought i would ask you not many would said the woman looking puzzled and interested and goodnatured all at once do you want to buy something she added as she saw sara glance at the buns four buns if you please said sara those at a penny each the woman went to the window and put some in a paper bag sara noticed that she put in six i said four if you please she explained i have only fourpence ill throw in two for makeweight said the woman with her goodnatured look i dare say you can eat them sometime arent you hungry a mist rose before saras eyes yes she answered i am very hungry and i am much obliged to you for your kindness andshe was going to addthere is a child outside who is hungrier than i am but just at that moment two or three customers came in at once and each one seemed in a hurry so she could only thank the woman again and go out illustration the beggar girl was still huddled up in the corner the beggar girl was still huddled up in the corner of the step she looked frightful in her wet and dirty rags she was staring straight before her with a stupid look of suffering and sara saw her suddenly draw the back of her roughened black hand across her eyes to rub away the tears which seemed to have surprised her by forcing their way from under her lids she was muttering to herself sara opened the paper bag and took out one of the hot buns which had already warmed her own cold hands a little see she said putting the bun in the ragged lap this is nice and hot eat it and you will not feel so hungry the child started and stared up at her as if such sudden amazing good luck almost frightened her then she snatched up the bun and began to cram it into her mouth with great wolfish bites oh my oh my sara heard her say hoarsely in wild delight oh my sara took out three more buns and put them down the sound in the hoarse ravenous voice was awful she is hungrier than i am she said to herself shes starving but her hand trembled when she put down the fourth bun im not starving she saidand she put down the fifth the little ravening london savage was still snatching and devouring when she turned away she was too ravenous to give any thanks even if she had ever been taught politenesswhich she had not she was only a poor little wild animal goodby said sara when she reached the other side of the street she looked back the child had a bun in each hand and had stopped in the middle of a bite to watch her sara gave her a little nod and the child after another starea curious lingering starejerked her shaggy head in response and until sara was out of sight she did not take another bite or even finish the one she had begun at that moment the bakerwoman looked out of her shop window well i never she exclaimed if that young un hasnt given her buns to a beggar child it wasnt because she didnt want them either well well she looked hungry enough id give something to know what she did it for she stood behind her window for a few moments and pondered then her curiosity got the better of her she went to the door and spoke to the beggar child who gave you those buns she asked her the child nodded her head toward saras vanishing figure what did she say inquired the woman axed me if i was ungry replied the hoarse voice what did you say said i was jist and then she came in and got the buns and gave them to you did she the child nodded how many five the woman thought it over left just one for herself she said in a low voice and she could have eaten the whole sixi saw it in her eyes she looked after the little draggled faraway figure and felt more disturbed in her usually comfortable mind than she had felt for many a day i wish she hadnt gone so quick she said im blest if she shouldnt have had a dozen then she turned to the child are you hungry yet she said im allus hungry was the answer but taint as bad as it was come in here said the woman and she held open the shop door the child got up and shuffled in to be invited into a warm place full of bread seemed an incredible thing she did not know what was going to happen she did not care even get yourself warm said the woman pointing to a fire in the tiny back room and look here when you are hard up for a bit of bread you can come in here and ask for it im blest if i wont give it to you for that young ones sake sara found some comfort in her remaining bun at all events it was very hot and it was better than nothing as she walked along she broke off small pieces and ate them slowly to make them last longer suppose it was a magic bun she said and a bite was as much as a whole dinner i should be overeating myself if i went on like this it was dark when she reached the square where the select seminary was situated the lights in the houses were all lighted the blinds were not yet drawn in the windows of the room where she nearly always caught glimpses of members of the large family frequently at this hour she could see the gentleman she called mr montmorency sitting in a big chair with a small swarm round him talking laughing perching on the arms of his seat or on his knees or leaning against them this evening the swarm was about him but he was not seated on the contrary there was a good deal of excitement going on it was evident that a journey was to be taken and it was mr montmorency who was to take it a brougham stood before the door and a big portmanteau had been strapped upon it the children were dancing about chattering and hanging on to their father the pretty rosy mother was standing near him talking as if she was asking final questions sara paused a moment to see the little ones lifted up and kissed and the bigger ones bent over and kissed also i wonder if he will stay away long she thought the portmanteau is rather big oh dear how they will miss him i shall miss him myselfeven though he doesnt know i am alive when the door opened she moved awayremembering the sixpencebut she saw the traveller come out and stand against the background of the warmly lighted hall the older children still hovering about him will moscow be covered with snow said the little girl janet will there be ice everywhere shall you drive in a drosky cried another shall you see the czar i will write and tell you all about it he answered laughing and i will send you pictures of muzhiks and things run into the house it is a hideous damp night i would rather stay with you than go to moscow good night good night duckies god bless you and he ran down the steps and jumped into the brougham if you find the little girl give her our love shouted guy clarence jumping up and down on the doormat then they went in and shut the door did you see said janet to nora as they went back to the roomthe littlegirlwhoisnotabeggar was passing she looked all cold and wet and i saw her turn her head over her shoulder and look at us mamma says her clothes always look as if they had been given her by some one who was quite richsome one who only let her have them because they were too shabby to wear the people at the school always send her out on errands on the horridest days and nights there are sara crossed the square to miss minchins area steps feeling faint and shaky i wonder who the little girl is she thoughtthe little girl he is going to look for and she went down the area steps lugging her basket and finding it very heavy indeed as the father of the large family drove quickly on his way to the station to take the train which was to carry him to moscow where he was to make his best efforts to search for the lost little daughter of captain crewe chapter xiv what melchisedec heard and saw on this very afternoon while sara was out a strange thing happened in the attic only melchisedec saw and heard it and he was so much alarmed and mystified that he scuttled back to his hole and hid there and really quaked and trembled as he peeped out furtively and with great caution to watch what was going on the attic had been very still all the day after sara had left it in the early morning the stillness had only been broken by the pattering of the rain upon the slates and the skylight melchisedec had in fact found it rather dull and when the rain ceased to patter and perfect silence reigned he decided to come out and reconnoitre though experience taught him that sara would not return for some time he had been rambling and sniffing about and had just found a totally unexpected and unexplained crumb left from his last meal when his attention was attracted by a sound on the roof he stopped to listen with a palpitating heart the sound suggested that something was moving on the roof it was approaching the skylight it reached the skylight the skylight was being mysteriously opened a dark face peered into the attic then another face appeared behind it and both looked in with signs of caution and interest two men were outside on the roof and were making silent preparations to enter through the skylight itself one was ram dass and the other was a young man who was the indian gentlemans secretary but of course melchisedec did not know this he only knew that the men were invading the silence and privacy of the attic and as the one with the dark face let himself down through the aperture with such lightness and dexterity that he did not make the slightest sound melchisedec turned tail and fled precipitately back to his hole he was frightened to death he had ceased to be timid with sara and knew she would never throw anything but crumbs and would never make any sound other than the soft low coaxing whistling but strange men were dangerous things to remain near he lay close and flat near the entrance of his home just managing to peep through the crack with a bright alarmed eye how much he understood of the talk he heard i am not in the least able to say but even if he had understood it all he would probably have remained greatly mystified the secretary who was light and young slipped through the skylight as noiselessly as ram dass had done and he caught a last glimpse of melchisedecs vanishing tail was that a rat he asked ram dass in a whisper yes a rat sahib answered ram dass also whispering there are many in the walls ugh exclaimed the young man it is a wonder the child is not terrified of them ram dass made a gesture with his hands he also smiled respectfully he was in this place as the intimate exponent of sara though she had only spoken to him once the child is the little friend of all things sahib he answered she is not as other children i see her when she does not see me i slip across the slates and look at her many nights to see that she is safe i watch her from my window when she does not know i am near she stands on the table there and looks out at the sky as if it spoke to her the sparrows come at her call the rat she has fed and tamed in her loneliness the poor slave of the house comes to her for comfort there is a little child who comes to her in secret there is one older who worships her and would listen to her forever if she might this i have seen when i have crept across the roof by the mistress of the housewho is an evil womanshe is treated like a pariah but she has the bearing of a child who is of the blood of kings you seem to know a great deal about her the secretary said all her life each day i know answered ram dass her going out i know and her coming in her sadness and her poor joys her coldness and her hunger i know when she sits alone until midnight learning from her books i know when her secret friends steal to her and she is happieras children can be even in the midst of povertybecause they come and she may laugh and talk with them in whispers if she were ill i should know and i would come and serve her if it might be done you are sure no one comes near this place but herself and that she will not return and surprise us she would be frightened if she found us here and the sahib carrisfords plan would be spoiled ram dass crossed noiselessly to the door and stood close to it none mount here but herself sahib he said she has gone out with her basket and may be gone for hours if i stand here i can hear any step before it reaches the last flight of the stairs the secretary took a pencil and a tablet from his breast pocket keep your ears open he said and he began to walk slowly and softly round the miserable little room making rapid notes on his tablet as he looked at things first he went to the narrow bed he pressed his hand upon the mattress and uttered an exclamation as hard as a stone he said that will have to be altered some day when she is out a special journey can be made to bring it across it cannot be done tonight he lifted the covering and examined the one thin pillow coverlet dingy and worn blanket thin sheets patched and ragged he said what a bed for a child to sleep inand in a house which calls itself respectable there has not been a fire in that grate for many a day glancing at the rusty fireplace never since i have seen it said ram dass the mistress of the house is not one who remembers that another than herself may be cold the secretary was writing quickly on his tablet he looked up from it as he tore off a leaf and slipped it into his breast pocket it is a strange way of doing the thing he said who planned it ram dass made a modestly apologetic obeisance it is true that the first thought was mine sahib he said though it was naught but a fancy i am fond of this child we are both lonely it is her way to relate her visions to her secret friends being sad one night i lay close to the open skylight and listened the vision she related told what this miserable room might be if it had comforts in it she seemed to see it as she talked and she grew cheered and warmed as she spoke then she came to this fancy and the next day the sahib being ill and wretched i told him of the thing to amuse him it seemed then but a dream but it pleased the sahib to hear of the childs doings gave him entertainment he became interested in her and asked questions at last he began to please himself with the thought of making her visions real things you think that it can be done while she sleeps suppose she awakened suggested the secretary and it was evident that whatsoever the plan referred to was it had caught and pleased his fancy as well as the sahib carrisfords i can move as if my feet were of velvet ram dass replied and children sleep soundlyeven the unhappy ones i could have entered this room in the night many times and without causing her to turn upon her pillow if the other bearer passes to me the things through the window i can do all and she will not stir when she awakens she will think a magician has been here he smiled as if his heart warmed under his white robe and the secretary smiled back at him it will be like a story from the arabian nights he said only an oriental could have planned it it does not belong to london fogs they did not remain very long to the great relief of melchisedec who as he probably did not comprehend their conversation felt their movements and whispers ominous the young secretary seemed interested in everything he wrote down things about the floor the fireplace the broken footstool the old table the wallswhich last he touched with his hand again and again seeming much pleased when he found that a number of old nails had been driven in various places you can hang things on them he said ram dass smiled mysteriously yesterday when she was out he said i entered bringing with me small sharp nails which can be pressed into the wall without blows from a hammer i placed many in the plaster where i may need them they are ready the indian gentlemans secretary stood still and looked round him as he thrust his tablets back into his pocket i think i have made notes enough we can go now he said the sahib carrisford has a warm heart it is a thousand pities that he has not found the lost child if he should find her his strength would be restored to him said ram dass his god may lead her to him yet then they slipped through the skylight as noiselessly as they had entered it and after he was quite sure they had gone melchisedec was greatly relieved and in the course of a few minutes felt it safe to emerge from his hole again and scuffle about in the hope that even such alarming human beings as these might have chanced to carry crumbs in their pockets and drop one or two of them chapter xv the magic when sara had passed the house next door she had seen ram dass closing the shutters and caught her glimpse of this room also it is a long time since i saw a nice place from the inside was the thought which crossed her mind there was the usual bright fire glowing in the grate and the indian gentleman was sitting before it his head was resting in his hand and he looked as lonely and unhappy as ever poor man said sara i wonder what you are supposing and this was what he was supposing at that very moment suppose he was thinking supposeeven if carmichael traces the people to moscowthe little girl they took from madame pascals school in paris is not the one we are in search of suppose she proves to be quite a different child what steps shall i take next when sara went into the house she met miss minchin who had come downstairs to scold the cook where have you wasted your time she demanded you have been out for hours it was so wet and muddy sara answered it was hard to walk because my shoes were so bad and slipped about make no excuses said miss minchin and tell no falsehoods sara went in to the cook the cook had received a severe lecture and was in a fearful temper as a result she was only too rejoiced to have some one to vent her rage on and sara was a convenience as usual why didnt you stay all night she snapped sara laid her purchases on the table here are the things she said the cook looked them over grumbling she was in a very savage humor indeed may i have something to eat sara asked rather faintly teas over and done with was the answer did you expect me to keep it hot for you sara stood silent for a second i had no dinner she said next and her voice was quite low she made it low because she was afraid it would tremble theres some bread in the pantry said the cook thats all youll get at this time of day sara went and found the bread it was old and hard and dry the cook was in too vicious a humor to give her anything to eat with it it was always safe and easy to vent her spite on sara really it was hard for the child to climb the three long flights of stairs leading to her attic she often found them long and steep when she was tired but tonight it seemed as if she would never reach the top several times she was obliged to stop to rest when she reached the top landing she was glad to see the glimmer of a light coming from under her door that meant that ermengarde had managed to creep up to pay her a visit there was some comfort in that it was better than to go into the room alone and find it empty and desolate the mere presence of plump comfortable ermengarde wrapped in her red shawl would warm it a little yes there ermengarde was when she opened the door she was sitting in the middle of the bed with her feet tucked safely under her she had never become intimate with melchisedec and his family though they rather fascinated her when she found herself alone in the attic she always preferred to sit on the bed until sara arrived she had in fact on this occasion had time to become rather nervous because melchisedec had appeared and sniffed about a good deal and once had made her utter a repressed squeal by sitting up on his hind legs and while he looked at her sniffing pointedly in her direction oh sara she cried out i am glad you have come melchy would sniff about so i tried to coax him to go back but he wouldnt for such a long time i like him you know but it does frighten me when he sniffs right at me do you think he ever would jump no answered sara ermengarde crawled forward on the bed to look at her you do look tired sara she said you are quite pale i am tired said sara dropping on to the lopsided footstool oh theres melchisedec poor thing hes come to ask for his supper melchisedec had come out of his hole as if he had been listening for her footstep sara was quite sure he knew it he came forward with an affectionate expectant expression as sara put her hand in her pocket and turned it inside out shaking her head im very sorry she said i havent one crumb left go home melchisedec and tell your wife there was nothing in my pocket im afraid i forgot because the cook and miss minchin were so cross melchisedec seemed to understand he shuffled resignedly if not contentedly back to his home i did not expect to see you tonight ermie sara said ermengarde hugged herself in the red shawl miss amelia has gone out to spend the night with her old aunt she explained no one else ever comes and looks into the bedrooms after we are in bed i could stay here until morning if i wanted to she pointed toward the table under the skylight sara had not looked toward it as she came in a number of books were piled upon it ermengardes gesture was a dejected one papa has sent me some more books sara she said there they are sara looked round and got up at once she ran to the table and picking up the top volume turned over its leaves quickly for the moment she forgot her discomforts ah she cried out how beautiful carlyles french revolution i have so wanted to read that i havent said ermengarde and papa will be so cross if i dont hell expect me to know all about it when i go home for the holidays what shall i do sara stopped turning over the leaves and looked at her with an excited flush on her cheeks look here she cried if youll lend me these books ill read themand tell you everything thats in them afterwardand ill tell it so that you will remember it too oh goodness exclaimed ermengarde do you think you can i know i can sara answered the little ones always remember what i tell them sara said ermengarde hope gleaming in her round face if youll do that and make me remember illill give you anything i dont want you to give me anything said sara i want your booksi want them and her eyes grew big and her chest heaved take them then said ermengarde i wish i wanted thembut i dont im not clever and my father is and he thinks i ought to be sara was opening one book after the other what are you going to tell your father she asked a slight doubt dawning in her mind oh he neednt know answered ermengarde hell think ive read them sara put down her book and shook her head slowly thats almost like telling lies she said and lieswell you see they are not only wickedtheyre vulgar sometimesreflectivelyive thought perhaps i might do something wickedi might suddenly fly into a rage and kill miss minchin you know when she was illtreating mebut i couldnt be vulgar why cant you tell your father i read them he wants me to read them said ermengarde a little discouraged by this unexpected turn of affairs he wants you to know what is in them said sara and if i can tell it to you in an easy way and make you remember it i should think he would like that hell like it if i learn anything in any way said rueful ermengarde you would if you were my father its not your fault that began sara she pulled herself up and stopped rather suddenly she had been going to say its not your fault that you are stupid that what ermengarde asked that you cant learn things quickly amended sara if you cant you cant if i canwhy i can thats all she always felt very tender of ermengarde and tried not to let her feel too strongly the difference between being able to learn anything at once and not being able to learn anything at all as she looked at her plump face one of her wise oldfashioned thoughts came to her perhaps she said to be able to learn things quickly isnt everything to be kind is worth a great deal to other people if miss minchin knew everything on earth and was like what she is now shed still be a detestable thing and everybody would hate her lots of clever people have done harm and have been wicked look at robespierre she stopped and examined ermengardes countenance which was beginning to look bewildered dont you remember she demanded i told you about him not long ago i believe youve forgotten well i dont remember all of it admitted ermengarde well you wait a minute said sara and ill take off my wet things and wrap myself in the coverlet and tell you over again she took off her hat and coat and hung them on a nail against the wall and she changed her wet shoes for an old pair of slippers then she jumped on the bed and drawing the coverlet about her shoulders sat with her arms round her knees now listen she said she plunged into the gory records of the french revolution and told such stories of it that ermengardes eyes grew round with alarm and she held her breath but though she was rather terrified there was a delightful thrill in listening and she was not likely to forget robespierre again or to have any doubts about the princesse de lamballe you know they put her head on a pike and danced round it sara explained and she had beautiful floating blonde hair and when i think of her i never see her head on her body but always on a pike with those furious people dancing and howling it was agreed that mr st john was to be told the plan they had made and for the present the books were to be left in the attic now lets tell each other things said sara how are you getting on with your french lessons ever so much better since the last time i came up here and you explained the conjugations miss minchin could not understand why i did my exercises so well that first morning sara laughed a little and hugged her knees she doesnt understand why lottie is doing her sums so well she said but it is because she creeps up here too and i help her she glanced round the room the attic would be rather niceif it wasnt so dreadful she said laughing again its a good place to pretend in the truth was that ermengarde did not know anything of the sometimes almost unbearable side of life in the attic and she had not a sufficiently vivid imagination to depict it for herself on the rare occasions that she could reach saras room she only saw that side of it which was made exciting by things which were pretended and stories which were told her visits partook of the character of adventures and though sometimes sara looked rather pale and it was not to be denied that she had grown very thin her proud little spirit would not admit of complaints she had never confessed that at times she was almost ravenous with hunger as she was tonight she was growing rapidly and her constant walking and running about would have given her a keen appetite even if she had had abundant and regular meals of a much more nourishing nature than the unappetizing inferior food snatched at such odd times as suited the kitchen convenience she was growing used to a certain gnawing feeling in her young stomach i suppose soldiers feel like this when they are on a long and weary march she often said to herself she liked the sound of the phrase long and weary march it made her feel rather like a soldier she had also a quaint sense of being a hostess in the attic if i lived in a castle she argued and ermengarde was the lady of another castle and came to see me with knights and squires and vassals riding with her and pennons flying when i heard the clarions sounding outside the drawbridge i should go down to receive her and i should spread feasts in the banquethall and call in minstrels to sing and play and relate romances when she comes into the attic i cant spread feasts but i can tell stories and not let her know disagreeable things i dare say poor chatelaines had to do that in times of famine when their lands had been pillaged she was a proud brave little chatelaine and dispensed generously the one hospitality she could offerthe dreams she dreamedthe visions she sawthe imaginings which were her joy and comfort so as they sat together ermengarde did not know that she was faint as well as ravenous and that while she talked she now and then wondered if her hunger would let her sleep when she was left alone she felt as if she had never been quite so hungry before i wish i was as thin as you sara ermengarde said suddenly i believe you are thinner than you used to be your eyes look so big and look at the sharp little bones sticking out of your elbow sara pulled down her sleeve which had pushed itself up i always was a thin child she said bravely and i always had big green eyes i love your queer eyes said ermengarde looking into them with affectionate admiration they always look as if they saw such a long way i love themand i love them to be greenthough they look black generally they are cats eyes laughed sara but i cant see in the dark with thembecause i have tried and i couldnti wish i could it was just at this minute that something happened at the skylight which neither of them saw if either of them had chanced to turn and look she would have been startled by the sight of a dark face which peered cautiously into the room and disappeared as quickly and almost as silently as it had appeared not quite as silently however sara who had keen ears suddenly turned a little and looked up at the roof that didnt sound like melchisedec she said it wasnt scratchy enough what said ermengarde a little startled didnt you think you heard something asked sara nno ermengarde faltered did you perhaps i didnt said sara but i thought i did it sounded as if something was on the slatessomething that dragged softly what could it be said ermengarde could it berobbers no sara began cheerfully there is nothing to steal she broke off in the middle of her words they both heard the sound that checked her it was not on the slates but on the stairs below and it was miss minchins angry voice sara sprang off the bed and put out the candle she is scolding becky she whispered as she stood in the darkness she is making her cry will she come in here ermengarde whispered back panicstricken no she will think i am in bed dont stir it was very seldom that miss minchin mounted the last flight of stairs sara could only remember that she had done it once before but now she was angry enough to be coming at least part of the way up and it sounded as if she was driving becky before her you impudent dishonest child they heard her say cook tells me she has missed things repeatedly t warnt me mum said becky sobbing i was ungry enough but t warnt menever you deserve to be sent to prison said miss minchins voice picking and stealing half a meatpie indeed t warnt me wept becky i could ave eat a whole unbut i never laid a finger on it miss minchin was out of breath between temper and mounting the stairs the meatpie had been intended for her special late supper it became apparent that she boxed beckys ears dont tell falsehoods she said go to your room this instant both sara and ermengarde heard the slap and then heard becky run in her slipshod shoes up the stairs and into her attic they heard her door shut and knew that she threw herself upon her bed i could ave et two of em they heard her cry into her pillow an i never took a bite twas cook give it to her policeman sara stood in the middle of the room in the darkness she was clenching her little teeth and opening and shutting fiercely her outstretched hands she could scarcely stand still but she dared not move until miss minchin had gone down the stairs and all was still the wicked cruel thing she burst forth the cook takes things herself and then says becky steals them she doesnt she doesnt shes so hungry sometimes that she eats crusts out of the ashbarrel she pressed her hands hard against her face and burst into passionate little sobs and ermengarde hearing this unusual thing was overawed by it sara was crying the unconquerable sara it seemed to denote something newsome mood she had never known suppose suppose a new dread possibility presented itself to her kind slow little mind all at once she crept off the bed in the dark and found her way to the table where the candle stood she struck a match and lit the candle when she had lighted it she bent forward and looked at sara with her new thought growing to definite fear in her eyes sara she said in a timid almost awestricken voice areareyou never told mei dont want to be rude butare you ever hungry it was too much just at that moment the barrier broke down sara lifted her face from her hands yes she said in a new passionate way yes i am im so hungry now that i could almost eat you and it makes it worse to hear poor becky shes hungrier than i am ermengarde gasped oh oh she cried wofully and i never knew i didnt want you to know sara said it would have made me feel like a street beggar i know i look like a street beggar no you dontyou dont ermengarde broke in your clothes are a little queerbut you couldnt look like a street beggar you havent a streetbeggar face a little boy once gave me a sixpence for charity said sara with a short little laugh in spite of herself here it is and she pulled out the thin ribbon from her neck he wouldnt have given me his christmas sixpence if i hadnt looked as if i needed it somehow the sight of the dear little sixpence was good for both of them it made them laugh a little though they both had tears in their eyes who was he asked ermengarde looking at it quite as if it had not been a mere ordinary silver sixpence he was a darling little thing going to a party said sara he was one of the large family the little one with the round legsthe one i call guy clarence i suppose his nursery was crammed with christmas presents and hampers full of cakes and things and he could see i had had nothing ermengarde gave a little jump backward the last sentences had recalled something to her troubled mind and given her a sudden inspiration oh sara she cried what a silly thing i am not to have thought of it of what something splendid said ermengarde in an excited hurry this very afternoon my nicest aunt sent me a box it is full of good things i never touched it i had so much pudding at dinner and i was so bothered about papas books her words began to tumble over each other its got cake in it and little meatpies and jamtarts and buns and oranges and redcurrant wine and figs and chocolate ill creep back to my room and get it this minute and well eat it now sara almost reeled when one is faint with hunger the mention of food has sometimes a curious effect she clutched ermengardes arm do you thinkyou could she ejaculated i know i could answered ermengarde and she ran to the dooropened it softlyput her head out into the darkness and listened then she went back to sara the lights are out everybodys in bed i can creepand creepand no one will hear it was so delightful that they caught each others hands and a sudden light sprang into saras eyes ermie she said let us pretend let us pretend its a party and oh wont you invite the prisoner in the next cell yes yes let us knock on the wall now the jailer wont hear sara went to the wall through it she could hear poor becky crying more softly she knocked four times that means come to me through the secret passage under the wall she explained i have something to communicate five quick knocks answered her she is coming she said almost immediately the door of the attic opened and becky appeared her eyes were red and her cap was sliding off and when she caught sight of ermengarde she began to rub her face nervously with her apron dont mind me a bit becky cried ermengarde miss ermengarde has asked you to come in said sara because she is going to bring a box of good things up here to us beckys cap almost fell off entirely she broke in with such excitement to eat miss she said things thats good to eat yes answered sara and we are going to pretend a party and you shall have as much as you want to eat put in ermengarde ill go this minute she was in such haste that as she tiptoed out of the attic she dropped her red shawl and did not know it had fallen no one saw it for a minute or so becky was too much overpowered by the good luck which had befallen her oh miss oh miss she gasped i know it was you that asked her to let me come itit makes me cry to think of it and she went to saras side and stood and looked at her worshippingly but in saras hungry eyes the old light had begun to glow and transform her world for her here in the atticwith the cold night outsidewith the afternoon in the sloppy streets barely passedwith the memory of the awful unfed look in the beggar childs eyes not yet fadedthis simple cheerful thing had happened like a thing of magic she caught her breath somehow something always happens she cried just before things get to the very worst it is as if the magic did it if i could only just remember that always the worst thing never quite comes she gave becky a little cheerful shake no no you mustnt cry she said we must make haste and set the table set the table miss said becky gazing round the room whatll we set it with sara looked round the attic too there doesnt seem to be much she answered half laughing that moment she saw something and pounced upon it it was ermengardes red shawl which lay upon the floor heres the shawl she cried i know she wont mind it it will make such a nice red tablecloth they pulled the old table forward and threw the shawl over it red is a wonderfully kind and comfortable color it began to make the room look furnished directly how nice a red rug would look on the floor exclaimed sara we must pretend there is one her eye swept the bare boards with a swift glance of admiration the rug was laid down already how soft and thick it is she said with the little laugh which becky knew the meaning of and she raised and set her foot down again delicately as if she felt something under it yes miss answered becky watching her with serious rapture she was always quite serious what next now said sara and she stood still and put her hands over her eyes something will come if i think and wait a littlein a soft expectant voice the magic will tell me one of her favorite fancies was that on the outside as she called it thoughts were waiting for people to call them becky had seen her stand and wait many a time before and knew that in a few seconds she would uncover an enlightened laughing face in a moment she did there she cried it has come i know now i must look among the things in the old trunk i had when i was a princess she flew to its corner and kneeled down it had not been put in the attic for her benefit but because there was no room for it elsewhere nothing had been left in it but rubbish but she knew she should find something the magic always arranged that kind of thing in one way or another in a corner lay a package so insignificantlooking that it had been overlooked and when she herself had found it she had kept it as a relic it contained a dozen small white handkerchiefs she seized them joyfully and ran to the table she began to arrange them upon the red tablecover patting and coaxing them into shape with the narrow lace edge curling outward her magic working its spells for her as she did it these are the plates she said they are golden plates these are the richly embroidered napkins nuns worked them in convents in spain did they miss breathed becky her very soul uplifted by the information you must pretend it said sara if you pretend it enough you will see them yes miss said becky and as sara returned to the trunk she devoted herself to the effort of accomplishing an end so much to be desired sara turned suddenly to find her standing by the table looking very queer indeed she had shut her eyes and was twisting her face in strange convulsive contortions her hands hanging stiffly clenched at her sides she looked as if she was trying to lift some enormous weight what is the matter becky sara cried what are you doing becky opened her eyes with a start i was apretendin miss she answered a little sheepishly i was tryin to see it like you do i almost did with a hopeful grin but it takes a lot o strenth perhaps it does if you are not used to it said sara with friendly sympathy but you dont know how easy it is when youve done it often i wouldnt try so hard just at first it will come to you after a while ill just tell you what things are look at these she held an old summer hat in her hand which she had fished out of the bottom of the trunk there was a wreath of flowers on it she pulled the wreath off these are garlands for the feast she said grandly they fill all the air with perfume theres a mug on the washstand becky ohand bring the soapdish for a centrepiece becky handed them to her reverently what are they now miss she inquired youd think they was made of crockerybut i know they aint this is a carven flagon said sara arranging tendrils of the wreath about the mug and thisbending tenderly over the soapdish and heaping it with rosesis purest alabaster encrusted with gems she touched the things gently a happy smile hovering about her lips which made her look as if she were a creature in a dream my aint it lovely whispered becky if we just had something for bonbondishes sara murmured theredarting to the trunk again i remember i saw something this minute it was only a bundle of wool wrapped in red and white tissuepaper but the tissuepaper was soon twisted into the form of little dishes and was combined with the remaining flowers to ornament the candlestick which was to light the feast only the magic could have made it more than an old table covered with a red shawl and set with rubbish from a longunopened trunk but sara drew back and gazed at it seeing wonders and becky after staring in delight spoke with bated breath this ere she suggested with a glance round the atticis it the bastille nowor has it turned into somethin different oh yes yes said sara quite different it is a banquethall my eye miss ejaculated becky a blanketall and she turned to view the splendors about her with awed bewilderment a banquethall said sara a vast chamber where feasts are given it has a vaulted roof and a minstrels gallery and a huge chimney filled with blazing oaken logs and it is brilliant with waxen tapers twinkling on every side my eye miss sara gasped becky again then the door opened and ermengarde came in rather staggering under the weight of her hamper she started back with an exclamation of joy to enter from the chill darkness outside and find ones self confronted by a totally unanticipated festal board draped with red adorned with white napery and wreathed with flowers was to feel that the preparations were brilliant indeed oh sara she cried out you are the cleverest girl i ever saw isnt it nice said sara they are things out of my old trunk i asked my magic and it told me to go and look but oh miss cried becky wait till shes told you what they are they aint justoh miss please tell her appealing to sara so sara told her and because her magic helped her she made her almost see it all the golden plattersthe vaulted spacesthe blazing logsthe twinkling waxen tapers as the things were taken out of the hamperthe frosted cakesthe fruitsthe bonbons and the winethe feast became a splendid thing its like a real party cried ermengarde its like a queens table sighed becky then ermengarde had a sudden brilliant thought ill tell you what sara she said pretend you are a princess now and this is a royal feast but its your feast said sara you must be the princess and we will be your maids of honor oh i cant said ermengarde im too fat and i dont know how you be her well if you want me to said sara but suddenly she thought of something else and ran to the rusty grate there is a lot of paper and rubbish stuffed in here she exclaimed if we light it there will be a bright blaze for a few minutes and we shall feel as if it was a real fire she struck a match and lighted it up with a great specious glow which illuminated the room by the time it stops blazing sara said we shall forget about its not being real she stood in the dancing glow and smiled doesnt it look real she said now we will begin the party she led the way to the table she waved her hand graciously to ermengarde and becky she was in the midst of her dream advance fair damsels she said in her happy dreamvoice and be seated at the banquettable my noble father the king who is absent on a long journey has commanded me to feast you she turned her head slightly toward the corner of the room what ho there minstrels strike up with your viols and bassoons princesses she explained rapidly to ermengarde and becky always had minstrels to play at their feasts pretend there is a minstrel gallery up there in the corner now we will begin they had barely had time to take their pieces of cake into their handsnot one of them had time to do more whenthey all three sprang to their feet and turned pale faces toward the doorlisteninglistening some one was coming up the stairs there was no mistake about it each of them recognized the angry mounting tread and knew that the end of all things had come itsthe missus choked becky and dropped her piece of cake upon the floor yes said sara her eyes growing shocked and large in her small white face miss minchin has found us out miss minchin struck the door open with a blow of her hand she was pale herself but it was with rage she looked from the frightened faces to the banquettable and from the banquettable to the last flicker of the burnt paper in the grate i have been suspecting something of this sort she exclaimed but i did not dream of such audacity lavinia was telling the truth so they knew that it was lavinia who had somehow guessed their secret and had betrayed them miss minchin strode over to becky and boxed her ears for a second time you impudent creature she said you leave the house in the morning sara stood quite still her eyes growing larger her face paler ermengarde burst into tears oh dont send her away she sobbed my aunt sent me the hamper wereonlyhaving a party so i see said miss minchin witheringly with the princess sara at the head of the table she turned fiercely on sara it is your doing i know she cried ermengarde would never have thought of such a thing you decorated the table i supposewith this rubbish she stamped her foot at becky go to your attic she commanded and becky stole away her face hidden in her apron her shoulders shaking then it was saras turn again i will attend to you tomorrow you shall have neither breakfast dinner nor supper i have not had either dinner or supper today miss minchin said sara rather faintly then all the better you will have something to remember dont stand there put those things into the hamper again she began to sweep them off the table into the hamper herself and caught sight of ermengardes new books and youto ermengardehave brought your beautiful new books into this dirty attic take them up and go back to bed you will stay there all day tomorrow and i shall write to your papa what would he say if he knew where you are tonight something she saw in saras grave fixed gaze at this moment made her turn on her fiercely what are you thinking of she demanded why do you look at me like that i was wondering answered sara as she had answered that notable day in the schoolroom what were you wondering it was very like the scene in the schoolroom there was no pertness in saras manner it was only sad and quiet i was wondering she said in a low voice what my papa would say if he knew where i am tonight miss minchin was infuriated just as she had been before and her anger expressed itself as before in an intemperate fashion she flew at her and shook her you insolent unmanageable child she cried how dare you how dare you she picked up the books swept the rest of the feast back into the hamper in a jumbled heap thrust it into ermengardes arms and pushed her before her toward the door i will leave you to wonder she said go to bed this instant and she shut the door behind herself and poor stumbling ermengarde and left sara standing quite alone the dream was quite at an end the last spark had died out of the paper in the grate and left only black tinder the table was left bare the golden plates and richly embroidered napkins and the garlands were transformed again into old handkerchiefs scraps of red and white paper and discarded artificial flowers all scattered on the floor the minstrels in the minstrel gallery had stolen away and the viols and bassoons were still emily was sitting with her back against the wall staring very hard sara saw her and went and picked her up with trembling hands there isnt any banquet left emily she said and there isnt any princess there is nothing left but the prisoners in the bastille and she sat down and hid her face what would have happened if she had not hidden it just then and if she had chanced to look up at the skylight at the wrong moment i do not knowperhaps the end of this chapter might have been quite differentbecause if she had glanced at the skylight she would certainly have been startled by what she would have seen she would have seen exactly the same face pressed against the glass and peering in at her as it had peered in earlier in the evening when she had been talking to ermengarde but she did not look up she sat with her little black head in her arms for some time she always sat like that when she was trying to bear something in silence then she got up and went slowly to the bed i cant pretend anything elsewhile i am awake she said there wouldnt be any use in trying if i go to sleep perhaps a dream will come and pretend for me she suddenly felt so tiredperhaps through want of foodthat she sat down on the edge of the bed quite weakly suppose there was a bright fire in the grate with lots of little dancing flames she murmured suppose there was a comfortable chair before itand suppose there was a small table near with a little hothot supper on it and supposeas she drew the thin coverings over hersuppose this was a beautiful soft bed with fleecy blankets and large downy pillows supposesuppose and her very weariness was good to her for her eyes closed and she fell fast asleep she did not know how long she slept but she had been tired enough to sleep deeply and profoundlytoo deeply and soundly to be disturbed by anything even by the squeaks and scamperings of melchisedecs entire family if all his sons and daughters had chosen to come out of their hole to fight and tumble and play when she awakened it was rather suddenly and she did not know that any particular thing had called her out of her sleep the truth was however that it was a sound which had called her backa real soundthe click of the skylight as it fell in closing after a lithe white figure which slipped through it and crouched down close by upon the slates of the roofjust near enough to see what happened in the attic but not near enough to be seen at first she did not open her eyes she felt too sleepy andcuriously enoughtoo warm and comfortable she was so warm and comfortable indeed that she did not believe she was really awake she never was as warm and cosey as this except in some lovely vision what a nice dream she murmured i feel quite warm idontwanttowakeup of course it was a dream she felt as if warm delightful bedclothes were heaped upon her she could actually feel blankets and when she put out her hand it touched something exactly like a satincovered eiderdown quilt she must not awaken from this delightshe must be quite still and make it last but she could noteven though she kept her eyes closed tightly she could not something was forcing her to awakensomething in the room it was a sense of light and a soundthe sound of a crackling roaring little fire oh i am awakening she said mournfully i cant help iti cant her eyes opened in spite of herself and then she actually smiledfor what she saw she had never seen in the attic before and knew she never should see oh i havent awakened she whispered daring to rise on her elbow and look all about her i am dreaming yet she knew it must be a dream for if she were awake such things could notcould not be do you wonder that she felt sure she had not come back to earth this is what she saw in the grate there was a glowing blazing fire on the hob was a little brass kettle hissing and boiling spread upon the floor was a thick warm crimson rug before the fire a foldingchair unfolded and with cushions on it by the chair a small foldingtable unfolded covered with a white cloth and upon it spread small covered dishes a cup a saucer a teapot on the bed were new warm coverings and a satincovered down quilt at the foot a curious wadded silk robe a pair of quilted slippers and some books the room of her dream seemed changed into fairylandand it was flooded with warm light for a bright lamp stood on the table covered with a rosy shade she sat up resting on her elbow and her breathing came short and fast it does notmelt away she panted oh i never had such a dream before she scarcely dared to stir but at last she pushed the bedclothes aside and put her feet on the floor with a rapturous smile i am dreamingi am getting out of bed she heard her own voice say and then as she stood up in the midst of it all turning slowly from side to sidei am dreaming it staysreal im dreaming it feels real its bewitchedor im bewitched i only think i see it all her words began to hurry themselves if i can only keep on thinking it she cried i dont care i dont care she stood panting a moment longer and then cried out again oh it isnt true she said it cant be true but oh how true it seems the blazing fire drew her to it and she knelt down and held out her hands close to itso close that the heat made her start back a fire i only dreamed wouldnt be hot she cried she sprang up touched the table the dishes the rug she went to the bed and touched the blankets she took up the soft wadded dressinggown and suddenly clutched it to her breast and held it to her cheek its warm its soft she almost sobbed its real it must be she threw it over her shoulders and put her feet into the slippers they are real too its all real she cried i am noti am not dreaming she almost staggered to the books and opened the one which lay upon the top something was written on the flyleafjust a few words and they were these to the little girl in the attic from a friend when she saw thatwasnt it a strange thing for her to doshe put her face down upon the page and burst into tears i dont know who it is she said but somebody cares for me a little i have a friend she took her candle and stole out of her own room and into beckys and stood by her bedside becky becky she whispered as loudly as she dared wake up when becky wakened and she sat upright staring aghast her face still smudged with traces of tears beside her stood a little figure in a luxurious wadded robe of crimson silk the face she saw was a shining wonderful thing the princess saraas she remembered herstood at her very bedside holding a candle in her hand come she said oh becky come becky was too frightened to speak she simply got up and followed her with her mouth and eyes open and without a word and when they crossed the threshold sara shut the door gently and drew her into the warm glowing midst of things which made her brain reel and her hungry senses faint its true its true she cried ive touched them all they are as real as we are the magic has come and done it becky while we were asleepthe magic that wont let those worst things ever quite happen chapter xvi the visitor imagine if you can what the rest of the evening was like how they crouched by the fire which blazed and leaped and made so much of itself in the little grate how they removed the covers of the dishes and found rich hot savory soup which was a meal in itself and sandwiches and toast and muffins enough for both of them the mug from the washstand was used as beckys teacup and the tea was so delicious that it was not necessary to pretend that it was anything else but tea they were warm and fullfed and happy and it was just like sara that having found her strange good fortune real she should give herself up to the enjoyment of it to the utmost she had lived such a life of imaginings that she was quite equal to accepting any wonderful thing that happened and almost to cease in a short time to find it bewildering i dont know any one in the world who could have done it she said but there has been some one and here we are sitting by their fireandandits true and whoever it iswherever they arei have a friend beckysome one is my friend it cannot be denied that as they sat before the blazing fire and ate the nourishing comfortable food they felt a kind of rapturous awe and looked into each others eyes with something like doubt do you think becky faltered once in a whisperdo you think it could melt away miss hadnt we better be quick and she hastily crammed her sandwich into her mouth if it was only a dream kitchen manners would be overlooked no it wont melt away said sara i am eating this muffin and i can taste it you never really eat things in dreams you only think you are going to eat them besides i keep giving myself pinches and i touched a hot piece of coal just now on purpose the sleepy comfort which at length almost overpowered them was a heavenly thing it was the drowsiness of happy wellfed childhood and they sat in the fireglow and luxuriated in it until sara found herself turning to look at her transformed bed there were even blankets enough to share with becky the narrow couch in the next attic was more comfortable that night than its occupant had ever dreamed that it could be as she went out of the room becky turned upon the threshold and looked about her with devouring eyes if it aint here in the mornin miss she said its been here tonight anyways an i shant never forget it she looked at each particular thing as if to commit it to memory the fire was there pointing with her finger an the table was before it an the lamp was there an the light looked rosy red an there was a satin cover on your bed an a warm rug on the floor an everythin looked beautiful anshe paused a second and laid her hand on her stomach tenderlythere was soup an sandwiches an muffinsthere was and with this conviction a reality at least she went away through the mysterious agency which works in schools and among servants it was quite well known in the morning that sara crewe was in horrible disgrace that ermengarde was under punishment and that becky would have been packed out of the house before breakfast but that a scullerymaid could not be dispensed with at once the servants knew that she was allowed to stay because miss minchin could not easily find another creature helpless and humble enough to work like a bounden slave for so few shillings a week the elder girls in the schoolroom knew that if miss minchin did not send sara away it was for practical reasons of her own shes growing so fast and learning such a lot somehow said jessie to lavinia that she will be given classes soon and miss minchin knows she will have to work for nothing it was rather nasty of you lavvy to tell about her having fun in the garret how did you find it out i got it out of lottie shes such a baby she didnt know she was telling me there was nothing nasty at all in speaking to miss minchin i felt it my dutypriggishly she was being deceitful and its ridiculous that she should look so grand and be made so much of in her rags and tatters what were they doing when miss minchin caught them pretending some silly thing ermengarde had taken up her hamper to share with sara and becky she never invites us to share things not that i care but its rather vulgar of her to share with servantgirls in attics i wonder miss minchin didnt turn sara outeven if she does want her for a teacher if she was turned out where would she go inquired jessie a trifle anxiously how do i know snapped lavinia shell look rather queer when she comes into the schoolroom this morning i should thinkafter whats happened she had no dinner yesterday and shes not to have any today jessie was not as illnatured as she was silly she picked up her book with a little jerk well i think its horrid she said theyve no right to starve her to death when sara went into the kitchen that morning the cook looked askance at her and so did the housemaids but she passed them hurriedly she had in fact overslept herself a little and as becky had done the same neither had had time to see the other and each had come downstairs in haste sara went into the scullery becky was violently scrubbing a kettle and was actually gurgling a little song in her throat she looked up with a wildly elated face it was there when i wakened missthe blanket she whispered excitedly it was as real as it was last night so was mine said sara it is all there nowall of it while i was dressing i ate some of the cold things we left oh laws oh laws becky uttered the exclamation in a sort of rapturous groan and ducked her head over her kettle just in time as the cook came in from the kitchen miss minchin had expected to see in sara when she appeared in the schoolroom very much what lavinia had expected to see sara had always been an annoying puzzle to her because severity never made her cry or look frightened when she was scolded she stood still and listened politely with a grave face when she was punished she performed her extra tasks or went without her meals making no complaint or outward sign of rebellion the very fact that she never made an impudent answer seemed to miss minchin a kind of impudence in itself but after yesterdays deprivation of meals the violent scene of last night the prospect of hunger today she must surely have broken down it would be strange indeed if she did not come downstairs with pale cheeks and red eyes and an unhappy humbled face miss minchin saw her for the first time when she entered the schoolroom to hear the little french class its lessons and superintend its exercises and she came in with a springing step color in her cheeks and a smile hovering about the corners of her mouth it was the most astonishing thing miss minchin had ever known it gave her quite a shock what was the child made of what could such a thing mean she called her at once to her desk you do not look as if you realize that you are in disgrace she said are you absolutely hardened the truth is that when one is still a childor even if one is grown upand has been well fed and has slept long and softly and warm when one has gone to sleep in the midst of a fairy story and has wakened to find it real one cannot be unhappy or even look as if one were and one could not if one tried keep a glow of joy out of ones eyes miss minchin was almost struck dumb by the look of saras eyes when she lifted them and made her perfectly respectful answer i beg your pardon miss minchin she said i know that i am in disgrace be good enough not to forget it and look as if you had come into a fortune it is an impertinence and remember you are to have no food today yes miss minchin sara answered but as she turned away her heart leaped with the memory of what yesterday had been if the magic had not saved me just in time she thought how horrible it would have been she cant be very hungry whispered lavinia just look at her perhaps she is pretending she has had a good breakfastwith a spiteful laugh shes different from other people said jessie watching sara with her class sometimes im a bit frightened of her ridiculous thing ejaculated lavinia all through the day the light was in saras face and the color in her cheek the servants cast puzzled glances at her and whispered to each other and miss amelias small blue eyes wore an expression of bewilderment what such an audacious look of wellbeing under august displeasure could mean she could not understand it was however just like saras singular obstinate way she was probably determined to brave the matter out one thing sara had resolved upon as she thought things over the wonders which had happened must be kept a secret if such a thing were possible if miss minchin should choose to mount to the attic again of course all would be discovered but it did not seem likely that she would do so for some time at least unless she was led by suspicion ermengarde and lottie would be watched with such strictness that they would not dare to steal out of their beds again ermengarde could be told the story and trusted to keep it secret if lottie made any discoveries she could be bound to secrecy also perhaps the magic itself would help to hide its own marvels but whatever happens sara kept saying to herself all daywhatever happens somewhere in the world there is a heavenly kind person who is my friendmy friend if i never know who it isif i never can even thank himi shall never feel quite so lonely oh the magic was good to me if it was possible for weather to be worse than it had been the day before it was worse this daywetter muddier colder there were more errands to be done the cook was more irritable and knowing that sara was in disgrace she was more savage but what does anything matter when ones magic has just proved itself ones friend saras supper of the night before had given her strength she knew that she should sleep well and warmly and even though she had naturally begun to be hungry again before evening she felt that she could bear it until breakfasttime on the following day when her meals would surely be given to her again it was quite late when she was at last allowed to go upstairs she had been told to go into the schoolroom and study until ten oclock and she had become interested in her work and remained over her books later when she reached the top flight of stairs and stood before the attic door it must be confessed that her heart beat rather fast of course it might all have been taken away she whispered trying to be brave it might only have been lent to me for just that one awful night but it was lent to mei had it it was real she pushed the door open and went in once inside she gasped slightly shut the door and stood with her back against it looking from side to side the magic had been there again it actually had and it had done even more than before the fire was blazing in lovely leaping flames more merrily than ever a number of new things had been brought into the attic which so altered the look of it that if she had not been past doubting she would have rubbed her eyes upon the low table another supper stoodthis time with cups and plates for becky as well as herself a piece of bright heavy strange embroidery covered the battered mantel and on it some ornaments had been placed all the bare ugly things which could be covered with draperies had been concealed and made to look quite pretty some odd materials of rich colors had been fastened against the wall with fine sharp tacksso sharp that they could be pressed into the wood and plaster without hammering some brilliant fans were pinned up and there were several large cushions big and substantial enough to use as seats a wooden box was covered with a rug and some cushions lay on it so that it wore quite the air of a sofa sara slowly moved away from the door and simply sat down and looked and looked again it is exactly like something fairy come true she said there isnt the least difference i feel as if i might wish for anythingdiamonds or bags of goldand they would appear that wouldnt be any stranger than this is this my garret am i the same cold ragged damp sara and to think i used to pretend and pretend and wish there were fairies the one thing i always wanted was to see a fairy story come true i am living in a fairy story i feel as if i might be a fairy myself and able to turn things into anything else she rose and knocked upon the wall for the prisoner in the next cell and the prisoner came when she entered she almost dropped in a heap upon the floor for a few seconds she quite lost her breath oh laws she gasped oh laws miss just as she had done in the scullery you see said sara on this night becky sat on a cushion upon the hearthrug and had a cup and saucer of her own when sara went to bed she found that she had a new thick mattress and big downy pillows her old mattress and pillow had been removed to beckys bedstead and consequently with these additions becky had been supplied with unheardof comfort where does it all come from becky broke forth once laws who does it miss dont let us even ask said sara if it were not that i want to say oh thank you i would rather not know it makes it more beautiful from that time life became more wonderful day by day the fairy story continued almost every day something new was done some new comfort or ornament appeared each time sara opened the door at night until in a short time the attic was a beautiful little room full of all sorts of odd and luxurious things the ugly walls were gradually entirely covered with pictures and draperies ingenious pieces of folding furniture appeared a bookshelf was hung up and filled with books new comforts and conveniences appeared one by one until there seemed nothing left to be desired when sara went downstairs in the morning the remains of the supper were on the table and when she returned to the attic in the evening the magician had removed them and left another nice little meal miss minchin was as harsh and insulting as ever miss amelia as peevish and the servants were as vulgar and rude sara was sent on errands in all weathers and scolded and driven hither and thither she was scarcely allowed to speak to ermengarde and lottie lavinia sneered at the increasing shabbiness of her clothes and the other girls stared curiously at her when she appeared in the schoolroom but what did it all matter while she was living in this wonderful mysterious story it was more romantic and delightful than anything she had ever invented to comfort her starved young soul and save herself from despair sometimes when she was scolded she could scarcely keep from smiling if you only knew she was saying to herself if you only knew the comfort and happiness she enjoyed were making her stronger and she had them always to look forward to if she came home from her errands wet and tired and hungry she knew she would soon be warm and well fed after she had climbed the stairs during the hardest day she could occupy herself blissfully by thinking of what she should see when she opened the attic door and wondering what new delight had been prepared for her in a very short time she began to look less thin color came into her cheeks and her eyes did not seem so much too big for her face sara crewe looks wonderfully well miss minchin remarked disapprovingly to her sister yes answered poor silly miss amelia she is absolutely fattening she was beginning to look like a little starved crow starved exclaimed miss minchin angrily there was no reason why she should look starved she always had plenty to eat ofof course agreed miss amelia humbly alarmed to find that she had as usual said the wrong thing there is something very disagreeable in seeing that sort of thing in a child of her age said miss minchin with haughty vagueness whatsort of thing miss amelia ventured it might almost be called defiance answered miss minchin feeling annoyed because she knew the thing she resented was nothing like defiance and she did not know what other unpleasant term to use the spirit and will of any other child would have been entirely humbled and broken byby the changes she has had to submit to but upon my word she seems as little subdued as ifas if she were a princess do you remember put in the unwise miss amelia what she said to you that day in the schoolroom about what you would do if you found out that she was no i dont said miss minchin dont talk nonsense but she remembered very clearly indeed very naturally even becky was beginning to look plumper and less frightened she could not help it she had her share in the secret fairy story too she had two mattresses two pillows plenty of bedcovering and every night a hot supper and a seat on the cushions by the fire the bastille had melted away the prisoners no longer existed two comforted children sat in the midst of delights sometimes sara read aloud from her books sometimes she learned her own lessons sometimes she sat and looked into the fire and tried to imagine who her friend could be and wished she could say to him some of the things in her heart then it came about that another wonderful thing happened a man came to the door and left several parcels all were addressed in large letters to the little girl in the righthand attic sara herself was sent to open the door and took them in she laid the two largest parcels on the hall table and was looking at the address when miss minchin came down the stairs and saw her take the things to the young lady to whom they belong she said severely dont stand there staring at them they belong to me answered sara quietly to you exclaimed miss minchin what do you mean i dont know where they come from said sara but they are addressed to me i sleep in the righthand attic becky has the other one miss minchin came to her side and looked at the parcels with an excited expression what is in them she demanded i dont know replied sara open them she ordered sara did as she was told when the packages were unfolded miss minchins countenance wore suddenly a singular expression what she saw was pretty and comfortable clothingclothing of different kinds shoes stockings and gloves and a warm and beautiful coat there were even a nice hat and an umbrella they were all good and expensive things and on the pocket of the coat was pinned a paper on which were written these words to be worn every daywill be replaced by others when necessary miss minchin was quite agitated this was an incident which suggested strange things to her sordid mind could it be that she had made a mistake after all and that the neglected child had some powerful though eccentric friend in the backgroundperhaps some previously unknown relation who had suddenly traced her whereabouts and chose to provide for her in this mysterious and fantastic way relations were sometimes very oddparticularly rich old bachelor uncles who did not care for having children near them a man of that sort might prefer to overlook his young relations welfare at a distance such a person however would be sure to be crotchety and hottempered enough to be easily offended it would not be very pleasant if there were such a one and he should learn all the truth about the thin shabby clothes the scant food and the hard work she felt very queer indeed and very uncertain and she gave a side glance at sara well she said in a voice such as she had never used since the little girl lost her father some one is very kind to you as the things have been sent and you are to have new ones when they are worn out you may as well go and put them on and look respectable after you are dressed you may come downstairs and learn your lessons in the schoolroom you need not go out on any more errands today about half an hour afterward when the schoolroom door opened and sara walked in the entire seminary was struck dumb with amazement my word ejaculated jessie jogging lavinias elbow look at the princess sara everybody was looking and when lavinia looked she turned quite red it was the princess sara indeed at least since the days when she had been a princess sara had never looked as she did now she did not seem the sara they had seen come down the back stairs a few hours ago she was dressed in the kind of frock lavinia had been used to envying her the possession of it was deep and warm in color and beautifully made her slender feet looked as they had done when jessie had admired them and the hair whose heavy locks had made her look rather like a shetland pony when it fell loose about her small odd face was tied back with a ribbon perhaps some one has left her a fortune jessie whispered i always thought something would happen to her she is so queer perhaps the diamondmines have suddenly appeared again said lavinia scathingly dont please her by staring at her in that way you silly thing sara broke in miss minchins deep voice come and sit here and while the whole schoolroom stared and pushed with elbows and scarcely made any effort to conceal its excited curiosity sara went to her old seat of honor and bent her head over her books that night when she went to her room after she and becky had eaten their supper she sat and looked at the fire seriously for a long time are you making something up in your head miss becky inquired with respectful softness when sara sat in silence and looked into the coals with dreaming eyes it generally meant that she was making a new story but this time she was not and she shook her head no she answered i am wondering what i ought to do becky staredstill respectfully she was filled with something approaching reverence for everything sara did and said i cant help thinking about my friend sara explained if he wants to keep himself a secret it would be rude to try and find out who he is but i do so want him to know how thankful i am to himand how happy he has made me any one who is kind wants to know when people have been made happy they care for that more than for being thanked i wishi do wish she stopped short because her eyes at that instant fell upon something standing on a table in a corner it was something she had found in the room when she came up to it only two days before it was a little writingcase fitted with paper and envelopes and pens and ink oh she exclaimed why did i not think of that before she rose and went to the corner and brought the case back to the fire i can write to him she said joyfully and leave it on the table then perhaps the person who takes the things away will take it too i wont ask him anything he wont mind my thanking him i feel sure so she wrote a note this is what she said i hope you will not think it is impolite that i should write this note to you when you wish to keep yourself a secret please believe i do not mean to be impolite or try to find out anything at all only i want to thank you for being so kind to meso heavenly kindand making everything like a fairy story i am so grateful to you and i am so happyand so is becky becky feels just as thankful as i doit is all just as beautiful and wonderful to her as it is to me we used to be so lonely and cold and hungry and nowoh just think what you have done for us please let me say just these words it seems as if i ought to say them thank youthank youthank you the little girl in the attic the next morning she left this on the little table and in the evening it had been taken away with the other things so she knew the magician had received it and she was happier for the thought she was reading one of her new books to becky just before they went to their respective beds when her attention was attracted by a sound at the skylight when she looked up from her page she saw that becky had heard the sound also as she had turned her head to look and was listening rather nervously somethings there miss she whispered yes said sara slowly it soundsrather like a cattrying to get in she left her chair and went to the skylight it was a queer little sound she heardlike a soft scratching she suddenly remembered something and laughed she remembered a quaint little intruder who had made his way into the attic once before she had seen him that very afternoon sitting disconsolately on a table before a window in the indian gentlemans house suppose she whispered in pleased excitementjust suppose it was the monkey who had got away again oh i wish it was she climbed on a chair very cautiously raised the skylight and peeped out it had been snowing all day and on the snow quite near her crouched a tiny shivering figure whose small black face wrinkled itself piteously at sight of her it is the monkey she cried out he has crept out of the lascars attic and he saw the light becky ran to her side are you going to let him in miss she said yes sara answered joyfully its too cold for monkeys to be out theyre delicate ill coax him in she put a hand out delicately speaking in a coaxing voiceas she spoke to the sparrows and to melchisedecas if she were some friendly little animal herself and lovingly understood their timid wildness come along monkey darling she said i wont hurt you he knew she would not hurt him he knew it before she laid her soft caressing little paw on him and drew him toward her he had felt human love in the slim brown hands of ram dass and he felt it in hers he let her lift him through the skylight and when he found himself in her arms he cuddled up to her breast and took friendly hold of a piece of her hair looking up into her face nice monkey nice monkey she crooned kissing his funny head oh i do love little animal things illustration she sat down and held him on her knee he was evidently glad to get to the fire and when she sat down and held him on her knee he looked from her to becky with mingled interest and appreciation he is plainlooking miss aint he said becky he looks like a very ugly baby laughed sara i beg your pardon monkey but im glad you are not a baby your mother couldnt be proud of you and no one would dare to say you looked like any of your relations oh i do like you she leaned back in her chair and reflected perhaps hes sorry hes so ugly she said and its always on his mind i wonder if he has a mind monkey my love have you a mind but the monkey only put up a tiny paw and scratched his head what shall you do with him becky asked i shall let him sleep with me tonight and then take him back to the indian gentleman tomorrow i am sorry to take you back monkey but you must go you ought to be fondest of your own family and im not a real relation and when she went to bed she made him a nest at her feet and he curled up and slept there as if he were a baby and much pleased with his quarters chapter xvii it is the child the next afternoon three members of the large family sat in the indian gentlemans library doing their best to cheer him up they had been allowed to come in to perform this office because he had specially invited them he had been living in a state of suspense for some time and today he was waiting for a certain event very anxiously this event was the return of mr carmichael from moscow his stay there had been prolonged from week to week on his first arrival there he had not been able satisfactorily to trace the family he had gone in search of when he felt at last sure that he had found them and had gone to their house he had been told that they were absent on a journey his efforts to reach them had been unavailing so he had decided to remain in moscow until their return mr carrisford sat in his recliningchair and janet sat on the floor beside him he was very fond of janet nora had found a footstool and donald was astride the tigers head which ornamented the rug made of the animals skin it must be owned that he was riding it rather violently dont chirrup so loud donald janet said when you come to cheer an ill person up you dont cheer him up at the top of your voice perhaps cheering up is too loud mr carrisford turning to the indian gentleman but he only patted her shoulder no it isnt he answered and it keeps me from thinking too much im going to be quiet donald shouted well all be as quiet as mice mice dont make a noise like that said janet donald made a bridle of his handkerchief and bounced up and down on the tigers head a whole lot of mice might he said cheerfully a thousand mice might i dont believe fifty thousand mice would said janet severely and we have to be as quiet as one mouse mr carrisford laughed and patted her shoulder again papa wont be very long now she said may we talk about the lost little girl i dont think i could talk much about anything else just now the indian gentleman answered knitting his forehead with a tired look we like her so much said nora we call her the little unfairy princess why the indian gentleman inquired because the fancies of the large family always made him forget things a little it was janet who answered it is because though she is not exactly a fairy she will be so rich when she is found that she will be like a princess in a fairy tale we called her the fairy princess at first but it didnt quite suit is it true said nora that her papa gave all his money to a friend to put in a mine that had diamonds in it and then the friend thought he had lost it all and ran away because he felt as if he was a robber but he wasnt really you know put in janet hastily the indian gentleman took hold of her hand quickly no he wasnt really he said i am sorry for the friend janet said i cant help it he didnt mean to do it and it would break his heart i am sure it would break his heart you are an understanding little woman janet the indian gentleman said and he held her hand close did you tell mr carrisford donald shouted again about the littlegirlwhoisntabeggar did you tell him she has new nice clothes praps shes been found by somebody when she was lost theres a cab exclaimed janet its stopping before the door it is papa they all ran to the windows to look out yes its papa donald proclaimed but there is no little girl all three of them incontinently fled from the room and tumbled into the hall it was in this way they always welcomed their father they were to be heard jumping up and down clapping their hands and being caught up and kissed mr carrisford made an effort to rise and sank back again into his chair it is no use he said what a wreck i am mr carmichaels voice approached the door no children he was saying you may come in after i have talked to mr carrisford go and play with ram dass then the door opened and he came in he looked rosier than ever and brought an atmosphere of freshness and health with him but his eyes were disappointed and anxious as they met the invalids look of eager question even as they grasped each others hands what news mr carrisford asked the child the russian people adopted she is not the child we are looking for was mr carmichaels answer she is much younger than captain crewes little girl her name is emily carew i have seen and talked to her the russians were able to give me every detail how wearied and miserable the indian gentleman looked his hand dropped from mr carmichaels then the search has to be begun over again he said that is all please sit down mr carmichael took a seat somehow he had gradually grown fond of this unhappy man he was himself so well and happy and so surrounded by cheerfulness and love that desolation and broken health seemed pitifully unbearable things if there had been the sound of just one gay little highpitched voice in the house it would have been so much less forlorn and that a man should be compelled to carry about in his breast the thought that he had seemed to wrong and desert a child was not a thing one could face come come he said in his cheery voice well find her yet we must begin at once no time must be lost mr carrisford fretted have you any new suggestion to makeany whatsoever mr carmichael felt rather restless and he rose and began to pace the room with a thoughtful though uncertain face well perhaps he said i dont know what it may be worth the fact is an idea occurred to me as i was thinking the thing over in the train on the journey from dover what was it if she is alive she is somewhere yes she is somewhere we have searched the schools in paris let us give up paris and begin in london that was my ideato search london there are schools enough in london said mr carrisford then he slightly started roused by a recollection by the way there is one next door then we will begin there we cannot begin nearer than next door no said carrisford there is a child there who interests me but she is not a pupil and she is a little dark forlorn creature as unlike poor crewe as a child could be perhaps the magic was at work again at that very momentthe beautiful magic it really seemed as if it might be so what was it that brought ram dass into the roomeven as his master spokesalaaming respectfully but with a scarcely concealed touch of excitement in his dark flashing eyes sahib he said the child herself has comethe child the sahib felt pity for she brings back the monkey who had again run away to her attic under the roof i have asked that she remain it was my thought that it would please the sahib to see and speak with her who is she inquired mr carmichael god knows mr carrisford answered she is the child i spoke of a little drudge at the school he waved his hand to ram dass and addressed him yes i should like to see her go and bring her in then he turned to mr carmichael while you have been away he explained i have been desperate the days were so dark and long ram dass told me of this childs miseries and together we invented a romantic plan to help her i suppose it was a childish thing to do but it gave me something to plan and think of without the help of an agile softfooted oriental like ram dass however it could not have been done then sara came into the room she carried the monkey in her arms and he evidently did not intend to part from her if it could be helped he was clinging to her and chattering and the interesting excitement of finding herself in the indian gentlemans room had brought a flush to saras cheeks your monkey ran away again she said in her pretty voice he came to my garret window last night and i took him in because it was so cold i would have brought him back if it had not been so late i knew you were ill and might not like to be disturbed the indian gentlemans hollow eyes dwelt on her with curious interest that was very thoughtful of you he said sara looked toward ram dass who stood near the door shall i give him to the lascar she asked how do you know he is a lascar said the indian gentleman smiling a little oh i know lascars sara said handing over the reluctant monkey i was born in india the indian gentleman sat upright so suddenly and with such a change of expression that she was for a moment quite startled you were born in india he exclaimed were you come here and he held out his hand sara went to him and laid her hand in his as he seemed to want to take it she stood still and her greengray eyes met his wonderingly something seemed to be the matter with him you live next door he demanded yes i live at miss minchins seminary but you are not one of her pupils a strange little smile hovered about saras mouth she hesitated a moment i dont think i know exactly what i am she replied why not at first i was a pupil and a parlorboarder but now you were a pupil what are you now the queer little sad smile was on saras lips again i sleep in the attic next to the scullerymaid she said i run errands for the cooki do anything she tells me and i teach the little ones their lessons question her carmichael said mr carrisford sinking back as if he had lost his strength question her i cannot the big kind father of the large family knew how to question little girls sara realized how much practice he had had when he spoke to her in his nice encouraging voice what do you mean by at first my child he inquired when i was first taken there by my papa where is your papa he died said sara very quietly he lost all his money and there was none left for me there was no one to take care of me or to pay miss minchin carmichael the indian gentleman cried out loudly carmichael we must not frighten her mr carmichael said aside to him in a quick low voice and he added aloud to sara so you were sent up into the attic and made into a little drudge that was about it wasnt it there was no one to take care of me said sara there was no money i belong to nobody how did your father lose his money the indian gentleman broke in breathlessly he did not lose it himself sara answered wondering still more each moment he had a friend he was very fond ofhe was very fond of him it was his friend who took his money he trusted his friend too much the indian gentlemans breath came more quickly the friend might have meant to do no harm he said it might have happened through a mistake sara did not know how unrelenting her quiet young voice sounded as she answered if she had known she would surely have tried to soften it for the indian gentlemans sake the suffering was just as bad for my papa she said it killed him what was your fathers name the indian gentleman said tell me his name was ralph crewe sara answered feeling startled captain crewe he died in india the haggard face contracted and ram dass sprang to his masters side carmichael the invalid gasped it is the childthe child for a moment sara thought he was going to die ram dass poured out drops from a bottle and held them to his lips sara stood near trembling a little she looked in a bewildered way at mr carmichael what child am i she faltered he was your fathers friend mr carmichael answered her dont be frightened we have been looking for you for two years sara put her hand up to her forehead and her mouth trembled she spoke as if she were in a dream and i was at miss minchins all the while she half whispered just on the other side of the wall chapter xviii i tried not to be it was pretty comfortable mrs carmichael who explained everything she was sent for at once and came across the square to take sara into her warm arms and make clear to her all that had happened the excitement of the totally unexpected discovery had been temporarily almost overpowering to mr carrisford in his weak condition upon my word he said faintly to mr carmichael when it was suggested that the little girl should go into another room i feel as if i do not want to lose sight of her i will take care of her janet said and mamma will come in a few minutes and it was janet who led her away were so glad you are found she said you dont know how glad we are that you are found donald stood with his hands in his pockets and gazed at sara with reflecting and selfreproachful eyes if id just asked what your name was when i gave you my sixpence he said you would have told me it was sara crewe and then you would have been found in a minute then mrs carmichael came in she looked very much moved and suddenly took sara in her arms and kissed her you look bewildered poor child she said and it is not to be wondered at sara could only think of one thing was he she said with a glance toward the closed door of the librarywas he the wicked friend oh do tell me mrs carmichael was crying as she kissed her again she felt as if she ought to be kissed very often because she had not been kissed for so long he was not wicked my dear she answered he did not really lose your papas money he only thought he had lost it and because he loved him so much his grief made him so ill that for a time he was not in his right mind he almost died of brainfever and long before he began to recover your poor papa was dead and he did not know where to find me murmured sara and i was so near somehow she could not forget that she had been so near he believed you were in school in france mrs carmichael explained and he was continually misled by false clues he has looked for you everywhere when he saw you pass by looking so sad and neglected he did not dream that you were his friends poor child but because you were a little girl too he was sorry for you and wanted to make you happier and he told ram dass to climb into your attic window and try to make you comfortable sara gave a start of joy her whole look changed did ram dass bring the things she cried out did he tell ram dass to do it did he make the dream that came true yes my dearyes he is kind and good and he was sorry for you for little lost sara crewes sake the library door opened and mr carmichael appeared calling sara to him with a gesture mr carrisford is better already he said he wants you to come to him sara did not wait when the indian gentleman looked at her as she entered he saw that her face was all alight she went and stood before his chair with her hands clasped together against her breast you sent the things to me she said in a joyful emotional little voicethe beautiful beautiful things you sent them yes poor dear child i did he answered her he was weak and broken with long illness and trouble but he looked at her with the look she remembered in her fathers eyesthat look of loving her and wanting to take her in his arms it made her kneel down by him just as she used to kneel by her father when they were the dearest friends and lovers in the world then it is you who are my friend she said it is you who are my friend and she dropped her face on his thin hand and kissed it again and again the man will be himself again in three weeks mr carmichael said aside to his wife look at his face already in fact he did look changed here was the little missus and he had new things to think of and plan for already in the first place there was miss minchin she must be interviewed and told of the change which had taken place in the fortunes of her pupil sara was not to return to the seminary at all the indian gentleman was very determined upon that point she must remain where she was and mr carmichael should go and see miss minchin himself i am glad i need not go back said sara she will be very angry she does not like me though perhaps it is my fault because i do not like her but oddly enough miss minchin made it unnecessary for mr carmichael to go to her by actually coming in search of her pupil herself she had wanted sara for something and on inquiry had heard an astonishing thing one of the housemaids had seen her steal out of the area with something hidden under her cloak and had also seen her go up the steps of the next door and enter the house what does she mean cried miss minchin to miss amelia i dont know im sure sister answered miss amelia unless she has made friends with him because he has lived in india it would be just like her to thrust herself upon him and try to gain his sympathies in some such impertinent fashion said miss minchin she must have been in the house two hours i will not allow such presumption i shall go and inquire into the matter and apologize for her intrusion sara was sitting on a footstool close to mr carrisfords knee and listening to some of the many things he felt it necessary to try to explain to her when ram dass announced the visitors arrival sara rose involuntarily and became rather pale but mr carrisford saw that she stood quietly and showed none of the ordinary signs of child terror miss minchin entered the room with a sternly dignified manner she was correctly and well dressed and rigidly polite i am sorry to disturb mr carrisford she said but i have explanations to make i am miss minchin the proprietress of the young ladies seminary next door the indian gentleman looked at her for a moment in silent scrutiny he was a man who had naturally a rather hot temper and he did not wish it to get too much the better of him so you are miss minchin he said i am sir in that case the indian gentleman replied you have arrived at the right time my solicitor mr carmichael was just on the point of going to see you mr carmichael bowed slightly and miss minchin looked from him to mr carrisford in amazement your solicitor she said i do not understand i have come here as a matter of duty i have just discovered that you have been intruded upon through the forwardness of one of my pupilsa charity pupil i came to explain that she intruded without my knowledge she turned upon sara go home at once she commanded indignantly you shall be severely punished go home at once the indian gentleman drew sara to his side and patted her hand she is not going miss minchin felt rather as if she must be losing her senses not going she repeated no said mr carrisford she is not going homeif you give your house that name her home for the future will be with me miss minchin fell back in amazed indignation with you with you sir what does this mean kindly explain the matter carmichael said the indian gentleman and get it over as quickly as possible and he made sara sit down again and held her hands in hiswhich was another trick of her papas then mr carmichael explainedin the quiet leveltoned steady manner of a man who knew his subject and all its legal significance which was a thing miss minchin understood as a business woman and did not enjoy mr carrisford madam he said was an intimate friend of the late captain crewe he was his partner in certain large investments the fortune which captain crewe supposed he had lost has been recovered and is now in mr carrisfords hands the fortune cried miss minchin and she really lost color as she uttered the exclamation saras fortune it will be saras fortune replied mr carmichael rather coldly it is saras fortune now in fact certain events have increased it enormously the diamondmines have retrieved themselves the diamondmines miss minchin gasped out if this was true nothing so horrible she felt had ever happened to her since she was born the diamondmines mr carmichael repeated and he could not help adding with a rather sly unlawyerlike smile there are not many princesses miss minchin who are richer than your little charity pupil sara crewe will be mr carrisford has been searching for her for nearly two years he has found her at last and he will keep her after which he asked miss minchin to sit down while he explained matters to her fully and went into such detail as was necessary to make it quite clear to her that saras future was an assured one and that what had seemed to be lost was to be restored to her tenfold also that she had in mr carrisford a guardian as well as a friend miss minchin was not a clever woman and in her excitement she was silly enough to make one desperate effort to regain what she could not help seeing she had lost through her own worldly folly he found her under my care she protested i have done everything for her but for me she would have starved in the streets here the indian gentleman lost his temper as to starving in the streets he said she might have starved more comfortably there than in your attic captain crewe left her in my charge miss minchin argued she must return to it until she is of age she can be a parlorboarder again she must finish her education the law will interfere in my behalf come come miss minchin mr carmichael interposed the law will do nothing of the sort if sara herself wishes to return to you i dare say mr carrisford might not refuse to allow it but that rests with sara then said miss minchin i appeal to sara i have not spoiled you perhaps she said awkwardly to the little girl but you know that your papa was pleased with your progress andahemi have always been fond of you saras greengray eyes fixed themselves on her with the quiet clear look miss minchin particularly disliked have you miss minchin she said i did not know that miss minchin reddened and drew herself up you ought to have known it said she but children unfortunately never know what is best for them amelia and i always said you were the cleverest child in the school will you not do your duty to your poor papa and come home with me sara took a step toward her and stood still she was thinking of the day when she had been told that she belonged to nobody and was in danger of being turned into the street she was thinking of the cold hungry hours she had spent alone with emily and melchisedec in the attic she looked miss minchin steadily in the face you know why i will not go home with you miss minchin she said you know quite well a hot flush showed itself on miss minchins hard angry face you will never see your companions again she began i will see that ermengarde and lottie are kept away mr carmichael stopped her with polite firmness excuse me he said she will see any one she wishes to see the parents of miss crewes fellowpupils are not likely to refuse her invitations to visit her at her guardians house mr carrisford will attend to that it must be confessed that even miss minchin flinched this was worse than the eccentric bachelor uncle who might have a peppery temper and be easily offended at the treatment of his niece a woman of sordid mind could easily believe that most people would not refuse to allow their children to remain friends with a little heiress of diamondmines and if mr carrisford chose to tell certain of her patrons how unhappy sara crewe had been made many unpleasant things might happen you have not undertaken an easy charge she said to the indian gentleman as she turned to leave the room you will discover that very soon the child is neither truthful nor grateful i supposeto sarathat you feel now that you are a princess again sara looked down and flushed a little because she thought her pet fancy might not be easy for strangerseven nice onesto understand at first itried not to be anything else she answered in a low voiceeven when i was coldest and hungriesti tried not to be now it will not be necessary to try said miss minchin acidly as ram dass salaamed her out of the room she returned home and going to her sittingroom sent at once for miss amelia she sat closeted with her all the rest of the afternoon and it must be admitted that poor miss amelia passed through more than one bad quarter of an hour she shed a good many tears and mopped her eyes a good deal one of her unfortunate remarks almost caused her sister to snap her head entirely off but it resulted in an unusual manner im not as clever as you sister she said and i am always afraid to say things to you for fear of making you angry perhaps if i were not so timid it would be better for the school and for both of us i must say ive often thought it would have been better if you had been less severe on sara crewe and had seen that she was decently dressed and more comfortable i know she was worked too hard for a child of her age and i know she was only half fed how dare you say such a thing exclaimed miss minchin i dont know how i dare miss amelia answered with a kind of reckless courage but now ive begun i may as well finish whatever happens to me the child was a clever child and a good childand she would have paid you for any kindness you had shown her but you didnt show her any the fact was she was too clever for you and you always disliked her for that reason she used to see through us both amelia gasped her infuriated elder looking as if she would box her ears and knock her cap off as she had often done to becky but miss amelias disappointment had made her hysterical enough not to care what occurred next she did she did she cried she saw through us both she saw that you were a hardhearted worldly woman and that i was a weak fool and that we were both of us vulgar and mean enough to grovel on our knees before her money and behave ill to her because it was taken from herthough she behaved herself like a little princess even when she was a beggar she didshe didlike a little princess and her hysterics got the better of the poor woman and she began to laugh and cry both at once and rock herself backward and forward in such a way as made miss minchin stare aghast and now youve lost her she cried wildly and some other school will get her and her money and if she were like any other child shed tell how shes been treated and all our pupils would be taken away and we should be ruined and it serves us right but it serves you right more than it does me for you are a hard woman maria minchinyoure a hard selfish worldly woman and she was in danger of making so much noise with her hysterical chokes and gurgles that her sister was obliged to go to her and apply salts and sal volatile to quiet her instead of pouring forth her indignation at her audacity and from that time forward it may be mentioned the elder miss minchin actually began to stand a little in awe of a sister who while she looked so foolish was evidently not quite so foolish as she looked and might consequently break out and speak truths people did not want to hear that evening when the pupils were gathered together before the fire in the schoolroom as was their custom before going to bed ermengarde came in with a letter in her hand and a queer expression on her round face it was queer because while it was an expression of delighted excitement it was combined with such amazement as seemed to belong to a kind of shock just received what is the matter cried two or three voices at once is it anything to do with the row that has been going on said lavinia eagerly there has been such a row in miss minchins room miss amelia has had something like hysterics and has had to go to bed ermengarde answered them slowly as if she were half stunned i have just had this letter from sara she said holding it out to let them see what a long letter it was from sara every voice joined in that exclamation where is she almost shrieked jessie next door said ermengarde still slowly with the indian gentleman where where has she been sent away does miss minchin know was the row about that why did she write tell us tell us there was a perfect babel and lottie began to cry plaintively ermengarde answered them slowly as if she were half plunged out into what at the moment seemed the most important and selfexplaining thing there were diamondmines she said stoutly there were open mouths and open eyes confronted her they were real she hurried on it was all a mistake about them something happened for a time and mr carrisford thought they were ruined who is mr carrisford shouted jessie the indian gentleman and captain crewe thought so tooand he died and mr carrisford had brainfever and ran away and he almost died and he did not know where sara was and it turned out that there were millions and millions of diamonds in the mines and half of them belong to sara and they belonged to her when she was living in the attic with no one but melchisedec for a friend and the cook ordering her about and mr carrisford found her this afternoon and he has got her in his homeand she will never come backand she will be more a princess than she ever wasa hundred and fifty thousand times more and i am going to see her tomorrow afternoon there even miss minchin herself could scarcely have controlled the uproar after this and though she heard the noise she did not try she was not in the mood to face anything more than she was facing in her room while miss amelia was weeping in bed she knew that the news had penetrated the walls in some mysterious manner and that every servant and every child would go to bed talking about it so until almost midnight the entire seminary realizing somehow that all rules were laid aside crowded round ermengarde in the schoolroom and heard read and reread the letter containing a story which was quite as wonderful as any sara herself had ever invented and which had the amazing charm of having happened to sara herself and the mystic indian gentleman in the very next house becky who had heard it also managed to creep upstairs earlier than usual she wanted to get away from people and go and look at the little magic room once more she did not know what would happen to it it was not likely that it would be left to miss minchin it would be taken away and the attic would be bare and empty again glad as she was for saras sake she went up the last flight of stairs with a lump in her throat and tears blurring her sight there would be no fire tonight and no rosy lamp no supper and no princess sitting in the glow reading or telling storiesno princess she choked down a sob as she pushed the attic door open and then she broke into a low cry the lamp was flushing the room the fire was blazing the supper was waiting and ram dass was standing smiling into her startled face missee sahib remembered he said she told the sahib all she wished you to know the good fortune which has befallen her behold a letter on the tray she has written she did not wish that you should go to sleep unhappy the sahib commands you to come to him tomorrow you are to be the attendant of missee sahib tonight i take these things back over the roof and having said this with a beaming face he made a little salaam and slipped through the skylight with an agile silentness of movement which showed becky how easily he had done it before chapter xix anne never had such joy reigned in the nursery of the large family never had they dreamed of such delights as resulted from an intimate acquaintance with the littlegirlwhowasnotabeggar the mere fact of her sufferings and adventures made her a priceless possession everybody wanted to be told over and over again the things which had happened to her when one was sitting by a warm fire in a big glowing room it was quite delightful to hear how cold it could be in an attic it must be admitted that the attic was rather delighted in and that its coldness and bareness quite sank into insignificance when melchisedec was remembered and one heard about the sparrows and things one could see if one climbed on the table and stuck ones head and shoulders out of the skylight of course the thing loved best was the story of the banquet and the dream which was true sara told it for the first time the day after she had been found several members of the large family came to take tea with her and as they sat or curled up on the hearthrug she told the story in her own way and the indian gentleman listened and watched her when she had finished she looked up at him and put her hand on his knee that is my part she said now wont you tell your part of it uncle tom he had asked her to call him always uncle tom i dont know your part yet and it must be beautiful so he told them how when he sat alone ill and dull and irritable ram dass had tried to distract him by describing the passers by and there was one child who passed oftener than any one else he had begun to be interested in herpartly perhaps because he was thinking a great deal of a little girl and partly because ram dass had been able to relate the incident of his visit to the attic in chase of the monkey he had described its cheerless look and the bearing of the child who seemed as if she was not of the class of those who were treated as drudges and servants bit by bit ram dass had made discoveries concerning the wretchedness of her life he had found out how easy a matter it was to climb across the few yards of roof to the skylight and this fact had been the beginning of all that followed sahib he had said one day i could cross the slates and make the child a fire when she is out on some errand when she returned wet and cold to find it blazing she would think a magician had done it the idea had been so fanciful that mr carrisfords sad face had lighted with a smile and ram dass had been so filled with rapture that he had enlarged upon it and explained to his master how simple it would be to accomplish numbers of other things he had shown a childlike pleasure and invention and the preparations for the carrying out of the plan had filled many a day with interest which would otherwise have dragged wearily on the night of the frustrated banquet ram dass had kept watch all his packages being in readiness in the attic which was his own and the person who was to help him had waited with him as interested as himself in the odd adventure ram dass had been lying flat upon the slates looking in at the skylight when the banquet had come to its disastrous conclusion he had been sure of the profoundness of saras wearied sleep and then with a dark lantern he had crept into the room while his companion had remained outside and handed the things to him when sara had stirred ever so faintly ram dass had closed the lanternslide and lain flat upon the floor these and many other exciting things the children found out by asking a thousand questions i am so glad sara said i am so glad it was you who were my friend there never were such friends as these two became somehow they seemed to suit each other in a wonderful way the indian gentleman had never had a companion he liked quite as much as he liked sara in a months time he was as mr carmichael had prophesied he would be a new man he was always amused and interested and he began to find an actual pleasure in the possession of the wealth he had imagined that he loathed the burden of there were so many charming things to plan for sara there was a little joke between them that he was a magician and it was one of his pleasures to invent things to surprise her she found beautiful new flowers growing in her room whimsical little gifts tucked under pillows and once as they sat together in the evening they heard the scratch of a heavy paw on the door and when sara went to find out what it was there stood a great doga splendid russian boarhoundwith a grand silver and gold collar bearing an inscription in raised letters i am boris it read i serve the princess sara there was nothing the indian gentleman loved more than the recollection of the little princess in rags and tatters the afternoons in which the large family or ermengarde and lottie gathered to rejoice together were very delightful but the hours when sara and the indian gentleman sat alone and read or talked had a special charm of their own during their passing many interesting things occurred illustration noticed that his companion sat gazing into the fire one evening mr carrisford looking up from his book noticed that his companion had not stirred for some time but sat gazing into the fire what are you supposing sara he asked sara looked up with a bright color on her cheek i was supposing she said i was remembering that hungry day and a child i saw but there were a great many hungry days said the indian gentleman with rather a sad tone in his voice which hungry day was it i forgot you didnt know said sara it was the day the dream came true then she told him the story of the bunshop and the fourpence she picked up out of the sloppy mud and the child who was hungrier than herself she told it quite simply and in as few words as possible but somehow the indian gentleman found it necessary to shade his eyes with his hand and look down at the carpet and i was supposing a kind of plan she said when she had finished i was thinking i should like to do something what was it said mr carrisford in a low tone you may do anything you like to do princess i was wondering rather hesitated sarayou know you say i have so much moneyi was wondering if i could go to see the bunwoman and tell her that if when hungry childrenparticularly on those dreadful dayscome and sit on the steps or look in at the window she would just call them in and give them something to eat she might send the bills to me could i do that you shall do it tomorrow morning said the indian gentleman thank you said sara you see i know what it is to be hungry and it is very hard when one cannot even pretend it away yes yes my dear said the indian gentleman yes yes it must be try to forget it come and sit on this footstool near my knee and only remember you are a princess yes said sara smiling and i can give buns and bread to the populace and she went and sat on the stool and the indian gentleman he used to like her to call him that too sometimes drew her small dark head down upon his knee and stroked her hair the next morning miss minchin in looking out of her window saw the thing she perhaps least enjoyed seeing the indian gentlemans carriage with its tall horses drew up before the door of the next house and its owner and a little figure warm with soft rich furs descended the steps to get into it the little figure was a familiar one and reminded miss minchin of days in the past it was followed by another as familiarthe sight of which she found very irritating it was becky who in the character of delighted attendant always accompanied her young mistress to her carriage carrying wraps and belongings already becky had a pink round face a little later the carriage drew up before the door of the bakers shop and its occupants got out oddly enough just as the bunwoman was putting a tray of smokinghot buns into the window when sara entered the shop the woman turned and looked at her and leaving the buns came and stood behind the counter for a moment she looked at sara very hard indeed and then her goodnatured face lighted up im sure that i remember you miss she said and yet yes said sara once you gave me six buns for fourpence and and you gave five of em to a beggar child the woman broke in on her ive always remembered it i couldnt make it out at first she turned round to the indian gentleman and spoke her next words to him i beg your pardon sir but theres not many young people that notices a hungry face in that way and ive thought of it many a time excuse the liberty missto sarabut you look rosier andwell better than you did thatthat i am better thank you said sara andi am much happierand i have come to ask you to do something for me me miss exclaimed the bunwoman smiling cheerfully why bless you yes miss what can i do and then sara leaning on the counter made her little proposal concerning the dreadful days and the hungry waifs and the hot buns the woman watched her and listened with an astonished face why bless me she said again when she had heard it all itll be a pleasure to me to do it i am a workingwoman myself and cannot afford to do much on my own account and theres sights of trouble on every side but if youll excuse me im bound to say ive given away many a bit of bread since that wet afternoon just along o thinking of youan how wet an cold you was an how hungry you looked an yet you gave away your hot buns as if you was a princess the indian gentleman smiled involuntarily at this and sara smiled a little too remembering what she had said to herself when she put the buns down on the ravenous childs ragged lap she looked so hungry she said she was even hungrier than i was she was starving said the woman manys the time shes told me of it sincehow she sat there in the wet and felt as if a wolf was atearing at her poor young insides oh have you seen her since then exclaimed sara do you know where she is yes i do answered the woman smiling more goodnaturedly than ever why shes in that there back room miss an has been for a month an a decent wellmeanin girl shes goin to turn out an such a help to me in the shop an in the kitchen as youd scarce believe knowin how shes lived she stepped to the door of the little back parlor and spoke and the next minute a girl came out and followed her behind the counter and actually it was the beggarchild clean and neatly clothed and looking as if she had not been hungry for a long time she looked shy but she had a nice face now that she was no longer a savage and the wild look had gone from her eyes she knew sara in an instant and stood and looked at her as if she could never look enough you see said the woman i told her to come when she was hungry and when shed come id give her odd jobs to do an i found she was willing and somehow i got to like her and the end of it was ive given her a place an a home and she helps me an behaves well an is as thankful as a girl can be her names anne she has no other the children stood and looked at each other for a few minutes and then sara took her hand out of her muff and held it out across the counter and anne took it and they looked straight into each others eyes i am so glad sara said and i have just thought of something perhaps mrs brown will let you be the one to give the buns and bread to the children perhaps you would like to do it because you know what it is to be hungry too yes miss said the girl and somehow sara felt as if she understood her though she said so little and only stood still and looked and looked after her as she went out of the shop with the indian gentleman and they got into the carriage and drove away scribner illustrated classics for younger readers stories which have been loved by young readers

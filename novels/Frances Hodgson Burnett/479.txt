little lord fauntleroy by frances hodgson burnett i cedric himself knew nothing whatever about it it had never been even mentioned to him he knew that his papa had been an englishman because his mamma had told him so but then his papa had died when he was so little a boy that he could not remember very much about him except that he was big and had blue eyes and a long mustache and that it was a splendid thing to be carried around the room on his shoulder since his papas death cedric had found out that it was best not to talk to his mamma about him when his father was ill cedric had been sent away and when he had returned everything was over and his mother who had been very ill too was only just beginning to sit in her chair by the window she was pale and thin and all the dimples had gone from her pretty face and her eyes looked large and mournful and she was dressed in black dearest said cedric his papa had called her that always and so the little boy had learned to say itdearest is my papa better he felt her arms tremble and so he turned his curly head and looked in her face there was something in it that made him feel that he was going to cry dearest he said is he well then suddenly his loving little heart told him that hed better put both his arms around her neck and kiss her again and again and keep his soft cheek close to hers and he did so and she laid her face on his shoulder and cried bitterly holding him as if she could never let him go again yes he is well she sobbed he is quite quite well but wewe have no one left but each other no one at all then little as he was he understood that his big handsome young papa would not come back any more that he was dead as he had heard of other people being although he could not comprehend exactly what strange thing had brought all this sadness about it was because his mamma always cried when he spoke of his papa that he secretly made up his mind it was better not to speak of him very often to her and he found out too that it was better not to let her sit still and look into the fire or out of the window without moving or talking he and his mamma knew very few people and lived what might have been thought very lonely lives although cedric did not know it was lonely until he grew older and heard why it was they had no visitors then he was told that his mamma was an orphan and quite alone in the world when his papa had married her she was very pretty and had been living as companion to a rich old lady who was not kind to her and one day captain cedric errol who was calling at the house saw her run up the stairs with tears on her eyelashes and she looked so sweet and innocent and sorrowful that the captain could not forget her and after many strange things had happened they knew each other well and loved each other dearly and were married although their marriage brought them the illwill of several persons the one who was most angry of all however was the captains father who lived in england and was a very rich and important old nobleman with a very bad temper and a very violent dislike to america and americans he had two sons older than captain cedric and it was the law that the elder of these sons should inherit the family title and estates which were very rich and splendid if the eldest son died the next one would be heir so though he was a member of such a great family there was little chance that captain cedric would be very rich himself but it so happened that nature had given to the youngest son gifts which she had not bestowed upon his elder brothers he had a beautiful face and a fine strong graceful figure he had a bright smile and a sweet gay voice he was brave and generous and had the kindest heart in the world and seemed to have the power to make every one love him and it was not so with his elder brothers neither of them was handsome or very kind or clever when they were boys at eton they were not popular when they were at college they cared nothing for study and wasted both time and money and made few real friends the old earl their father was constantly disappointed and humiliated by them his heir was no honor to his noble name and did not promise to end in being anything but a selfish wasteful insignificant man with no manly or noble qualities it was very bitter the old earl thought that the son who was only third and would have only a very small fortune should be the one who had all the gifts and all the charms and all the strength and beauty sometimes he almost hated the handsome young man because he seemed to have the good things which should have gone with the stately title and the magnificent estates and yet in the depths of his proud stubborn old heart he could not help caring very much for his youngest son it was in one of his fits of petulance that he sent him off to travel in america he thought he would send him away for a while so that he should not be made angry by constantly contrasting him with his brothers who were at that time giving him a great deal of trouble by their wild ways but after about six months he began to feel lonely and longed in secret to see his son again so he wrote to captain cedric and ordered him home the letter he wrote crossed on its way a letter the captain had just written to his father telling of his love for the pretty american girl and of his intended marriage and when the earl received that letter he was furiously angry bad as his temper was he had never given way to it in his life as he gave way to it when he read the captains letter his valet who was in the room when it came thought his lordship would have a fit of apoplexy he was so wild with anger for an hour he raged like a tiger and then he sat down and wrote to his son and ordered him never to come near his old home nor to write to his father or brothers again he told him he might live as he pleased and die where he pleased that he should be cut off from his family forever and that he need never expect help from his father as long as he lived the captain was very sad when he read the letter he was very fond of england and he dearly loved the beautiful home where he had been born he had even loved his illtempered old father and had sympathized with him in his disappointments but he knew he need expect no kindness from him in the future at first he scarcely knew what to do he had not been brought up to work and had no business experience but he had courage and plenty of determination so he sold his commission in the english army and after some trouble found a situation in new york and married the change from his old life in england was very great but he was young and happy and he hoped that hard work would do great things for him in the future he had a small house on a quiet street and his little boy was born there and everything was so gay and cheerful in a simple way that he was never sorry for a moment that he had married the rich old ladys pretty companion just because she was so sweet and he loved her and she loved him she was very sweet indeed and her little boy was like both her and his father though he was born in so quiet and cheap a little home it seemed as if there never had been a more fortunate baby in the first place he was always well and so he never gave any one trouble in the second place he had so sweet a temper and ways so charming that he was a pleasure to every one and in the third place he was so beautiful to look at that he was quite a picture instead of being a baldheaded baby he started in life with a quantity of soft fine goldcolored hair which curled up at the ends and went into loose rings by the time he was six months old he had big brown eyes and long eyelashes and a darling little face he had so strong a back and such splendid sturdy legs that at nine months he learned suddenly to walk his manners were so good for a baby that it was delightful to make his acquaintance he seemed to feel that every one was his friend and when any one spoke to him when he was in his carriage in the street he would give the stranger one sweet serious look with the brown eyes and then follow it with a lovely friendly smile and the consequence was that there was not a person in the neighborhood of the quiet street where he livedeven to the groceryman at the corner who was considered the crossest creature alivewho was not pleased to see him and speak to him and every month of his life he grew handsomer and more interesting when he was old enough to walk out with his nurse dragging a small wagon and wearing a short white kilt skirt and a big white hat set back on his curly yellow hair he was so handsome and strong and rosy that he attracted every ones attention and his nurse would come home and tell his mamma stories of the ladies who had stopped their carriages to look at and speak to him and of how pleased they were when he talked to them in his cheerful little way as if he had known them always his greatest charm was this cheerful fearless quaint little way of making friends with people i think it arose from his having a very confiding nature and a kind little heart that sympathized with every one and wished to make every one as comfortable as he liked to be himself it made him very quick to understand the feelings of those about him perhaps this had grown on him too because he had lived so much with his father and mother who were always loving and considerate and tender and wellbred he had never heard an unkind or uncourteous word spoken at home he had always been loved and caressed and treated tenderly and so his childish soul was full of kindness and innocent warm feeling he had always heard his mamma called by pretty loving names and so he used them himself when he spoke to her he had always seen that his papa watched over her and took great care of her and so he learned too to be careful of her so when he knew his papa would come back no more and saw how very sad his mamma was there gradually came into his kind little heart the thought that he must do what he could to make her happy he was not much more than a baby but that thought was in his mind whenever he climbed upon her knee and kissed her and put his curly head on her neck and when he brought his toys and picturebooks to show her and when he curled up quietly by her side as she used to lie on the sofa he was not old enough to know of anything else to do so he did what he could and was more of a comfort to her than he could have understood oh mary he heard her say once to her old servant i am sure he is trying to help me in his innocent wayi know he is he looks at me sometimes with a loving wondering little look as if he were sorry for me and then he will come and pet me or show me something he is such a little man i really think he knows as he grew older he had a great many quaint little ways which amused and interested people greatly he was so much of a companion for his mother that she scarcely cared for any other they used to walk together and talk together and play together when he was quite a little fellow he learned to read and after that he used to lie on the hearthrug in the evening and read aloudsometimes stories and sometimes big books such as older people read and sometimes even the newspaper and often at such times mary in the kitchen would hear mrs errol laughing with delight at the quaint things he said and indade said mary to the groceryman nobody cud help laughin at the quare little ways of himand his ouldfashioned sayins didnt he come into my kitchen the noight the new prisident was nominated and shtand afore the fire lookin loike a pictur wid his hands in his shmall pockets an his innocent bit of a face as sayrious as a jedge an sez he to me mary sez he im

with his mother ever since he was born and after his fathers death had been cook and housemaid and nurse and everything else she was proud of his graceful strong little body and his pretty manners and especially proud of the bright curly hair which waved over his forehead and fell in charming lovelocks on his shoulders she was willing to work early and late to help his mamma make his small suits and keep them in order ristycratic is it she would say faith an id loike to see the choild on fifth aveynoo as looks loike him an shteps out as handsome as himself an ivvery man woman and choild lookin afther him in his bit of a black velvet skirt made out of the misthresss ould gownd an his little head up an his curly hair flyin an shinin its loike a young lord he looks cedric did not know that he looked like a young lord he did not know what a lord was his greatest friend was the groceryman at the cornerthe cross groceryman who was never cross to him his name was mr hobbs and cedric admired and respected him very much he thought him a very rich and powerful person he had so many things in his storeprunes and figs and oranges and biscuitsand he had a horse and wagon cedric was fond of the milkman and the baker and the applewoman but he liked mr hobbs best of all and was on terms of such intimacy with him that he went to see him every day and often sat with him quite a long time discussing the topics of the hour it was quite surprising how many things they found to talk aboutthe fourth of july for instance when they began to talk about the fourth of july there really seemed no end to it mr hobbs had a very bad opinion of the british and he told the whole story of the revolution relating very wonderful and patriotic stories about the villainy of the enemy and the bravery of the revolutionary heroes and he even generously repeated part of the declaration of independence cedric was so excited that his eyes shone and his cheeks were red and his curls were all rubbed and tumbled into a yellow mop he could hardly wait to eat his dinner after he went home he was so anxious to tell his mamma it was perhaps mr hobbs who gave him his first interest in politics mr hobbs was fond of reading the newspapers and so cedric heard a great deal about what was going on in washington and mr hobbs would tell him whether the president was doing his duty or not and once when there was an election he found it all quite grand and probably but for mr hobbs and cedric the country might have been wrecked mr hobbs took him to see a great torchlight procession and many of the men who carried torches remembered afterward a stout man who stood near a lamppost and held on his shoulder a handsome little shouting boy who waved his cap in the air it was not long after this election when cedric was between seven and eight years old that the very strange thing happened which made so wonderful a change in his life it was quite curious too that the day it happened he had been talking to mr hobbs about england and the queen and mr hobbs had said some very severe things about the aristocracy being specially indignant against earls and marquises it had been a hot morning and after playing soldiers with some friends of his cedric had gone into the store to rest and had found mr hobbs looking very fierce over a piece of the illustrated london news which contained a picture of some court ceremony ah he said thats the way they go on now but theyll get enough of it some day when those theyve trod on rise and blow em up skyhighearls and marquises and all its coming and they may look out for it cedric had perched himself as usual on the high stool and pushed his hat back and put his hands in his pockets in delicate compliment to mr hobbs did you ever know many marquises mr hobbs cedric inquiredor earls no answered mr hobbs with indignation i guess not id like to catch one of em inside here thats all ill have no grasping tyrants sittin round on my crackerbarrels and he was so proud of the sentiment that he looked around proudly and mopped his forehead perhaps they wouldnt be earls if they knew any better said cedric feeling some vague sympathy for their unhappy condition wouldnt they said mr hobbs they just glory in it its in em theyre a bad lot they were in the midst of their conversation when mary appeared cedric thought she had come to buy some sugar perhaps but she had not she looked almost pale and as if she were excited about something come home darlint she said the misthress is wantin yez cedric slipped down from his stool does she want me to go out with her mary he asked goodmorning mr hobbs ill see you again he was surprised to see mary staring at him in a dumfounded fashion and he wondered why she kept shaking her head whats the matter mary he said is it the hot weather no said mary but theres strange things happenin to us has the sun given dearest a headache he inquired anxiously but it was not that when he reached his own house there was a coupe standing before the door and some one was in the little parlor talking to his mamma mary hurried him upstairs and put on his best summer suit of creamcolored flannel with the red scarf around his waist and combed out his curly locks lords is it he heard her say an the nobility an gintry och bad cess to them lords indadeworse luck it was really very puzzling but he felt sure his mamma would tell him what all the excitement meant so he allowed mary to bemoan herself without asking many questions when he was dressed he ran downstairs and went into the parlor a tall thin old gentleman with a sharp face was sitting in an armchair his mother was standing near by with a pale face and he saw that there were tears in her eyes oh ceddie she cried out and ran to her little boy and caught him in her arms and kissed him in a frightened troubled way oh ceddie darling the tall old gentleman rose from his chair and looked at cedric with his sharp eyes he rubbed his thin chin with his bony hand as he looked he seemed not at all displeased and so he said at last slowlyand so this is little lord fauntleroy ii there was never a more amazed little boy than cedric during the week that followed there was never so strange or so unreal a week in the first place the story his mamma told him was a very curious one he was obliged to hear it two or three times before he could understand it he could not imagine what mr hobbs would think of it it began with earls his grandpapa whom he had never seen was an earl and his eldest uncle if he had not been killed by a fall from his horse would have been an earl too in time and after his death his other uncle would have been an earl if he had not died suddenly in rome of a fever after that his own papa if he had lived would have been an earl but since they all had died and only cedric was left it appeared that he was to be an earl after his grandpapas deathand for the present he was lord fauntleroy he turned quite pale when he was first told of it oh dearest he said i should rather not be an earl none of the boys are earls cant i not be one but it seemed to be unavoidable and when that evening they sat together by the open window looking out into the shabby street he and his mother had a long talk about it cedric sat on his footstool clasping one knee in his favorite attitude and wearing a bewildered little face rather red from the exertion of thinking his grandfather had sent for him to come to england and his mamma thought he must go because she said looking out of the window with sorrowful eyes i know your papa would wish it to be so ceddie he loved his home very much and there are many things to be thought of that a little boy cant quite understand i should be a selfish little mother if i did not send you when you are a man you will see why ceddie shook his head mournfully i shall be very sorry to leave mr hobbs he said im afraid hell miss me and i shall miss him and i shall miss them all when mr havishamwho was the family lawyer of the earl of dorincourt and who had been sent by him to bring lord fauntleroy to englandcame the next day cedric heard many things but somehow it did not console him to hear that he was to be a very rich man when he grew up and that he would have castles here and castles there and great parks and deep mines and grand estates and tenantry he was troubled about his friend mr hobbs and he went to see him at the store soon after breakfast in great anxiety of mind he found him reading the morning paper and he approached him with a grave demeanor he really felt it would be a great shock to mr hobbs to hear what had befallen him and on his way to the store he had been thinking how it would be best to break the news hello said mr hobbs mornin goodmorning said cedric he did not climb up on the high stool as usual but sat down on a crackerbox and clasped his knee and was so silent for a few moments that mr hobbs finally looked up inquiringly over the top of his newspaper hello he said again cedric gathered all his strength of mind together mr hobbs he said do you remember what we were talking about yesterday morning well replied mr hobbsseems to me it was england yes said cedric but just when mary came for me you know mr hobbs rubbed the back of his head we was mentioning queen victoria and the aristocracy yes said cedric rather hesitatingly andand earls dont you know why yes returned mr hobbs we did touch em up a little thats so cedric flushed up to the curly bang on his forehead nothing so embarrassing as this had ever happened to him in his life he was a little afraid that it might be a trifle embarrassing to mr hobbs too you said he proceeded that you wouldnt have them sitting round on your crackerbarrels so i did returned mr hobbs stoutly and i meant it let em try itthats all mr hobbs said cedric one is sitting on this box now mr hobbs almost jumped out of his chair what he exclaimed yes cedric announced with due modesty i am oneor i am going to be i wont deceive you mr hobbs looked agitated he rose up suddenly and went to look at the thermometer the mercurys got into your head he exclaimed turning back to examine his young friends countenance it is a hot day how do you feel got any pain when did you begin to feel that way he put his big hand on the little boys hair this was more embarrassing than ever thank you said ceddie im all right there is nothing the matter with my head im sorry to say its true mr hobbs that was what mary came to take me home for mr havisham was telling my mamma and he is a lawyer mr hobbs sank into his chair and mopped his forehead with his handkerchief one of us has got a sunstroke he exclaimed no returned cedric we havent we shall have to make the best of it mr hobbs mr havisham came all the way from england to tell us about it my grandpapa sent him mr hobbs stared wildly at the innocent serious little face before him who is your grandfather he asked cedric put his hand in his pocket and carefully drew out a piece of paper on which something was written in his own round irregular hand i couldnt easily remember it so i wrote it down on this he said and he read aloud slowly john arthur molyneux errol earl of dorincourt that is his name and he lives in a castlein two or three castles i think and my papa who died was his youngest son and i shouldnt have been a lord or an earl if my papa hadnt died and my papa wouldnt have been an earl if his two brothers hadnt died but they all died and there is no one but meno boyand so i have to be one and my grandpapa has sent for me to come to england mr hobbs seemed to grow hotter and hotter he mopped his forehead and his bald spot and breathed hard he began to see that something very remarkable had happened but when he looked at the little boy sitting on the crackerbox with the innocent anxious expression in his childish eyes and saw that he was not changed at all but was simply as he had been the day before just a handsome cheerful brave little fellow in a blue suit and red neckribbon all this information about the nobility bewildered him he was all the more bewildered because cedric gave it with such ingenuous simplicity and plainly without realizing himself how stupendous it was whawhat did you say your name was mr hobbs inquired its cedric errol lord fauntleroy answered cedric that was what mr havisham called me he said when i went into the room and so this is little lord fauntleroy well said mr hobbs ill bejiggered this was an exclamation he always used when he was very much astonished or excited he could think of nothing else to say just at that puzzling moment cedric felt it to be quite a proper and suitable ejaculation his respect and affection for mr hobbs were so great that he admired and approved of all his remarks he had not seen enough of society as yet to make him realize that sometimes mr hobbs was not quite conventional he knew of course that he was different from his mamma but then his mamma was a lady and he had an idea that ladies were always different from gentlemen he looked at mr hobbs wistfully england is a long way off isnt it he asked its across the atlantic ocean mr hobbs answered thats the worst of it said cedric perhaps i shall not see you again for a long time i dont like to think of that mr hobbs the best of friends must part said mr hobbs well said cedric we have been friends for a great many years havent we ever since you was born mr hobbs answered you was about six weeks old when you was first walked out on this street ah remarked cedric with a sigh i never thought i should have to be an earl then you think said mr hobbs theres no getting out of it im afraid not answered cedric my mamma says that my papa would wish me to do it but if i have to be an earl theres one thing i can do i can try to be a good one im not going to be a tyrant and if there is ever to be another war with america i shall try to stop it his conversation with mr hobbs was a long and serious one once having got over the first shock mr hobbs was not so rancorous as might have been expected he endeavored to resign himself to the situation and before the interview was at an end he had asked a great many questions as cedric could answer but few of them he endeavored to answer them himself and being fairly launched on the subject of earls and marquises and lordly estates explained many things in a way which would probably have astonished mr havisham could that gentleman have heard it but then there were many things which astonished mr havisham he had spent all his life in england and was not accustomed to american people and american habits he had been connected professionally with the family of the earl of dorincourt for nearly forty years and he knew all about its grand estates and its great wealth and importance and in a cold businesslike way he felt an interest in this little boy who in the future was to be the master and owner of them allthe future earl of dorincourt he had known all about the old earls disappointment in his elder sons and all about his fierce rage at captain cedrics american marriage and he knew how he still hated the gentle little widow and would not speak of her except with bitter and cruel words he insisted that she was only a common american girl who had entrapped his son into marrying her because she knew he was an earls son the old lawyer himself had more than half believed this was all true he had seen a great many selfish mercenary people in his life and he had not a good opinion of americans when he had been driven into the cheap street and his coupe had stopped before the cheap small house he had felt actually shocked it seemed really quite dreadful to think that the future owner of dorincourt castle and wyndham towers and chorlworth and all the other stately splendors should have been born and brought up in an insignificant house in a street with a sort of greengrocery at the corner he wondered what kind of a child he would be and what kind of a mother he had he rather shrank from seeing them both he had a sort of pride in the noble family whose legal affairs he had conducted so long and it would have annoyed him very much to have found himself obliged to manage a woman who would seem to him a vulgar moneyloving person with no respect for her dead husbands country and the dignity of his name it was a very old name and a very splendid one and mr havisham had a great respect for it himself though he was only a cold keen businesslike old lawyer when mary handed him into the small parlor he looked around it critically it was plainly furnished but it had a homelike look there were no cheap common ornaments and no cheap gaudy pictures the few adornments on the walls were in good taste and about the room were many pretty things which a womans hand might have made not at all bad so far he had said to himself but perhaps the captains taste predominated but when mrs errol came into the room he began to think she herself might have had something to do with it if he had not been quite a selfcontained and stiff old gentleman he would probably have started when he saw her she looked in the simple black dress fitting closely to her slender figure more like a young girl than the mother of a boy of seven she had a pretty sorrowful young face and a very tender innocent look in her large brown eyesthe sorrowful look that had never quite left her face since her husband had died cedric was used to seeing it there the only times he had ever seen it fade out had been when he was playing with her or talking to her and had said some oldfashioned thing or used some long word he had picked up out of the newspapers or in his conversations with mr hobbs he was fond of using long words and he was always pleased when they made her laugh though he could not understand why they were laughable they were quite serious matters with him the lawyers experience taught him to read peoples characters very shrewdly and as soon as he saw cedrics mother he knew that the old earl had made a great mistake in thinking her a vulgar mercenary woman mr havisham had never been married he had never even been in love but he divined that this pretty young creature with the sweet voice and sad eyes had married captain errol only because she loved him with all her affectionate heart and that she had never once thought it an advantage that he was an earls son and he saw he should have no trouble with her and he began to feel that perhaps little lord fauntleroy might not be such a trial to his noble family after all the captain had been a handsome fellow and the young mother was very pretty and perhaps the boy might be well enough to look at when he first told mrs errol what he had come for she turned very pale oh she said will he have to be taken away from me we love each other so much he is such a happiness to me he is all i have i have tried to be a good mother to him and her sweet young voice trembled and the tears rushed into her eyes you do not know what he has been to me she said the lawyer cleared his throat i am obliged to tell you he said that the earl of dorincourt is notis not very friendly toward you he is an old man and his prejudices are very strong he has always especially disliked america and americans and was very much enraged by his sons marriage i am sorry to be the bearer of so unpleasant a communication but he is very fixed in his determination not to see you his plan is that lord fauntleroy shall be educated under his own supervision that he shall live with him the earl is attached to dorincourt castle and spends a great deal of time there he is a victim to inflammatory gout and is not fond of london lord fauntleroy will therefore be likely to live chiefly at dorincourt the earl offers you as a home court lodge which is situated pleasantly and is not very far from the castle he also offers you a suitable income lord fauntleroy will be permitted to visit you the only stipulation is that you shall not visit him or enter the park gates you see you will not be really separated from your son and i assure you madam the terms are not so harsh asas they might have been the advantage of such surroundings and education as lord fauntleroy will have i am sure you must see will be very great he felt a little uneasy lest she should begin to cry or make a scene as he knew some women would have done it embarrassed and annoyed him to see women cry but she did not she went to the window and stood with her face turned away for a few moments and he saw she was trying to steady herself captain errol was very fond of dorincourt she said at last he loved england and everything english it was always a grief to him that he was parted from his home he was proud of his home and of his name he would wishi know he would wish that his son should know the beautiful old places and be brought up in such a way as would be suitable to his future position then she came back to the table and stood looking up at mr havisham very gently my husband would wish it she said it will be best for my little boy i knowi am sure the earl would not be so unkind as to try to teach him not to love me and i knoweven if he triedthat my little boy is too much like his father to be harmed he has a warm faithful nature and a true heart he would love me even if he did not see me and so long as we may see each other i ought not to suffer very much she thinks very little of herself the lawyer thought she does not make any terms for herself madam he said aloud i respect your consideration for your son he will thank you for it when he is a man i assure you lord fauntleroy will be most carefully guarded and every effort will be used to insure his happiness the earl of dorincourt will be as anxious for his comfort and wellbeing as you yourself could be i hope said the tender little mother in a rather broken voice that his grandfather will love ceddie the little boy has a very affectionate nature and he has always been loved mr havisham cleared his throat again he could not quite imagine the gouty fierytempered old earl loving any one very much but he knew it would be to his interest to be kind in his irritable way to the child who was to be his heir he knew too that if ceddie were at all a credit to his name his grandfather would be proud of him lord fauntleroy will be comfortable i am sure he replied it was with a view to his happiness that the earl desired that you should be near enough to him to see him frequently he did not think it would be discreet to repeat the exact words the earl had used which were in fact neither polite nor amiable mr havisham preferred to express his noble patrons offer in smoother and more courteous language he had another slight shock when mrs errol asked mary to find her little boy and bring him to her and mary told her where he was sure ill foind him aisy enough maam she said for its wid mr hobbs he is this minnit settin on his high shtool by the counther an talkin pollytics most loikely or enjyin hisself among the soap an candles an pertaties as sinsible an shwate as ye plase mr hobbs has known him all his life mrs errol said to the lawyer he is very kind to ceddie and there is a great friendship between them remembering the glimpse he had caught of the store as he passed it and having a recollection of the barrels of potatoes and apples and the various odds and ends mr havisham felt his doubts arise again in england gentlemens sons did not make friends of grocerymen and it seemed to him a rather singular proceeding it would be very awkward if the child had bad manners and a disposition to like low company one of the bitterest humiliations of the old earls life had been that his two elder sons had been fond of low company could it be he thought that this boy shared their bad qualities instead of his fathers good qualities he was thinking uneasily about this as he talked to mrs errol until the child came into the room when the door opened he actually hesitated a moment before looking at cedric it would perhaps have seemed very queer to a great many people who knew him if they could have known the curious sensations that passed through mr havisham when he looked down at the boy who ran into his mothers arms he experienced a revulsion of feeling which was quite exciting he recognized in an instant that here was one of the finest and handsomest little fellows he had ever seen his beauty was something unusual he had a strong lithe graceful little body and a manly little face he held his childish head up and carried himself with a brave air he was so like his father that it was really startling he had his fathers golden hair and his mothers brown eyes but there was nothing sorrowful or timid in them they were innocently fearless eyes he looked as if he had never feared or doubted anything in his life he is the bestbredlooking and handsomest little fellow i ever saw was what mr havisham thought what he said aloud was simply and so this is little lord fauntleroy and after this the more he saw of little lord fauntleroy the more of a surprise he found him he knew very little about children though he had seen plenty of them in englandfine handsome rosy girls and boys who were strictly taken care of by their tutors and governesses and who were sometimes shy and sometimes a trifle boisterous but never very interesting to a ceremonious rigid old lawyer perhaps his personal interest in little lord fauntleroys fortunes made him notice ceddie more than he had noticed other children but however that was he certainly found himself noticing him a great deal cedric did not know he was being observed and he only behaved himself in his ordinary manner he shook hands with mr havisham in his friendly way when they were introduced to each other and he answered all his questions with the unhesitating readiness with which he answered mr hobbs he was neither shy nor bold and when mr havisham was talking to his mother the lawyer noticed that he listened to the conversation with as much interest as if he had been quite grown up he seems to be a very mature little fellow mr havisham said to the mother i think he is in some things she answered he has always been very quick to learn and he has lived a great deal with grownup people he has a funny little habit of using long words and expressions he has read in books or has heard others use but he is very fond of childish play i think he is rather clever but he is a very boyish little boy sometimes the next time mr havisham met him he saw that this last was quite true as his coupe turned the corner he caught sight of a group of small boys who were evidently much excited two of them were about to run a race and one of them was his young lordship and he was shouting and making as much noise as the noisiest of his companions he stood side by side with another boy one little red leg advanced a step one to make ready yelled the starter two to be steady threeand away mr havisham found himself leaning out of the window of his coupe with a curious feeling of interest he really never remembered having seen anything quite like the way in which his lordships lordly little red legs flew up behind his knickerbockers and tore over the ground as he shot out in the race at the signal word he shut his small hands and set his face against the wind his bright hair streamed out behind hooray ced errol all the boys shouted dancing and shrieking with excitement hooray billy williams hooray ceddie hooray billy hooray ray ray i really believe he is going to win said mr havisham the way in which the red legs flew and flashed up and down the shrieks of the boys the wild efforts of billy williams whose brown legs were not to be despised as they followed closely in the rear of the red legs made him feel some excitement i reallyi really cant help hoping he will win he said with an apologetic sort of cough at that moment the wildest yell of all went up from the dancing hopping boys with one last frantic leap the future earl of dorincourt had reached the lamppost at the end of the block and touched it just two seconds before billy williams flung himself at it panting three cheers for ceddie errol yelled the little boys hooray for ceddie errol mr havisham drew his head in at the window of his coupe and leaned back with a dry smile bravo lord fauntleroy he said as his carriage stopped before the door of mrs errols house the victor and the vanquished were coming toward it attended by the clamoring crew cedric walked by billy williams and was speaking to him his elated little face was very red his curls clung to his hot moist forehead his hands were in his pockets you see he was saying evidently with the intention of making defeat easy for his unsuccessful rival i guess i won because my legs are a little longer than yours i guess that was it you see im three days older than you and that gives me a vantage im three days older and this view of the case seemed to cheer billy williams so much that he began to smile on the world again and felt able to swagger a little almost as if he had won the race instead of losing it somehow ceddie errol had a way of making people feel comfortable even in the first flush of his triumphs he remembered that the person who was beaten might not feel so gay as he did and might like to think that he might have been the winner under different circumstances that morning mr havisham had quite a long conversation with the winner of the racea conversation which made him smile his dry smile and rub his chin with his bony hand several times mrs errol had been called out of the parlor and the lawyer and cedric were left together at first mr havisham wondered what he should say to his small companion he had an idea that perhaps it would be best to say several things which might prepare cedric for meeting his grandfather and perhaps for the great change that was to come to him he could see that cedric had not the least idea of the sort of thing he was to see when he reached england or of the sort of home that waited for him there he did not even know yet that his mother was not to live in the same house with him they had thought it best to let him get over the first shock before telling him mr havisham sat in an armchair on one side of the open window on the other side was another still larger chair and cedric sat in that and looked at mr havisham he sat well back in the depths of his big seat his curly head against the cushioned back his legs crossed and his hands thrust deep into his pockets in a quite mr hobbslike way he had been watching mr havisham very steadily when his mamma had been in the room and after she was gone he still looked at him in respectful thoughtfulness there was a short silence after mrs errol went out and cedric seemed to be studying mr havisham and mr havisham was certainly studying cedric he could not make up his mind as to what an elderly gentleman should say to a little boy who won races and wore short knickerbockers and red stockings on legs which were not long enough to hang over a big chair when he sat well back in it but cedric relieved him by suddenly beginning the conversation himself do you know he said i dont know what an earl is dont you said mr havisham no replied ceddie and i think when a boy is going to be one he ought to know dont you wellyes answered mr havisham would you mind said ceddie respectfullywould you mind splaining it to me sometimes when he used his long words he did not pronounce them quite correctly what made him an earl a king or queen in the first place said mr havisham generally he is made an earl because he has done some service to his sovereign or some great deed oh said cedric thats like the president is it said mr havisham is that why your presidents are elected yes answered ceddie cheerfully when a man is very good and knows a great deal he is elected president they have torchlight processions and bands and everybody makes speeches i used to think i might perhaps be a president but i never thought of being an earl i didnt know about earls he said rather hastily lest mr havisham might feel it impolite in him not to have wished to be oneif id known about them i dare say i should have thought i should like to be one it is rather different from being a president said mr havisham is it asked cedric how are there no torchlight processions mr havisham crossed his own legs and put the tips of his fingers carefully together he thought perhaps the time had come to explain matters rather more clearly an earl isis a very important person he began so is a president put in ceddie the torchlight processions are five miles long and they shoot up rockets and the band plays mr hobbs took me to see them an earl mr havisham went on feeling rather uncertain of his ground is frequently of very ancient lineage whats that asked ceddie of very old familyextremely old ah said cedric thrusting his hands deeper into his pockets i suppose that is the way with the applewoman near the park i dare say she is of ancient linlenage she is so old it would surprise you how she can stand up shes a hundred i should think and yet she is out there when it rains even im sorry for her and so are the other boys billy williams once had nearly a dollar and i asked him to buy five cents worth of apples from her every day until he had spent it all that made twenty days and he grew tired of apples after a week but thenit was quite fortunatea gentleman gave me fifty cents and i bought apples from her instead you feel sorry for any one thats so poor and has such ancient linlenage she says hers has gone into her bones and the rain makes it worse mr havisham felt rather at a loss as he looked at his companions innocent serious little face i am afraid you did not quite understand me he explained when i said ancient lineage i did not mean old age i meant that the name of such a family has been known in the world a long time perhaps for hundreds of years persons bearing that name have been known and spoken of in the history of their country like george washington said ceddie ive heard of him ever since i was born and he was known about long before that mr hobbs says he will never be forgotten thats because of the declaration of independence you know and the fourth of july you see he was a very brave man the first earl of dorincourt said mr havisham solemnly was created an earl four hundred years ago well well said ceddie that was a long time ago did you tell dearest that it would intrust her very much well tell her when she comes in she always likes to hear curus things what else does an earl do besides being created a great many of them have helped to govern england some of them have been brave men and have fought in great battles in the old days i should like to do that myself said cedric my papa was a soldier and he was a very brave manas brave as george washington perhaps that was because he would have been an earl if he hadnt died i am glad earls are brave thats a great vantageto be a brave man once i used to be rather afraid of thingsin the dark you know but when i thought about the soldiers in the revolution and george washingtonit cured me there is another advantage in being an earl sometimes said mr havisham slowly and he fixed his shrewd eyes on the little boy with a rather curious expression some earls have a great deal of money he was curious because he wondered if his young friend knew what the power of money was thats a good thing to have said ceddie innocently i wish i had a great deal of money do you said mr havisham and why well explained cedric there are so many things a person can do with money you see theres the applewoman if i were very rich i should buy her a little tent to put her stall in and a little stove and then i should give her a dollar every morning it rained so that she could afford to stay at home and thenoh id give her a shawl and you see her bones wouldnt feel so badly her bones are not like our bones they hurt her when she moves its very painful when your bones hurt you if i were rich enough to do all those things for her i guess her bones would be all right ahem said mr havisham and what else would you do if you were rich oh id do a great many things of course i should buy dearest all sorts of beautiful things needlebooks and fans and gold thimbles and rings and an encyclopedia and a carriage so that she neednt have to wait for the streetcars if she liked pink silk dresses i should buy her some but she likes black best but id take her to the big stores and tell her to look round and choose for herself and then dick who is dick asked mr havisham dick is a bootblack said his young lordship quite warming up in his interest in plans so exciting he is one of the nicest bootblacks you ever knew he stands at the corner of a street downtown ive known him for years once when i was very little i was walking out with dearest and she bought me a beautiful ball that bounced and i was carrying it and it bounced into the middle of the street where the carriages and horses were and i was so disappointed i began to cryi was very little i had kilts on and dick was blacking a mans shoes and he said hello and he ran in between the horses and caught the ball for me and wiped it off with his coat and gave it to me and said its all right young un so dearest admired him very much and so did i and ever since then when we go downtown we talk to him he says hello and i say hello and then we talk a little and he tells me how trade is its been bad lately and what would you like to do for him inquired the lawyer rubbing his chin and smiling a queer smile well said lord fauntleroy settling himself in his chair with a business air id buy jake out and who is jake mr havisham asked hes dicks partner and he is the worst partner a fellow could have dick says so he isnt a credit to the business and he isnt square he cheats and that makes dick mad it would make you mad you know if you were blacking boots as hard as you could and being square all the time and your partner wasnt square at all people like dick but they dont like jake and so sometimes they dont come twice so if i were rich id buy jake out and get dick a boss signhe says a boss sign goes a long way and id get him some new clothes and new brushes and start him out fair he says all he wants is to start out fair there could have been nothing more confiding and innocent than the way in which his small lordship told his little story quoting his friend dicks bits of slang in the most candid good faith he seemed to feel not a shade of a doubt that his elderly companion would be just as interested as he was himself and in truth mr havisham was beginning to be greatly interested but perhaps not quite so much in dick and the applewoman as in this kind little lordling whose curly head was so busy under its yellow thatch with goodnatured plans for his friends and who seemed somehow to have forgotten himself altogether is there anything he began what would you get for yourself if you were rich lots of things answered lord fauntleroy briskly but first id give mary some money for bridgetthats her sister with twelve children and a husband out of work she comes here and cries and dearest gives her things in a basket and then she cries again and says blessins be on yez for a beautiful lady and i think mr hobbs would like a gold watch and chain to remember me by and a meerschaum pipe and then id like to get up a company a company exclaimed mr havisham like a republican rally explained cedric becoming quite excited id have torches and uniforms and things for all the boys and myself too and wed march you know and drill thats what i should like for myself if i were rich the door opened and mrs errol came in i am sorry to have been obliged to leave you so long she said to mr havisham but a poor woman who is in great trouble came to see me this young gentleman said mr havisham has been telling me about some of his friends and what he would do for them if he were rich bridget is one of his friends said mrs errol and it is bridget to whom i have been talking in the kitchen she is in great trouble now because her husband has rheumatic fever cedric slipped down out of his big chair i think ill go and see her he said and ask her how he is hes a nice man when he is well im obliged to him because he once made me a sword out of wood hes a very talented man he ran out of the room and mr havisham rose from his chair he seemed to have something in his mind which he wished to speak of he hesitated a moment and then said looking down at mrs errol before i left dorincourt castle i had an interview with the earl in which he gave me some instructions he is desirous that his grandson should look forward with some pleasure to his future life in england and also to his acquaintance with himself he said that i must let his lordship know that the change in his life would bring him money and the pleasures children enjoy if he expressed any wishes i was to gratify them and to tell him that his grandfather had given him what he wished i am aware that the earl did not expect anything quite like this but if it would give lord fauntleroy pleasure to assist this poor woman i should feel that the earl would be displeased if he were not gratified for the second time he did not repeat the earls exact words his lordship had indeed said make the lad understand that i can give him anything he wants let him know what it is to be the grandson of the earl of dorincourt buy him everything he takes a fancy to let him have money in his pockets and tell him his grandfather put it there his motives were far from being good and if he had been dealing with a nature less affectionate and warmhearted than little lord fauntleroys great harm might have been done and cedrics mother was too gentle to suspect any harm she thought that perhaps this meant that a lonely unhappy old man whose children were dead wished to be kind to her little boy and win his love and confidence and it pleased her very much to think that ceddie would be able to help bridget it made her happier to know that the very first result of the strange fortune which had befallen her little boy was that he could do kind things for those who needed kindness quite a warm color bloomed on her pretty young face oh she said that was very kind of the earl cedric will be so glad he has always been fond of bridget and michael they are quite deserving i have often wished i had been able to help them more michael is a hardworking man when he is well but he has been ill a long time and needs expensive medicines and warm clothing and nourishing food he and bridget will not be wasteful of what is given them mr havisham put his thin hand in his breast pocket and drew forth a large pocketbook there was a queer look in his keen face the truth was he was wondering what the earl of dorincourt would say when he was told what was the first wish of his grandson that had been granted he wondered what the cross worldly selfish old nobleman would think of it i do not know that you have realized he said that the earl of dorincourt is an exceedingly rich man he can afford to gratify any caprice i think it would please him to know that lord fauntleroy had been indulged in any fancy if you will call him back and allow me i shall give him five pounds for these people that would be twentyfive dollars exclaimed mrs errol it will seem like wealth to them i can scarcely believe that it is true it is quite true said mr havisham with his dry smile a great change has taken place in your sons life a great deal of power will lie in his hands oh cried his mother and he is such a little boya very little boy how can i teach him to use it well it makes me half afraid my pretty little ceddie the lawyer slightly cleared his throat it touched his worldly hard old heart to see the tender timid look in her brown eyes i think madam he said that if i may judge from my interview with lord fauntleroy this morning the next earl of dorincourt will think for others as well as for his noble self he is only a child yet but i think he may be trusted then his mother went for cedric and brought him back into the parlor mr havisham heard him talking before he entered the room its infamnatory rheumatism he was saying and thats a kind of rheumatism thats dreadful and he thinks about the rent not being paid and bridget says that makes the infammation worse and pat could get a place in a store if he had some clothes his little face looked quite anxious when he came in he was very sorry for bridget dearest said you wanted me he said to mr havisham ive been talking to bridget mr havisham looked down at him a moment he felt a little awkward and undecided as cedrics mother had said he was a very little boy the earl of dorincourt he began and then he glanced involuntarily at mrs errol little lord fauntleroys mother suddenly kneeled down by him and put both her tender arms around his childish body ceddie she said the earl is your grandpapa your own papas father he is very very kind and he loves you and wishes you to love him because the sons who were his little boys are dead he wishes you to be happy and to make other people happy he is very rich and he wishes you to have everything you would like to have he told mr havisham so and gave him a great deal of money for you you can give some to bridget now enough to pay her rent and buy michael everything isnt that fine ceddie isnt he good and she kissed the child on his round cheek where the bright color suddenly flashed up in his excited amazement he looked from his mother to mr havisham can i have it now he cried can i give it to her this minute shes just going mr havisham handed him the money it was in fresh clean greenbacks and made a neat roll ceddie flew out of the room with it bridget they heard him shout as he tore into the kitchen bridget wait a minute heres some money its for you and you can pay the rent my grandpapa gave it to me its for you and michael oh master ceddie cried bridget in an awestricken voice its twintyfoive dollars is here where bes the misthress i think i shall have to go and explain it to her mrs errol said so she too went out of the room and mr havisham was left alone for a while he went to the window and stood looking out into the street reflectively he was thinking of the old earl of dorincourt sitting in his great splendid gloomy library at the castle gouty and lonely surrounded by grandeur and luxury but not really loved by any one because in all his long life he had never really loved any one but himself he had been selfish and selfindulgent and arrogant and passionate he had cared so much for the earl of dorincourt and his pleasures that there had been no time for him to think of other people all his wealth and power all the benefits from his noble name and high rank had seemed to him to be things only to be used to amuse and give pleasure to the earl of dorincourt and now that he was an old man all this excitement and selfindulgence had only brought him ill health and irritability and a dislike of the world which certainly disliked him in spite of all his splendor there was never a more unpopular old nobleman than the earl of dorincourt and there could scarcely have been a more lonely one he could fill his castle with guests if he chose he could give great dinners and splendid hunting parties but he knew that in secret the people who would accept his invitations were afraid of his frowning old face and sarcastic biting speeches he had a cruel tongue and a bitter nature and he took pleasure in sneering at people and making them feel uncomfortable when he had the power to do so because they were sensitive or proud or timid mr havisham knew his hard fierce ways by heart and he was thinking of him as he looked out of the window into the narrow quiet street and there rose in his mind in sharp contrast the picture of the cheery handsome little fellow sitting in the big chair and telling his story of his friends dick and the applewoman in his generous innocent honest way and he thought of the immense income the beautiful majestic estates the wealth and power for good or evil which in the course of time would lie in the small chubby hands little lord fauntleroy thrust so deep into his pockets it will make a great difference he said to himself it will make a great difference cedric and his mother came back soon after cedric was in high spirits he sat down in his own chair between his mother and the lawyer and fell into one of his quaint attitudes with his hands on his knees he was glowing with enjoyment of bridgets relief and rapture she cried he said she said she was crying for joy i never saw any one cry for joy before my grandpapa must be a very good man i didnt know he was so good a man its moremore agreeabler to be an earl than i thought it was im almost gladim almost quite glad im going to be one iii cedrics good opinion of the advantages of being an earl increased greatly during the next week it seemed almost impossible for him to realize that there was scarcely anything he might wish to do which he could not do easily in fact i think it may be said that he did not fully realize it at all but at least he understood after a few conversations with mr havisham that he could gratify all his nearest wishes and he proceeded to gratify them with a simplicity and delight which caused mr havisham much diversion in the week before they sailed for england he did many curious things the lawyer long after remembered the morning they went downtown together to pay a visit to dick and the afternoon they so amazed the applewoman of ancient lineage by stopping before her stall and telling her she was to have a tent and a stove and a shawl and a sum of money which seemed to her quite wonderful for i have to go to england and be a lord explained cedric sweettemperedly and i shouldnt like to have your bones on my mind every time it rained my own bones never hurt so i think i dont know how painful a persons bones can be but ive sympathized with you a great deal and i hope youll be better shes a very good applewoman he said to mr havisham as they walked away leaving the proprietress of the stall almost gasping for breath and not at all believing in her great fortune once when i fell down and cut my knee she gave me an apple for nothing ive always remembered her for it you know you always remember people who are kind to you it had never occurred to his honest simple little mind that there were people who could forget kindnesses the interview with dick was quite exciting dick had just been having a great deal of trouble with jake and was in low spirits when they saw him his amazement when cedric calmly announced that they had come to give him what seemed a very great thing to him and would set all his troubles right almost struck him dumb lord fauntleroys manner of announcing the object of his visit was very simple and unceremonious mr havisham was much impressed by its directness as he stood by and listened the statement that his old friend had become a lord and was in danger of being an earl if he lived long enough caused dick to so open his eyes and mouth and start that his cap fell off when he picked it up he uttered a rather singular exclamation mr havisham thought it singular but cedric had heard it before i soy he said whatre yer givin us this plainly embarrassed his lordship a little but he bore himself bravely everybody thinks it not true at first he said mr hobbs thought id had a sunstroke i didnt think i was going to like it myself but i like it better now im used to it the one who is the earl now hes my grandpapa and he wants me to do anything i like hes very kind if he is an earl and he sent me a lot of money by mr havisham and ive brought some to you to buy jake out and the end of the matter was that dick actually bought jake out and found himself the possessor of the business and some new brushes and a most astonishing sign and outfit he could not believe in his good luck any more easily than the applewoman of ancient lineage could believe in hers he walked about like a bootblack in a dream he stared at his young benefactor and felt as if he might wake up at any moment he scarcely seemed to realize anything until cedric put out his hand to shake hands with him before going away well goodbye he said and though he tried to speak steadily there was a little tremble in his voice and he winked his big brown eyes and i hope tradell be good im sorry im going away to leave you but perhaps i shall come back again when im an earl and i wish youd write to me because we were always good friends and if you write to me heres where you must send your letter and he gave him a slip of paper and my name isnt cedric errol any more its lord fauntleroy andand goodbye dick dick winked his eyes also and yet they looked rather moist about the lashes he was not an educated bootblack and he would have found it difficult to tell what he felt just then if he had tried perhaps that was why he didnt try and only winked his eyes and swallowed a lump in his throat i wish ye wasnt goin away he said in a husky voice then he winked his eyes again then he looked at mr havisham and touched his cap thanky sir fur bringin him down here an fur wot yeve done heshes a queer little feller he added ive allers thort a heap of him hes such a game little feller anan such a queer little un and when they turned away he stood and looked after them in a dazed kind of way and there was still a mist in his eyes and a lump in his throat as he watched the gallant little figure marching gayly along by the side of its tall rigid escort until the day of his departure his lordship spent as much time as possible with mr hobbs in the store gloom had settled upon mr hobbs he was much depressed in spirits when his young friend brought to him in triumph the parting gift of a gold watch and chain mr hobbs found it difficult to acknowledge it properly he laid the case on his stout knee and blew his nose violently several times theres something written on it said cedricinside the case i told the man myself what to say from his oldest friend lord fauntleroy to mr hobbs when this you see remember me i dont want you to forget me mr hobbs blew his nose very loudly again i shant forget you he said speaking a trifle huskily as dick had spoken nor dont you go and forget me when you get among the british arrystocracy i shouldnt forget you whoever i was among answered his lordship ive spent my happiest hours with you at least some of my happiest hours i hope youll come to see me sometime im sure my grandpapa would be very much pleased perhaps hell write and ask you when i tell him about you youyou wouldnt mind his being an earl would you i mean you wouldnt stay away just because he was one if he invited you to come id come to see you replied mr hobbs graciously so it seemed to be agreed that if he received a pressing invitation from the earl to come and spend a few months at dorincourt castle he was to lay aside his republican prejudices and pack his valise at once at last all the preparations were complete the day came when the trunks were taken to the steamer and the hour arrived when the carriage stood at the door then a curious feeling of loneliness came upon the little boy his mamma had been shut up in her room for some time when she came down the stairs her eyes looked large and wet and her sweet mouth was trembling cedric went to her and she bent down to him and he put his arms around her and they kissed each other he knew something made them both sorry though he scarcely knew what it was but one tender little thought rose to his lips we liked this little house dearest didnt we he said we always will like it wont we yesyes she answered in a low sweet voice yes darling and then they went into the carriage and cedric sat very close to her and as she looked back out of the window he looked at her and stroked her hand and held it close and then it seemed almost directly they were on the steamer in the midst of the wildest bustle and confusion carriages were driving down and leaving passengers passengers were getting into a state of excitement about baggage which had not arrived and threatened to be too late big trunks and cases were being bumped down and dragged about sailors were uncoiling ropes and hurrying to and fro officers were giving orders ladies and gentlemen and children and nurses were coming on boardsome were laughing and looked gay some were silent and sad here and there two or three were crying and touching their eyes with their handkerchiefs cedric found something to interest him on every side he looked at the piles of rope at the furled sails at the tall tall masts which seemed almost to touch the hot blue sky he began to make plans for conversing with the sailors and gaining some information on the subject of pirates it was just at the very last when he was standing leaning on the railing of the upper deck and watching the final preparations enjoying the excitement and the shouts of the sailors and wharfmen that his attention was called to a slight bustle in one of the groups not far from him some one was hurriedly forcing his way through this group and coming toward him it was a boy with something red in his hand it was dick he came up to cedric quite breathless ive run all the way he said ive come down to see ye off trades been prime i bought this for ye out o what i made yesterday ye kin wear it when ye get among the swells i lost the paper when i was tryin to get through them fellers downstairs they didnt want to let me up its a hankercher he poured it all forth as if in one sentence a bell rang and he made a leap away before cedric had time to speak goodbye he panted wear it when ye get among the swells and he darted off and was gone a few seconds later they saw him struggle through the crowd on the lower deck and rush on shore just before the gangplank was drawn in he stood on the wharf and waved his cap cedric held the handkerchief in his hand it was of bright red silk ornamented with purple horseshoes and horses heads there was a great straining and creaking and confusion the people on the wharf began to shout to their friends and the people on the steamer shouted back goodbye goodbye goodbye old fellow every one seemed to be saying dont forget us write when you get to liverpool goodbye goodbye little lord fauntleroy leaned forward and waved the red handkerchief goodbye dick he shouted lustily thank you goodbye dick and the big steamer moved away and the people cheered again and cedrics mother drew the veil over her eyes and on the shore there was left great confusion but dick saw nothing save that bright childish face and the bright hair that the sun shone on and the breeze lifted and he heard nothing but the hearty childish voice calling goodbye dick as little lord fauntleroy steamed slowly away from the home of his birth to the unknown land of his ancestors iv it was during the voyage that cedrics mother told him that his home was not to be hers and when he first understood it his grief was so great that mr havisham saw that the earl had been wise in making the arrangements that his mother should be quite near him and see him often for it was very plain he could not have borne the separation otherwise but his mother managed the little fellow so sweetly and lovingly and made him feel that she would be so near him that after a while he ceased to be oppressed by the fear of any real parting my house is not far from the castle ceddie she repeated each time the subject was referred toa very little way from yours and you can always run in and see me every day and you will have so many things to tell me and we shall be so happy together it is a beautiful place your papa has often told me about it he loved it very much and you will love it too i should love it better if you were there his small lordship said with a heavy little sigh he could not but feel puzzled by so strange a state of affairs which could put his dearest in one house and himself in another the fact was that mrs errol had thought it better not to tell him why this plan had been made i should prefer he should not be told she said to mr havisham he would not really understand he would only be shocked and hurt and i feel sure that his feeling for the earl will be a more natural and affectionate one if he does not know that his grandfather dislikes me so bitterly he has never seen hatred or hardness and it would be a great blow to him to find out that any one could hate me he is so loving himself and i am so dear to him it is better for him that he should not be told until he is much older and it is far better for the earl it would make a barrier between them even though ceddie is such a child so cedric only knew that there was some mysterious reason for the arrangement some reason which he was not old enough to understand but which would be explained when he was older he was puzzled but after all it was not the reason he cared about so much and after many talks with his mother in which she comforted him and placed before him the bright side of the picture the dark side of it gradually began to fade out though now and then mr havisham saw him sitting in some queer little oldfashioned attitude watching the sea with a very grave face and more than once he heard an unchildish sigh rise to his lips i dont like it he said once as he was having one of his almost venerable talks with the lawyer you dont know how much i dont like it but there are a great many troubles in this world and you have to bear them mary says so and ive heard mr hobbs say it too and dearest wants me to like to live with my grandpapa because you see all his children are dead and thats very mournful it makes you sorry for a man when all his children have diedand one was killed suddenly one of the things which always delighted the people who made the acquaintance of his young lordship was the sage little air he wore at times when he gave himself up to conversationcombined with his occasionally elderly remarks and the extreme innocence and seriousness of his round childish face it was irresistible he was such a handsome blooming curlyheaded little fellow that when he sat down and nursed his knee with his chubby hands and conversed with much gravity he was a source of great entertainment to his hearers gradually mr havisham had begun to derive a great deal of private pleasure and amusement from his society and so you are going to try to like the earl he said yes answered his lordship hes my relation and of course you have to like your relations and besides hes been very kind to me when a person does so many things for you and wants you to have everything you wish for of course youd like him if he wasnt your relation but when hes your relation and does that why youre very fond of him do you think suggested mr havisham that he will be fond of you well said cedric i think he will because you see im his relation too and im his boys little boy besides and well dont you seeof course he must be fond of me now or he wouldnt want me to have everything that i like and he wouldnt have sent you for me oh remarked the lawyer thats it is it yes said cedric thats it dont you think thats it too of course a man would be fond of his grandson the people who had been seasick had no sooner recovered from their seasickness and come on deck to recline in their steamerchairs and enjoy themselves than every one seemed to know the romantic story of little lord fauntleroy and every one took an interest in the little fellow who ran about the ship or walked with his mother or the tall thin old lawyer or talked to the sailors every one liked him he made friends everywhere he was ever ready to make friends when the gentlemen walked up and down the deck and let him walk with them he stepped out with a manly sturdy little tramp and answered all their jokes with much gay enjoyment when the ladies talked to him there was always laughter in the group of which he was the center when he played with the children there was always magnificent fun on hand among the sailors he had the heartiest friends he heard miraculous stories about pirates and shipwrecks and desert islands he learned to splice ropes and rig toy ships and gained an amount of information concerning topsls and mainsls quite surprising his conversation had indeed quite a nautical flavor at times and on one occasion he raised a shout of laughter in a group of ladies and gentlemen who were sitting on deck wrapped in shawls and overcoats by saying sweetly and with a very engaging expression shiver my timbers but its a cold day it surprised him when they laughed he had picked up this seafaring remark from an elderly naval man of the name of jerry who told him stories in which it occurred frequently to judge from his stories of his own adventures jerry had made some two or three thousand voyages and had been invariably shipwrecked on each occasion on an island densely populated with bloodthirsty cannibals judging also by these same exciting adventures he had been partially roasted and eaten frequently and had been scalped some fifteen or twenty times that is why he is so bald explained lord fauntleroy to his mamma after you have been scalped several times the hair never grows again jerrys never grew again after that last time when the king of the parromachaweekins did it with the knife made out of the skull of the chief of the wopslemumpkies he says it was one of the most serious times he ever had he was so frightened that his hair stood right straight up when the king flourished his knife and it never would lie down and the king wears it that way now and it looks something like a hairbrush i never heard anything like the asperiences jerry has had i should so like to tell mr hobbs about them sometimes when the weather was very disagreeable and people were kept below decks in the saloon a party of his grownup friends would persuade him to tell them some of these asperiences of jerrys and as he sat relating them with great delight and fervor there was certainly no more popular voyager on any ocean steamer crossing the atlantic than little lord fauntleroy he was always innocently and goodnaturedly ready to do his small best to add to the general entertainment and there was a charm in the very unconsciousness of his own childish importance jerrys stories intrust them very much he said to his mamma for my partyou must excuse me dearestbut sometimes i should have thought they couldnt be all quite true if they hadnt happened to jerry himself but as they all happened to jerrywell its very strange you know and perhaps sometimes he may forget and be a little mistaken as hes been scalped so often being scalped a great many times might make a person forgetful it was eleven days after he had said goodbye to his friend dick before he reached liverpool and it was on the night of the twelfth day that the carriage in which he and his mother and mr havisham had driven from the station stopped before the gates of court lodge they could not see much of the house in the darkness cedric only saw that there was a driveway under great arching trees and after the carriage had rolled down this driveway a short distance he saw an open door and a stream of bright light coming through it mary had come with them to attend her mistress and she had reached the house before them when cedric jumped out of the carriage he saw one or two servants standing in the wide bright hall and mary stood in the doorway lord fauntleroy sprang at her with a gay little shout did you get here mary he said heres mary dearest and he kissed the maid on her rough red cheek i am glad you are here mary mrs errol said to her in a low voice it is such a comfort to me to see you it takes the strangeness away and she held out her little hand which mary squeezed encouragingly she knew how this first strangeness must feel to this little mother who had left her own land and was about to give up her child the english servants looked with curiosity at both the boy and his mother they had heard all sorts of rumors about them both they knew how angry the old earl had been and why mrs errol was to live at the lodge and her little boy at the castle they knew all about the great fortune he was to inherit and about the savage old grandfather and his gout and his tempers hell have no easy time of it poor little chap they had said among themselves but they did not know what sort of a little lord had come among them they did not quite understand the character of the next earl of dorincourt he pulled off his overcoat quite as if he were used to doing things for himself and began to look about him he looked about the broad hall at the pictures and stags antlers and curious things that ornamented it they seemed curious to him because he had never seen such things before in a private house dearest he said this is a very pretty house isnt it i am glad you are going to live here its quite a large house it was quite a large house compared to the one in the shabby new york street and it was very pretty and cheerful mary led them upstairs to a bright chintzhung bedroom where a fire was burning and a large snowwhite persian cat was sleeping luxuriously on the white fur hearthrug it was the housekaper up at the castle maam sint her to yez explained mary its herself is a kindhearted lady an has had iverything done to prepar fur yez i seen her meself a few minnits an she was fond av the captin maam an graivs fur him and she said to say the big cat slapin on the rug moight make the room same homeloike to yez she knowed captin errol whin he was a byean a foine handsum bye she ses he was an a foine young man wid a plisint word fur every one great an shmall an ses i to her ses i hes lift a bye thats loike him maam fur a foiner little felly niver sthipped in shoeleather when they were ready they went downstairs into another big bright room its ceiling was low and the furniture was heavy and beautifully carved the chairs were deep and had high massive backs and there were queer shelves and cabinets with strange pretty ornaments on them there was a great tigerskin before the fire and an armchair on each side of it the stately white cat had responded to lord fauntleroys stroking and followed him downstairs and when he threw himself down upon the rug she curled herself up grandly beside him as if she intended to make friends cedric was so pleased that he put his head down by hers and lay stroking her not noticing what his mother and mr havisham were saying they were indeed speaking in a rather low tone mrs errol looked a little pale and agitated he need not go tonight she said he will stay with me tonight yes answered mr havisham in the same low tone it will not be necessary for him to go tonight i myself will go to the castle as soon as we have dined and inform the earl of our arrival mrs errol glanced down at cedric he was lying in a graceful careless attitude upon the blackandyellow skin the fire shone on his handsome flushed little face and on the tumbled curly hair spread out on the rug the big cat was purring in drowsy contentshe liked the caressing touch of the kind little hand on her fur mrs errol smiled faintly his lordship does not know all that he is taking from me she said rather sadly then she looked at the lawyer will you tell him if you please she said that i should rather not have the money the money mr havisham exclaimed you can not mean the income he proposed to settle upon you yes she answered quite simply i think i should rather not have it i am obliged to accept the house and i thank him for it because it makes it possible for me to be near my child but i have a little money of my ownenough to live simply uponand i should rather not take the other as he dislikes me so much i should feel a little as if i were selling cedric to him i am giving him up only because i love him enough to forget myself for his good and because his father would wish it to be so mr havisham rubbed his chin this is very strange he said he will be very angry he wont understand it i think he will understand it after he thinks it over she said i do not really need the money and why should i accept luxuries from the man who hates me so much that he takes my little boy from mehis sons child mr havisham looked reflective for a few moments i will deliver your message he said afterward and then the dinner was brought in and they sat down together the big cat taking a seat on a chair near cedrics and purring majestically throughout the meal when later in the evening mr havisham presented himself at the castle he was taken at once to the earl he found him sitting by the fire in a luxurious easychair his foot on a goutstool he looked at the lawyer sharply from under his shaggy eyebrows but mr havisham could see that in spite of his pretense at calmness he was nervous and secretly excited well he said well havisham come back have you whats the news lord fauntleroy and his mother are at court lodge replied mr havisham they bore the voyage very well and are in excellent health the earl made a halfimpatient sound and moved his hand restlessly glad to hear it he said brusquely so far so good make yourself comfortable have a glass of wine and settle down what else his lordship remains with his mother tonight tomorrow i will bring him to the castle the earls elbow was resting on the arm of his chair he put his hand up and shielded his eyes with it well he said go on you know i told you not to write to me about the matter and i know nothing whatever about it what kind of a lad is he i dont care about the mother what sort of a lad is he mr havisham drank a little of the glass of port he had poured out for himself and sat holding it in his hand it is rather difficult to judge of the character of a child of seven he said cautiously the earls prejudices were very intense he looked up quickly and uttered a rough word a fool is he he exclaimed or a clumsy cub his american blood tells does it i do not think it has injured him my lord replied the lawyer in his dry deliberate fashion i dont know much about children but i thought him rather a fine lad his manner of speech was always deliberate and unenthusiastic but he made it a trifle more so than usual he had a shrewd fancy that it would be better that the earl should judge for himself and be quite unprepared for his first interview with his grandson healthy and wellgrown asked my lord apparently very healthy and quite wellgrown replied the lawyer straightlimbed and well enough to look at demanded the earl a very slight smile touched mr havishams thin lips there rose up before his minds eye the picture he had left at court lodgethe beautiful graceful childs body lying upon the tigerskin in careless comfortthe bright tumbled hair spread on the rugthe bright rosy boys face rather a handsome boy i think my lord as boys go he said though i am scarcely a judge perhaps but you will find him somewhat different from most english children i dare say i havent a doubt of that snarled the earl a twinge of gout seizing him a lot of impudent little beggars those american children ive heard that often enough it is not exactly impudence in his case said mr havisham i can scarcely describe what the difference is he has lived more with older people than with children and the difference seems to be a mixture of maturity and childishness american impudence protested the earl ive heard of it before they call it precocity and freedom beastly impudent bad manners thats what it is mr havisham drank some more port he seldom argued with his lordly patronnever when his lordly patrons noble leg was inflamed by gout at such times it was always better to leave him alone so there was a silence of a few moments it was mr havisham who broke it i have a message to deliver from mrs errol he remarked i dont want any of her messages growled his lordship the less i hear of her the better this is a rather important one explained the lawyer she prefers not to accept the income you proposed to settle on her the earl started visibly whats that he cried out whats that mr havisham repeated his words she says it is not necessary and that as the relations between you are not friendly not friendly ejaculated my lord savagely i should say they were not friendly i hate to think of her a mercenary sharpvoiced american i dont wish to see her my lord said mr havisham you can scarcely call her mercenary she has asked for nothing she does not accept the money you offer her all done for effect snapped his noble lordship she wants to wheedle me into seeing her she thinks i shall admire her spirit i dont admire it its only american independence i wont have her living like a beggar at my park gates as shes the boys mother she has a position to keep up and she shall keep it up she shall have the money whether she likes it or not she wont spend it said mr havisham i dont care whether she spends it or not blustered my lord she shall have it sent to her she shant tell people that she has to live like a pauper because i have done nothing for her she wants to give the boy a bad opinion of me i suppose she has poisoned his mind against me already no said mr havisham i have another message which will prove to you that she has not done that i dont want to hear it panted the earl out of breath with anger and excitement and gout but mr havisham delivered it she asks you not to let lord fauntleroy hear anything which would lead him to understand that you separate him from her because of your prejudice against her he is very fond of her and she is convinced that it would cause a barrier to exist between you she says he would not comprehend it and it might make him fear you in some measure or at least cause him to feel less affection for you she has told him that he is too young to understand the reason but shall hear it when he is older she wishes that there should be no shadow on your first meeting the earl sank back into his chair his deepset fierce old eyes gleamed under his beetling brows come now he said still breathlessly come now you dont mean the mother hasnt told him not one word my lord replied the lawyer coolly that i can assure you the child is prepared to believe you the most amiable and affectionate of grandparents nothingabsolutely nothing has been said to him to give him the slightest doubt of your perfection and as i carried out your commands in every detail while in new york he certainly regards you as a wonder of generosity he does eh said the earl i give you my word of honor said mr havisham that lord fauntleroys impressions of you will depend entirely upon yourself and if you will pardon the liberty i take in making the suggestion i think you will succeed better with him if you take the precaution not to speak slightingly of his mother pooh pooh said the earl the youngster is only seven years old he has spent those seven years at his mothers side returned mr havisham and she has all his affection v it was late in the afternoon when the carriage containing little lord fauntleroy and mr havisham drove up the long avenue which led to the castle the earl had given orders that his grandson should arrive in time to dine with him and for some reason best known to himself he had also ordered that the child should be sent alone into the room in which he intended to receive him as the carriage rolled up the avenue lord fauntleroy sat leaning comfortably against the luxurious cushions and regarded the prospect with great interest he was in fact interested in everything he saw he had been interested in the carriage with its large splendid horses and their glittering harness he had been interested in the tall coachman and footman with their resplendent livery and he had been especially interested in the coronet on the panels and had struck up an acquaintance with the footman for the purpose of inquiring what it meant when the carriage reached the great gates of the park he looked out of the window to get a good view of the huge stone lions ornamenting the entrance the gates were opened by a motherly rosylooking woman who came out of a pretty ivycovered lodge two children ran out of the door of the house and stood looking with round wideopen eyes at the little boy in the carriage who looked at them also their mother stood courtesying and smiling and the children on receiving a sign from her made bobbing little courtesies too does she know me asked lord fauntleroy i think she must think she knows me and he took off his black velvet cap to her and smiled how do you do he said brightly goodafternoon the woman seemed pleased he thought the smile broadened on her rosy face and a kind look came into her blue eyes god bless your lordship she said god bless your pretty face good luck and happiness to your lordship welcome to you lord fauntleroy waved his cap and nodded to her again as the carriage rolled by her i like that woman he said she looks as if she liked boys i should like to come here and play with her children i wonder if she has enough to make up a company mr havisham did not tell him that he would scarcely be allowed to make playmates of the gatekeepers children the lawyer thought there was time enough for giving him that information the carriage rolled on and on between the great beautiful trees which grew on each side of the avenue and stretched their broad swaying branches in an arch across it cedric had never seen such treesthey were so grand and stately and their branches grew so low down on their huge trunks he did not then know that dorincourt castle was one of the most beautiful in all england that its park was one of the broadest and finest and its trees and avenue almost without rivals but he did know that it was all very beautiful he liked the big broadbranched trees with the late afternoon sunlight striking golden lances through them he liked the perfect stillness which rested on everything he felt a great strange pleasure in the beauty of which he caught glimpses under and between the sweeping boughsthe great beautiful spaces of the park with still other trees standing sometimes stately and alone and sometimes in groups now and then they passed places where tall ferns grew in masses and again and again the ground was azure with the bluebells swaying in the soft breeze several times he started up with a laugh of delight as a rabbit leaped up from under the greenery and scudded away with a twinkle of short white tail behind it once a covey of partridges rose with a sudden whir and flew away and then he shouted and clapped his hands its a beautiful place isnt it he said to mr havisham i never saw such a beautiful place its prettier even than central park he was rather puzzled by the length of time they were on their way how far is it he said at length from the gate to the front door it is between three and four miles answered the lawyer thats a long way for a person to live from his gate remarked his lordship every few minutes he saw something new to wonder at and admire when he caught sight of the deer some couched in the grass some standing with their pretty antlered heads turned with a halfstartled air toward the avenue as the carriage wheels disturbed them he was enchanted has there been a circus he cried or do they live here always whose are they they live here mr havisham told him they belong to the earl your grandfather it was not long after this that they saw the castle it rose up before them stately and beautiful and gray the last rays of the sun casting dazzling lights on its many windows it had turrets and battlements and towers a great deal of ivy grew upon its walls all the broad open space about it was laid out in terraces and lawns and beds of brilliant flowers its the most beautiful place i ever saw said cedric his round face flushing with pleasure it reminds any one of a kings palace i saw a picture of one once in a fairybook he saw the great entrancedoor thrown open and many servants standing in two lines looking at him he wondered why they were standing there and admired their liveries very much he did not know that they were there to do honor to the little boy to whom all this splendor would one day belongthe beautiful castle like the fairy kings palace the magnificent park the grand old trees the dells full of ferns and bluebells where the hares and rabbits played the dappled largeeyed deer couching in the deep grass it was only a couple of weeks since he had sat with mr hobbs among the potatoes and canned peaches with his legs dangling from the high stool it would not have been possible for him to realize that he had very much to do with all this grandeur at the head of the line of servants there stood an elderly woman in a rich plain black silk gown she had gray hair and wore a cap as he entered the hall she stood nearer than the rest and the child thought from the look in her eyes that she was going to speak to him mr havisham who held his hand paused a moment this is lord fauntleroy mrs mellon he said lord fauntleroy this is mrs mellon who is the housekeeper cedric gave her his hand his eyes lighting up was it you who sent the cat he said im much obliged to you maam mrs mellons handsome old face looked as pleased as the face of the lodgekeepers wife had done i should know his lordship anywhere she said to mr havisham he has the captains face and way its a great day this sir cedric wondered why it was a great day he looked at mrs mellon curiously it seemed to him for a moment as if there were tears in her eyes and yet it was evident she was not unhappy she smiled down on him the cat left two beautiful kittens here she said they shall be sent up to your lordships nursery mr havisham said a few words to her in a low voice in the library sir mrs mellon replied his lordship is to be taken there alone a few minutes later the very tall footman in livery who had escorted cedric to the library door opened it and announced lord fauntleroy my lord in quite a majestic tone if he was only a footman he felt it was rather a grand occasion when the heir came home to his own land and possessions and was ushered into the presence of the old earl whose place and title he was to take cedric crossed the threshold into the room it was a very large and splendid room with massive carven furniture in it and shelves upon shelves of books the furniture was so dark and the draperies so heavy the diamondpaned windows were so deep and it seemed such a distance from one end of it to the other that since the sun had gone down the effect of it all was rather gloomy for a moment cedric thought there was nobody in the room but soon he saw that by the fire burning on the wide hearth there was a large easychair and that in that chair some one was sittingsome one who did not at first turn to look at him but he had attracted attention in one quarter at least on the floor by the armchair lay a dog a huge tawny mastiff with body and limbs almost as big as a lions and this great creature rose majestically and slowly and marched toward the little fellow with a heavy step then the person in the chair spoke dougal he called come back sir but there was no more fear in little lord fauntleroys heart than there was unkindnesshe had been a brave little fellow all his life he put his hand on the big dogs collar in the most natural way in the world and they strayed forward together dougal sniffing as he went and then the earl looked up what cedric saw was a large old man with shaggy white hair and eyebrows and a nose like an eagles beak between his deep fierce eyes what the earl saw was a graceful childish figure in a black velvet suit with a lace collar and with lovelocks waving about the handsome manly little face whose eyes met his with a look of innocent goodfellowship if the castle was like the palace in a fairy story it must be owned that little lord fauntleroy was himself rather like a small copy of the fairy prince though he was not at all aware of the fact and perhaps was rather a sturdy young model of a fairy but there was a sudden glow of triumph and exultation in the fiery old earls heart as he saw what a strong beautiful boy this grandson was and how unhesitatingly he looked up as he stood with his hand on the big dogs neck it pleased the grim old nobleman that the child should show no shyness or fear either of the dog or of himself cedric looked at him just as he had looked at the woman at the lodge and at the housekeeper and came quite close to him are you the earl he said im your grandson you know that mr havisham brought im lord fauntleroy he held out his hand because he thought it must be the polite and proper thing to do even with earls i hope you are very well he continued with the utmost friendliness im very glad to see you the earl shook hands with him with a curious gleam in his eyes just at first he was so astonished that he scarcely knew what to say he stared at the picturesque little apparition from under his shaggy brows and took it all in from head to foot glad to see me are you he said yes answered lord fauntleroy very there was a chair near him and he sat down on it it was a highbacked rather tall chair and his feet did not touch the floor when he had settled himself in it but he seemed to be quite comfortable as he sat there and regarded his august relative intently but modestly ive kept wondering what you would look like he remarked i used to lie in my berth in the ship and wonder if you would be anything like my father am i asked the earl well cedric replied i was very young when he died and i may not remember exactly how he looked but i dont think you are like him you are disappointed i suppose suggested his grandfather oh no responded cedric politely of course you would like any one to look like your father but of course you would enjoy the way your grandfather looked even if he wasnt like your father you know how it is yourself about admiring your relations the earl leaned back in his chair and stared he could not be said to know how it was about admiring his relations he had employed most of his noble leisure in quarreling violently with them in turning them out of his house and applying abusive epithets to them and they all hated him cordially any boy would love his grandfather continued lord fauntleroy especially one that had been as kind to him as you have been another queer gleam came into the old noblemans eyes oh he said i have been kind to you have i yes answered lord fauntleroy brightly im ever so much obliged to you about bridget and the applewoman and dick bridget exclaimed the earl dick the applewoman yes explained cedric the ones you gave me all that money forthe money you told mr havisham to give me if i wanted it ha ejaculated his lordship thats it is it the money you were to spend as you liked what did you buy with it i should like to hear something about that he drew his shaggy eyebrows together and looked at the child sharply he was secretly curious to know in what way the lad had indulged himself oh said lord fauntleroy perhaps you didnt know about dick and the applewoman and bridget i forgot you lived such a long way off from them they were particular friends of mine and you see michael had the fever whos michael asked the earl michael is bridgets husband and they were in great trouble when a man is sick and cant work and has twelve children you know how it is and michael has always been a sober man and bridget used to come to our house and cry and the evening mr havisham was there she was in the kitchen crying because they had almost nothing to eat and couldnt pay the rent and i went in to see her and mr havisham sent for me and he said you had given him some money for me and i ran as fast as i could into the kitchen and gave it to bridget and that made it all right and bridget could scarcely believe her eyes thats why im so obliged to you oh said the earl in his deep voice that was one of the things you did for yourself was it what else dougal had been sitting by the tall chair the great dog had taken its place there when cedric sat down several times it had turned and looked up at the boy as if interested in the conversation dougal was a solemn dog who seemed to feel altogether too big to take lifes responsibilities lightly the old earl who knew the dog well had watched it with secret interest dougal was not a dog whose habit it was to make acquaintances rashly and the earl wondered somewhat to see how quietly the brute sat under the touch of the childish hand and just at this moment the big dog gave little lord fauntleroy one more look of dignified scrutiny and deliberately laid its huge lionlike head on the boys blackvelvet knee the small hand went on stroking this new friend as cedric answered well there was dick he said youd like dick hes so square this was an americanism the earl was not prepared for what does that mean he inquired lord fauntleroy paused a moment to reflect he was not very sure himself what it meant he had taken it for granted as meaning something very creditable because dick had been fond of using it i think it means that he wouldnt cheat any one he exclaimed or hit a boy who was under his size and that he blacks peoples boots very well and makes them shine as much as he can hes a perfessional bootblack and hes one of your acquaintances is he said the earl he is an old friend of mine replied his grandson not quite as old as mr hobbs but quite old he gave me a present just before the ship sailed he put his hand into his pocket and drew forth a neatly folded red object and opened it with an air of affectionate pride it was the red silk handkerchief with the large purple horseshoes and heads on it he gave me this said his young lordship i shall keep it always you can wear it round your neck or keep it in your pocket he bought it with the first money he earned after i bought jake out and gave him the new brushes its a keepsake i put some poetry in mr hobbss watch it was when this you see remember me when this i see i shall always remember dick the sensations of the right honorable the earl of dorincourt could scarcely be described he was not an old nobleman who was very easily bewildered because he had seen a great deal of the world but here was something he found so novel that it almost took his lordly breath away and caused him some singular emotions he had never cared for children he had been so occupied with his own pleasures that he had never had time to care for them his own sons had not interested him when they were very youngthough sometimes he remembered having thought cedrics father a handsome and strong little fellow he had been so selfish himself that he had missed the pleasure of seeing unselfishness in others and he had not known how tender and faithful and affectionate a kindhearted little child can be and how innocent and unconscious are its simple generous impulses a boy had always seemed to him a most objectionable little animal selfish and greedy and boisterous when not under strict restraint his own two eldest sons had given their tutors constant trouble and annoyance and of the younger one he fancied he had heard few complaints because the boy was of no particular importance it had never once occurred to him that he should like his grandson he had sent for the little cedric because his pride impelled him to do so if the boy was to take his place in the future he did not wish his name to be made ridiculous by descending to an uneducated boor he had been convinced the boy would be a clownish fellow if he were brought up in america he had no feeling of affection for the lad his only hope was that he should find him decently wellfeatured and with a respectable share of sense he had been so disappointed in his other sons and had been made so furious by captain errols american marriage that he had never once thought that anything creditable could come of it when the footman had announced lord fauntleroy he had almost dreaded to look at the boy lest he should find him all that he had feared it was because of this feeling that he had ordered that the child should be sent to him alone his pride could not endure that others should see his disappointment if he was to be disappointed his proud stubborn old heart therefore had leaped within him when the boy came forward with his graceful easy carriage his fearless hand on the big dogs neck even in the moments when he had hoped the most the earl had never hoped that his grandson would look like that it seemed almost too good to be true that this should be the boy he had dreaded to seethe child of the woman he so dislikedthis little fellow with so much beauty and such a brave childish grace the earls stern composure was quite shaken by this startling surprise and then their talk began and he was still more curiously moved and more and more puzzled in the first place he was so used to seeing people rather afraid and embarrassed before him that he had expected nothing else but that his grandson would be timid or shy but cedric was no more afraid of the earl than he had been of dougal he was not bold he was only innocently friendly and he was not conscious that there could be any reason why he should be awkward or afraid the earl could not help seeing that the little boy took him for a friend and treated him as one without having any doubt of him at all it was quite plain as the little fellow sat there in his tall chair and talked in his friendly way that it had never occurred to him that this large fiercelooking old man could be anything but kind to him and rather pleased to see him there and it was plain too that in his childish way he wished to please and interest his grandfather cross and hardhearted and worldly as the old earl was he could not help feeling a secret and novel pleasure in this very confidence after all it was not disagreeable to meet some one who did not distrust him or shrink from him or seem to detect the ugly part of his nature some one who looked at him with clear unsuspecting eyesif it was only a little boy in a black velvet suit so the old man leaned back in his chair and led his young companion on to telling him still more of himself and with that odd gleam in his eyes watched the little fellow as he talked lord fauntleroy was quite willing to answer all his questions and chatted on in his genial little way quite composedly he told him all about dick and jake and the applewoman and mr hobbs he described the republican rally in all the glory of its banners and transparencies torches and rockets in the course of the conversation he reached the fourth of july and the revolution and was just becoming enthusiastic when he suddenly recollected something and stopped very abruptly what is the matter demanded his grandfather why dont you go on lord fauntleroy moved rather uneasily in his chair it was evident to the earl that he was embarrassed by the thought which had just occurred to him i was just thinking that perhaps you mightnt like it he replied perhaps some one belonging to you might have been there i forgot you were an englishman you can go on said my lord no one belonging to me was there you forgot you were an englishman too oh no said cedric quickly im an american you are an englishman said the earl grimly your father was an englishman it amused him a little to say this but it did not amuse cedric the lad had never thought of such a development as this he felt himself grow quite hot up to the roots of his hair i was born in america he protested you have to be an american if you are born in america i beg your pardon with serious politeness and delicacy for contradicting you mr hobbs told me if there were another war you know i should have toto be an american the earl gave a grim half laughit was short and grim but it was a laugh you would would you he said he hated america and americans but it amused him to see how serious and interested this small patriot was he thought that so good an american might make a rather good englishman when he was a man they had not time to go very deep into the revolution againand indeed lord fauntleroy felt some delicacy about returning to the subjectbefore dinner was announced cedric left his chair and went to his noble kinsman he looked down at his gouty foot would you like me to help you he said politely you could lean on me you know once when mr hobbs hurt his foot with a potatobarrel rolling on it he used to lean on me the big footman almost periled his reputation and his situation by smiling he was an aristocratic footman who had always lived in the best of noble families and he had never smiled indeed he would have felt himself a disgraced and vulgar footman if he had allowed himself to be led by any circumstance whatever into such an indiscretion as a smile but he had a very narrow escape he only just saved himself by staring straight over the earls head at a very ugly picture the earl looked his valiant young relative over from head to foot do you think you could do it he asked gruffly i think i could said cedric im strong im seven you know you could lean on your stick on one side and on me on the other dick says ive a good deal of muscle for a boy thats only seven he shut his hand and moved it upward to his shoulder so that the earl might see the muscle dick had kindly approved of and his face was so grave and earnest that the footman found it necessary to look very hard indeed at the ugly picture well said the earl you may try cedric gave him his stick and began to assist him to rise usually the footman did this and was violently sworn at when his lordship had an extra twinge of gout the earl was not a very polite person as a rule and many a time the huge footmen about him quaked inside their imposing liveries but this evening he did not swear though his gouty foot gave him more twinges than one he chose to try an experiment he got up slowly and put his hand on the small shoulder presented to him with so much courage little lord fauntleroy made a careful step forward looking down at the gouty foot just lean on me he said with encouraging good cheer ill walk very slowly if the earl had been supported by the footman he would have rested less on his stick and more on his assistants arm and yet it was part of his experiment to let his grandson feel his burden as no light weight it was quite a heavy weight indeed and after a few steps his young lordships face grew quite hot and his heart beat rather fast but he braced himself sturdily remembering his muscle and dicks approval of it dont be afraid of leaning on me he panted im all rightifif it isnt a very long way it was not really very far to the diningroom but it seemed rather a long way to cedric before they reached the chair at the head of the table the hand on his shoulder seemed to grow heavier at every step and his face grew redder and hotter and his breath shorter but he never thought of giving up he stiffened his childish muscles held his head erect and encouraged the earl as he limped along does your foot hurt you very much when you stand on it he asked did you ever put it in hot water and mustard mr hobbs used to put his in hot water arnica is a very nice thing they tell me the big dog stalked slowly beside them and the big footman followed several times he looked very queer as he watched the little figure making the very most of all its strength and bearing its burden with such goodwill the earl too looked rather queer once as he glanced sidewise down at the flushed little face when they entered the room where they were to dine cedric saw it was a very large and imposing one and that the footman who stood behind the chair at the head of the table stared very hard as they came in but they reached the chair at last the hand was removed from his shoulder and the earl was fairly seated cedric took out dicks handkerchief and wiped his forehead its a warm night isnt it he said perhaps you need a fire becausebecause of your foot but it seems just a little warm to me his delicate consideration for his noble relatives feelings was such that he did not wish to seem to intimate that any of his surroundings were unnecessary you have been doing some rather hard work said the earl oh no said lord fauntleroy it wasnt exactly hard but i got a little warm a person will get warm in summer time and he rubbed his damp curls rather vigorously with the gorgeous handkerchief his own chair was placed at the other end of the table opposite his grandfathers it was a chair with arms and intended for a much larger individual than himself indeed everything he had seen so farthe great rooms with their high ceilings the massive furniture the big footman the big dog the earl himselfwere all of proportions calculated to make this little lad feel that he was very small indeed but that did not trouble him he had never thought himself very large or important and he was quite willing to accommodate himself even to circumstances which rather overpowered him perhaps he had never looked so little a fellow as when seated now in his great chair at the end of the table notwithstanding his solitary existence the earl chose to live in some state he was fond of his dinner and he dined in a formal style cedric looked at him across a glitter of splendid glass and plate which to his unaccustomed eyes seemed quite dazzling a stranger looking on might well have smiled at the picturethe great stately room the big liveried servants the bright lights the glittering silver and glass the fiercelooking old nobleman at the head of the table and the very small boy at the foot dinner was usually a very serious matter with the earland it was a very serious matter with the cook if his lordship was not pleased or had an indifferent appetite today however his appetite seemed a trifle better than usual perhaps because he had something to think of beside the flavor of the entrees and the management of the gravies his grandson gave him something to think of he kept looking at him across the table he did not say very much himself but he managed to make the boy talk he had never imagined that he could be entertained by hearing a child talk but lord fauntleroy at once puzzled and amused him and he kept remembering how he had let the childish shoulder feel his weight just for the sake of trying how far the boys courage and endurance would go and it pleased him to know that his grandson had not quailed and had not seemed to think even for a moment of giving up what he had undertaken to do you dont wear your coronet all the time remarked lord fauntleroy respectfully no replied the earl with his grim smile it is not becoming to me mr hobbs said you always wore it said cedric but after he thought it over he said he supposed you must sometimes take it off to put your hat on yes said the earl i take it off occasionally and one of the footmen suddenly turned aside and gave a singular little cough behind his hand cedric finished his dinner first and then he leaned back in his chair and took a survey of the room you must be very proud of your house he said its such a beautiful house i never saw anything so beautiful but of course as im only seven i havent seen much and you think i must be proud of it do you said the earl i should think any one would be proud of it replied lord fauntleroy i should be proud of it if it were my house everything about it is beautiful and the park and those treeshow beautiful they are and how the leaves rustle then he paused an instant and looked across the table rather wistfully its a very big house for just two people to live in isnt it he said it is quite large enough for two answered the earl do you find it too large his little lordship hesitated a moment i was only thinking he said that if two people lived in it who were not very good companions they might feel lonely sometimes do you think i shall make a good companion inquired the earl yes replied cedric i think you will mr hobbs and i were great friends he was the best friend i had except dearest the earl made a quick movement of his bushy eyebrows who is dearest she is my mother said lord fauntleroy in a rather low quiet little voice perhaps he was a trifle tired as his bedtime was nearing and perhaps after the excitement of the last few days it was natural he should be tired so perhaps too the feeling of weariness brought to him a vague sense of loneliness in the remembrance that tonight he was not to sleep at home watched over by the loving eyes of that best friend of his they had always been best friends this boy and his young mother he could not help thinking of her and the more he thought of her the less was he inclined to talk and by the time the dinner was at an end the earl saw that there was a faint shadow on his face but cedric bore himself with excellent courage and when they went back to the library though the tall footman walked on one side of his master the earls hand rested on his grandsons shoulder though not so heavily as before when the footman left them alone cedric sat down upon the hearthrug near dougal for a few minutes he stroked the dogs ears in silence and looked at the fire the earl watched him the boys eyes looked wistful and thoughtful and once or twice he gave a little sigh the earl sat still and kept his eyes fixed on his grandson fauntleroy he said at last what are you thinking of fauntleroy looked up with a manful effort at a smile i was thinking about dearest he said andand i think id better get up and walk up and down the room he rose up and put his hands in his small pockets and began to walk to and fro his eyes were very bright and his lips were pressed together but he kept his head up and walked firmly dougal moved lazily and looked at him and then stood up he walked over to the child and began to follow him uneasily fauntleroy drew one hand from his pocket and laid it on the dogs head hes a very nice dog he said hes my friend he knows how i feel how do you feel asked the earl it disturbed him to see the struggle the little fellow was having with his first feeling of homesickness but it pleased him to see that he was making so brave an effort to bear it well he liked this childish courage come here he said fauntleroy went to him i never was away from my own house before said the boy with a troubled look in his brown eyes it makes a person feel a strange feeling when he has to stay all night in another persons castle instead of in his own house but dearest is not very far away from me she told me to remember thatandand im sevenand i can look at the picture she gave me he put his hand in his pocket and brought out a small violet velvetcovered case this is it he said you see you press this spring and it opens and she is in there he had come close to the earls chair and as he drew forth the little case he leaned against the arm of it and against the old mans arm too as confidingly as if children had always leaned there there she is he said as the case opened and he looked up with a smile the earl knitted his brows he did not wish to see the picture but he looked at it in spite of himself and there looked up at him from it such a pretty young facea face so like the childs at his sidethat it quite startled him i suppose you think you are very fond of her he said yes answered lord fauntleroy in a gentle tone and with simple directness i do think so and i think its true you see mr hobbs was my friend and dick and bridget and mary and michael they were my friends too but dearestwell she is my close friend and we always tell each other everything my father left her to me to take care of and when i am a man i am going to work and earn money for her what do you think of doing inquired his grandfather his young lordship slipped down upon the hearthrug and sat there with the picture still in his hand he seemed to be reflecting seriously before he answered i did think perhaps i might go into business with mr hobbs he said but i should like to be a president well send you to the house of lords instead said his grandfather well remarked lord fauntleroy if i couldnt be a president and if that is a good business i shouldnt mind the grocery business is dull sometimes perhaps he was weighing the matter in his mind for he sat very quiet after this and looked at the fire for some time the earl did not speak again he leaned back in his chair and watched him a great many strange new thoughts passed through the old noblemans mind dougal had stretched himself out and gone to sleep with his head on his huge paws there was a long silence in about half an hours time mr havisham was ushered in the great room was very still when he entered the earl was still leaning back in his chair he moved as mr havisham approached and held up his hand in a gesture of warningit seemed as if he had scarcely intended to make the gestureas if it were almost involuntary dougal was still asleep and close beside the great dog sleeping also with his curly head upon his arm lay little lord fauntleroy vi when lord fauntleroy wakened in the morninghe had not wakened at all when he had been carried to bed the night beforethe first sounds he was conscious of were the crackling of a wood fire and the murmur of voices you will be careful dawson not to say anything about it he heard some one say he does not know why she is not to be with him and the reason is to be kept from him if thems his lordships orders mem another voice answered theyll have to be kep i suppose but if youll excuse the liberty mem as its between ourselves servant or no servant all i have to say is its a cruel thingparting that poor pretty young widdered cretur from her own flesh and blood and him such a little beauty and a nobleman born james and thomas mem last night in the servants hall they both of em say as they never see anythink in their two livesnor yet no other gentleman in liverylike that little fellows ways as innercent an polite an interested as if hed been sitting there dining with his best friendand the temper of a angel instead of one if youll excuse me mem as its well known is enough to curdle your blood in your veins at times and as to looks mem when we was rung for james and me to go into the library and bring him upstairs and james lifted him up in his arms what with his little innercent face all red and rosy and his little head on jamess shoulder and his hair hanging down all curly an shinin a prettier takiner sight youd never wish to see an its my opinion my lord wasnt blind to it neither for he looked at him and he says to james see you dont wake him he says cedric moved on his pillow and turned over opening his eyes there were two women in the room everything was bright and cheerful with gayflowered chintz there was a fire on the hearth and the sunshine was streaming in through the ivyentwined windows both women came toward him and he saw that one of them was mrs mellon the housekeeper and the other a comfortable middleaged woman with a face as kind and goodhumored as a face could be goodmorning my lord said mrs mellon did you sleep well his lordship rubbed his eyes and smiled goodmorning he said i didnt know i was here you were carried upstairs when you were asleep said the housekeeper this is your bedroom and this is dawson who is to take care of you fauntleroy sat up in bed and held out his hand to dawson as he had held it out to the earl how do you do maam he said im much obliged to you for coming to take care of me you can call her dawson my lord said the housekeeper with a smile she is used to being called dawson miss dawson or mrs dawson inquired his lordship just dawson my lord said dawson herself beaming all over neither miss nor missis bless your little heart will you get up now and let dawson dress you and then have your breakfast in the nursery i learned to dress myself many years ago thank you answered fauntleroy dearest taught me dearest is my mamma we had only mary to do all the workwashing and alland so of course it wouldnt do to give her so much trouble i can take my bath too pretty well if youll just be kind enough to zamine the corners after im done dawson and the housekeeper exchanged glances dawson will do anything you ask her to said mrs mellon that i will bless him said dawson in her comforting goodhumored voice he shall dress himself if he likes and ill stand by ready to help him if he wants me thank you responded lord fauntleroy its a little hard sometimes about the buttons you know and then i have to ask somebody he thought dawson a very kind woman and before the bath and the dressing were finished they were excellent friends and he had found out a great deal about her he had discovered that her husband had been a soldier and had been killed in a real battle and that her son was a sailor and was away on a long cruise and that he had seen pirates and cannibals and chinese people and turks and that he brought home strange shells and pieces of coral which dawson was ready to show at any moment some of them being in her trunk all this was very interesting he also found out that she had taken care of little children all her life and that she had just come from a great house in another part of england where she had been taking care of a beautiful little girl whose name was lady gwyneth vaughn and she is a sort of relation of your lordships said dawson and perhaps sometime you may see her do you think i shall said fauntleroy i should like that i never knew any little girls but i always like to look at them when he went into the adjoining room to take his breakfast and saw what a great room it was and found there was another adjoining it which dawson told him was his also the feeling that he was very small indeed came over him again so strongly that he confided it to dawson as he sat down to the table on which the pretty breakfast service was arranged i am a very little boy he said rather wistfully to live in such a large castle and have so many big roomsdont you think so oh come said dawson you feel just a little strange at first thats all but youll get over that very soon and then youll like it here its such a beautiful place you know its a very beautiful place of course said fauntleroy with a little sigh but i should like it better if i didnt miss dearest so i always had my breakfast with her in the morning and put the sugar and cream in her tea for her and handed her the toast that made it very sociable of course oh well answered dawson comfortingly you know you can see her every day and theres no knowing how much youll have to tell her bless you wait till youve walked about a bit and seen thingsthe dogs and the stables with all the horses in them theres one of them i know youll like to see is there exclaimed fauntleroy im very fond of horses i was very fond of jim he was the horse that belonged to mr hobbs grocery wagon he was a beautiful horse when he wasnt balky well said dawson you just wait till youve seen whats in the stables and deary me you havent looked even into the very next room yet what is there asked fauntleroy wait until youve had your breakfast and then you shall see said dawson at this he naturally began to grow curious and he applied himself assiduously to his breakfast it seemed to him that there must be something worth looking at in the next room dawson had such a consequential mysterious air now then he said slipping off his seat a few minutes later ive had enough can i go and look at it dawson nodded and led the way looking more mysterious and important than ever he began to be very much interested indeed when she opened the door of the room he stood upon the threshold and looked about him in amazement he did not speak he only put his hands in his pockets and stood there flushing up to his forehead and looking in he flushed up because he was so surprised and for the moment excited to see such a place was enough to surprise any ordinary boy the room was a large one too as all the rooms seemed to be and it appeared to him more beautiful than the rest only in a different way the furniture was not so massive and antique as was that in the rooms he had seen downstairs the draperies and rugs and walls were brighter there were shelves full of books and on the tables were numbers of toysbeautiful ingenious thingssuch as he had looked at with wonder and delight through the shop windows in new york it looks like a boys room he said at last catching his breath a little whom do they belong to go and look at them said dawson they belong to you to me he cried to me why do they belong to me who gave them to me and he sprang forward with a gay little shout it seemed almost too much to be believed it was grandpapa he said with his eyes as bright as stars i know it was grandpapa yes it was his lordship said dawson and if you will be a nice little gentleman and not fret about things and will enjoy yourself and be happy all the day he will give you anything you ask for it was a tremendously exciting morning there were so many things to be examined so many experiments to be tried each novelty was so absorbing that he could scarcely turn from it to look at the next and it was so curious to know that all this had been prepared for himself alone that even before he had left new york people had come down from london to arrange the rooms he was to occupy and had provided the books and playthings most likely to interest him did you ever know any one he said to dawson who had such a kind grandfather dawsons face wore an uncertain expression for a moment she had not a very high opinion of his lordship the earl she had not been in the house many days but she had been there long enough to hear the old noblemans peculiarities discussed very freely in the servants hall an of all the wicious savage hilltempered hold fellows it was ever my hillluck to wear livery hunder the tallest footman had said hes the wiolentest and wust by a long shot and this particular footman whose name was thomas had also repeated to his companions below stairs some of the earls remarks to mr havisham when they had been discussing these very preparations give him his own way and fill his rooms with toys my lord had said give him what will amuse him and hell forget about his mother quickly enough amuse him and fill his mind with other things and we shall have no trouble thats boy nature so perhaps having had this truly amiable object in view it did not please him so very much to find it did not seem to be exactly this particular boys nature the earl had passed a bad night and had spent the morning in his room but at noon after he had lunched he sent for his grandson fauntleroy answered the summons at once he came down the broad staircase with a bounding step the earl heard him run across the hall and then the door opened and he came in with red cheeks and sparkling eyes i was waiting for you to send for me he said i was ready a long time ago im ever so much obliged to you for all those things im ever so much obliged to you i have been playing with them all the morning oh said the earl you like them do you i like them so muchwell i couldnt tell you how much said fauntleroy his face glowing with delight theres one thats like baseball only you play it on a board with black and white pegs and you keep your score with some counters on a wire i tried to teach dawson but she couldnt quite understand it just at firstyou see she never played baseball being a lady and im afraid i wasnt very good at explaining it to her but you know all about it dont you im afraid i dont replied the earl its an american game isnt it is it something like cricket i never saw cricket said fauntleroy but mr hobbs took me several times to see baseball its a splendid game you get so excited would you like me to go and get my game and show it to you perhaps it would amuse you and make you forget about your foot does your foot hurt you very much this morning more than i enjoy was the answer then perhaps you couldnt forget it said the little fellow anxiously perhaps it would bother you to be told about the game do you think it would amuse you or do you think it would bother you go and get it said the earl it certainly was a novel entertainment thismaking a companion of a child who offered to teach him to play gamesbut the very novelty of it amused him there was a smile lurking about the earls mouth when cedric came back with the box containing the game in his arms and an expression of the most eager interest on his face may i pull that little table over here to your chair he asked ring for thomas said the earl he will place it for you oh i can do it myself answered fauntleroy its not very heavy very well replied his grandfather the lurking smile deepened on the old mans face as he watched the little fellows preparations there was such an absorbed interest in them the small table was dragged forward and placed by his chair and the game taken from its box and arranged upon it its very interesting when you once begin said fauntleroy you see the black pegs can be your side and the white ones mine theyre men you know and once round the field is a home run and counts oneand these are the outsand here is the first base and thats the second and thats the third and thats the home base he entered into the details of explanation with the greatest animation he showed all the attitudes of pitcher and catcher and batter in the real game and gave a dramatic description of a wonderful hot ball he had seen caught on the glorious occasion on which he had witnessed a match in company with mr hobbs his vigorous graceful little body his eager gestures his simple enjoyment of it all were pleasant to behold when at last the explanations and illustrations were at an end and the game began in good earnest the earl still found himself entertained his young companion was wholly absorbed he played with all his childish heart his gay little laughs when he made a good throw his enthusiasm over a home run his impartial delight over his own good luck and his opponents would have given a flavor to any game if a week before any one had told the earl of dorincourt that on that particular morning he would be forgetting his gout and his bad temper in a childs game played with black and white wooden pegs on a gayly painted board with a curlyheaded small boy for a companion he would without doubt have made himself very unpleasant and yet he certainly had forgotten himself when the door opened and thomas announced a visitor the visitor in question who was an elderly gentleman in black and no less a person than the clergyman of the parish was so startled by the amazing scene which met his eye that he almost fell back a pace and ran some risk of colliding with thomas there was in fact no part of his duty that the reverend mr mordaunt found so decidedly unpleasant as that part which compelled him to call upon his noble patron at the castle his noble patron indeed usually made these visits as disagreeable as it lay in his lordly power to make them he abhorred churches and charities and flew into violent rages when any of his tenantry took the liberty of being poor and ill and needing assistance when his gout was at its worst he did not hesitate to announce that he would not be bored and irritated by being told stories of their miserable misfortunes when his gout troubled him less and he was in a somewhat more humane frame of mind he would perhaps give the rector some money after having bullied him in the most painful manner and berated the whole parish for its shiftlessness and imbecility but whatsoever his mood he never failed to make as many sarcastic and embarrassing speeches as possible and to cause the reverend mr mordaunt to wish it were proper and christianlike to throw something heavy at him during all the years in which mr mordaunt had been in charge of dorincourt parish the rector certainly did not remember having seen his lordship of his own free will do any one a kindness or under any circumstances whatever show that he thought of any one but himself he had called today to speak to him of a specially pressing case and as he had walked up the avenue he had for two reasons dreaded his visit more than usual in the first place he knew that his lordship had for several days been suffering with the gout and had been in so villainous a humor that rumors of it had even reached the villagecarried there by one of the young women servants to her sister who kept a little shop and retailed darningneedles and cotton and peppermints and gossip as a means of earning an honest living what mrs dibble did not know about the castle and its inmates and the farmhouses and their inmates and the village and its population was really not worth being talked about and of course she knew everything about the castle because her sister jane shorts was one of the upper housemaids and was very friendly and intimate with thomas and the way his lordship do go on said mrs dibble over the counter and the way he do use language mr thomas told jane herself no flesh and blood as is in livery could standfor throw a plate of toast at mr thomas hisself he did not more than two days since and if it werent for other things being agreeable and the society below stairs most genteel warning would have been gave within a hour and the rector had heard all this for somehow the earl was a favorite black sheep in the cottages and farmhouses and his bad behavior gave many a good woman something to talk about when she had company to tea and the second reason was even worse because it was a new one and had been talked about with the most excited interest who did not know of the old noblemans fury when his handsome son the captain had married the american lady who did not know how cruelly he had treated the captain and how the big gay sweetsmiling young man who was the only member of the grand family any one liked had died in a foreign land poor and unforgiven who did not know how fiercely his lordship had hated the poor young creature who had been this sons wife and how he had hated the thought of her child and never meant to see the boyuntil his two sons died and left him without an heir and then who did not know that he had looked forward without any affection or pleasure to his grandsons coming and that he had made up his mind that he should find the boy a vulgar awkward pert american lad more likely to disgrace his noble name than to honor it the proud angry old man thought he had kept all his thoughts secret he did not suppose any one had dared to guess at much less talk over what he felt and dreaded but his servants watched him and read his face and his illhumors and fits of gloom and discussed them in the servants hall and while he thought himself quite secure from the common herd thomas was telling jane and the cook and the butler and the housemaids and the other footmen that it was his opinion that the hold man was wuss than usual athinkin hover the captings boy an hanticipatin as he wont be no credit to the fambly an serve him right added thomas hits is hown fault wot can he iggspect from a child brought up in pore circumstances in that there low hamerica and as the reverend mr mordaunt walked under the great trees he remembered that this questionable little boy had arrived at the castle only the evening before and that there were nine chances to one that his lordships worst fears were realized and twentytwo chances to one that if the poor little fellow had disappointed him the earl was even now in a tearing rage and ready to vent all his rancor on the first person who calledwhich it appeared probable would be his reverend self judge then of his amazement when as thomas opened the library door his ears were greeted by a delighted ring of childish laughter thats two out shouted an excited clear little voice you see its two out and there was the earls chair and the goutstool and his foot on it and by him a small table and a game on it and quite close to him actually leaning against his arm and his ungouty knee was a little boy with face glowing and eyes dancing with excitement its two out the little stranger cried you hadnt any luck that time had youand then they both recognized at once that some one had come in the earl glanced around knitting his shaggy eyebrows as he had a trick of doing and when he saw who it was mr mordaunt was still more surprised to see that he looked even less disagreeable than usual instead of more so in fact he looked almost as if he had forgotten for the moment how disagreeable he was and how unpleasant he really could make himself when he tried ah he said in his harsh voice but giving his hand rather graciously goodmorning mordaunt ive found a new employment you see he put his other hand on cedrics shoulderperhaps deep down in his heart there was a stir of gratified pride that it was such an heir he had to present there was a spark of something like pleasure in his eyes as he moved the boy slightly forward this is the new lord fauntleroy he said fauntleroy this is mr mordaunt the rector of the parish fauntleroy looked up at the gentleman in the clerical garments and gave him his hand i am very glad to make your acquaintance sir he said remembering the words he had heard mr hobbs use on one or two occasions when he had been greeting a new customer with ceremony cedric felt quite sure that one ought to be more than usually polite to a minister mr mordaunt held the small hand in his a moment as he looked down at the childs face smiling involuntarily he liked the little fellow from that instantas in fact people always did like him and it was not the boys beauty and grace which most appealed to him it was the simple natural kindliness in the little lad which made any words he uttered however quaint and unexpected sound pleasant and sincere as the rector looked at cedric he forgot to think of the earl at all nothing in the world is so strong as a kind heart and somehow this kind little heart though it was only the heart of a child seemed to clear all the atmosphere of the big gloomy room and make it brighter i am delighted to make your acquaintance lord fauntleroy said the rector you made a long journey to come to us a great many people will be glad to know you made it safely it was a long way answered fauntleroy but dearest my mother was with me and i wasnt lonely of course you are never lonely if your mother is with you and the ship was beautiful take a chair mordaunt said the earl mr mordaunt sat down he glanced from fauntleroy to the earl your lordship is greatly to be congratulated he said warmly but the earl plainly had no intention of showing his feelings on the subject he is like his father he said rather gruffly let us hope hell conduct himself more creditably and then he added well what is it this morning mordaunt who is in trouble now this was not as bad as mr mordaunt had expected but he hesitated a second before he began it is higgins he said higgins of edge farm he has been very unfortunate he was ill himself last autumn and his children had scarlet fever i cant say that he is a very good manager but he has had illluck and of course he is behindhand in many ways he is in trouble about his rent now newick tells him if he doesnt pay it he must leave the place and of course that would be a very serious matter his wife is ill and he came to me yesterday to beg me to see about it and ask you for time he thinks if you would give him time he could catch up again they all think that said the earl looking rather black fauntleroy made a movement forward he had been standing between his grandfather and the visitor listening with all his might he had begun to be interested in higgins at once he wondered how many children there were and if the scarlet fever had hurt them very much his eyes were wide open and were fixed upon mr mordaunt with intent interest as that gentleman went on with the conversation higgins is a wellmeaning man said the rector making an effort to strengthen his plea he is a bad enough tenant replied his lordship and he is always behindhand newick tells me he is in great trouble now said the rector he is very fond of his wife and children and if the farm is taken from him they may literally starve he can not give them the nourishing things they need two of the children were left very low after the fever and the doctor orders for them wine and luxuries that higgins can not afford at this fauntleroy moved a step nearer that was the way with michael he said the earl slightly started i forgot you he said i forgot we had a philanthropist in the room who was michael and the gleam of queer amusement came back into the old mans deepset eyes he was bridgets husband who had the fever answered fauntleroy and he couldnt pay the rent or buy wine and things and you gave me that money to help him the earl drew his brows together into a curious frown which somehow was scarcely grim at all he glanced across at mr mordaunt i dont know what sort of landed proprietor he will make he said i told havisham the boy was to have what he wantedanything he wantedand what he wanted it seems was money to give to beggars oh but they werent beggars said fauntleroy eagerly michael was a splendid bricklayer they all worked oh said the earl they were not beggars they were splendid bricklayers and bootblacks and applewomen he bent his gaze on the boy for a few seconds in silence the fact was that a new thought was coming to him and though perhaps it was not prompted by the noblest emotions it was not a bad thought come here he said at last fauntleroy went and stood as near to him as possible without encroaching on the gouty foot what would you do in this case his lordship asked it must be confessed that mr mordaunt experienced for the moment a curious sensation being a man of great thoughtfulness and having spent so many years on the estate of dorincourt knowing the tenantry rich and poor the people of the village honest and industrious dishonest and lazy he realized very strongly what power for good or evil would be given in the future to this one small boy standing there his brown eyes wide open his hands deep in his pockets and the thought came to him also that a great deal of power might perhaps through the caprice of a proud selfindulgent old man be given to him now and that if his young nature were not a simple and generous one it might be the worst thing that could happen not only for others but for himself and what would you do in such a case demanded the earl fauntleroy drew a little nearer and laid one hand on his knee with the most confiding air of good comradeship if i were very rich he said and not only just a little boy i should let him stay and give him the things for his children but then i am only a boy then after a seconds pause in which his face brightened visibly you can do anything cant you he said humph said my lord staring at him thats your opinion is it and he was not displeased either i mean you can give any one anything said fauntleroy whos newick he is my agent answered the earl and some of my tenants are not overfond of him are you going to write him a letter now inquired fauntleroy shall i bring you the pen and ink i can take the game off this table it plainly had not for an instant occurred to him that newick would be allowed to do his worst the earl paused a moment still looking at him can you write he asked yes answered cedric but not very well move the things from the table commanded my lord and bring the pen and ink and a sheet of paper from my desk mr mordaunts interest began to increase fauntleroy did as he was told very deftly in a few moments the sheet of paper the big inkstand and the pen were ready there he said gayly now you can write it you are to write it said the earl i exclaimed fauntleroy and a flush overspread his forehead will it do if i write it i dont always spell quite right when i havent a dictionary and nobody tells me it will do answered the earl higgins will not complain of the spelling im not the philanthropist you are dip your pen in the ink fauntleroy took up the pen and dipped it in the inkbottle then he arranged himself in position leaning on the table now he inquired what must i say you may say higgins is not to be interfered with for the present and sign it fauntleroy said the earl fauntleroy dipped his pen in the ink again and resting his arm began to write it was rather a slow and serious process but he gave his whole soul to it after a while however the manuscript was complete and he handed it to his grandfather with a smile slightly tinged with anxiety do you think it will do he asked the earl looked at it and the corners of his mouth twitched a little yes he answered higgins will find it entirely satisfactory and he handed it to mr mordaunt what mr mordaunt found written was this dear mr newik if you pleas mr higins is not to be intur feared with for the present and oblige yours rispecferly fauntleroy mr hobbs always signed his letters that way said fauntleroy and i thought id better say please is that exactly the right way to spell interfered its not exactly the way it is spelled in the dictionary answered the earl i was afraid of that said fauntleroy i ought to have asked you see thats the way with words of more than one syllable you have to look in the dictionary its always safest ill write it over again and write it over again he did making quite an imposing copy and taking precautions in the matter of spelling by consulting the earl himself spelling is a curious thing he said its so often different from what you expect it to be i used to think please was spelled plees but it isnt you know and youd think dear was spelled dere if you didnt inquire sometimes it almost discourages you when mr mordaunt went away he took the letter with him and he took something else with him alsonamely a pleasanter feeling and a more hopeful one than he had ever carried home with him down that avenue on any previous visit he had made at dorincourt castle when he was gone fauntleroy who had accompanied him to the door went back to his grandfather may i go to dearest now he asked i think she will be waiting for me the earl was silent a moment there is something in the stable for you to see first he said ring the bell if you please said fauntleroy with his quick little flush im very much obliged but i think id better see it tomorrow she will be expecting me all the time very well answered the earl we will order the carriage then he added dryly its a pony fauntleroy drew a long breath a pony he exclaimed whose pony is it yours replied the earl mine cried the little fellow minelike the things upstairs yes said his grandfather would you like to see it shall i order it to be brought around fauntleroys cheeks grew redder and redder i never thought i should have a pony he said i never thought that how glad dearest will be you give me everything dont you do you wish to see it inquired the earl fauntleroy drew a long breath i want to see it he said i want to see it so much i can hardly wait but im afraid there isnt time you must go and see your mother this afternoon asked the earl you think you cant put it off why said fauntleroy she has been thinking about me all the morning and i have been thinking about her oh said the earl you have have you ring the bell as they drove down the avenue under the arching trees he was rather silent but fauntleroy was not he talked about the pony what color was it how big was it what was its name what did it like to eat best how old was it how early in the morning might he get up and see it dearest will be so glad he kept saying she will be so much obliged to you for being so kind to me she knows i always liked ponies so much but we never thought i should have one there was a little boy on fifth avenue who had one and he used to ride out every morning and we used to take a walk past his house to see him he leaned back against the cushions and regarded the earl with rapt interest for a few minutes and in entire silence i think you must be the best person in the world he burst forth at last you are always doing good arent youand thinking about other people dearest says that is the best kind of goodness not to think about yourself but to think about other people that is just the way you are isnt it his lordship was so dumfounded to find himself presented in such agreeable colors that he did not know exactly what to say he felt that he needed time for reflection to see each of his ugly selfish motives changed into a good and generous one by the simplicity of a child was a singular experience fauntleroy went on still regarding him with admiring eyesthose great clear innocent eyes you make so many people happy he said theres michael and bridget and their ten children and the applewoman and dick and mr hobbs and mr higgins and mrs higgins and their children and mr mordauntbecause of course he was gladand dearest and me about the pony and all the other things do you know ive counted it up on my fingers and in my mind and its twentyseven people youve been kind to thats a good manytwentyseven and i was the person who was kind to themwas i said the earl why yes you know answered fauntleroy you made them all happy do you know with some delicate hesitation that people are sometimes mistaken about earls when they dont know them mr hobbs was i am going to write him and tell him about it what was mr hobbss opinion of earls asked his lordship well you see the difficulty was replied his young companion that he didnt know any and hed only read about them in books he thoughtyou mustnt mind itthat they were gory tyrants and he said he wouldnt have them hanging around his store but if hed known you im sure he would have felt quite different i shall tell him about you what shall you tell him i shall tell him said fauntleroy glowing with enthusiasm that you are the kindest man i ever heard of and you are always thinking of other people and making them happy andand i hope when i grow up i shall be just like you just like me repeated his lordship looking at the little kindling face and a dull red crept up under his withered skin and he suddenly turned his eyes away and looked out of the carriage window at the great beechtrees with the sun shining on their glossy redbrown leaves just like you said fauntleroy adding modestly if i can perhaps im not good enough but im going to try the carriage rolled on down the stately avenue under the beautiful broadbranched trees through the spaces of green shade and lanes of golden sunlight fauntleroy saw again the lovely places where the ferns grew high and the bluebells swayed in the breeze he saw the deer standing or lying in the deep grass turn their large startled eyes as the carriage passed and caught glimpses of the brown rabbits as they scurried away he heard the whir of the partridges and the calls and songs of the birds and it all seemed even more beautiful to him than before all his heart was filled with pleasure and happiness in the beauty that was on every side but the old earl saw and heard very different things though he was apparently looking out too he saw a long life in which there had been neither generous deeds nor kind thoughts he saw years in which a man who had been young and strong and rich and powerful had used his youth and strength and wealth and power only to please himself and kill time as the days and years succeeded each other he saw this man when the time had been killed and old age had come solitary and without real friends in the midst of all his splendid wealth he saw people who disliked or feared him and people who would flatter and cringe to him but no one who really cared whether he lived or died unless they had something to gain or lose by it he looked out on the broad acres which belonged to him and he knew what fauntleroy did nothow far they extended what wealth they represented and how many people had homes on their soil and he knew tooanother thing fauntleroy did notthat in all those homes humble or welltodo there was probably not one person however much he envied the wealth and stately name and power and however willing he would have been to possess them who would for an instant have thought of calling the noble owner good or wishing as this simplesouled little boy had to be like him and it was not exactly pleasant to reflect upon even for a cynical worldly old man who had been sufficient unto himself for seventy years and who had never deigned to care what opinion the world held of him so long as it did not interfere with his comfort or entertainment and the fact was indeed that he had never before condescended to reflect upon it at all and he only did so now because a child had believed him better than he was and by wishing to follow in his illustrious footsteps and imitate his example had suggested to him the curious question whether he was exactly the person to take as a model fauntleroy thought the earls foot must be hurting him his brows knitted themselves together so as he looked out at the park and thinking this the considerate little fellow tried not to disturb him and enjoyed the trees and the ferns and the deer in silence but at last the carriage having passed the gates and bowled through the green lanes for a short distance stopped they had reached court lodge and fauntleroy was out upon the ground almost before the big footman had time to open the carriage door the earl wakened from his reverie with a start what he said are we here yes said fauntleroy let me give you your stick just lean on me when you get out i am not going to get out replied his lordship brusquely notnot to see dearest exclaimed fauntleroy with astonished face dearest will excuse me said the earl dryly go to her and tell her that not even a new pony would keep you away she will be disappointed said fauntleroy she will want to see you very much i am afraid not was the answer the carriage will call for you as we come backtell jeffries to drive on thomas thomas closed the carriage door and after a puzzled look fauntleroy ran up the drive the earl had the opportunityas mr havisham once hadof seeing a pair of handsome strong little legs flash over the ground with astonishing rapidity evidently their owner had no intention of losing any time the carriage rolled slowly away but his lordship did not at once lean back he still looked out through a space in the trees he could see the house door it was wide open the little figure dashed up the steps another figurea little figure too slender and young in its black gownran to meet it it seemed as if they flew together as fauntleroy leaped into his mothers arms hanging about her neck and covering her sweet young face with kisses vii on the following sunday morning mr mordaunt had a large congregation indeed he could scarcely remember any sunday on which the church had been so crowded people appeared upon the scene who seldom did him the honor of coming to hear his sermons there were even people from hazelton which was the next parish there were hearty sunburned farmers stout comfortable applecheeked wives in their best bonnets and most gorgeous shawls and half a dozen children or so to each family the doctors wife was there with her four daughters mrs kimsey and mr kimsey who kept the druggists shop and made pills and did up powders for everybody within ten miles sat in their pew mrs dibble in hers miss smiff the village dressmaker and her friend miss perkins the milliner sat in theirs the doctors young man was present and the druggists apprentice in fact almost every family on the county side was represented in one way or another in the course of the preceding week many wonderful stories had been told of little lord fauntleroy mrs dibble had been kept so busy attending to customers who came in to buy a pennyworth of needles or a haporth of tape and to hear what she had to relate that the little shop bell over the door had nearly tinkled itself to death over the coming and going mrs dibble knew exactly how his small lordships rooms had been furnished for him what expensive toys had been bought how there was a beautiful brown pony awaiting him and a small groom to attend it and a little dogcart with silvermounted harness and she could tell too what all the servants had said when they had caught glimpses of the child on the night of his arrival and how every female below stairs had said it was a shame so it was to part the poor pretty dear from his mother and had all declared their hearts came into their mouths when he went alone into the library to see his grandfather for there was no knowing how hed be treated and his lordships temper was enough to fluster them with old heads on their shoulders let alone a child but if youll believe me mrs jennifer mum mrs dibble had said fear that child does not knowso mr thomas hisself says an set an smile he did an talked to his lordship as if theyd been friends ever since his first hour an the earl so took aback mr thomas says that he couldnt do nothing but listen and stare from under his eyebrows an its mr thomass opinion mrs bates mum that bad as he is he was pleased in his secret soul an proud too for a handsomer little fellow or with better manners though so oldfashioned mr thomas says hed never wish to see and then there had come the story of higgins the reverend mr mordaunt had told it at his own dinner table and the servants who had heard it had told it in the kitchen and from there it had spread like wildfire and on marketday when higgins had appeared in town he had been questioned on every side and newick had been questioned too and in response had shown to two or three people the note signed fauntleroy and so the farmers wives had found plenty to talk of over their tea and their shopping and they had done the subject full justice and made the most of it and on sunday they had either walked to church or had been driven in their gigs by their husbands who were perhaps a trifle curious themselves about the new little lord who was to be in time the owner of the soil it was by no means the earls habit to attend church but he chose to appear on this first sundayit was his whim to present himself in the huge family pew with fauntleroy at his side there were many loiterers in the churchyard and many lingerers in the lane that morning there were groups at the gates and in the porch and there had been much discussion as to whether my lord would really appear or not when this discussion was at its height one good woman suddenly uttered an exclamation eh she said that must be the mother pretty young thing all who heard turned and looked at the slender figure in black coming up the path the veil was thrown back from her face and they could see how fair and sweet it was and how the bright hair curled as softly as a childs under the little widows cap she was not thinking of the people about she was thinking of cedric and of his visits to her and his joy over his new pony on which he had actually ridden to her door the day before sitting very straight and looking very proud and happy but soon she could not help being attracted by the fact that she was being looked at and that her arrival had created some sort of sensation she first noticed it because an old woman in a red cloak made a bobbing courtesy to her and then another did the same thing and said god bless you my lady and one man after another took off his hat as she passed for a moment she did not understand and then she realized that it was because she was little lord fauntleroys mother that they did so and she flushed rather shyly and smiled and bowed too and said thank you in a gentle voice to the old woman who had blessed her to a person who had always lived in a bustling crowded american city this simple deference was very novel and at first just a little embarrassing but after all she could not help liking and being touched by the friendly warmheartedness of which it seemed to speak she had scarcely passed through the stone porch into the church before the great event of the day happened the carriage from the castle with its handsome horses and tall liveried servants bowled around the corner and down the green lane here they come went from one lookeron to another and then the carriage drew up and thomas stepped down and opened the door and a little boy dressed in black velvet and with a splendid mop of bright waving hair jumped out every man woman and child looked curiously upon him hes the captain over again said those of the onlookers who remembered his father hes the captains self to the life he stood there in the sunlight looking up at the earl as thomas helped that nobleman out with the most affectionate interest that could be imagined the instant he could help he put out his hand and offered his shoulder as if he had been seven feet high it was plain enough to every one that however it might be with other people the earl of dorincourt struck no terror into the breast of his grandson just lean on me they heard him say how glad the people are to see you and how well they all seem to know you take off your cap fauntleroy said the earl they are bowing to you to me cried fauntleroy whipping off his cap in a moment baring his bright head to the crowd and turning shining puzzled eyes on them as he tried to bow to every one at once god bless your lordship said the courtesying redcloaked old woman who had spoken to his mother long life to you thank you maam said fauntleroy and then they went into the church and were looked at there on their way up the aisle to the square redcushioned and curtained pew when fauntleroy was fairly seated he made two discoveries which pleased him the first that across the church where he could look at her his mother sat and smiled at him the second that at one end of the pew against the wall knelt two quaint figures carven in stone facing each other as they kneeled on either side of a pillar supporting two stone missals their pointed hands folded as if in prayer their dress very antique and strange on the tablet by them was written something of which he could only read the curious words here lyeth ye bodye of gregorye arthure fyrst earle of dorincourt allsoe of alisone hildegarde hys wyfe may i whisper inquired his lordship devoured by curiosity what is it said his grandfather who are they some of your ancestors answered the earl who lived a few hundred years ago perhaps said lord fauntleroy regarding them with respect perhaps i got my spelling from them and then he proceeded to find his place in the church service when the music began he stood up and looked across at his mother smiling he was very fond of music and his mother and he often sang together so he joined in with the rest his pure sweet high voice rising as clear as the song of a bird he quite forgot himself in his pleasure in it the earl forgot himself a little too as he sat in his curtainshielded corner of the pew and watched the boy cedric stood with the big psalter open in his hands singing with all his childish might his face a little uplifted happily and as he sang a long ray of sunshine crept in and slanting through a golden pane of a stained glass window brightened the falling hair about his young head his mother as she looked at him across the church felt a thrill pass through her heart and a prayer rose in it tooa prayer that the pure simple happiness of his childish soul might last and that the strange great fortune which had fallen to him might bring no wrong or evil with it there were many soft anxious thoughts in her tender heart in those new days oh ceddie she had said to him the evening before as she hung over him in saying goodnight before he went away oh ceddie dear i wish for your sake i was very clever and could say a great many wise things but only be good dear only be brave only be kind and true always and then you will never hurt any one so long as you live and you may help many and the big world may be better because my little child was born and that is best of all ceddieit is better than everything else that the world should be a little better because a man has livedeven ever so little better dearest and on his return to the castle fauntleroy had repeated her words to his grandfather and i thought about you when she said that he ended and i told her that was the way the world was because you had lived and i was going to try if i could be like you and what did she say to that asked his lordship a trifle uneasily she said that was right and we must always look for good in people and try to be like it perhaps it was this the old man remembered as he glanced through the divided folds of the red curtain of his pew many times he looked over the peoples heads to where his sons wife sat alone and he saw the fair face the unforgiven dead had loved and the eyes which were so like those of the child at his side but what his thoughts were and whether they were hard and bitter or softened a little it would have been hard to discover as they came out of church many of those who had attended the service stood waiting to see them pass as they neared the gate a man who stood with his hat in his hand made a step forward and then hesitated he was a middleaged farmer with a careworn face well higgins said the earl fauntleroy turned quickly to look at him oh he exclaimed is it mr higgins yes answered the earl dryly and i suppose he came to take a look at his new landlord yes my lord said the man his sunburned face reddening mr newick told me his young lordship was kind enough to speak for me and i thought id like to say a word of thanks if i might be allowed perhaps he felt some wonder when he saw what a little fellow it was who had innocently done so much for him and who stood there looking up just as one of his own less fortunate children might have doneapparently not realizing his own importance in the least ive a great deal to thank your lordship for he said a great deal i oh said fauntleroy i only wrote the letter it was my grandfather who did it but you know how he is about always being good to everybody is mrs higgins well now higgins looked a trifle taken aback he also was somewhat startled at hearing his noble landlord presented in the character of a benevolent being full of engaging qualities iwell yes your lordship he stammered the missus is better since the trouble was took off her mind it was worrying broke her down im glad of that said fauntleroy my grandfather was very sorry about your children having the scarlet fever and so was i he has had children himself im his sons little boy you know higgins was on the verge of being panicstricken he felt it would be the safer and more discreet plan not to look at the earl as it had been well known that his fatherly affection for his sons had been such that he had seen them about twice a year and that when they had been ill he had promptly departed for london because he would not be bored with doctors and nurses it was a little trying therefore to his lordships nerves to be told while he looked on his eyes gleaming from under his shaggy eyebrows that he felt an interest in scarlet fever you see higgins broke in the earl with a fine grim smile you people have been mistaken in me lord fauntleroy understands me when you want reliable information on the subject of my character apply to him get into the carriage fauntleroy and fauntleroy jumped in and the carriage rolled away down the green lane and even when it turned the corner into the high road the earl was still grimly smiling viii lord dorincourt had occasion to wear his grim smile many a time as the days passed by indeed as his acquaintance with his grandson progressed he wore the smile so often that there were moments when it almost lost its grimness there is no denying that before lord fauntleroy had appeared on the scene the old man had been growing very tired of his loneliness and his gout and his seventy years after so long a life of excitement and amusement it was not agreeable to sit alone even in the most splendid room with one foot on a goutstool and with no other diversion than flying into a rage and shouting at a frightened footman who hated the sight of him the old earl was too clever a man not to know perfectly well that his servants detested him and that even if he had visitors they did not come for love of himthough some found a sort of amusement in his sharp sarcastic talk which spared no one so long as he had been strong and well he had gone from one place to another pretending to amuse himself though he had not really enjoyed it and when his health began to fail he felt tired of everything and shut himself up at dorincourt with his gout and his newspapers and his books but he could not read all the time and he became more and more bored as he called it he hated the long nights and days and he grew more and more savage and irritable and then fauntleroy came and when the earl saw him fortunately for the little fellow the secret pride of the grandfather was gratified at the outset if cedric had been a less handsome little fellow the old man might have taken so strong a dislike to him that he would not have given himself the chance to see his grandsons finer qualities but he chose to think that cedrics beauty and fearless spirit were the results of the dorincourt blood and a credit to the dorincourt rank and then when he heard the lad talk and saw what a wellbred little fellow he was notwithstanding his boyish ignorance of all that his new position meant the old earl liked his grandson more and actually began to find himself rather entertained it had amused him to give into those childish hands the power to bestow a benefit on poor higgins my lord cared nothing for poor higgins but it pleased him a little to think that his grandson would be talked about by the country people and would begin to be popular with the tenantry even in his childhood then it had gratified him to drive to church with cedric and to see the excitement and interest caused by the arrival he knew how the people would speak of the beauty of the little lad of his fine strong straight body of his erect bearing his handsome face and his bright hair and how they would say as the earl had heard one woman exclaim to another that the boy was every inch a lord my lord of dorincourt was an arrogant old man proud of his name proud of his rank and therefore proud to show the world that at last the house of dorincourt had an heir who was worthy of the position he was to fill the morning the new pony had been tried the earl had been so pleased that he had almost forgotten his gout when the groom had brought out the pretty creature which arched its brown glossy neck and tossed its fine head in the sun the earl had sat at the open window of the library and had looked on while fauntleroy took his first riding lesson he wondered if the boy would show signs of timidity it was not a very small pony and he had often seen children lose courage in making their first essay at riding fauntleroy mounted in great delight he had never been on a pony before and he was in the highest spirits wilkins the groom led the animal by the bridle up and down before the library window hes a well plucked un he is wilkins remarked in the stable afterward with many grins it werent no trouble to put him up an a old un wouldnt ha sat any straighter when he were up he sesses he to me wilkins he ses am i sitting up straight they sit up straight at the circus ses he an i ses as straight as a arrer your lordshipan he laughs as pleased as could be an he ses thats right he ses you tell me if i dont sit up straight wilkins but sitting up straight and being led at a walk were not altogether and completely satisfactory after a few minutes fauntleroy spoke to his grandfatherwatching him from the window cant i go by myself he asked and cant i go faster the boy on fifth avenue used to trot and canter do you think you could trot and canter said the earl i should like to try answered fauntleroy his lordship made a sign to wilkins who at the signal brought up his own horse and mounted it and took fauntleroys pony by the leadingrein now said the earl let him trot the next few minutes were rather exciting to the small equestrian he found that trotting was not so easy as walking and the faster the pony trotted the less easy it was it jjolts a ggoogood dealdodoesnt it he said to wilkins ddoes it jjolt yyou no my lord answered wilkins youll get used to it in time rise in your stirrups im rirising all the ttime said fauntleroy he was both rising and falling rather uncomfortably and with many shakes and bounces he was out of breath and his face grew red but he held on with all his might and sat as straight as he could the earl could see that from his window when the riders came back within speaking distance after they had been hidden by the trees a few minutes fauntleroys hat was off his cheeks were like poppies and his lips were set but he was still trotting manfully stop a minute said his grandfather wheres your hat wilkins touched his it fell off your lordship he said with evident enjoyment wouldnt let me stop to pick it up my lord not much afraid is he asked the earl dryly him your lordship exclaimed wilkins i shouldnt say as he knowed what it meant ive taught young genlemen to ride afore an i never see one stick on more determinder tired said the earl to fauntleroy want to get off it jolts you more than you think it will admitted his young lordship frankly and it tires you a little too but i dont want to get off i want to learn how as soon as ive got my breath i want to go back for the hat the cleverest person in the world if he had undertaken to teach fauntleroy how to please the old man who watched him could not have taught him anything which would have succeeded better as the pony trotted off again toward the avenue a faint color crept up in the fierce old face and the eyes under the shaggy brows gleamed with a pleasure such as his lordship had scarcely expected to know again and he sat and watched quite eagerly until the sound of the horses hoofs returned when they did come which was after some time they came at a faster pace fauntleroys hat was still off wilkins was carrying it for him his cheeks were redder than before and his hair was flying about his ears but he came at quite a brisk canter there he panted as they drew up i ccantered i didnt do it as well as the boy on fifth avenue but i did it and i staid on he and wilkins and the pony were close friends after that scarcely a day passed in which the country people did not see them out together cantering gayly on the highroad or through the green lanes the children in the cottages would run to the door to look at the proud little brown pony with the gallant little figure sitting so straight in the saddle and the young lord would snatch off his cap and swing it at them and shout hullo goodmorning in a very unlordly manner though with great heartiness sometimes he would stop and talk with the children and once wilkins came back to the castle with a story of how fauntleroy had insisted on dismounting near the village school so that a boy who was lame and tired might ride home on his pony an im blessed said wilkins in telling the story at the stablesim blessed if hed hear of anything else he wouldnt let me get down because he said the boy mightnt feel comfortable on a big horse an ses he wilkins ses he that boys lame and im not and i want to talk to him too and up the lad has to get and my lord trudges alongside of him with his hands in his pockets and his cap on the back of his head awhistling and talking as easy as you please and when we come to the cottage an the boys mother come out all in a taking to see whats up he whips off his cap an ses he ive brought your son home maam ses he because his leg hurt him and i dont think that stick is enough for him to lean on and im going to ask my grandfather to have a pair of crutches made for him an im blessed if the woman wasnt struck all of a heap as well she might be i thought i should a hexplodid myself when the earl heard the story he was not angry as wilkins had been half afraid that he would be on the contrary he laughed outright and called fauntleroy up to him and made him tell all about the matter from beginning to end and then he laughed again and actually a few days later the dorincourt carriage stopped in the green lane before the cottage where the lame boy lived and fauntleroy jumped out and walked up to the door carrying a pair of strong light new crutches shouldered like a gun and presented them to mrs hartle the lame boys name was hartle with these words my grandfathers compliments and if you please these are for your boy and we hope he will get better i said your compliments he explained to the earl when he returned to the carriage you didnt tell me to but i thought perhaps you forgot that was right wasnt it and the earl laughed again and did not say it was not in fact the two were becoming more intimate every day and every day fauntleroys faith in his lordships benevolence and virtue increased he had no doubt whatever that his grandfather was the most amiable and generous of elderly gentlemen certainly he himself found his wishes gratified almost before they were uttered and such gifts and pleasures were lavished upon him that he was sometimes almost bewildered by his own possessions apparently he was to have everything he wanted and to do everything he wished to do and though this would certainly not have been a very wise plan to pursue with all small boys his young lordship bore it amazingly well perhaps notwithstanding his sweet nature he might have been somewhat spoiled by it if it had not been for the hours he spent with his mother at court lodge that best friend of his watched over him ever closely and tenderly the two had many long talks together and he never went back to the castle with her kisses on his cheeks without carrying in his heart some simple pure words worth remembering there was one thing it is true which puzzled the little fellow very much he thought over the mystery of it much oftener than any one supposed even his mother did not know how often he pondered on it the earl for a long time never suspected that he did so at all but being quick to observe the little boy could not help wondering why it was that his mother and grandfather never seemed to meet he had noticed that they never did meet when the dorincourt carriage stopped at court lodge the earl never alighted and on the rare occasions of his lordships going to church fauntleroy was always left to speak to his mother in the porch alone or perhaps to go home with her and yet every day fruit and flowers were sent to court lodge from the hothouses at the castle but the one virtuous action of the earls which had set him upon the pinnacle of perfection in cedrics eyes was what he had done soon after that first sunday when mrs errol had walked home from church unattended about a week later when cedric was going one day to visit his mother he found at the door instead of the large carriage and prancing pair a pretty little brougham and a handsome bay horse that is a present from you to your mother the earl said abruptly she can not go walking about the country she needs a carriage the man who drives will take charge of it it is a present from you fauntleroys delight could but feebly express itself he could scarcely contain himself until he reached the lodge his mother was gathering roses in the garden he flung himself out of the little brougham and flew to her dearest he cried could you believe it this is yours he says it is a present from me it is your own carriage to drive everywhere in he was so happy that she did not know what to say she could not have borne to spoil his pleasure by refusing to accept the gift even though it came from the man who chose to consider himself her enemy she was obliged to step into the carriage roses and all and let herself be taken to drive while fauntleroy told her stories of his grandfathers goodness and amiability they were such innocent stories that sometimes she could not help laughing a little and then she would draw her little boy closer to her side and kiss him feeling glad that he could see only good in the old man who had so few friends the very next day after that fauntleroy wrote to mr hobbs he wrote quite a long letter and after the first copy was written he brought it to his grandfather to be inspected because he said its so uncertain about the spelling and if youll tell me the mistakes ill write it out again this was what he had written my dear mr hobbs i want to tell you about my granfarther he is the best earl you ever new it is a mistake about earls being tirents he is not a tirent at all i wish you new him you would be good friends i am sure you would he has the gout in his foot and is a grate sufrer but he is so pashent i love him more every day becaus no one could help loving an earl like that who is kind to every one in this world i wish you could talk to him he knows everything in the world you can ask him any question but he has never plaid base ball he has given me a pony and a cart and my mamma a bewtifle cariage and i have three rooms and toys of all kinds it would serprise you you would like the castle and the park it is such a large castle you could lose yourself wilkins tells me wilkins is my groom he says there is a dungon under the castle it is so pretty everything in the park would serprise you there are such big trees and there are deers and rabbits and games flying about in the cover my granfarther is very rich but he is not proud and orty as you thought earls always were i like to be with him the people are so polite and kind they take of their hats to you and the women make curtsies and sometimes say god bless you i can ride now but at first it shook me when i troted my granfarther let a poor man stay on his farm when he could not pay his rent and mrs mellon went to take wine and things to his sick children i should like to see you and i wish dearest could live at the castle but i am very happy when i dont miss her too much and i love my granfarther every one does plees write soon your afechshnet old frend cedric errol p s no one is in the dungon my granfarfher never had any one langwishin in there p s he is such a good earl he reminds me of you he is a unerversle favrit do you miss your mother very much asked the earl when he had finished reading this yes said fauntleroy i miss her all the time he went and stood before the earl and put his hand on his knee looking up at him you dont miss her do you he said i dont know her answered his lordship rather crustily i know that said fauntleroy and thats what makes me wonder she told me not to ask you any questions andand i wont but sometimes i cant help thinking you know and it makes me all puzzled but im not going to ask any questions and when i miss her very much i go and look out of my window to where i see her light shine for me every night through an open place in the trees it is a long way off but she puts it in her window as soon as it is dark and i can see it twinkle far away and i know what it says what does it say asked my lord it says goodnight god keep you all the nightjust what she used to say when we were together every night she used to say that to me and every morning she said god bless you all the day so you see i am quite safe all the time quite i have no doubt said his lordship dryly and he drew down his beetling eyebrows and looked at the little boy so fixedly and so long that fauntleroy wondered what he could be thinking of ix the fact was his lordship the earl of dorincourt thought in those days of many things of which he had never thought before and all his thoughts were in one way or another connected with his grandson his pride was the strongest part of his nature and the boy gratified it at every point through this pride he began to find a new interest in life he began to take pleasure in showing his heir to the world the world had known of his disappointment in his sons so there was an agreeable touch of triumph in exhibiting this new lord fauntleroy who could disappoint no one he wished the child to appreciate his own power and to understand the splendor of his position he wished that others should realize it too he made plans for his future sometimes in secret he actually found himself wishing that his own past life had been a better one and that there had been less in it that this pure childish heart would shrink from if it knew the truth it was not agreeable to think how the beautiful innocent face would look if its owner should be made by any chance to understand that his grandfather had been called for many a year the wicked earl of dorincourt the thought even made him feel a trifle nervous he did not wish the boy to find it out sometimes in this new interest he forgot his gout and after a while his doctor was surprised to find his noble patients health growing better than he had expected it ever would be again perhaps the earl grew better because the time did not pass so slowly for him and he had something to think of beside his pains and infirmities one fine morning people were amazed to see little lord fauntleroy riding his pony with another companion than wilkins this new companion rode a tall powerful gray horse and was no other than the earl himself it was in fact fauntleroy who had suggested this plan as he had been on the point of mounting his pony he had said rather wistfully to his grandfather i wish you were going with me when i go away i feel lonely because you are left all by yourself in such a big castle i wish you could ride too and the greatest excitement had been aroused in the stables a few minutes later by the arrival of an order that selim was to be saddled for the earl after that selim was saddled almost every day and the people became accustomed to the sight of the tall gray horse carrying the tall gray old man with his handsome fierce eagle face by the side of the brown pony which bore little lord fauntleroy and in their rides together through the green lanes and pretty country roads the two riders became more intimate than ever and gradually the old man heard a great deal about dearest and her life as fauntleroy trotted by the big horse he chatted gayly there could not well have been a brighter little comrade his nature was so happy it was he who talked the most the earl often was silent listening and watching the joyous glowing face sometimes he would tell his young companion to set the pony off at a gallop and when the little fellow dashed off sitting so straight and fearless he would watch him with a gleam of pride and pleasure in his eyes and when after such a dash fauntleroy came back waving his cap with a laughing shout he always felt that he and his grandfather were very good friends indeed one thing that the earl discovered was that his sons wife did not lead an idle life it was not long before he learned that the poor people knew her very well indeed when there was sickness or sorrow or poverty in any house the little brougham often stood before the door do you know said fauntleroy once they all say god bless you when they see her and the children are glad there are some who go to her house to be taught to sew she says she feels so rich now that she wants to help the poor ones it had not displeased the earl to find that the mother of his heir had a beautiful young face and looked as much like a lady as if she had been a duchess and in one way it did not displease him to know that she was popular and beloved by the poor and yet he was often conscious of a hard jealous pang when he saw how she filled her childs heart and how the boy clung to her as his best beloved the old man would have desired to stand first himself and have no rival that same morning he drew up his horse on an elevated point of the moor over which they rode and made a gesture with his whip over the broad beautiful landscape spread before them do you know that all that land belongs to me he said to fauntleroy does it answered fauntleroy how much it is to belong to one person and how beautiful do you know that some day it will all belong to youthat and a great deal more to me exclaimed fauntleroy in rather an awestricken voice when when i am dead his grandfather answered then i dont want it said fauntleroy i want you to live always thats kind answered the earl in his dry way nevertheless some day it will all be yourssome day you will be the earl of dorincourt little lord fauntleroy sat very still in his saddle for a few moments he looked over the broad moors the green farms the beautiful copses the cottages in the lanes the pretty village and over the trees to where the turrets of the great castle rose gray and stately then he gave a queer little sigh what are you thinking of asked the earl i am thinking replied fauntleroy what a little boy i am and of what dearest said to me what was it inquired the earl she said that perhaps it was not so easy to be very rich that if any one had so many things always one might sometimes forget that every one else was not so fortunate and that one who is rich should always be careful and try to remember i was talking to her about how good you were and she said that was such a good thing because an earl had so much power and if he cared only about his own pleasure and never thought about the people who lived on his lands they might have trouble that he could helpand there were so many people and it would be such a hard thing and i was just looking at all those houses and thinking how i should have to find out about the people when i was an earl how did you find out about them as his lordships knowledge of his tenantry consisted in finding out which of them paid their rent promptly and in turning out those who did not this was rather a hard question newick finds out for me he said and he pulled his great gray mustache and looked at his small questioner rather uneasily we will go home now he added and when you are an earl see to it that you are a better earl than i have been he was very silent as they rode home he felt it to be almost incredible that he who had never really loved any one in his life should find himself growing so fond of this little fellowas without doubt he was at first he had only been pleased and proud of cedrics beauty and bravery but there was something more than pride in his feeling now he laughed a grim dry laugh all to himself sometimes when he thought how he liked to have the boy near him how he liked to hear his voice and how in secret he really wished to be liked and thought well of by his small grandson im an old fellow in my dotage and i have nothing else to think of he would say to himself and yet he knew it was not that altogether and if he had allowed himself to admit the truth he would perhaps have found himself obliged to own that the very things which attracted him in spite of himself were the qualities he had never possessedthe frank true kindly nature the affectionate trustfulness which could never think evil it was only about a week after that ride when after a visit to his mother fauntleroy came into the library with a troubled thoughtful face he sat down in that highbacked chair in which he had sat on the evening of his arrival and for a while he looked at the embers on the hearth the earl watched him in silence wondering what was coming it was evident that cedric had something on his mind at last he looked up does newick know all about the people he asked it is his business to know about them said his lordship been neglecting ithas he contradictory as it may seem there was nothing which entertained and edified him more than the little fellows interest in his tenantry he had never taken any interest in them himself but it pleased him well enough that with all his childish habits of thought and in the midst of all his childish amusements and high spirits there should be such a quaint seriousness working in the curly head there is a place said fauntleroy looking up at him with wideopen horrorstricken eyedearest has seen it it is at the other end of the village the houses are close together and almost falling down you can scarcely breathe and the people are so poor and everything is dreadful often they have fever and the children die and it makes them wicked to live like that and be so poor and miserable it is worse than michael and bridget the rain comes in at the roof dearest went to see a poor woman who lived there she would not let me come near her until she had changed all her things the tears ran down her cheeks when she told me about it the tears had come into his own eyes but he smiled through them i told her you didnt know and i would tell you he said he jumped down and came and leaned against the earls chair you can make it all right he said just as you made it all right for higgins you always make it all right for everybody i told her you would and that newick must have forgotten to tell you the earl looked down at the hand on his knee newick had not forgotten to tell him in fact newick had spoken to him more than once of the desperate condition of the end of the village known as earls court he knew all about the tumbledown miserable cottages and the bad drainage and the damp walls and broken windows and leaking roofs and all about the poverty the fever and the misery mr mordaunt had painted it all to him in the strongest words he could use and his lordship had used violent language in response and when his gout had been at the worst he said that the sooner the people of earls court died and were buried by the parish the better it would beand there was an end of the matter and yet as he looked at the small hand on his knee and from the small hand to the honest earnest frankeyed face he was actually a little ashamed both of earls court and himself what he said you want to make a builder of model cottages of me do you and he positively put his own hand upon the childish one and stroked it those must be pulled down said fauntleroy with great eagerness dearest says so let uslet us go and have them pulled down tomorrow the people will be so glad when they see you theyll know you have come to help them and his eyes shone like stars in his glowing face the earl rose from his chair and put his hand on the childs shoulder let us go out and take our walk on the terrace he said with a short laugh and we can talk it over and though he laughed two or three times again as they walked to and fro on the broad stone terrace where they walked together almost every fine evening he seemed to be thinking of something which did not displease him and still he kept his hand on his small companions shoulder x the truth was that mrs errol had found a great many sad things in the course of her work among the poor of the little village that appeared so picturesque when it was seen from the moorsides everything was not as picturesque when seen near by as it looked from a distance she had found idleness and poverty and ignorance where there should have been comfort and industry and she had discovered after a while that erleboro was considered to be the worst village in that part of the country mr mordaunt had told her a great many of his difficulties and discouragements and she had found out a great deal by herself the agents who had managed the property had always been chosen to please the earl and had cared nothing for the degradation and wretchedness of the poor tenants many things therefore had been neglected which should have been attended to and matters had gone from bad to worse as to earls court it was a disgrace with its dilapidated houses and miserable careless sickly people when first mrs errol went to the place it made her shudder such ugliness and slovenliness and want seemed worse in a country place than in a city it seemed as if there it might be helped and as she looked at the squalid uncaredfor children growing up in the midst of vice and brutal indifference she thought of her own little boy spending his days in the great splendid castle guarded and served like a young prince having no wish ungratified and knowing nothing but luxury and ease and beauty and a bold thought came in her wise little motherheart gradually she had begun to see as had others that it had been her boys good fortune to please the earl very much and that he would scarcely be likely to be denied anything for which he expressed a desire the earl would give him anything she said to mr mordaunt he would indulge his every whim why should not that indulgence be used for the good of others it is for me to see that this shall come to pass she knew she could trust the kind childish heart so she told the little fellow the story of earls court feeling sure that he would speak of it to his grandfather and hoping that some good results would follow and strange as it appeared to every one good results did follow the fact was that the strongest power to influence the earl was his grandsons perfect confidence in himthe fact that cedric always believed that his grandfather was going to do what was right and generous he could not quite make up his mind to let him discover that he had no inclination to be generous at all and that he wanted his own way on all occasions whether it was right or wrong it was such a novelty to be regarded with admiration as a benefactor of the entire human race and the soul of nobility that he did not enjoy the idea of looking into the affectionate brown eyes and saying i am a violent selfish old rascal i never did a generous thing in my life and i dont care about earls court or the poor peopleor something which would amount to the same thing he actually had learned to be fond enough of that small boy with the mop of yellow lovelocks to feel that he himself would prefer to be guilty of an amiable action now and then and sothough he laughed at himselfafter some reflection he sent for newick and had quite a long interview with him on the subject of the court and it was decided that the wretched hovels should be pulled down and new houses should be built it is lord fauntleroy who insists on it he said dryly he thinks it will improve the property you can tell the tenants that its his idea and he looked down at his small lordship who was lying on the hearthrug playing with dougal the great dog was the lads constant companion and followed him about everywhere stalking solemnly after him when he walked and trotting majestically behind when he rode or drove of course both the country people and the town people heard of the proposed improvement at first many of them would not believe it but when a small army of workmen arrived and commenced pulling down the crazy squalid cottages people began to understand that little lord fauntleroy had done them a good turn again and that through his innocent interference the scandal of earls court had at last been removed if he had only known how they talked about him and praised him everywhere and prophesied great things for him when he grew up how astonished he would have been but he never suspected it he lived his simple happy child lifefrolicking about in the park chasing the rabbits to their burrows lying under the trees on the grass or on the rug in the library reading wonderful books and talking to the earl about them and then telling the stories again to his mother writing long letters to dick and mr hobbs who responded in characteristic fashion riding out at his grandfathers side or with wilkins as escort as they rode through the market town he used to see the people turn and look and he noticed that as they lifted their hats their faces often brightened very much but he thought it was all because his grandfather was with him they are so fond of you he once said looking up at his lordship with a bright smile do you see how glad they are when they see you i hope they will some day be as fond of me it must be nice to have everybody like you and he felt quite proud to be the grandson of so greatly admired and beloved an individual when the cottages were being built the lad and his grandfather used to ride over to earls court together to look at them and fauntleroy was full of interest he would dismount from his pony and go and make acquaintance with the workmen asking them questions about building and bricklaying and telling them things about america after two or three such conversations he was able to enlighten the earl on the subject of brickmaking as they rode home i always like to know about things like those he said because you never know what you are coming to when he left them the workmen used to talk him over among themselves and laugh at his odd innocent speeches but they liked him and liked to see him stand among them talking away with his hands in his pockets his hat pushed back on his curls and his small face full of eagerness hes a rare un they used to say an a noice little outspoken chap too not much o th bad stock in him and they would go home and tell their wives about him and the women would tell each other and so it came about that almost every one talked of or knew some story of little lord fauntleroy and gradually almost every one knew that the wicked earl had found something he cared for at lastsomething which had touched and even warmed his hard bitter old heart but no one knew quite how much it had been warmed and how day by day the old man found himself caring more and more for the child who was the only creature that had ever trusted him he found himself looking forward to the time when cedric would be a young man strong and beautiful with life all before him but having still that kind heart and the power to make friends everywhere and the earl wondered what the lad would do and how he would use his gifts often as he watched the little fellow lying upon the hearth conning some big book the light shining on the bright young head his old eyes would gleam and his cheek would flush the boy can do anything he would say to himself anything he never spoke to any one else of his feeling for cedric when he spoke of him to others it was always with the same grim smile but fauntleroy soon knew that his grandfather loved him and always liked him to be nearnear to his chair if they were in the library opposite to him at table or by his side when he rode or drove or took his evening walk on the broad terrace do you remember cedric said once looking up from his book as he lay on the rug do you remember what i said to you that first night about our being good companions i dont think any people could be better companions than we are do you we are pretty good companions i should say replied his lordship come here fauntleroy scrambled up and went to him is there anything you want the earl asked anything you have not the little fellows brown eyes fixed themselves on his grandfather with a rather wistful look only one thing he answered what is that inquired the earl fauntleroy was silent a second he had not thought matters over to himself so long for nothing what is it my lord repeated fauntleroy answered it is dearest he said the old earl winced a little but you see her almost every day he said is not that enough i used to see her all the time said fauntleroy she used to kiss me when i went to sleep at night and in the morning she was always there and we could tell each other things without waiting the old eyes and the young ones looked into each other through a moment of silence then the earl knitted his brows do you never forget about your mother he said no answered fauntleroy never and she never forgets about me i shouldnt forget about you you know if i didnt live with you i should think about you all the more upon my word said the earl after looking at him a moment longer i believe you would the jealous pang that came when the boy spoke so of his mother seemed even stronger than it had been before it was stronger because of this old mans increasing affection for the boy but it was not long before he had other pangs so much harder to face that he almost forgot for the time he had ever hated his sons wife at all and in a strange and startling way it happened one evening just before the earls court cottages were completed there was a grand dinner party at dorincourt there had not been such a party at the castle for a long time a few days before it took place sir harry lorridaile and lady lorridaile who was the earls only sister actually came for a visita thing which caused the greatest excitement in the village and set mrs dibbles shopbell tinkling madly again because it was well known that lady lorridaile had only been to dorincourt once since her marriage thirtyfive years before she was a handsome old lady with white curls and dimpled peachy cheeks and she was as good as gold but she had never approved of her brother any more than did the rest of the world and having a strong will of her own and not being at all afraid to speak her mind frankly she had after several lively quarrels with his lordship seen very little of him since her young days she had heard a great deal of him that was not pleasant through the years in which they had been separated she had heard about his neglect of his wife and of the poor ladys death and of his indifference to his children and of the two weak vicious unprepossessing elder boys who had been no credit to him or to any one else those two elder sons bevis and maurice she had never seen but once there had come to lorridaile park a tall stalwart beautiful young fellow about eighteen years old who had told her that he was her nephew cedric errol and that he had come to see her because he was passing near the place and wished to look at his aunt constantia of whom he had heard his mother speak lady lorridailes kind heart had warmed through and through at the sight of the young man and she had made him stay with her a week and petted him and made much of him and admired him immensely he was so sweettempered lighthearted spirited a lad that when he went away she had hoped to see him often again but she never did because the earl had been in a bad humor when he went back to dorincourt and had forbidden him ever to go to lorridaile park again but lady lorridaile had always remembered him tenderly and though she feared he had made a rash marriage in america she had been very angry when she heard how he had been cast off by his father and that no one really knew where or how he lived at last there came a rumor of his death and then bevis had been thrown from his horse and killed and maurice had died in rome of the fever and soon after came the story of the american child who was to be found and brought home as lord fauntleroy probably to be ruined as the others were she said to her husband unless his mother is good enough and has a will of her own to help her to take care of him but when she heard that cedrics mother had been parted from him she was almost too indignant for words it is disgraceful harry she said fancy a child of that age being taken from his mother and made the companion of a man like my brother he will either be brutal to the boy or indulge him until he is a little monster if i thought it would do any good to write it wouldnt constantia said sir harry i know it wouldnt she answered i know his lordship the earl of dorincourt too wellbut it is outrageous not only the poor people and farmers heard about little lord fauntleroy others knew him he was talked about so much and there were so many stories of himof his beauty his sweet temper his popularity and his growing influence over the earl his grandfatherthat rumors of him reached the gentry at their country places and he was heard of in more than one county of england people talked about him at the dinner tables ladies pitied his young mother and wondered if the boy were as handsome as he was said to be and men who knew the earl and his habits laughed heartily at the stories of the little fellows belief in his lordships amiability sir thomas asshe of asshawe hall being in erleboro one day met the earl and his grandson riding together and stopped to shake hands with my lord and congratulate him on his change of looks and on his recovery from the gout and d ye know he said when he spoke of the incident afterward the old man looked as proud as a turkeycock and upon my word i dont wonder for a handsomer finer lad than his grandson i never saw as straight as a dart and sat his pony like a young trooper and so by degrees lady lorridaile too heard of the child she heard about higgins and the lame boy and the cottages at earls court and a score of other thingsand she began to wish to see the little fellow and just as she was wondering how it might be brought about to her utter astonishment she received a letter from her brother inviting her to come with her husband to dorincourt it seems incredible she exclaimed i have heard it said that the child has worked miracles and i begin to believe it they say my brother adores the boy and can scarcely endure to have him out of sight and he is so proud of him actually i believe he wants to show him to us and she accepted the invitation at once when she reached dorincourt castle with sir harry it was late in the afternoon and she went to her room at once before seeing her brother having dressed for dinner she entered the drawingroom the earl was there standing near the fire and looking very tall and imposing and at his side stood a little boy in black velvet and a large vandyke collar of rich lacea little fellow whose round bright face was so handsome and who turned upon her such beautiful candid brown eyes that she almost uttered an exclamation of pleasure and surprise at the sight as she shook hands with the earl she called him by the name she had not used since her girlhood what molyneux she said is this the child yes constantia answered the earl this is the boy fauntleroy this is your grandaunt lady lorridaile how do you do grandaunt said fauntleroy lady lorridaile put her hand on his shoulders and after looking down into his upraised face a few seconds kissed him warmly i am your aunt constantia she said and i loved your poor papa and you are very like him it makes me glad when i am told i am like him answered fauntleroy because it seems as if every one liked himjust like dearest eszacklyaunt constantia adding the two words after a seconds pause lady lorridaile was delighted she bent and kissed him again and from that moment they were warm friends well molyneux she said aside to the earl afterward it could not possibly be better than this i think not answered his lordship dryly he is a fine little fellow we are great friends he believes me to be the most charming and sweettempered of philanthropists i will confess to you constantiaas you would find it out if i did notthat i am in some slight danger of becoming rather an old fool about him what does his mother think of you asked lady lorridaile with her usual straightforwardness i have not asked her answered the earl slightly scowling well said lady lorridaile i will be frank with you at the outset molyneux and tell you i dont approve of your course and that it is my intention to call on mrs errol as soon as possible so if you wish to quarrel with me you had better mention it at once what i hear of the young creature makes me quite sure that her child owes her everything we were told even at lorridaile park that your poorer tenants adore her already they adore him said the earl nodding toward fauntleroy as to mrs errol youll find her a pretty little woman im rather in debt to her for giving some of her beauty to the boy and you can go to see her if you like all i ask is that she will remain at court lodge and that you will not ask me to go and see her and he scowled a little again but he doesnt hate her as much as he used to that is plain enough to me her ladyship said to sir harry afterward and he is a changed man in a measure and incredible as it may seem harry it is my opinion that he is being made into a human being through nothing more nor less than his affection for that innocent affectionate little fellow why the child actually loves himleans on his chair and against his knee his own children would as soon have thought of nestling up to a tiger the very next day she went to call upon mrs errol when she returned she said to her brother molyneux she is the loveliest little woman i ever saw she has a voice like a silver bell and you may thank her for making the boy what he is she has given him more than her beauty and you make a great mistake in not persuading her to come and take charge of you i shall invite her to lorridaile shell not leave the boy replied the earl i must have the boy too said lady lorridaile laughing but she knew fauntleroy would not be given up to her and each day she saw more clearly how closely those two had grown to each other and how all the proud grim old mans ambition and hope and love centered themselves in the child and how the warm innocent nature returned his affection with most perfect trust and good faith she knew too that the prime reason for the great dinner party was the earls secret desire to show the world his grandson and heir and to let people see that the boy who had been so much spoken of and described was even a finer little specimen of boyhood than rumor had made him bevis and maurice were such a bitter humiliation to him she said to her husband every one knew it he actually hated them his pride has full sway here perhaps there was not one person who accepted the invitation without feeling some curiosity about little lord fauntleroy and wondering if he would be on view and when the time came he was on view the lad has good manners said the earl he will be in no ones way children are usually idiots or boresmine were bothbut he can actually answer when hes spoken to and be silent when he is not he is never offensive but he was not allowed to be silent very long every one had something to say to him the fact was they wished to make him talk the ladies petted him and asked him questions and the men asked him questions too and joked with him as the men on the steamer had done when he crossed the atlantic fauntleroy did not quite understand why they laughed so sometimes when he answered them but he was so used to seeing people amused when he was quite serious that he did not mind he thought the whole evening delightful the magnificent rooms were so brilliant with lights there were so many flowers the gentlemen seemed so gay and the ladies wore such beautiful wonderful dresses and such sparkling ornaments in their hair and on their necks there was one young lady who he heard them say had just come down from london where she had spent the season and she was so charming that he could not keep his eyes from her she was a rather tall young lady with a proud little head and very soft dark hair and large eyes the color of purple pansies and the color on her cheeks and lips was like that of a rose she was dressed in a beautiful white dress and had pearls around her throat there was one strange thing about this young lady so many gentlemen stood near her and seemed anxious to please her that fauntleroy thought she must be something like a princess he was so much interested in her that without knowing it he drew nearer and nearer to her and at last she turned and spoke to him come here lord fauntleroy she said smiling and tell me why you look at me so i was thinking how beautiful you are his young lordship replied then all the gentlemen laughed outright and the young lady laughed a little too and the rose color in her cheeks brightened ah fauntleroy said one of the gentlemen who had laughed most heartily make the most of your time when you are older you will not have the courage to say that but nobody could help saying it said fauntleroy sweetly could you help it dont you think she is pretty too we are not allowed to say what we think said the gentleman while the rest laughed more than ever but the beautiful young ladyher name was miss vivian herbertput out her hand and drew cedric to her side looking prettier than before if possible lord fauntleroy shall say what he thinks she said and i am much obliged to him i am sure he thinks what he says and she kissed him on his cheek i think you are prettier than any one i ever saw said fauntleroy looking at her with innocent admiring eyes except dearest of course i couldnt think any one quite as pretty as dearest i think she is the prettiest person in the world i am sure she is said miss vivian herbert and she laughed and kissed his cheek again she kept him by her side a great part of the evening and the group of which they were the center was very gay he did not know how it happened but before long he was telling them all about america and the republican rally and mr hobbs and dick and in the end he proudly produced from his pocket dicks parting giftthe red silk handkerchief i put it in my pocket tonight because it was a party he said i thought dick would like me to wear it at a party and queer as the big flaming spotted thing was there was a serious affectionate look in his eyes which prevented his audience from laughing very much you see i like it he said because dick is my friend but though he was talked to so much as the earl had said he was in no ones way he could be quiet and listen when others talked and so no one found him tiresome a slight smile crossed more than one face when several times he went and stood near his grandfathers chair or sat on a stool close to him watching him and absorbing every word he uttered with the most charmed interest once he stood so near the chairs arm that his cheek touched the earls shoulder and his lordship detecting the general smile smiled a little himself he knew what the lookerson were thinking and he felt some secret amusement in their seeing what good friends he was with this youngster who might have been expected to share the popular opinion of him mr havisham had been expected to arrive in the afternoon but strange to say he was late such a thing had really never been known to happen before during all the years in which he had been a visitor at dorincourt castle he was so late that the guests were on the point of rising to go in to dinner when he arrived when he approached his host the earl regarded him with amazement he looked as if he had been hurried or agitated his dry keen old face was actually pale i was detained he said in a low voice to the earl byan extraordinary event it was as unlike the methodic old lawyer to be agitated by anything as it was to be late but it was evident that he had been disturbed at dinner he ate scarcely anything and two or three times when he was spoken to he started as if his thoughts were far away at dessert when fauntleroy came in he looked at him more than once nervously and uneasily fauntleroy noted the look and wondered at it he and mr havisham were on friendly terms and they usually exchanged smiles the lawyer seemed to have forgotten to smile that evening the fact was he forgot everything but the strange and painful news he knew he must tell the earl before the night was overthe strange news which he knew would be so terrible a shock and which would change the face of everything as he looked about at the splendid rooms and the brilliant companyat the people gathered together he knew more that they might see the brighthaired little fellow near the earls chair than for any other reasonas he looked at the proud old man and at little lord fauntleroy smiling at his side he really felt quite shaken notwithstanding that he was a hardened old lawyer what a blow it was that he must deal them he did not exactly know how the long superb dinner ended he sat through it as if he were in a dream and several times he saw the earl glance at him in surprise but it was over at last and the gentlemen joined the ladies in the drawingroom they found fauntleroy sitting on the sofa with miss vivian herbertthe great beauty of the last london season they had been looking at some pictures and he was thanking his companion as the door opened im ever so much obliged to you for being so kind to me he was saying i never was at a party before and ive enjoyed myself so much he had enjoyed himself so much that when the gentlemen gathered about miss herbert again and began to talk to her as he listened and tried to understand their laughing speeches his eyelids began to droop they drooped until they covered his eyes two or three times and then the sound of miss herberts low pretty laugh would bring him back and he would open them again for about two seconds he was quite sure he was not going to sleep but there was a large yellow satin cushion behind him and his head sank against it and after a while his eyelids drooped for the last time they did not even quite open when as it seemed a long time after some one kissed him lightly on the cheek it was miss vivian herbert who was going away and she spoke to him softly goodnight little lord fauntleroy she said sleep well and in the morning he did not know that he had tried to open his eyes and had murmured sleepily goodnightim sogladi saw youyou are sopretty he only had a very faint recollection of hearing the gentlemen laugh again and of wondering why they did it no sooner had the last guest left the room than mr havisham turned from his place by the fire and stepped nearer the sofa where he stood looking down at the sleeping occupant little lord fauntleroy was taking his ease luxuriously one leg crossed the other and swung over the edge of the sofa one arm was flung easily above his head the warm flush of healthful happy childish sleep was on his quiet face his waving tangle of bright hair strayed over the yellow satin cushion he made a picture well worth looking at as mr havisham looked at it he put his hand up and rubbed his shaven chin with a harassed countenance well havisham said the earls harsh voice behind him what is it it is evident something has happened what was the extraordinary event if i may ask mr havisham turned from the sofa still rubbing his chin it was bad news he answered distressing news my lordthe worst of news i am sorry to be the bearer of it the earl had been uneasy for some time during the evening as he glanced at mr havisham and when he was uneasy he was always illtempered why do you look so at the boy he exclaimed irritably you have been looking at him all the evening as ifsee here now why should you look at the boy havisham and hang over him like some bird of illomen what has your news to do with lord fauntleroy my lord said mr havisham i will waste no words my news has everything to do with lord fauntleroy and if we are to believe itit is not lord fauntleroy who lies sleeping before us but only the son of captain errol and the present lord fauntleroy is the son of your son bevis and is at this moment in a lodginghouse in london the earl clutched the arms of his chair with both his hands until the veins stood out upon them the veins stood out on his forehead too his fierce old face was almost livid what do you mean he cried out you are mad whose lie is this if it is a lie answered mr havisham it is painfully like the truth a woman came to my chambers this morning she said your son bevis married her six years ago in london she showed me her marriage certificate they quarrelled a year after the marriage and he paid her to keep away from him she has a son five years old she is an american of the lower classesan ignorant personand until lately she did not fully understand what her son could claim she consulted a lawyer and found out that the boy was really lord fauntleroy and the heir to the earldom of dorincourt and she of course insists on his claims being acknowledged there was a movement of the curly head on the yellow satin cushion a soft long sleepy sigh came from the parted lips and the little boy stirred in his sleep but not at all restlessly or uneasily not at all as if his slumber were disturbed by the fact that he was being proved a small impostor and that he was not lord fauntleroy at all and never would be the earl of dorincourt he only turned his rosy face more on its side as if to enable the old man who stared at it so solemnly to see it better the handsome grim old face was ghastly a bitter smile fixed itself upon it i should refuse to believe a word of it he said if it were not such a low scoundrelly piece of business that it becomes quite possible in connection with the name of my son bevis it is quite like bevis he was always a disgrace to us always a weak untruthful vicious young brute with low tastesmy son and heir bevis lord fauntleroy the woman is an ignorant vulgar person you say i am obliged to admit that she can scarcely spell her own name answered the lawyer she is absolutely uneducated and openly mercenary she cares for nothing but the money she is very handsome in a coarse way but the fastidious old lawyer ceased speaking and gave a sort of shudder the veins on the old earls forehead stood out like purple cords something else stood out upon it toocold drops of moisture he took out his handkerchief and swept them away his smile grew even more bitter and i he said i objected toto the other woman the mother of this child pointing to the sleeping form on the sofa i refused to recognize her and yet she could spell her own name i suppose this is retribution suddenly he sprang up from his chair and began to walk up and down the room fierce and terrible words poured forth from his lips his rage and hatred and cruel disappointment shook him as a storm shakes a tree his violence was something dreadful to see and yet mr havisham noticed that at the very worst of his wrath he never seemed to forget the little sleeping figure on the yellow satin cushion and that he never once spoke loud enough to awaken it i might have known it he said they were a disgrace to me from their first hour i hated them both and they hated me bevis was the worse of the two i will not believe this yet though i will contend against it to the last but it is like bevisit is like him and then he raged again and asked questions about the woman about her proofs and pacing the room turned first white and then purple in his repressed fury when at last he had learned all there was to be told and knew the worst mr havisham looked at him with a feeling of anxiety he looked broken and haggard and changed his rages had always been bad for him but this one had been worse than the rest because there had been something more than rage in it he came slowly back to the sofa at last and stood near it if any one had told me i could be fond of a child he said his harsh voice low and unsteady i should not have believed them i always detested childrenmy own more than the rest i am fond of this one he is fond of me with a bitter smile i am not popular i never was but he is fond of me he never was afraid of mehe always trusted me he would have filled my place better than i have filled it i know that he would have been an honor to the name he bent down and stood a minute or so looking at the happy sleeping face his shaggy eyebrows were knitted fiercely and yet somehow he did not seem fierce at all he put up his hand pushed the bright hair back from the forehead and then turned away and rang the bell when the largest footman appeared he pointed to the sofa takehe said and then his voice changed a littletake lord fauntleroy to his room xi when mr hobbss young friend left him to go to dorincourt castle and become lord fauntleroy and the groceryman had time to realize that the atlantic ocean lay between himself and the small companion who had spent so many agreeable hours in his society he really began to feel very lonely indeed the fact was mr hobbs was not a clever man nor even a bright one he was indeed rather a slow and heavy person and he had never made many acquaintances he was not mentally energetic enough to know how to amuse himself and in truth he never did anything of an entertaining nature but read the newspapers and add up his accounts it was not very easy for him to add up his accounts and sometimes it took him a long time to bring them out right and in the old days little lord fauntleroy who had learned how to add up quite nicely with his fingers and a slate and pencil had sometimes even gone to the length of trying to help him and then too he had been so good a listener and had taken such an interest in what the newspaper said and he and mr hobbs had held such long conversations about the revolution and the british and the elections and the republican party that it was no wonder his going left a blank in the grocery store at first it seemed to mr hobbs that cedric was not really far away and would come back again that some day he would look up from his paper and see the little lad standing in the doorway in his white suit and red stockings and with his straw hat on the back of his head and would hear him say in his cheerful little voice hello mr hobbs this is a hot dayisnt it but as the days passed on and this did not happen mr hobbs felt very dull and uneasy he did not even enjoy his newspaper as much as he used to he would put the paper down on his knee after reading it and sit and stare at the high stool for a long time there were some marks on the long legs which made him feel quite dejected and melancholy they were marks made by the heels of the next earl of dorincourt when he kicked and talked at the same time it seems that even youthful earls kick the legs of things they sit onnoble blood and lofty lineage do not prevent it after looking at those marks mr hobbs would take out his gold watch and open it and stare at the inscription from his oldest friend lord fauntleroy to mr hobbs when this you see remember me and after staring at it awhile he would shut it up with a loud snap and sigh and get up and go and stand in the doorwaybetween the box of potatoes and the barrel of applesand look up the street at night when the store was closed he would light his pipe and walk slowly along the pavement until he reached the house where cedric had lived on which there was a sign that read this house to let and he would stop near it and look up and shake his head and puff at his pipe very hard and after a while walk mournfully back again this went on for two or three weeks before any new idea came to him being slow and ponderous it always took him a long time to reach a new idea as a rule he did not like new ideas but preferred old ones after two or three weeks however during which instead of getting better matters really grew worse a novel plan slowly and deliberately dawned upon him he would go to see dick he smoked a great many pipes before he arrived at the conclusion but finally he did arrive at it he would go to see dick he knew all about dick cedric had told him and his idea was that perhaps dick might be some comfort to him in the way of talking things over so one day when dick was very hard at work blacking a customers boots a short stout man with a heavy face and a bald head stopped on the pavement and stared for two or three minutes at the bootblacks sign which read professor dick tipton cant be beat he stared at it so long that dick began to take a lively interest in him and when he had put the finishing touch to his customers boots he said want a shine sir the stout man came forward deliberately and put his foot on the rest yes he said then when dick fell to work the stout man looked from dick to the sign and from the sign to dick where did you get that he asked from a friend o mine said dicka little feller he guv me the whole outfit he was the best little feller ye ever saw hes in england now gone to be one o them lords lordlord asked mr hobbs with ponderous slowness lord fauntleroygoin to be earl of dorincourt dick almost dropped his brush why boss he exclaimed d ye know him yerself ive known him answered mr hobbs wiping his warm forehead ever since he was born we was lifetime acquaintancesthats what we was it really made him feel quite agitated to speak of it he pulled the splendid gold watch out of his pocket and opened it and showed the inside of the case to dick when this you see remember me he read that was his parting keepsake to me i dont want you to forget methose was his wordsid ha remembered him he went on shaking his head if he hadnt given me a thing an i hadnt seen hide nor hair on him again he was a companion as any man would remember he was the nicest little feller i ever see said dick an as to sandi never seen so much sand to a little feller i thought a heap o him i didan we was friends toowe was sort o chums from the fust that little young un an me i grabbed his ball from under a stage fur him an he never forgot it an hed come down here he would with his mother or his nuss and hed holler hello dick at me as friendly as if he was six feet high when he warnt knee high to a grasshopper and was dressed in gals cloes he was a gay little chap and when you was down on your luck it did you good to talk to him thats so said mr hobbs it was a pity to make a earl out of him he would have shone in the grocery businessor dry goods either he would have shone and he shook his head with deeper regret than ever it proved that they had so much to say to each other that it was not possible to say it all at one time and so it was agreed that the next night dick should make a visit to the store and keep mr hobbs company the plan pleased dick well enough he had been a street waif nearly all his life but he had never been a bad boy and he had always had a private yearning for a more respectable kind of existence since he had been in business for himself he had made enough money to enable him to sleep under a roof instead of out in the streets and he had begun to hope he might reach even a higher plane in time so to be invited to call on a stout respectable man who owned a corner store and even had a horse and wagon seemed to him quite an event do you know anything about earls and castles mr hobbs inquired id like to know more of the particklars theres a story about some on em in the penny story gazette said dick its called the crime of a coronet or the revenge of the countess may its a boss thing too some of us boys re takin it to read bring it up when you come said mr hobbs an ill pay for it bring all you can find that have any earls in em if there arent earls markisesll do or dooksthough he never made mention of any dooks or markises we did go over coronets a little but i never happened to see any i guess they dont keep em round here tiffany d have em if anybody did said dick but i dont know as id know one if i saw it mr hobbs did not explain that he would not have known one if he saw it he merely shook his head ponderously i spose there is very little call for em he said and that ended the matter this was the beginning of quite a substantial friendship when dick went up to the store mr hobbs received him with great hospitality he gave him a chair tilted against the door near a barrel of apples and after his young visitor was seated he made a jerk at them with the hand in which he held his pipe saying help yerself then he looked at the story papers and after that they read and discussed the british aristocracy and mr hobbs smoked his pipe very hard and shook his head a great deal he shook it most when he pointed out the high stool with the marks on its legs theres his very kicks he said impressively his very kicks i sit and look at em by the hour this is a world of ups an its a world of downs why hed set there an eat crackers out of a box an apples out of a barrel an pitch his cores into the street an now hes a lord alivin in a castle thems a lords kicks theyll be a earls kicks some day sometimes i says to myself says i well ill be jiggered he seemed to derive a great deal of comfort from his reflections and dicks visit before dick went home they had a supper in the small backroom they had crackers and cheese and sardines and other canned things out of the store and mr hobbs solemnly opened two bottles of ginger ale and pouring out two glasses proposed a toast heres to him he said lifting his glass an may he teach em a lessonearls an markises an dooks an all after that night the two saw each other often and mr hobbs was much more comfortable and less desolate they read the penny story gazette and many other interesting things and gained a knowledge of the habits of the nobility and gentry which would have surprised those despised classes if they had realized it one day mr hobbs made a pilgrimage to a book store down town for the express purpose of adding to their library he went to the clerk and leaned over the counter to speak to him i want he said a book about earls what exclaimed the clerk a book repeated the groceryman about earls im afraid said the clerk looking rather queer that we havent what you want havent said mr hobbs anxiously well say markises thenor dooks i know of no such book answered the clerk mr hobbs was much disturbed he looked down on the floorthen he looked up none about female earls he inquired im afraid not said the clerk with a smile well exclaimed mr hobbs ill be jiggered he was just going out of the store when the clerk called him back and asked him if a story in which the nobility were chief characters would do mr hobbs said it wouldif he could not get an entire volume devoted to earls so the clerk sold him a book called the tower of london written by mr harrison ainsworth and he carried it home when dick came they began to read it it was a very wonderful and exciting book and the scene was laid in the reign of the famous english queen who is called by some people bloody mary and as mr hobbs heard of queen marys deeds and the habit she had of chopping peoples heads off putting them to the torture and burning them alive he became very much excited he took his pipe out of his mouth and stared at dick and at last he was obliged to mop the perspiration from his brow with his red pocket handkerchief why he aint safe he said he aint safe if the women folks can sit up on their thrones an give the word for things like that to be done whos to know whats happening to him this very minute hes no more safe than nothing just let a woman like that get mad an no ones safe well said dick though he looked rather anxious himself ye see this ere un isnt the one thats bossin things now i know her names victory an this un here in the book her names mary so it is said mr hobbs still mopping his forehead so it is an the newspapers are not sayin anything about any racks thumbscrews or stakeburninsbut still it doesnt seem as if t was safe for him over there with those queer folks why they tell me they dont keep the fourth o july he was privately uneasy for several days and it was not until he received fauntleroys letter and had read it several times both to himself and to dick and had also read the letter dick got about the same time that he became composed again but they both found great pleasure in their letters they read and reread them and talked them over and enjoyed every word of them and they spent days over the answers they sent and read them over almost as often as the letters they had received it was rather a labor for dick to write his all his knowledge of reading and writing he had gained during a few months when he had lived with his elder brother and had gone to a nightschool but being a sharp boy he had made the most of that brief education and had spelled out things in newspapers since then and practiced writing with bits of chalk on pavements or walls or fences he told mr hobbs all about his life and about his elder brother who had been rather good to him after their mother died when dick was quite a little fellow their father had died some time before the brothers name was ben and he had taken care of dick as well as he could until the boy was old enough to sell newspapers and run errands they had lived together and as he grew older ben had managed to get along until he had quite a decent place in a store and then exclaimed dick with disgust blest if he didnt go an marry a gal just went and got spoony an hadnt any more sense left married her an set up housekeepin in two back rooms an a hefty un she wasa regular tigercat shed tear things to pieces when she got madand she was mad all the time had a baby just like heryell day n

she was crackey but didnt we have a timeben n mehself n the young un she was mad at ben because he didnt make money faster n at last he went out west with a man to set up a cattle ranch an hadnt been

across the water to be nuss to a lady as had a little baby too never heard a word of her sincenuther has ben if id ha bin him i wouldnt ha fretted a bitn i guess he didnt but he thought a heap o her

arm and twist it round n round her head n i tell you her eyes d snap folks used to say she was part italiunsaid her mother or father d come from there n it made her queer i tell ye she was one of emshe was he often told mr hobbs stories of her and of his brother ben who since his going out west had written once or twice to dick bens luck had not been good and he had wandered from place to place but at last he had settled on a ranch in california where he was at work at the time when dick became acquainted with mr hobbs that gal said dick one day she took all the grit out o him i couldnt help feelin sorry for him sometimes they were sitting in the store doorway together and mr hobbs was filling his pipe he oughtnt to ve married he said solemnly as he rose to get a match womeni never could see any use in em myself as he took the match from its box he stopped and looked down on the counter why he said if here isnt a letter i didnt see it before the postman must have laid it down when i wasnt noticin or the newspaper slipped over it he picked it up and looked at it carefully its from him he exclaimed thats the very one its from he forgot his pipe altogether he went back to his chair quite excited and took his pocketknife and opened the envelope i wonder what news there is this time he said and then he unfolded the letter and read as follows dorincourt castle my dear mr hobbs i write this in a great hury becaus i have something curous to tell you i know you will be very mutch suprised my dear frend when i tel you it is all a mistake and i am not a lord and i shall not have to be an earl there is a lady whitch was marid to my uncle bevis who is dead and she has a little boy and he is lord fauntleroy becaus that is the way it is in england the earls eldest sons little boy is the earl if every body else is dead i mean if his farther and grandfarther are dead my grandfarther is not dead but my uncle bevis is and so his boy is lord fauntleroy and i am not becaus my papa was the youngest son and my name is cedric errol like it was when i was in new york and all the things will belong to the other boy i thought at first i should have to give him my pony and cart but my grandfarther says i need not my grandfarther is very sorry and i think he does not like the lady but preaps he thinks dearest and i are sorry because i shall not be an earl i would like to be an earl now better than i thout i would at first becaus this is a beautifle castle and i like every body so and when you are rich you can do so many things i am not rich now becaus when your papa is only the youngest son he is not very rich i am going to learn to work so that i can take care of dearest i have been asking wilkins about grooming horses preaps i might be a groom or a coachman the lady brought her little boy to the castle and my grandfarther and mr havisham talked to her i think she was angry she talked loud and my grandfarther was angry too i never saw him angry before i wish it did not make them all mad i thort i would tell you and dick right away becaus you would be intrusted so no more at present with love from your old frend cedric errol not lord fauntleroy mr hobbs fell back in his chair the letter dropped on his knee his penknife slipped to the floor and so did the envelope well he ejaculated i am jiggered he was so dumfounded that he actually changed his exclamation it had always been his habit to say i will be jiggered but this time he said i am jiggered perhaps he really was jiggered there is no knowing well said dick the whole things bust up hasnt it bust said mr hobbs its my opinion its a putup job o the british ristycrats to rob him of his rights because hes an american theyve had a spite agin us ever since the revolution an theyre takin it out on him i told you he wasnt safe an see whats happened like as not the whole goverments got together to rob him of his lawful ownins he was very much agitated he had not approved of the change in his young friends circumstances at first but lately he had become more reconciled to it and after the receipt of cedrics letter he had perhaps even felt some secret pride in his young friends magnificence he might not have a good opinion of earls but he knew that even in america money was considered rather an agreeable thing and if all the wealth and grandeur were to go with the title it must be rather hard to lose it theyre trying to rob him he said thats what theyre doing and folks that have money ought to look after him and he kept dick with him until quite a late hour to talk it over and when that young man left he went with him to the corner of the street and on his way back he stopped opposite the empty house for some time staring at the to let and smoking his pipe in much disturbance of mind xii a very few days after the dinner party at the castle almost everybody in england who read the newspapers at all knew the romantic story of what had happened at dorincourt it made a very interesting story when it was told with all the details there was the little american boy who had been brought to england to be lord fauntleroy and who was said to be so fine and handsome a little fellow and to have already made people fond of him there was the old earl his grandfather who was so proud of his heir there was the pretty young mother who had never been forgiven for marrying captain errol and there was the strange marriage of bevis the dead lord fauntleroy and the strange wife of whom no one knew anything suddenly appearing with her son and saying that he was the real lord fauntleroy and must have his rights all these things were talked about and written about and caused a tremendous sensation and then there came the rumor that the earl of dorincourt was not satisfied with the turn affairs had taken and would perhaps contest the claim by law and the matter might end with a wonderful trial there never had been such excitement before in the county in which erleboro was situated on marketdays people stood in groups and talked and wondered what would be done the farmers wives invited one another to tea that they might tell one another all they had heard and all they thought and all they thought other people thought they related wonderful anecdotes about the earls rage and his determination not to acknowledge the new lord fauntleroy and his hatred of the woman who was the claimants mother but of course it was mrs dibble who could tell the most and who was more in demand than ever an a bad lookout it is she said an if you were to ask me maam i should say as it was a judgment on him for the way hes treated that sweet young cretur as he parted from her childfor hes got that fond of him an that set on him an that proud of him as hes amost drove mad by whats happened an whats more this new ones no lady as his little lordships ma is shes a boldfaced blackeyed thing as mr thomas says no gentleman in livery ud bemean hisself to be gave orders by and let her come into the house he says an he goes out of it an the boy dont no more compare with the other one than nothin you could mention an mercy knows whats goin to come of it all an where its to end an you might have knocked me down with a feather when jane brought the news in fact there was excitement everywhere at the castle in the library where the earl and mr havisham sat and talked in the servants hall where mr thomas and the butler and the other men and women servants gossiped and exclaimed at all times of the day and in the stables where wilkins went about his work in a quite depressed state of mind and groomed the brown pony more beautifully than ever and said mournfully to the coachman that he never taught a young genleman to ride as took to it more natral or was a betterplucked one than he was he was a one as it were some pleasure to ride behind but in the midst of all the disturbance there was one person who was quite calm and untroubled that person was the little lord fauntleroy who was said not to be lord fauntleroy at all when first the state of affairs had been explained to him he had felt some little anxiousness and perplexity it is true but its foundation was not in baffled ambition while the earl told him what had happened he had sat on a stool holding on to his knee as he so often did when he was listening to anything interesting and by the time the story was finished he looked quite sober it makes me feel very queer he said it makes me feelqueer the earl looked at the boy in silence it made him feel queer tooqueerer than he had ever felt in his whole life and he felt more queer still when he saw that there was a troubled expression on the small face which was usually so happy will they take dearests house from herand her carriage cedric asked in a rather unsteady anxious little voice no said the earl decidedlyin quite a loud voice in fact they can take nothing from her ah said cedric with evident relief cant they then he looked up at his grandfather and there was a wistful shade in his eyes and they looked very big and soft that other boy he said rather tremulouslyhe will have toto be your boy nowas i waswont he no answered the earland he said it so fiercely and loudly that cedric quite jumped no he exclaimed in wonderment wont he i thought he stood up from his stool quite suddenly shall i be your boy even if im not going to be an earl he said shall i be your boy just as i was before and his flushed little face was all alight with eagerness how the old earl did look at him from head to foot to be sure how his great shaggy brows did draw themselves together and how queerly his deep eyes shone under themhow very queerly my boy he saidand if youll believe it his very voice was queer almost shaky and a little broken and hoarse not at all what you would expect an earls voice to be though he spoke more decidedly and peremptorily even than beforeyes youll be my boy as long as i live and by george sometimes i feel as if you were the only boy i had ever had cedrics face turned red to the roots of his hair it turned red with relief and pleasure he put both his hands deep into his pockets and looked squarely into his noble relatives eyes do you he said well then i dont care about the earl part at all i dont care whether im an earl or not i thoughtyou see i thought the one that was going to be the earl would have to be your boy too andand i couldnt be that was what made me feel so queer the earl put his hand on his shoulder and drew him nearer they shall take nothing from you that i can hold for you he said drawing his breath hard i wont believe yet that they can take anything from you you were made for the place andwell you may fill it still but whatever comes you shall have all that i can give youall it scarcely seemed as if he were speaking to a child there was such determination in his face and voice it was more as if he were making a promise to himselfand perhaps he was he had never before known how deep a hold upon him his fondness for the boy and his pride in him had taken he had never seen his strength and good qualities and beauty as he seemed to see them now to his obstinate nature it seemed impossiblemore than impossibleto give up what he had so set his heart upon and he had determined that he would not give it up without a fierce struggle within a few days after she had seen mr havisham the woman who claimed to be lady fauntleroy presented herself at the castle and brought her child with her she was sent away the earl would not see her she was told by the footman at the door his lawyer would attend to her case it was thomas who gave the message and who expressed his opinion of her freely afterward in the servants hall he hoped he said as he had wore livery in igh famblies long enough to know a lady when he see one an if that was a lady he was no judge o females the one at the lodge added thomas loftily merican or no merican shes one o the right sort as any gentleman ud reckinize with all a heye i remarked it myself to henery when fust we called there the woman drove away the look on her handsome common face half frightened half fierce mr havisham had noticed during his interviews with her that though she had a passionate temper and a coarse insolent manner she was neither so clever nor so bold as she meant to be she seemed sometimes to be almost overwhelmed by the position in which she had placed herself it was as if she had not expected to meet with such opposition she is evidently the lawyer said to mrs errol a person from the lower walks of life she is uneducated and untrained in everything and quite unused to meeting people like ourselves on any terms of equality she does not know what to do her visit to the castle quite cowed her she was infuriated but she was cowed the earl would not receive her but i advised him to go with me to the dorincourt arms where she is staying when she saw him enter the room she turned white though she flew into a rage at once and threatened and demanded in one breath the fact was that the earl had stalked into the room and stood looking like a venerable aristocratic giant staring at the woman from under his beetling brows and not condescending a word he simply stared at her taking her in from head to foot as if she were some repulsive curiosity he let her talk and demand until she was tired without himself uttering a word and then he said you say you are my eldest sons wife if that is true and if the proof you offer is too much for us the law is on your side in that case your boy is lord fauntleroy the matter will be sifted to the bottom you may rest assured if your claims are proved you will be provided for i want to see nothing of either you or the child so long as i live the place will unfortunately have enough of you after my death you are exactly the kind of person i should have expected my son bevis to choose and then he turned his back upon her and stalked out of the room as he had stalked into it not many days after that a visitor was announced to mrs errol who was writing in her little morning room the maid who brought the message looked rather excited her eyes were quite round with amazement in fact and being young and inexperienced she regarded her mistress with nervous sympathy its the earl hisself maam she said in tremulous awe when mrs errol entered the drawingroom a very tall majesticlooking old man was standing on the tigerskin rug he had a handsome grim old face with an aquiline profile a long white mustache and an obstinate look mrs errol i believe he said mrs errol she answered i am the earl of dorincourt he said he paused a moment almost unconsciously to look into her uplifted eyes they were so like the big affectionate childish eyes he had seen uplifted to his own so often every day during the last few months that they gave him a quite curious sensation the boy is very like you he said abruptly it has been often said so my lord she replied but i have been glad to think him like his father also as lady lorridaile had told him her voice was very sweet and her manner was very simple and dignified she did not seem in the least troubled by his sudden coming yes said the earl he is likemy sontoo he put his hand up to his big white mustache and pulled it fiercely do you know he said why i have come here i have seen mr havisham mrs errol began and he has told me of the claims which have been made i have come to tell you said the earl that they will be investigated and contested if a contest can be made i have come to tell you that the boy shall be defended with all the power of the law his rights the soft voice interrupted him he must have nothing that is not his by right even if the law can give it to him she said unfortunately the law can not said the earl if it could it should this outrageous woman and her child perhaps she cares for him as much as i care for cedric my lord said little mrs errol and if she was your eldest sons wife her son is lord fauntleroy and mine is not she was no more afraid of him than cedric had been and she looked at him just as cedric would have looked and he having been an old tyrant all his life was privately pleased by it people so seldom dared to differ from him that there was an entertaining novelty in it i suppose he said scowling slightly that you would much prefer that he should not be the earl of dorincourt her fair young face flushed it is a very magnificent thing to be the earl of dorincourt my lord she said i know that but i care most that he should be what his father wasbrave and just and true always in striking contrast to what his grandfather was eh said his lordship sardonically i have not had the pleasure of knowing his grandfather replied mrs errol but i know my little boy believes she stopped short a moment looking quietly into his face and then she added i know that cedric loves you would he have loved me said the earl dryly if you had told him why i did not receive you at the castle no answered mrs errol i think not that was why i did not wish him to know well said my lord brusquely there are few women who would not have told him he suddenly began to walk up and down the room pulling his great mustache more violently than ever yes he is fond of me he said and i am fond of him i cant say i ever was fond of anything before i am fond of him he pleased me from the first i am an old man and was tired of my life he has given me something to live for i am proud of him i was satisfied to think of his taking his place some day as the head of the family he came back and stood before mrs errol i am miserable he said miserable he looked as if he was even his pride could not keep his voice steady or his hands from shaking for a moment it almost seemed as if his deep fierce eyes had tears in them perhaps it is because i am miserable that i have come to you he said quite glaring down at her i used to hate you i have been jealous of you this wretched disgraceful business has changed that after seeing that repulsive woman who calls herself the wife of my son bevis i actually felt it would be a relief to look at you i have been an obstinate old fool and i suppose i have treated you badly you are like the boy and the boy is the first object in my life i am miserable and i came to you merely because you are like the boy and he cares for you and i care for him treat me as well as you can for the boys sake he said it all in his harsh voice and almost roughly but somehow he seemed so broken down for the time that mrs errol was touched to the heart she got up and moved an armchair a little forward i wish you would sit down she said in a soft pretty sympathetic way you have been so much troubled that you are very tired and you need all your strength it was just as new to him to be spoken to and cared for in that gentle simple way as it was to be contradicted he was reminded of the boy again and he actually did as she asked him perhaps his disappointment and wretchedness were good discipline for him if he had not been wretched he might have continued to hate her but just at present he found her a little soothing almost anything would have seemed pleasant by contrast with lady fauntleroy and this one had so sweet a face and voice and a pretty dignity when she spoke or moved very soon through the quiet magic of these influences he began to feel less gloomy and then he talked still more whatever happens he said the boy shall be provided for he shall be taken care of now and in the future before he went away he glanced around the room do you like the house he demanded very much she answered this is a cheerful room he said may i come here again and talk this matter over as often as you wish my lord she replied and then he went out to his carriage and drove away thomas and henry almost stricken dumb upon the box at the turn affairs had taken xiii of course as soon as the story of lord fauntleroy and the difficulties of the earl of dorincourt were discussed in the english newspapers they were discussed in the american newspapers the story was too interesting to be passed over lightly and it was talked of a great deal there were so many versions of it that it would have been an edifying thing to buy all the papers and compare them mr hobbs read so much about it that he became quite bewildered one paper described his young friend cedric as an infant in armsanother as a young man at oxford winning all the honors and distinguishing himself by writing greek poems one said he was engaged to a young lady of great beauty who was the daughter of a duke another said he had just been married the only thing in fact which was not said was that he was a little boy between seven and eight with handsome legs and curly hair one said he was no relation to the earl of dorincourt at all but was a small impostor who had sold newspapers and slept in the streets of new york before his mother imposed upon the family lawyer who came to america to look for the earls heir then came the descriptions of the new lord fauntleroy and his mother sometimes she was a gypsy sometimes an actress sometimes a beautiful spaniard but it was always agreed that the earl of dorincourt was her deadly enemy and would not acknowledge her son as his heir if he could help it and as there seemed to be some slight flaw in the papers she had produced it was expected that there would be a long trial which would be far more interesting than anything ever carried into court before mr hobbs used to read the papers until his head was in a whirl and in the evening he and dick would talk it all over they found out what an important personage an earl of dorincourt was and what a magnificent income he possessed and how many estates he owned and how stately and beautiful was the castle in which he lived and the more they learned the more excited they became seems like somethin orter be done said mr hobbs things like them orter be held on toearls or no earls but there really was nothing they could do but each write a letter to cedric containing assurances of their friendship and sympathy they wrote those letters as soon as they could after receiving the news and after having written them they handed them over to each other to be read this is what mr hobbs read in dicks letter dere frend i got ure letter an mr hobbs got his an we are sory u are down on ure luck an we say hold on as longs u kin an dont let no one git ahed of u there is a lot of ole theves wil make al they kin of u ef u dont kepe ure i skined but this is mosly to say that ive not forgot wot u did fur me an if there aint no better way cum over here an go in pardners with me biznes is fine an ile see no harm cums to u enny big feler that trise to cum it over u wil hafter setle it fust with perfessor dick tipton so no more at present dick and this was what dick read in mr hobbss letter dear sir yrs received and wd say things looks bad i believe its a put up job and them thats done it ought to be looked after sharp and what i write to say is two things im going to look this thing up keep quiet and ill see a lawyer and do all i can and if the worst happens and them earls is too many for us theres a partnership in the grocery business ready for you when yure old enough and a home and a friend in yrs truly silas hobbs well said mr hobbs hes pervided for between us if he aint a earl so he is said dick id ha stood by him blest if i didnt like that little feller fustrate the very next morning one of dicks customers was rather surprised he was a young lawyer just beginning practiceas poor as a very young lawyer can possibly be but a bright energetic young fellow with sharp wit and a good temper he had a shabby office near dicks stand and every morning dick blacked his boots for him and quite often they were not exactly watertight but he always had a friendly word or a joke for dick that particular morning when he put his foot on the rest he had an illustrated paper in his handan enterprising paper with pictures in it of conspicuous people and things he had just finished looking it over and when the last boot was polished he handed it over to the boy heres a paper for you dick he said you can look it over when you drop in at delmonicos for your breakfast picture of an english castle in it and an english earls daughterinlaw fine young woman toolots of hairthough she seems to be raising rather a row you ought to become familiar with the nobility and gentry dick begin on the right honorable the earl of dorincourt and lady fauntleroy hello i say whats the matter the pictures he spoke of were on the front page and dick was staring at one of them with his eyes and mouth open and his sharp face almost pale with excitement whats to pay dick said the young man what has paralyzed you dick really did look as if something tremendous had happened he pointed to the picture under which was written mother of claimant lady fauntleroy it was the picture of a handsome woman with large eyes and heavy braids of black hair wound around her head her said dick my i know her better n i know you the young man began to laugh where did you meet her dick he said at newport or when you ran over to paris the last time dick actually forgot to grin he began to gather his brushes and things together as if he had something to do which would put an end to his business for the present never mind he said i know her an ive struck work for this mornin and in less than five minutes from that time he was tearing through the streets on his way to mr hobbs and the corner store mr hobbs could scarcely believe the evidence of his senses when he looked across the counter and saw dick rush in with the paper in his hand the boy was out of breath with running so much out of breath in fact that he could scarcely speak as he threw the paper down on the counter hello exclaimed mr hobbs hello what you got there look at it panted dick look at that woman in the picture thats what you look at she aint no ristocrat she aint with withering scorn shes no lords wife you may eat me if it aint minnaminna id know her anywheres an so d ben jest ax him mr hobbs dropped into his seat i knowed it was a putup job he said i knowed it and they done it on account o him bein a merican done it cried dick with disgust she done it thats who done it she was allers up to her tricks an ill tell yer wot come to me the minnit i saw her pictur there was one o them papers we saw had a letter in it that said somethin bout her boy an it said he had a scar on his chin put them two togetherher n that there scar why that there boy o hers aint no more a lord than i am its bens boythe little chap she hit when she let fly that plate at me professor dick tipton had always been a sharp boy and earning his living in the streets of a big city had made him still sharper he had learned to keep his eyes open and his wits about him and it must be confessed he enjoyed immensely the excitement and impatience of that moment if little lord fauntleroy could only have looked into the store that morning he would certainly have been interested even if all the discussion and plans had been intended to decide the fate of some other boy than himself mr hobbs was almost overwhelmed by his sense of responsibility and dick was all alive and full of energy he began to write a letter to ben and he cut out the picture and inclosed it to him and mr hobbs wrote a letter to cedric and one to the earl they were in the midst of this letterwriting when a new idea came to dick say he said the feller that give me the paper hes a lawyer lets ax him what wed better do lawyers knows it all mr hobbs was immensely impressed by this suggestion and dicks business capacity thats so he replied this here calls for lawyers and leaving the store in the care of a substitute he struggled into his coat and marched downtown with dick and the two presented themselves with their romantic story in mr harrisons office much to that young mans astonishment if he had not been a very young lawyer with a very enterprising mind and a great deal of spare time on his hands he might not have been so readily interested in what they had to say for it all certainly sounded very wild and queer but he chanced to want something to do very much and he chanced to know dick and dick chanced to say his say in a very sharp telling sort of way and said mr hobbs say what your times worth a hour and look into this thing thorough and ill pay the damagesilas hobbs corner of blank street vegetables and fancy groceries well said mr harrison it will be a big thing if it turns out all right and it will be almost as big a thing for me as for lord fauntleroy and at any rate no harm can be done by investigating it appears there has been some dubiousness about the child the woman contradicted herself in some of her statements about his age and aroused suspicion the first persons to be written to are dicks brother and the earl of dorincourts family lawyer and actually before the sun went down two letters had been written and sent in two different directionsone speeding out of new york harbor on a mail steamer on its way to england and the other on a train carrying letters and passengers bound for california and the first was addressed to t havisham esq and the second to benjamin tipton and after the store was closed that evening mr hobbs and dick sat in the backroom and talked together until midnight xiv it is astonishing how short a time it takes for very wonderful things to happen it had taken only a few minutes apparently to change all the fortunes of the little boy dangling his red legs from the high stool in mr hobbss store and to transform him from a small boy living the simplest life in a quiet street into an english nobleman the heir to an earldom and magnificent wealth it had taken only a few minutes apparently to change him from an english nobleman into a penniless little impostor with no right to any of the splendors he had been enjoying and surprising as it may appear it did not take nearly so long a time as one might have expected to alter the face of everything again and to give back to him all that he had been in danger of losing it took the less time because after all the woman who had called herself lady fauntleroy was not nearly so clever as she was wicked and when she had been closely pressed by mr havishams questions about her marriage and her boy she had made one or two blunders which had caused suspicion to be awakened and then she had lost her presence of mind and her temper and in her excitement and anger had betrayed herself still further all the mistakes she made were about her child there seemed no doubt that she had been married to bevis lord fauntleroy and had quarreled with him and had been paid to keep away from him but mr havisham found out that her story of the boys being born in a certain part of london was false and just when they all were in the midst of the commotion caused by this discovery there came the letter from the young lawyer in new york and mr hobbss letters also what an evening it was when those letters arrived and when mr havisham and the earl sat and talked their plans over in the library after my first three meetings with her said mr havisham i began to suspect her strongly it appeared to me that the child was older than she said he was and she made a slip in speaking of the date of his birth and then tried to patch the matter up the story these letters bring fits in with several of my suspicions our best plan will be to cable at once for these two tiptonssay nothing about them to herand suddenly confront her with them when she is not expecting it she is only a very clumsy plotter after all my opinion is that she will be frightened out of her wits and will betray herself on the spot and that was what actually happened she was told nothing and mr havisham kept her from suspecting anything by continuing to have interviews with her in which he assured her he was investigating her statements and she really began to feel so secure that her spirits rose immensely and she began to be as insolent as might have been expected but one fine morning as she sat in her sittingroom at the inn called the dorincourt arms making some very fine plans for herself mr havisham was announced and when he entered he was followed by no less than three personsone was a sharpfaced boy and one was a big young man and the third was the earl of dorincourt she sprang to her feet and actually uttered a cry of terror it broke from her before she had time to check it she had thought of these newcomers as being thousands of miles away when she had ever thought of them at all which she had scarcely done for years she had never expected to see them again it must be confessed that dick grinned a little when he saw her hello minna he said the big young manwho was benstood still a minute and looked at her do you know her mr havisham asked glancing from one to the other yes said ben i know her and she knows me and he turned his back on her and went and stood looking out of the window as if the sight of her was hateful to him as indeed it was then the woman seeing herself so baffled and exposed lost all control over herself and flew into such a rage as ben and dick had often seen her in before dick grinned a trifle more as he watched her and heard the names she called them all and the violent threats she made but ben did not turn to look at her i can swear to her in any court he said to mr havisham and i can bring a dozen others who will her father is a respectable sort of man though hes low down in the world her mother was just like herself shes dead but hes alive and hes honest enough to be ashamed of her hell tell you who she is and whether she married me or not then he clenched his hand suddenly and turned on her wheres the child he demanded hes going with me he is done with you and so am i and just as he finished saying the words the door leading into the bedroom opened a little and the boy probably attracted by the sound of the loud voices looked in he was not a handsome boy but he had rather a nice face and he was quite like ben his father as any one could see and there was the threecornered scar on his chin ben walked up to him and took his hand and his own was trembling yes he said i could swear to him too tom he said to the little fellow im your father ive come to take you away wheres your hat the boy pointed to where it lay on a chair it evidently rather pleased him to hear that he was going away he had been so accustomed to queer experiences that it did not surprise him to be told by a stranger that he was his father he objected so much to the woman who had come a few months before to the place where he had lived since his babyhood and who had suddenly announced that she was his mother that he was quite ready for a change ben took up the hat and marched to the door if you want me again he said to mr havisham you know where to find me he walked out of the room holding the childs hand and not looking at the woman once she was fairly raving with fury and the earl was calmly gazing at her through his eyeglasses which he had quietly placed upon his aristocratic eagle nose come come my young woman said mr havisham this wont do at all if you dont want to be locked up you really must behave yourself and there was something so very businesslike in his tones that probably feeling that the safest thing she could do would be to get out of the way she gave him one savage look and dashed past him into the next room and slammed the door we shall have no more trouble with her said mr havisham and he was right for that very night she left the dorincourt arms and took the train to london and was seen no more when the earl left the room after the interview he went at once to his carriage to court lodge he said to thomas to court lodge said thomas to the coachman as he mounted the box an you may depend on it things are taking a uniggspected turn when the carriage stopped at court lodge cedric was in the drawingroom with his mother the earl came in without being announced he looked an inch or so taller and a great many years younger his deep eyes flashed where he said is lord fauntleroy mrs errol came forward a flush rising to her cheek is it lord fauntleroy she asked is it indeed the earl put out his hand and grasped hers yes he answered it is then he put his other hand on cedrics shoulder fauntleroy he said in his unceremonious authoritative way ask your mother when she will come to us at the castle fauntleroy flung his arms around his mothers neck to live with us he cried to live with us always the earl looked at mrs errol and mrs errol looked at the earl his lordship was entirely in earnest he had made up his mind to waste no time in arranging this matter he had begun to think it would suit him to make friends with his heirs mother are you quite sure you want me said mrs errol with her soft pretty smile quite sure he said bluntly we have always wanted you but we were not exactly aware of it we hope you will come xv ben took his boy and went back to his cattle ranch in california and he returned under very comfortable circumstances just before his going mr havisham had an interview with him in which the lawyer told him that the earl of dorincourt wished to do something for the boy who might have turned out to be lord fauntleroy and so he had decided that it would be a good plan to invest in a cattle ranch of his own and put ben in charge of it on terms which would make it pay him very well and which would lay a foundation for his sons future and so when ben went away he went as the prospective master of a ranch which would be almost as good as his own and might easily become his own in time as indeed it did in the course of a few years and tom the boy grew up on it into a fine young man and was devotedly fond of his father and they were so successful and happy that ben used to say that tom made up to him for all the troubles he had ever had but dick and mr hobbswho had actually come over with the others to see that things were properly looked afterdid not return for some time it had been decided at the outset that the earl would provide for dick and would see that he received a solid education and mr hobbs had decided that as he himself had left a reliable substitute in charge of his store he could afford to wait to see the festivities which were to celebrate lord fauntleroys eighth birthday all the tenantry were invited and there were to be feasting and dancing and games in the park and bonfires and fireworks in the evening just like the fourth of july said lord fauntleroy it seems a pity my birthday wasnt on the fourth doesnt it for then we could keep them both together it must be confessed that at first the earl and mr hobbs were not as intimate as it might have been hoped they would become in the interests of the british aristocracy the fact was that the earl had known very few grocerymen and mr hobbs had not had many very close acquaintances who were earls and so in their rare interviews conversation did not flourish it must also be owned that mr hobbs had been rather overwhelmed by the splendors fauntleroy felt it his duty to show him the entrance gate and the stone lions and the avenue impressed mr hobbs somewhat at the beginning and when he saw the castle and the flowergardens and the hothouses and the terraces and the peacocks and the dungeon and the armor and the great staircase and the stables and the liveried servants he really was quite bewildered but it was the picture gallery which seemed to be the finishing stroke somethin in the manner of a museum he said to fauntleroy when he was led into the great beautiful room nno said fauntleroy rather doubtfully i dont think its a museum my grandfather says these are my ancestors your aunts sisters ejaculated mr hobbs all of em your greatuncle he must have had a family did he raise em all and he sank into a seat and looked around him with quite an agitated countenance until with the greatest difficulty lord fauntleroy managed to explain that the walls were not lined entirely with the portraits of the progeny of his greatuncle he found it necessary in fact to call in the assistance of mrs mellon who knew all about the pictures and could tell who painted them and when and who added romantic stories of the lords and ladies who were the originals when mr hobbs once understood and had heard some of these stories he was very much fascinated and liked the picture gallery almost better than anything else and he would often walk over from the village where he staid at the dorincourt arms and would spend half an hour or so wandering about the gallery staring at the painted ladies and gentlemen who also stared at him and shaking his head nearly all the time and they was all earls he would say er pretty nigh it an hes goin to be one of em an own it all privately he was not nearly so much disgusted with earls and their mode of life as he had expected to be and it is to be doubted whether his strictly republican principles were not shaken a little by a closer acquaintance with castles and ancestors and all the rest of it at any rate one day he uttered a very remarkable and unexpected sentiment i wouldnt have minded bein one of em myself he saidwhich was really a great concession what a grand day it was when little lord fauntleroys birthday arrived and how his young lordship enjoyed it how beautiful the park looked filled with the thronging people dressed in their gayest and best and with the flags flying from the tents and the top of the castle nobody had staid away who could possibly come because everybody was really glad that little lord fauntleroy was to be little lord fauntleroy still and some day was to be the master of everything every one wanted to have a look at him and at his pretty kind mother who had made so many friends and positively every one liked the earl rather better and felt more amiably toward him because the little boy loved and trusted him so and because also he had now made friends with and behaved respectfully to his heirs mother it was said that he was even beginning to be fond of her too and that between his young lordship and his young lordships mother the earl might be changed in time into quite a wellbehaved old nobleman and everybody might be happier and better off what scores and scores of people there were under the trees and in the tents and on the lawns farmers and farmers wives in their sunday suits and bonnets and shawls girls and their sweethearts children frolicking and chasing about and old dames in red cloaks gossiping together at the castle there were ladies and gentlemen who had come to see the fun and to congratulate the earl and to meet mrs errol lady lorredaile and sir harry were there and sir thomas asshe and his daughters and mr havisham of course and then beautiful miss vivian herbert with the loveliest white gown and lace parasol and a circle of gentlemen to take care of herthough she evidently liked fauntleroy better than all of them put together and when he saw her and ran to her and put his arm around her neck she put her arms around him too and kissed him as warmly as if he had been her own favorite little brother and she said dear little lord fauntleroy dear little boy i am so glad i am so glad and afterward she walked about the grounds with him and let him show her everything and when he took her to where mr hobbs and dick were and said to her this is my old old friend mr hobbs miss herbert and this is my other old friend dick i told them how pretty you were and i told them they should see you if you came to my birthdayshe shook hands with them both and stood and talked to them in her prettiest way asking them about america and their voyage and their life since they had been in england while fauntleroy stood by looking up at her with adoring eyes and his cheeks quite flushed with delight because he saw that mr hobbs and dick liked her so much well said dick solemnly afterward shes the daisiest gal i ever saw sheswell shes just a daisy thats what she is n no mistake everybody looked after her as she passed and every one looked after little lord fauntleroy and the sun shone and the flags fluttered and the games were played and the dances danced and as the gayeties went on and the joyous afternoon passed his little lordship was simply radiantly happy the whole world seemed beautiful to him there was some one else who was happy tooan old man who though he had been rich and noble all his life had not often been very honestly happy perhaps indeed i shall tell you that i think it was because he was rather better than he had been that he was rather happier he had not indeed suddenly become as good as fauntleroy thought him but at least he had begun to love something and he had several times found a sort of pleasure in doing the kind things which the innocent kind little heart of a child had suggestedand that was a beginning and every day he had been more pleased with his sons wife it was true as the people said that he was beginning to like her too he liked to hear her sweet voice and to see her sweet face and as he sat in his armchair he used to watch her and listen as she talked to her boy and he heard loving gentle words which were new to him and he began to see why the little fellow who had lived in a new york side street and known grocerymen and made friends with bootblacks was still so wellbred and manly a little fellow that he made no one ashamed of him even when fortune changed him into the heir to an english earldom living in an english castle it was really a very simple thing after allit was only that he had lived near a kind and gentle heart and had been taught to think kind thoughts always and to care for others it is a very little thing perhaps but it is the best thing of all he knew nothing of earls and castles he was quite ignorant of all grand and splendid things but he was always lovable because he was simple and loving to be so is like being born a king as the old earl of dorincourt looked at him that day moving about the park among the people talking to those he knew and making his ready little bow when any one greeted him entertaining his friends dick and mr hobbs or standing near his mother or miss herbert listening to their conversation the old nobleman was very well satisfied with him and he had never been better satisfied than he was when they went down to the biggest tent where the more important tenants of the dorincourt estate were sitting down to the grand collation of the day they were drinking toasts and after they had drunk the health of the earl with much more enthusiasm than his name had ever been greeted with before they proposed the health of little lord fauntleroy and if there had ever been any doubt at all as to whether his lordship was popular or not it would have been settled that instant such a clamor of voices and such a rattle of glasses and applause they had begun to like him so much those warmhearted people that they forgot to feel any restraint before the ladies and gentlemen from the castle who had come to see them they made quite a decent uproar and one or two motherly women looked tenderly at the little fellow where he stood with his mother on one side and the earl on the other and grew quite moist about the eyes and said to one another god bless him the pretty little dear little lord fauntleroy was delighted he stood and smiled and made bows and flushed rosy red with pleasure up to the roots of his bright hair is it because they like me dearest he said to his mother is it dearest im so glad and then the earl put his hand on the childs shoulder and said to him fauntleroy say to them that you thank them for their kindness fauntleroy gave a glance up at him and then at his mother must i he asked just a trifle shyly and she smiled and so did miss herbert and they both nodded and so he made a little step forward and everybody looked at himsuch a beautiful innocent little fellow he was too with his brave trustful faceand he spoke as loudly as he could his childish voice ringing out quite clear and strong im ever so much obliged to you he said andi hope youll enjoy my

an earl i am going to try to be as good as my grandfather and amid the shouts and clamor of applause he stepped back with a little sigh of relief and put his hand into the earls and stood close to him smiling and leaning against his side and that would be the very end of my story but i must add one curious piece of information which is that mr hobbs became so fascinated with high life and was so reluctant to leave his young friend that he actually sold his corner store in new york and settled in the english village of erlesboro where he opened a shop which was patronized by the castle and consequently was a great success and though he and the earl never became very intimate if you will believe me that man hobbs became in time more aristocratic than his lordship himself and he read the court news every morning and followed all the doings of the house of lords and about ten years after when dick who had finished his education and was going to visit his brother in california asked the good grocer if he did not wish to return to america he shook his head seriously not to live there he said not to live there i want to be near him an sort o look after him its a good enough country for

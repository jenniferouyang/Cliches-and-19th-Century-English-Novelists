by frances hodgson burnett all rights reserved illustration logo through one administration chapter i eight years before the administration rendered important by the series of events and incidents which form the present story there had come to washington on a farewell visit to a distant relative with whom he was rather a favorite a young officer who was on the point of leaving the civilized world for a faraway western military station the name of the young officer was philip tredennis his relative and entertainer was a certain wellknown entomologist whom it will be safe to call professor herrick at the smithsonian and in all scientific circles professor herricks name was a familiar one he was considered an enviable as well as an able man he had established himself in washington because he found men there whose tastes and pursuits were congenial with his own and because the softness of the climate suited him he was rich enough to be free from all anxiety and to enjoy the delightful liberty of pursuing his scientific labors because they were his pleasure and not because he was dependent upon their results he had a quiet and charming home an excellent matteroffact wife and one daughter who was being educated in a northern city and who was said to be as bright and attractive as one could wish a young creature to be of this daughter tredennis had known very little except that she enjoyed an existence and came home at long intervals for the holidays when it did not happen that she was sent to the sea or the mountains with her mother instead the professor himself seemed to know but little of her he was a quiet and intensely studious person taking small interest in the ordinary world and appearing always slightly surprised when his wife spoke to him still his manner toward her was as gentle and painstaking as if she had been the rarest possible beetle and the only one of her species to be found in any known collection though perhaps the interest she awakened in him was not so great as it might have been under such exceptionally favorable circumstances she was not a brilliant or farseeing woman and her opinions of entomology and indeed of science in general were vague and obscured by objections to small boxes glass cases long pins and chloroform and specimens of all orders so observing this tredennis felt it not at all unnatural that he should not hear much of his daughter from the professor why his relative liked him the young man was not at all sure though at times he had felt the only solution of the mystery to be that he liked him because his tendency was toward silence and books and research of all kinds he thought he was certain that the professor did like him he had invited him to visit him in washington and had taken him to the smithsonian and rambled from room to room with him bestowing upon him tomes of information in the simplest and most natural manner filled with the quietest interest himself and entirely prepared to find his feeling shared by his charge he had given into his hands the most treasured volumes in his library and had even seemed pleased to have him seated near him when he sat at work at all events it was an established fact that a friendly feeling existed between them and that if it had been his habit to refer to his daughter he would have spoken of her to tredennis but tredennis heard nothing of her until he had been some days in washington and then it was mrs herrick who spoke of her nathan she said one evening at dinner bertha will be home on tuesday the professor laid his spoon down as if he had rather unexpectedly discovered that he had had enough soup bertha he said indeed next tuesday well of course we must be ready for her do you want any money my dear but of course you will want money when she comes if she has finished school as i think you said she had i shall want money to pay her bills answered mrs herrick she will bring them with her her aunt has had her things made in new york yes said the professor i dare say they will be more satisfactory what kind of things for instance catherine dresses replied mrs herrick and things of that sort you know she is to come out this season to come out remarked the professor carefully giving the matter his undivided attention i hope she will enjoy it what sort of a ceremony is it and after a young person has come out does she ever go in and is there any particular pageant attached to such aa contingency when she comes out answered mrs herrick taking a purely practical view of the affair she begins to go to parties to balls and receptions and lunches which she does not do when she is going to schools it isnt considered proper and it wouldnt give her any time for her studies bertha hasnt been allowed to go out at all her aunt maria has been very particular about it and she will enjoy things all the more because they are quite new to her i dare say she will be very gay this winter washington is a very good place for a girl to come out in after dinner when they retired to the library together it occurred to tredennis that the professor was bestowing some thought upon his paternal position and his first observation proved that this was the case it is a most wonderful thing that a few brief years should make such changes he said it seems impossible that so short a time should change a small and exceedingly red infant into a young person returned from school in the most complete condition and ready to come out she was not interesting as an infant i tried to find her so but failed though it was insisted that she was an unusually intelligent baby and i have not seen much of her of late years when she was growing it was thought that the climate of washington was not good for her i am really a little curious about her my views of girls are extremely undefined i have always been a bookworm i have not known girls they have not come within my radius i remember one i once knew years ago but that is all it was when i was a younger man i think she was a year or so older than bertha she was very interestingas a study she used to bewilder me he walked over to the table and began to turn over some papers she had gray eyes he said in a rather lower voicegray eyes he was so quiet for some time that tredennis thought he had forgotten what he had been talking about but after a pause of at least three minutes he spoke again i would not be at all sorry he said if bertha was a little like her i suppose he addedreferring seriously to tredennisi suppose they are all more or less alike i thinkfaltered tredennis perhaps so he did not feel himself an authority the professor stood still a moment regarding the fire abstractly she had gray eyes he said againgray eyes and immediately afterward returned to his table seated himself and fell to work the next week bertha arrived and to her distant relative her arrival was a revelation she descended upon the quiet householdwith her trunks her delight in their contents her anticipation of her first season her fresh and rather surprised exultation in her own small powers and charms which were just revealing themselves to herlike a young whirlwind her mother awakened to a most maternal interest in the gayeties into which she was to be drawn the very servants were absorbed in the allpervading excitement which at length penetrated to the professors study itself and aroused him from his entomological reveries after she had been in the house a week he began to examine the girl through his spectacles with great care and deliberation and having cheerfully submitted to this inspection through several meals one day at dinner its object expressed herself with charming directness concerning it i do hope youll like me papa she said when you have classified me classified you said the professor in some bewilderment yes answered bertha you know i always feel as if you might turn me over gently with your finger at any moment and watch me carefully while i struggled until you knew all about me and then chloroform me and stick a pin through me with a label on it i shouldnt like the chloroform and the pin but i should take an interest in the label couldnt i have the label without the pin papa i dont know said the professor examining her more carefully than ever i am afraid not after that it became his custom to encourage her to reveal herself in conversation which it was very easy to do as she was a recklessly candid young person given to the most delightfully illogical partisanship an endless variety of romantic fancies and a vivid representation of all facts in which she felt interest it must be confessed that for the sake of hearing her talk the professor somewhat neglected for the time being both coleoptera and lepidoptera and drifting into the sittingroom upon many sunny mornings allowed himself to be surrounded by innocent frivolities in the way of personal adornments and it must also be added that he fell into the habit of talking of the girl to tredennis as they sat together by the study fire at night she is an attractive girl he said once seriously i find myself quite absorbed in her at times she is chaotic illogical unpracticaloftener than not she does not know anything of what she is talking about but her very absurdities have a kind of cleverness in them and witthere is wit in her nonsense though she is scarcely conscious of it i cannot help thinking of her future and what its needs will develop in her it all depends upon the needs you never know what will be developed but you know it depends upon the needs ihope there will be no painful needs said tredennis looking at the fire she is very happy i never saw any one so happy yes shes very happy admitted the professor at present she is not much more than a joyous perfectly healthy young animal she sings and laughs because she cant help it and she adorns herself from instinct shell be different in a year or two shell be less happy but more interesting more interesting said tredennis in a low voice yes more interesting answered the professor looking at the fire himself with an air of abstractedly following a train of thought she will have made discoveries about herself it is a pity she cant make them without being less happybut then none of us are happy he paused rubbed his forehead a second and then turned suddenly on tredennis are you happy he demanded tredennis started and hesitated yyesnno he answered unsteadily he would have said yes unreservedly a short time ago but within the last few days he had been less sure of himself and now being confronted with the question unexpectedly he found that he must answer with a reservationthough he could not at all have given a reason for the feeling that he must do so perhaps it is not my way to look at life brightly he added it is her way said the professor she believes in everything in a persistent childish fashion that is touching to older persons like myself if you contest her points of belief with her she is simply obstinate you cant move her why should any one try said tredennis warmly there is no need to try responded the professor she will find out for herself why should she said tredennis warmer still i hope she wont the professor took off his spectacles and began to polish them carefully with a corner of his large white handkerchief she is going to be a clever woman he said for her sake i am sorry to see it she is going to be the kind of clever woman who has nine chances out of ten of being a desperate pain to herself while she is a pleasure to her friends she hasnt the nature to find safety in cleverness she has a conscience and emotions and they will go against her against her cried tredennis she will make mistakes and suffer for theminstead of letting others suffer she wont be a saint but she might be a martyr it always struck me that it took faults and follies to make a martyr he bent forward and poked the fire as carefully as he had rubbed his spectacles then he turned to tredennis againslowly this time instead of suddenly you resent it all i suppose he said of course you do it makes you angry ive no doubt it would have made me angry i dare say at your age to hear an elderly scientist dissect a pretty young creature and take the bloom off her life for her its natural i dont like to think of her asas being anything but happyandand good said tredennis with some secret resentment shell not be bad said the professor critically it isnt in her she might be happy perhapsif one thing happened to her what one thing asked tredennis if she married a fine fellow whom she was deeply and passionately in love withwhich happens to very few women in the shadow of his corner tredennis felt the hot blood mount steadily to his forehead and was glad of the dim light for the professor was still regarding him fixedly though as if in abstraction she will belikely to marry the man she loves sir he said in a voice neither clear nor steady yes said the professor unless she makes the mistake of merely marrying the man who loves her she will meet him often enough and if he chances some day to be a fascinating fellow her fate will be sealed that goes along with the rest of her strengths and weaknesses and he gave the fire a vigorous poke which cast a glow of light upon them both then leaving his chair he stood for a moment polishing his glassesstaring absently at tredennis before he put them onand wandered back to his table and his specimens tredennis own acquaintance with his young relative was not a very intimate one too many interests presented themselves on every side to allow of her devoting herself specially to any one and her fathers favorite scarcely took the form of an interest she had not the leisure to discover that he was fully worth the discovering she regarded him simply as a large and rather serious young man who without seeming stupid listened rather than talked and yet was not actually a brilliant listener since he only listened with an air of observing quietly and keeping the result of his observations to himself i dare say it will suit him to be out among the indians she said to her mother upon one occasion and i should think it would suit the indians he wont find them frivolous and given up to vanity i believe he thinks i am frivolous it struck me that he did the other day when i was talking about that new dress being made do you think i talk about my clothes too much mamma well at all events with much frankness i dont talk about them half as much as i think about them i am always thinking about them just now it seems as if i should die if they werent becoming after they were made but dont you suppose its natural mamma and that i shall get over it in time she was brushing out her hair before the glass and turned round brush in hand with an expression of rather alarmed interest and repeated the question dont you think i shall get over it she said it seems just now as if everything had begun all at once and anything might happen and i had rather lost my breath a little in the rush of it and i do so want to have a good time and i care about everything connected with itclothes and people and parties and everythingbut i dont want to be any more frivolous than i need bei mean i dont want to be a stupid she gave the pretty redbrown mane embowering her a little shake back and fixed her large clear eyes on her mothers i suppose all girls are frivolous just at first she said dont you i dont call it frivolous said her mother who was a simple excellent creature not troubled with intellectual pangs and who while she admired her frequently found her daughter as far beyond her mild limited comprehension as her husband was and she was not at all disposed to complain thereat either the one fact she was best able to grasp at this moment was that the girl looked her best and that the circumstance might be utilized as a hint for the future that way of wearing your hair is very becoming to you bertha she said i wish there was some way of managing it so as to get the same effect but i cant wear it down after im out said bertha reflectively ive got beyond thatas i suppose i shall get beyond the frivolity and she turned to the glass and looked at herself quite simply and with a soft little air of seriousness which was very bewitching she regarded herself in this manner for several seconds and then began slowly to dress her hair plaiting it into soft thick plaits which she fastened closely and simply at the nape of her pretty neck i believe ill try not to be quite so frivolous she said perhaps she was making an effort at the accomplishment of this desirable end when she came down to dinner an hour or so later tredennis thought he had never seen her so lovely he was standing alone in the firelight looking doubtfully at something he held in his hand and she entered so quietly that he started on becoming conscious of her presence she wore a dress he had not seen beforea pale gray soft in material and very simply made with a little lace kerchief knotted at her throat she came forward and laid her hand on the back of a chair papa has not come in she began then stopped suddenly with a quick graceful little turn of her head oh where is the heliotrope she exclaimed for the room was full of the subtle fragrance of it he made a rather headlong step forward it is here he said i have been out and i saw a lot of it in a florists window i dont know whether its a flower to wearand that sort of thingbut i always liked the odor of it so i brought this home and he held it out to her she took it and buried her face in it delightedly it was a sumptuous handful and had been cut with unsparing lavishness he had in fact stood by and seen it done ah i like it so she cried i do like itits lovely then she lifted her face hesitating a second as a new thought occurred to her she looked up at him with pretty uncertainty the color rising in her cheeks simply because she was uncertain theyi dont knowshe said you didntthey are not for for you tredennis ended for her hurriedly yes i dont know why but i thought of you when i saw them its an idea i suppose they are for you if youll have them ah she said it was so kind of you im so glad to have them i have always liked them she almost hid her bright face in them again while he stood and watched her wondering why he felt suddenly tremulous and unreasonably happy at last she looked up at him again i wish this was my comingout night she said i would wear these you have given me my first bouquet i am glad of that if i am here on the night of your first party he answered i will give you another if you will let me if you are here she said are you going away and there was an innocent unconsciously expressed touch of disappointment in her tone which was a sharp pleasure to him though he was in too chaotic a mental condition to call it either pleasure or pain i may be ordered away at any moment he said he could never exactly remember afterward how it came about that in a few moments more he was sitting in the professors armchair and she had taken a seat on a hassock near him with some of his heliotrope in the knot of her hair some fastened against her pale gray dress and some loosely clasped in the hand which rested on her lap he did not know how it happened but she was there and the scent of the heliotrope floated about her in the warmth of the fire and she was talking in the bright fanciful way which entertained the professor and he knew that this brief moment he came for the first time within the charmed circle of her girlish life and pleasures and though he was conscious that his nearness moved her no more than the professors would have done he was content there was a softness in her manner which was new to him and which had the effect of giving him courage it was a result partly of the pleasure he had given her and partly of the good resolution she had made of which he knew nothing he only saw the result and enjoyed it she even showed a pretty interest in his future she is what the italians call simpatica had been one of her fathers observations concerning her and tredennis thought of it as he listened and watched her it was her gift to say well all she had to say her simplest speech produced its little effect because all her heart was with her hearer just now she thought only of tredennis and that she wished to show her interest in him so she sat with her flowers upon her knee and talked and it was an enchanted hour for tredennis who felt like a creature slowly awakening to the light of day i suppose we may not see you again for several years she said i do not like to think of that and i am sure papa wont butand she turned smiling into his eyes her chin resting in the hollow of her palm her elbow on her kneewhen we do see you of course you will be a most distinguished person entirely covered with stars and ribbons andscalps and you he said i wonder what will have happened to you oh a great many things of course she answered but only the unimportant things that happen to all girlsthough they will be important enough to me i dare say i shall have had a lovely time and have been very happy and she turned her little smile upon the fire and brooded for a few secondsstill in her pretty attitude it was such a pretty attitude and her look was so sweet that both together wrought upon tredennis strongly and he felt himself awakening a little more i wish he said breaking the brief silence in a low voicei wish that i could insure thehappiness for you she turned with a slight start and some vague trouble in her face oh she said dont you think i shall be sure to be happy there seems to be no reason why i should not oh i hope i shall be happy ii dont know what i should do if i wasnt happy i cant imagine it everybody is not happy he said his voice almost tremulous but she faltered but ii have always been happyshe stopped her eyes appealing to him piteously i suppose after all that is a poor reason she added but it almost seems like one i wish it were one he said dont look like that itit hurts me if any sacrifice of mineany suffering she stirred a little moved in some vague way by the intensity of his tone and as she did so the odor of the heliotrope floated toward him berthahe said bertha he did not know what he would have saidand the words were never spokenfor at that moment the enchanted hour was ended it was the professor himself who broke in upon itthe professor who opened the door and entered hungry and absentminded the firelight striking upon his spectacles and seeming to enlarge them tremendously as he turned his head from side to side inhaling the air of the room with evident delight flowers eh he said what kind of flowers the air seems full of them bertha rose and went to him tredennis watching her girlish palegray figure as it moved across the room with a pained and bewildered sense of having lost something which he might never regain they are heliotropes she said philip brought them to me it is my first bouquet so i shall keep it until i am an old woman a week later tredennis left washington it so chanced that he took his departure on the night rendered eventful by the first party in the excitement attendant upon the preparations for this festivity and for his own journey he saw even less of bertha than usual when she appeared at the table she was in such bright high spirits that the professor found herfor some private reason of his ownmore absorbing than ever his spectacles followed her with an air of deep interest he professed an untrained anxiety concerning the dress she was to wear appearing to regard it as a scientific object worthy of attention shes very happy he would say to tredennis again and again shes very happy and having said it he invariably rubbed his forehead abstractedly and pushed his spectacles a trifle awry without appearing conscious of it when the carriage tredennis had ordered came to the door at ten oclock the coup which was to convey bertha to the scene of her first triumphs had just driven up a few seconds later bertha turned from her mirror and took up her bouquet of white rosebuds and heliotrope as a servant knocked at the door the carriage is here miss he said and mr tredennis is going away and says would you come and let him say goodby in a few seconds more tredennis who was standing in the hall looked up from the carpet and saw her coming down the staircase with a little run her white dress a cloud about her her eyes shining like stars the rose and heliotrope bouquet he had sent her in her hand thank you for it she said as soon as she reached him i shall keep this too and see what i have done and she pushed a leaf aside and showed him a faded sprig of heliotrope hidden among the fresh flowers i thought i would like to have a little piece of it among the rest she said and she gave him her hand with a smile both soft and bright and you really kept it he said oh yes she answered simply you know i am going to keep it as long as i live i wish we could keep you i wish you were going with us i am going in a different direction he said andsuddenly i have not a minute to spare goodby a little shadow fell on the brightness of her face i wish there was no such word as goodby she said there was a silence of a few seconds in which her hand lay in his and their eyes rested on each other then mrs herrick and the professor appeared i believe said tredennis if you are going now i will let you set out on your journey first i should like to seethe last of you but it isnt the last of me said bertha it is the first of methe very first and my heart is beating quite fast and she put her hand to the side of her slender white bodice laughing a gay sweet laugh with a thrill of excitement in it and then they went out to the carriage and when mrs herrick had been assisted in bertha stood for a moment on the pavementa bright pure white figure her flowers in her hand the hall light shining upon her papa she called to the professor who stood on the threshold i never asked you if you liked itthe dress you know yes child said the professor yes child i likei like it and his voice shook a little and he said nothing more and then bertha got into the carriage and it drove away into the darkness and almost immediately after tredennis found himself in his carriage which drove away into the darkness tooonly as he laid his head against the cushions and closed his eyes he saw just as he had seen a moment before a bright pure white figure standing upon the pavement the night behind it the great bouquet of white roses in its hand and the light from the house streaming upon the radiant girls face chapter ii the eight years that followed were full of events for tredennis after the first two his name began to be well known in military circles as that of a man bold cool and remarkable for a just clearsightedness which set him somewhat apart from most men of his class and age stationed as he was in the midst of a hostile indian country full of perilous adventure a twofold career opened itself before him his nerve courage and physical endurance rendered him invaluable in time of danger while his tendency to constant study of the problems surrounding him gave him in time of peace the distinction of being a thinking man whose logically deduced and clearly stated opinions were continually of use to those whose positions were more responsible than his own he never fell into the ordinary idle routine of a frontier camp life in his plain soldierly quarters he worked hard lived simply and read much during the first year he was rather desolate and unhappy the weeks he had spent with the herricks had been by no means the best preparation for his frontier experience since they had revealed to him the possibilities of existence such as he had given no thought to before his youth had been rather rigorous and lonely and his misfortune of reserve had prevented his forming any intimate friendships his boyhood had been spent at boardingschool his early manhood at west point and after that his life had settled itself into the usual wandering homeless groove which must be the lot of an unmarried military man the warm atmosphere of a longestablished home its agreeably unobtrusive routine which made the changes of morning noon and night all something pleasant to anticipate the presence of the women who could not be separated in ones mind from the household itselfall these things were a sort of revelation to him he had enjoyed them and would have felt some slight sadness in leaving them even if he had not left something else also it was a mere shadow he had left but it was a shadow whose memory haunted him through many a long and lonely hour and was all the more a trouble through its very vagueness he was not the man likely to become the victim of a hopeless passion in three weeks his was a nature to awaken slowly but to awaken to such strength of feeling and to such power to suffer at last as would leave no alternative between happiness and stolidly borne despair if fate decreed that the despair and not the happiness was to be his portion it would be borne silently and with stern patience but it would be despair nevertheless as it was he had been gradually aroused to a vague tenderness of feeling for the brightness and sweetness which had been before him day after day sometimes during this first year of his loneliness he wondered why he had not gone farther and reached the point of giving some expression to what he had felt but he never did so without being convinced by his after reflections that such an effort would only have told against him it wasnt the time he said aloud to himself as he sat in his lonely room one night it wasnt the time he had been thinking of how she looked as she came to him that night in her simple palegray dress with the little lace kerchief tied round her throat that and his memory of the bright figure at the carriagedoor were pictures which had a habit of starting up before him now and again though chiefly at such times as he was alone and rather feeling his isolation he remembered his own feeling at her girlish pleasure in his gift the tone of her voice her attitude as she sat afterward on the low seat near him her chin resting in her hollowed palm her smiling eyes uplifted to his her pretty unstudied attitudes had often struck him and this one lingered in his fancy as somehow belonging naturally to a mans dreams of a fireside if the room and fireside were your own he said abstractedly youd like he stopped and rising to his feet suddenly began to pace the room but it wasnt the time he said she would not have understoodi scarcely understood myselfand if we should ever meet again in all probability the time will have gone by after such thoughts he always betook himself to his books again with quite a fierce vigor and in the rebound accomplished a great deal he gave a great deal of studious attention to the indian question and in his determination to achieve practical knowledge undertook more than one dangerous adventure with those among the tribes whom it was possible to approach openly he made friends studying their languages and establishing a reputation among them for honor and good faith which was a useful element in matters of negotiation and treaty so it came about that his name was frequently mentioned in the department and drifted into the newspapers his opinions being quoted as opinions carrying weight and in an indirect way the herricks heard of him oftener than he heard of them since there had been no regular exchange of letters between them the professor being the poorest of correspondents occasionally when he fell upon a newspaper paragraph commenting upon tredennis work and explaining some of his theories he was roused to writing him a letter of approval or argument and at the close of such epistles he usually mentioned his daughter in a fashion peculiarly his own bertha is happier than ever he said the first winter bertha is well and is said to dance in the most astonishingly attractive manner an astonishing number of times every evening this i gather not only from her mother but from certain elaborately ornamented cards they call programmes which i sometimes find and study in privatethis came the second winter the third he said it dawns upon bertha that she is certainly cleverer than the majority of her acquaintance this at once charms and surprises her she is careful not to obtrude the fact upon public notice but it has been observed and i find she has quite a little reputation in society as an unusually bright and ready young creature with a habit of being delightfully equal to any occasion i gradually discover her to be full of subtleties of which she is entirely unconscious tredennis read this a number of times and found food for reflection in it he thought it over frequently during the winter and out of his pondering upon it grew a plan which began to unfold itself in his mind rather vaguely at first but afterward more definitely this plan was his intention to obtain leave of absence and having obtained it to make his way at once to washington he had thought at first of applying for it in the spring but fate was against him difficulties which broke out between the settlers and certain hostile tribes called him into active service and it was not until the severities of the next winter aided in quelling the disturbance by driving the indians into shelter that he found himself free again it was late on new years eve that he went to his quarters to write his application for furlough he had been hard at work all day and came in cold and tired and pleased to find the room made cheerful by a great fire of logs whose leaping flames brightened and warmed every corner the mail had come in during his absence and two or three letters lay upon the table with the eastern papers but he pushed them aside without opening them i will look at them afterward he said this shall be done firstbefore the clock strikes twelve when the new year comes in he paused pen in hand accidentally catching a glimpse of his face in the by no means flattering shavingglass which hung on the wall opposite he saw himself brown with exposure bearing marks of thought and responsibility his age did not warrant and wearing even at this moment the rather stern and rigid expression which he had always felt vaguely to be his misfortune recognizing it his face relaxed into a halfsmile what a severelooking fellow he said that must be improved upon no one could stand that it is against a man at the outset and the smile remained upon his face for at least ten secondsat all events until he had drawn his paper before him and begun to write his task was soon completed the letter written he folded it placed it in its envelope and directed it looking as immovable as ever and yet conscious of being inwardly more moved than he had ever been before perhaps he said halfaloud this is the time and it is well i waited and then he turned to the letters and papers awaiting him the papers he merely glanced over and laid aside the letters he opened and read there were four of them three of them business epistles soon disposed of the sight of the handwriting upon the fourth made his heart bound suddenlyit was the clear spacesaving calligraphy of professor herrick who labelled his envelopes as economically as if they had been entomological specimens its curious that it should have come now tredennis said as he tore it open it was a characteristic letter written it appeared with the object of convincing tredennis that he had been guilty of a slight error in one of his statements concerning the signlanguage of a certain tribe it devoted five pages of closelywritten paper to proofs and researches into the subject and scientific reasons for the truth of all assertions made it was clear and by no means uninteresting the professor never was uninteresting and he was generally correct tredennis read his arguments carefully and with respect even with an occasional thrill as he remembered how his communications usually terminated but this was an exception to the general rule at the bottom of the fifth page he signed himself your sincere friend nathan herrick and he had said nothing about bertha not a word said tredennis he never did so before what does it mean not a word and he had scarcely finished speaking before he saw that on the back of the last page a postscript was writtena brief one three words without comment these bertha is married for a few moments tredennis sat still and stared at them the glass across the room reflected very little change in his face the immovable look became a trifle more immovable if anything there was scarcely the stirring of a muscle at length he moved slowly folding the letter carefully and returning it to its envelope in exactly the folds it had lain in when he took it out after that he rose and began to pace the floor with a slow and heavy tread once he stopped and spoke looking down at the boards beneath his feet bertha is married he said in a low hard voice and the clock beginning to strike at the moment he listened until it ended its stroke of twelve and then spoke again the new year he said and bertha is married and he walked to the table where his letter of application lay and taking it up tore it in two and tossed it into the fire four years elapsed before he saw washington and in the four years he worked harder than before added to his reputation year by year and led the unsettled and wandering existence which his profession entailed at rare intervals he heard from the professor and once or twice in the course of his wanderings he met with washingtonians who knew the family and gave him news of them he heard of the death of mrs herrick and something of berthas life from the professor and on one occasion while in chicago he encountered at the house of an acquaintance a pretty and charming woman who had lived in washington before her marriage and in the course of conversation the fact that she had known the herricks revealed itself she appeared not only to have known but to have liked them and really brightened and warmed when they were mentioned i was very fond of bertha she said and we knew each other as well as girls can know each other in the rush of a washington winter i was one of her bridesmaids when she was married did you know her well and she regarded him with an additional touch of interest in her very lovely eyes not very well tredennis answered we are distantly related to each other and i spent several weeks in her fathers house just after her return from school but i did not know her so well as i knew the professor and you did not meet mr amory there was no mr amory then was tredenniss reply of course not said mrs sylvestre i might have known that if i had thought for a moment he only appeared upon the scene the winter before they were married she met him at a ball at the mexican ministers and his fate was sealed tredennis was silent a moment then he asked a question did you know him well he said she reflected an instant and then replied smiling he was too much in love for ones acquaintance with him to progress to any great extent his condition was something like david copperfields when he said that he was saturated with dora he was saturated with bertha they must be very happy remarked tredennis and he did not know that he spoke in a hard and unresponsive tone and that his face was more stern than was at all necessary naturally responded mrs sylvestre calmly they have money their children are charming and their social position is unassailable bertha is very clever and mr amory admires her and is very indulgent but he could scarcely help that she is that kind of person she repeated tredennis mrs sylvestre smiled again bertha she replied people are always indulgent with her she is one of those fortunate persons who are born without any tendency to demand and who consequently have everything given to them without the trouble of having a struggle she has a pretty soft sort of way and people stand aside before it before i knew her well i used to think it was simply cleverness wasnt it said tredennis not quite it escapes that by being constitutional amiability and grace but if it wasnt constitutional amiability and grace it would be cleverness and you would resent it as it is you like her for it she is pretty and charming and has her little world at her feet and yet her manner is such that you find yourself wondering if she even suspects it does she asked tredennis mrs sylvestre turned her attention to the other side of the room there is mr sylvestre she said serenely he is coming to us you must know each other and then mr sylvestre sauntered up he was a very handsome man with a rather languid air which remotely suggested that if he took off his manners and folded them away he would reveal the unadorned fact that he was bored but even he bestirred himself a little when tredennis relationship to the herricks was mentioned what he said you are mrs amorys cousin only third or fourth responded tredennis by jove youre in luck his new acquaintance returned third or fourth is near enough i wouldnt object to sixth myself do you see her often i have not seen her for seven years mr sylvestre bestowed a critical glance upon him whats the matter with you he inquired languidly theres something radically wrong about a man who neglects his opportunities in that way he paused and smiled showing his white teeth through his mustache oh shes a clever little devhe pulled himself up with remarkable adroitness shes very clever he said shes delightfully clever she must be commented tredennis unenthusiastically i never hear her mentioned without its being added that she is very clever you would be likely to find the thing out for yourself when you met hereven if you hadnt heard it said mr sylvestre when tredennis returned to his room that night he sat down to read deliberately choosing a complicated work which demanded the undivided attention of the peruser he sat before it for half an hour with bent brow and unyielding demeanor but at the end of that time he pushed it aside left his seat and began to pace the floor and so walked with a gloomy face until it was long past midnight when he put out the light and went to bed chapter iii two years later he found himself one evening in march driving along pennsylvania avenue in a musty hack which might have been the very one which had borne him to the depot the night he had seen the last of bertha and her white roses but the streets were gayer now than they had been then he had arrived only a day or so after the occurrence of an event of no less national importance than the inauguration of a newly elected president and there still remained traces of the festivities attendant upon this ceremony in the shape of unremoved decorations fluttering from windows draping doors and swaying in lines across the streets groups of people wearing a rather fatigued air of having remained after the feast for the purpose of more extended sightseeing gave the sidewalks a wellfilled look and here and there among them was to be seen a belated uniform which had figured effectively in the procession to the capitol two days before having taken note of these things tredennis leaned back upon his musty cushions with a half sigh of weariness i come in with the administration he said i wonder if i shall go out with it and what will have happened in the interval he was thinking of his past and what it had paid him he had set out in his early manhood with the fixed intention of making for himself a place in the world in which he might feel a reasonable amount of pride he had attained every object he had aimed at with the knowledge that he had given for every such object its due value in labor persistent effort and steadiness of purpose no man of his age stood higher in his profession than he didvery few as high he had earned distinction honor and not a little applause he had found himself a lion on more than one occasion and though he had not particularly enjoyed the experience had not undervalued it as an experience the world had used him well and if he had been given to forming intimacies he might have had many friends his natural tendency to silence and reserve had worked against him in this but as it was he had no enemies and many wellwishers it was not his habit to bemoan even in secret his rather isolated life there were times when he told himself that no other would suit him so well but there were also times when he recognized that it was isolated and the recognition was one which at such moments he roused all the force of his nature to shut out of his mind as soon as possible he had perhaps never fully known the influence his one vague dream had had upon his life when it ended he made a steady effort to adjust himself to the new condition of existing without it and had learned much of the strength of its power over him by the strength of the endeavor it had cost him his inward thought was that if there had been a little more to remember the memory might have been less sad as it was the forgetting was a slow vague pain which he felt indefinitely long after he thought that it had died away he put the old drifting fancies out of his mind and having no leaning toward selfindulgence believed at last that they were done with because they returned but seldom but he never heard of bertha either through the professor or through others without being conscious for days afterward of an unrest he called by no name he rested under the influence of this feeling as he was driven through the lighted streets toward his hotel and his recollection of his last drive through these same streets made it stronger eight years he said she has been to many parties since then let us hope she has enjoyed them all he made his first visit to the professor the same evening after he had established himself in his room and dined the professor was always at home in the evening and irregular as their correspondence had been tredennis felt that he was sure of a welcome from him he was not mistaken in this he found his welcome the professor was seated in his dressinggown before his studytable as if he had not stirred during the eight years he had even the appearance of being upon the point of empaling the same corpulent beetle upon the same attenuated pin and of engaging in the occupation with the same scientific interest tredennis remembered so well on hearing his visitors name announced he started slightly laid his beetle aside with care and rising from his seat came forward with warm pleasure in his face what he exclaimed whatyou tredennis well well im very glad my dear fellow im very glad he shook his hand affectionately at the same time holding him by the shoulder as if to make more sure of him i am very glad myself said tredennis it is a great pleasure to see you again and it took you eight years to get round to us said the professor looking at him thoughtfully and turning him round a trifle more to the light eight years thats a slice out of a mans life too but you are no older professor said tredennis i am older but not you the professor nodded acquiescence yes yes i know all about that he said youre an old fellow now i was an old fellow myself forty years ago there sit down and tell me all about it that is the chair you sat in when you were here last you sat in it the nightthe night we talked about bertha chapter iv how is bertha tredennis asked the professor sat down in his chair and took up the poker quite carefully she is at a party tonight he said poking the fire though it is late in the season for parties she generally is at a partyoftener than not she is at two or three parties then she must be well suggested tredennis oh she is well the professor answered and she gets a good deal out of life she will always get a good deal out of itin one way or another that is a good thing remarked tredennis very responded the professor if its all in the one way and not in the other he changed the subject almost immediately and began to discuss tredennis own affairs his kindly interest in his career touched the younger mans heart it seemed that he had taken an interest in him from the first and silent as he had been had never lost sight of him it used to strike me that you would be likely to make something of your life he said in his quiet halfabstracted way you looked like it i used to say to myself that if you were my son i should look forward to being proud of you ii wish you had been my son my boy if i had been answered tredennis earnestly i should have felt it a reason for aiming high the professor smiled faintly well he said you aimed high without that incentive and the best of it is that you have not failed you are a strong fellow i likeastrongfellow he added slowly he spoke of bertha occasionally again in the course of their after conversation but not as it had been his habit to speak of her in her girlhood his references to her were mostly statements of facts connected with her children her mode of life or her household she lived near him her home was an attractive one and her children were handsome healthy and bright amory is a bright fellow and a handsome fellow he said he is not very robust but he is an attractive creaturesensitive poetic temperament fanciful he is fanciful about bertha and given to admiring her when he went away at the end of the evening tredennis carried with him the old vague sense of discomfort the professor had been interesting and conversational and had given him the warmest of welcomes but he had missed something from their talk which he had expected to find he was not aware of how he had counted upon it until he missed it and the sense of loss which he experienced was a trouble to him he had certainly not been conscious of holding bertha foremost in his mind when he had turned his steps toward her fathers house he had thought of how his old friend would look of what he would say and had wondered if he should find him changed he had not asked himself if he should see bertha or hear of her and yet what he had missed in her fathers friendly talk had been the old kindly interested discussion of her and once out in the night air and the deserted streets he knew that he was sadder for his visit than he had fancied he should be the bright happy girlish figure seemed to have passed out of the professors life alsoout of the home it had adornedeven out of the world itself his nights sleep was not a very peaceful one but the next morning when he rose the light of day and the stir of life around him seemed to have dispelled the reality of his last nights fancies his mind had resolved itself into a condition with which he was familiar and he was aroused to interest and pleasure in his surroundings his memory was once more the ghost of a memory which he had long accustomed himself to living without during the morning his time was fully occupied by his preparations for his new duties but in the afternoon he was at liberty and remembering a message he was commissioned to deliver to the sister of a brother officer he found his way to the ladys house it was a house in a fashionable street and its mistress was a fashionable little person who appeared delighted to see him and to treat him with great cordiality i am so glad you were so good as to call today she said mr gardner heard that you had arrived but did not know where you were or he would have seen you this morning what a pity that you were not in time for the inauguration the ball was more than usually successful i do hope you will let us see you tonight tonight repeated tredennis yes we want you so much she continued we give a little partyonly a little oneand we shall be so glad there will be several people here who will be delighted to meet youthe gentleman who is spoken of as likely to be the new secretary of the interior for instance he will be charmed mr gardner has told me what interesting things you have been doing and what adventures you have had i shall feel quite sure that my party will be a success if you will consent to be my lion i am afraid my consenting wouldnt establish the fact said tredennis you would want a mane and a roar and claws but you are very kind to ask me to your party the end of the matter was that after some exchange of civilities he gave a halfpromise to appear mentally reserving the privilege of sending regrets if he did not feel equal to the effort when night arrived he was not fond of parties and so having delivered the message with which he had been commissioned he made his adieus and retired when night came he was rather surprised to find lurking in his mind some slight inclination to abide by his promise accordingly after having taken a deliberate late dinner read the papers and written a letter or so he dressed himself and issued forth on arriving at his destination he found the little party a large one the street was crowded with carriages the house was brilliantly lighted an awning extended from the door to the edge of the pavement and each carriage depositing its brilliant burden within the protection of the striped tunnel drove rapidly away to give place to another obeying the injunctions of the servant at the door tredennis mounted to the second story and divested himself of his overcoat with the assistance of a smart mulatto who took it in charge the room in which he found himself was rather inconveniently crowded with menyoung middleaged elderly some of them wearing a depressed air of wishing themselves at home some bearing themselves stolidly and others either quietly resigned or appearing to enjoy themselves greatly it was not always the younger ones who formed this last class tredennis observed in one corner a brisk gentleman with wellbrushed gray beard laughed delightedly over a story just related to him with much sprightliness by a companion a decade older than himself while near them an unsmiling youth of twenty regarded their ecstasies without the movement of a muscle tredennis attention was attracted for a moment toward two men who stood near him evidently awaiting the appearance of some one at the door of the ladies cloakroom which they could see from where they stood one of them leaned in a nicely managed laborsaving attitude against the doorpost he was a rather tall blonde young man with a face eminently calculated to express either a great deal or absolutely nothing at all as he chose to permit it and his unobtrusive evening dress had an air of very agreeable fitness and neatness and quite distinguished itself by seeming to belong to him it was his laugh which called tredennis attention to him he laughed in response to some remark of his companionsa noncommittal but naturally sounding baritone laugh which was not without its attractiveness yes i was there he said and sang no thank you and she was there of course she repeated his friend his countenance at this moment expressing nothing whatever and doing it very well oh mrs amory responded the other who was young enough and in sufficiently high spirits to be led into forgetting to combine good taste with his hilarity you might say mrs amoryif you dont object replied his companion quietly it would be more civil then tredennis passed out and heard no more he made his way down the stairs which were crowded with guests going down and coming up and presented himself at the door of the first of the double parlors where he saw his hostess standing with her husband here he was received with the greatest warmth mrs gardner brightening visibly when she caught sight of him now she said this is really good of you i was almost afraid to let you go away this afternoon mr gardner colonel tredennis is really here she added with frank cordiality after that tredennis found himself swallowed as in a maelstrom he was introduced right and left hearing a name here and seeing a face there and always conscious of attaching the wrong names to the faces as he struggled to retain some impression of both in his memory mrs gardner bore him onward filled with the most amiable and hospitable delight in the sensation he awakened as she led him toward the prominent official in prospective before referred to who leaned against a mantelpiece and beguiled his time by making himself quite agreeable to a very pretty young dbutante who was recounting her experience at the inaugural ball here tredennis was allowed to free himself from the maelstrom and let it whirl past him as he stood a little aside and conversed with his new acquaintance who showed deep interest in and much appreciation of all he had to say and evidently would have been glad to prolong the interview beyond the moment when some polite exigency called him away in the midst of an animated discussion of the rights of indian agents and settlers when he had gone tredennis still remained standing where he had left him enjoying his temporary seclusion and the opportunity of looking on with the cool speculation of an outsider he had been looking on thus for some momentsat the passing to and fro at the wellbred elbowing through the crush at the groups gathering themselves here and there to exchange greetings and then breaking apart and drifting awaywhen he suddenly became aware of a faint fragrance in the atmosphere about him which impressed itself upon him with a curious insistence on his first vague recognition of its presence he could not have told what it was or why it roused in him something nearer pain than pleasure it awakened in him a queer sense of impatience with the glare of light the confusion of movement and voices and the gay measure of the music in the next room and almost the instant he felt this impatience a flash of recognition broke upon him and he knew what the perfume was and that it seemed out of place in the glare and confusion simply because his one distinct memory of it associated itself only with the night when he had sat in the firelight with bertha and she had held the heliotrope in her hand with this memory in his mind and with a half smile at his own momentary resentment of the conditions surrounding him he turned toward the spot near from which he fancied the odor of the flowers came thinking that it had floated from some floral decoration of the deep window and so turning he sawsurrounded by what seemed to be the gayest group in the roombertha herself she was exquisitely dressed and stood in the prettiest possible pose supporting herself lightly against the side of the window she had a bouquet in her hand and a brilliant smile on her lips and tredennis knew in an instant that she had seen and recognized him she did not move she simply retained her pretty pose smiling and waiting for him to come to her and though she said nothing to her companions something in her smile evidently revealed the situation to them for almost immediately the circle divided itself and room was made for him to advance within it often afterward tredennis tried to remember how he moved toward her and what he said when he found himself quite near her holding the gloved hand she gave him so lightly but his recollections were always of the vaguest there scarcely seemed to have been any first wordshe was at her side she gave him her hand and then in the most natural manner the group about her seemed to melt away and they were left together and he glancing half unconsciously down at her bouquet saw that it was made of heliotrope and marchal niel roses she was so greatly and yet so little changed that he felt as he looked at her like a man in a dream he tried to analyze the change and could not and the effort to do so was a pain to him the color in her cheeks was less bright than he remembered it but her eyes were brighter he thought also that they looked larger and soon recognized that this was not only because her face was less girlishly full but arose from a certain alertness of expression which had established itself in them and yet despite their clear brightness when she lifted them to his own his sense of loss was for the instant terrible her slight rounded figure was even prettier than evermore erect better borne and with a delicate consciousness and utilizing of its own gracesbut it was less easy to connect it mentally with the little gray gown and lace kerchief than he could ever have believed possible her very smile and voice had changed the smile was sometimes a very brilliant one and sometimes soft and slow as if a hidden meaning lay behind it the voice was lowpitched charmingly modulated and expressed far more than the words it gave to a listener but tredennis knew that he must learn to know them both and that to do so would take time and effort he never felt this so strongly as when she sat down on the cushioned windowseat and made a little gesture toward the place at her side sit down she said with the soft smile this timea smile at once sweet and careless sit down and tell me if you are glad to be stationed in washington and let me tell you that papa is delighted at the prospect of your being near him again thank you answered tredennis and as to the being here i think i like the idea of the change well enough you will find it a great change i dare say she went on though of course you have not devoted yourself to the indians entirely during your absence but washington is unlike any other american city i think it is unlike any other city in the universe it is an absorbingly interesting place when you get used to it you are fortunate in finding it so said tredennis i she said lightly oh i do not think i could resign myself to living anywhere else though when you reflect of course you know that is a national quality all good americans adore the city they confer distinction on by living in and asperse the characters of all other places englishmen believe in london and frenchmen in paris but in america a new yorker vaunts himself upon new york a bostonian glories in boston and a washingtonian delights in the capital of his country and so on until you reach new orleans that is true enough said tredennis though i had not thought of it before oh it is true she answered with an airy laugh then she added with a change of tone you have been away for a long time eight years he replied he thought she gave a slight start but immediately she turned upon him with one of the brilliant smiles we have had time to grow since then she saidnot older of course but infinitely wiserand better he did not find it easy to comprehend very clearly either her smile or her manner he felt that there might be something hidden behind both though certainly nothing could have been brighter or more inconsequent than her tone he did not smile but regarded her for a moment with a look of steady interest of which he was scarcely conscious she bore it for an instant and then turned her eyes carelessly aside with a laugh i do not think you are changed at all she said why he asked still watching her and trying to adjust himself to her words you looked at me then she said just as you used to when you were with us before and i said something frivolous i am afraid i was often frivolous in those days i confess i suspected myself of it and one day i even made a resolution she did start thenas if some memory had suddenly returned to her she lifted her bouquet to her face and let it slowly drop upon her knee again as she turned and looked at him i remember now she said that i made that resolution the day you brought me the heliotrope and now it seemed for the instant to be her turn to regard him with interest i dont know what the resolution was he said rather grimly but i hope it was a good one did you keep it no she answered undisturbedly but i kept the heliotrope you know i said i would it is laid away in one of my bureau drawers and the first party he asked was it a success oh yes she replied it was a great success i am happy to say that all my parties are successes inasmuch as i enjoy them is this a success he inquired she raised her bouquet to her face again and glanced over it at the crowded room it is an immense success she said such things always arein washington do you see that little woman on the sofa notice what bright eyes she has and how quickly they move from one person to anotherlike a birds she is our washington correspondent for halfadozen western papers and does the social column in one of our principal dailies and tomorrow you will read in it that one of the most brilliant receptions of the season was held last night at the charming home of mrs winter gardner on k street you will also learn that mrs richard amory was lovely in white brocade and pearls and that noticeable among even the stateliest masculine forms was the imposing figure of colonel tredennis the hero of indian adventure and she had been speaking in the quietest possible manner looking at the scene before her and not at him but here she stopped and bent toward him a little have you she said softly such a thing as a scalp about you he was by no means prepared for the inquiry but he sustained himself under it in his usual immovable manner he put his hand up to his breast and then dropped it i am afraid not he said not in this suit i forgot in dressing that i might need them but i might go back to the hotel he added suggestively oh no thanks she said returning to her former position i was only thinking how pleased she would be if you could show her a little one and tell her the history of it it would be so useful to her i am very sorry said tredennis you would be more sorry she went on if you knew what an industrious little person she is and with what difficulty she earns her ten dollars a column she goes to receptions and literary and art clubs and to the white house and the capitol and knows everybody and just what adjectives they like and how many and is never illnatured at all though it really seems to me that such an existence offers a premium to spitefulness i am convinced that it would make me spiteful but she never loses control over her temperor her adjectives if i weighed two hundred pounds for instance she would refer to my avoirdupois as matronly embonpoint and if i were a skeleton she would say i had a slight and reedlike figure which is rather clever you know as well as being christian charity and she will inform the world tomorrow that your dress glancing down at it was white and that my hair was brown as usual she ended for him and that i carried a bouquet of heliotrope and roses i hope you like it he said oh very much indeed thank you was her response and if i did not somebody else would or it is plain that she would not get her ten dollars a column it has struck me that she doesnt do it for amusement or with the deliberate intention of annoying people for my part i admire and envy her there is no collection so valuable as a collection of adjectives everything depends on adjectives you can begin a friendship or end it with oneor an enmity either will you tell me said tredennis what adjective you would apply to the blonde young man on the other side of the room who has just picked up a ladys handkerchief she looked across the room at the person indicated and did not reply at once there was a faintly reflective smile in her eyes though it could scarcely be said to touch her lips the man was the one who had attracted tredennis attention at the door of the cloakroom and since coming downstairs he had regarded him with some interest upon each occasion when he had caught sight of him as he moved from room to room evidently at once paying unobtrusive but unswerving attention to the social exigencies of his position and finding a decent amount of quiet entertainment in the results of his efforts i wish you would tell me said bertha after her little pause what adjective you would apply to him i am afraid said tredennis that our acquaintance is too limited at present to allow of my grasping the subject as i dont chance to know him at all bertha interposed still watching the object of discussion with the faintly reflective smile i have known him for six years she said and i have not found his adjective yet he is a cousin of mr amorys suppose she said turning with perfect seriousness and making a slight movement as if she would risesuppose we go and ask miss jessup tredennis offered her his arm let us hope that miss jessup can tell us he said his imperturbable readiness seemed to please her her little laugh had a genuine sound in it she sat down again i am afraid she could not she said see he is coming to speak to me and we might ask him but she did not ask him when he presented himself before her as he did almost immediately he had come to remind her that dancing was going on in one of the rooms and that she had promised him the waltz the musicians had just struck into with a flourish perhaps you will remember that you said the third waltz he said and this is the third waltz bertha rose i remember she said and i think i am ready for it but before you take me away you must know colonel tredennis of course you do know colonel tredennis but you must know him better colonel tredennis this is mr arbuthnot the pair bowed as civility demanded of the two it must be confessed that tredennis recognition of the ceremony was the less cordial just for the moment he was conscious of feeling secretly repelled by the young mans wellcarried conventional figure and calm blond countenancethe figure seemed so correct a copy of a score of others the blond countenance expressed so little beyond a carefully trained tendency to good manners entirely unbiassed by any human emotion by the time our waltz is finished said bertha as she took his arm i hope that mr amory will be here he promised me that he would come in toward the end of the evening he will be very glad to find you here and then with a little bow to tredennis she went away she did not speak to her companion until they reached the room where the dancers were congregated then as they took their place among the waltzers she broke the silence if i dont dance well she said take into consideration the fact that i have just been conversing with a man i knew eight years ago you will be sure to dance well said arbuthnot as they began but i dont mind acknowledging an objection to persons i knew eight years ago i never could find any sufficient reason for their turning up and as to your friend it strikes me it shows a great lack of taste in the indians to have consented to part with him it appeared to me that he possessed a manner calculated to endear him to aboriginal society beyond measure bertha laugheda laugh whose faintness might have arisen from her rapid motion hes rather rigorouslooking she said but he always was still i remember i was beginning to like him quite well when he went west papa is very fond of him he turns out to be a persistent heroic kind of beingwith a purpose in life and the rest of it his size is heroic enough said arbuthnot he would look better on a pedestal in a public square than in a parlor bertha made no reply but after having made the round of the room twice she stopped i am not dancing well she said i do not think i am in a dancing mood i will sit down arbuthnot glanced at her and then looked away do you want to be quiet he asked i want to be quieter than this she answered for a few minutes i believe i am tired you have been going out too much he said as he led her into a small sideroom which had been given up to a large ornate punchbowl to do reverence to which occasional devotees wandered in and out i have been going out a great deal she answered she leaned back in the luxurious little chair he had given her and looked across the hall into the room where the waltz was at its height and having looked she laughed do you see that girl in the white dress which doesnt fit she saidthe plump girl who bags at the waist and is oblivious to itand everything else but her waltz and her partner yes he responded but i hope you are not laughing at herthere is no need of it shes having a fascinating time yes she returned she is having a lively time but i am not laughing at her but at what she reminds me of do you know i was just that age when colonel tredennis saw me last i was not that size or that shape and my dresses used to fitbut i was just that age and just as oblivious and danced with just that spirit of enjoyment you dance with just as much enjoyment now said arbuthnot and you are quite as oblivious at times though it may suit your fancy just at the present moment to regard yourself as a shattered wreck confronted with the ruins of your lost youth and innocence i revel in that kind of thing myself at intervals but it does not last no she said opening her fan with a smile and looking down at the cupids and butterflies adorning it of course it wont last and i must confess that i am not ordinarily given to itbut that man do you know it was a curious sort of sensation that came over me when i first saw him i was standing near a window talking to halfadozen people and really enjoying myself very muchyou know i nearly always enjoy myselfand suddenly something seemed to make me look upand there he stood it would not be a bad idea for him to conceal his pedestal about him and mount it when it became necessary for him to remain stationary said arbuthnot flippantly and yet with a momentary gravity in his eyes somewhat at variance with his speech she went on as if he had not spoken it was certainly a curious feeling she continued everything came to me in a flash i suppose i am rather a light and frivolous person not sufficiently given to reflecting on the passage of time and suddenly there he stood and i remembered that eight years had gone by and that everything was changed a great many things can happen in eight years commented arbuthnot a great many things have happened to me she said everything has happened to me no said arbuthnot in a low rather reflective tone and looking as he spoke not at her but at the girl whose white dress did not fit and who at that moment whirled rather breathlessly by the door nonot everything i have grown from a child to a woman she said i have married i have arrived at maternal dignity i dont see that there is anything else that could happenat least anything comfortable no he admitted i dont think there is anything comfortable well it is very certain i dont want to try anything uncomfortable she said happy the people whose annals are tiresome montesquieu says that and it always struck me as meaning something i hope it does not mean that you consider your annals tiresome said arbuthnot how that girl does dance this is the fifth time she has passed the door i hope her partner likes it as much as she does remarked bertha and as to the annals i have not found them tiresome at all thank you as we happen to have come to retrospect i think i may say that i have rather enjoyed myself on the whole i have had no tremendous emotions on which you may congratulate yourself arbuthnot put in i do she responded i know i should not have liked them i have left such things toyou for instance she said this with a little air of civil mocking which was by no means unbecoming and to which her companion was well used thank you he replied amiably you showed consideration of coursebut thats your way i may not have lived exactly the kind of life i used to think i should livewhen i was a schoolgirl she went on smiling but who doesand who would want to when she attained years of discretion and i may not be exactly the kind of person imeant to be but i think i may congratulate you on thatand richard you would never have been the radiant creatures you are if i had ripened to that state of perfection you could not have borne up under it she rose from her seat and took his arm no she said i am not the kind of person i meant to be and colonel tredennis has reminded me of the fact and elevated my spirits let us go and find him and invite him to dinner tomorrow he deserves it as they passed the door of the dancingroom she paused a moment to look in and as she did so caught sight of the girl in the white dress once more she is not tired yet she said but her partner isand so am i if richard has come i think i shall go home chapter v tredennis dined with them the next day and many days afterward on meeting him richard amory had taken one of his rather numerous enthusiastic fancies to him and in pursuit and indulgence of this fancy could not see enough of him these fanciful friendships were the delights of his life and he never denied himself one though occasionally they wore themselves out in time to give place to others tredennis found him as the professor had described him a bright fellow and a handsome fellow he had thought that when he came forward to introduce himself as he had done at the gardners reception he had never seen a brighter or more attractive human being he had a dark delicate eager face soft waving hair tossed lightly back from a forehead whose beauty was almost feminine a slight lithe figure and an air of youth and alertness which would have been attraction enough in itself he was interested in everything each subject touched upon seeming to awaken him to enthusiasmthe indians the settlers the agencies the fort lifeequally interested in each and equally ready to confront in the most delightfully sanguine mood the problems each suggested it is worth a great deal to have an opportunity to judge of these things from the inside he said there are a thousand questions i want to ask but we shall see you often of course we must see you often it will be the greatest pleasure to us his first entrance into their house the following evening was something which always set itself apart in tredennis memory a gay burst of laughter greeted him as the parlor door was thrown openlaughter so gay that the first announcement of his name was drowned by it and as he paused for a moment he had the opportunity to take in fully the picture before him the room was a pretty and luxurious one its prettiness and luxury wearing the air of being the result of natural growth and suggesting no oppressiveness of upholstery its comforts were evidently the outcome of the fancies and desires of those who lounged or read or talked in it and its knickknacks and follies were all indicative of some charming whim carried out with a delightful freedom from reason which was their own excuse in the open fireplace a bright woodfire burned and upon the white wolfskin before it richard amory lay at unconventional full length with his hands clasped lightly under his head evidently enjoying to the utmost the ease of his position the glow of the fire and the jest of the moment while near him in an easychair sat arbuthnot both of them looked at bertha who stood with one hand resting on the low mantel i have been waiting for a long time tredennis heard her say and then as the servant announced his name again she stopped speaking and came forward to meet him while richard sprang lightly to his feet i will tell you at the outset she said that it is not one of the timehonored customs of washington for people to receive their guests with this ingenuous and untrammelled freedom but but she has been telling us a story put in richard shaking hands with him and she told it so well that we forgot the time and she must tell it again it is not worth telling again she said as they returned to the fire and besides i told it to you in the strictest confidence and if that is not reason enough i dont mind confessing that it is a story which doesnt exhibit me in an amiable light it shows a temper and viciousness that you count among your home comforts and dont feel it decent to display for the benefit of any one but your immediate relatives tredennis looked down at her curiously his first glance at her had shown him that tonight she was even farther removed from his past than she had seemed before her rich dress showed flashes of bright color her eyes were alight with some touch of excitement and her little wrists were covered with pretty barbarities of bangles and charms which jingled as she moved i should like to hear the story he said it is a very good story commented arbuthnot laughing i think i would tell it over again oh yes said richard colonel tredennis must hear it bertha looked across at tredennis and as she did so he saw in her eyes what he had seen the night before and had not understood but which dawned upon him nowa slight smiling defiance of his thoughts whatsoever they might be you wont like it she said but you shall hear it if you wish it is about a great lady that will add to the interest said tredennis you have great ladies in washington it is infinitely to our credit that they are only occasional incidents she answered and that they dont often last long when one considers the number of quiet domesticated women who find themselves launched suddenly by some wave of chance into the whirl of public life one naturally wonders that we are not afflicted with some very great ladies indeed but it must be confessed we have far less to complain of in that respect than might be expected but this particular great lady said tredennis is one of the occasional incidents some one said that our society was led by bewildered europeans and astonished americansamericans astonished to find themselves suddenly bearing the responsibility of the highest positions and europeans bewildered by being called upon to adjust themselves to startling novelties in manners and customs this great lady is one of the astonished americans and privately she is very much astonished indeed arbuthnot laughed you will observe he commented that mrs amorys remarks are entirely unbiassed by any feminine prejudices you will observe said bertha that mr arbuthnots remarks are entirely unbiassed by any prejudice in favor of my reliability of statement but she added with a delusive air of amiable candor i am sure you cannot deny that i was very civil to her i have not a doubt of it responded arbuthnot and i dont mind adding that i should like to have been there to see colonel tredennis shall judge she said whether it would have been really worth while i will make the story brief last season the great lady gave me cause to remember her we had not met and to please a friend i called upon her we found her in her drawingroom engaged in entertaining two new newly arrived attachs they seemed to interest her i regret to say that we did not she did not hear our names when the servant announced them and the insignificance of our general bearing was against us i think it must have been that for we were comparatively well dressedat least miss jessups description of our costumes in the wabash times gave that impression the following week perhaps we looked timid and unaccustomed to the luxurious trophies from many climes miss jessup again surrounding us the ingenuous modesty of extreme youth which you may have observed repeatedly replied arbuthnot thank you but i suppose it told against me on this occasion our respectable attire and air of general worthiness availed nothing the great lady rose stared at us gave us her fingerends called us by names which did not belong to us and sat down again turning her back upon us with much frankness and resuming her conversation with the attachs not interrupting it to address six words to us during the three minutes we remained that is the first half of the story it promises well for the second half said tredennis the second is my half said bertha later she discovered our real names and the fact thatshall i say that miss jessup knew them and thought them worthy of mention in the wabash times that would perhaps be a good way of putting it then she called but did not see me as i was out we did not meet again until this afternoon i was making the cabinet calls and had the pleasure of encountering her at the house of the secretary of war perhaps miss jessup had sent her a copy of the wabash times yesterday with the society column markedi dont know but she was pleased to approach me i received her advances with the mild consideration of one who sees a mistake made but is prevented by an amiable delicacy from correcting it and observing this she was led into the indiscretion of saying with graceful leniency that she feared i did not know her i think it is really there that my half begins i smiled with flattering incredulity and said that would be very strange in a washingtonian when you calledshe began i looked at her with a blush as of slight embarrassment which seemed to disturb her you have not forgotten that you called she remarked chillingly it would have been impossible for me to forget anything so agreeable i said as though in delicately eager apology i am most unlucky it was some more fortunate person but she said i returned the visit i received your card i replied smiling ingenuously into her eyes and it reminded me of my delinquency of course i knew it was a mistake and after i had smiled into her eyes for a second or so longer she began to understand and i think by this time it is quite clear to her there must be a moral to that commented tredennis there is she responded with serene readiness a useful one it is this it is always safein washingtonto be civil to the respectably clad if the exigencies of public position demand that you receive not the people you wish to see or the people who wish to see you but the respectably clad it is well to deal in glittering generalities of good manners and evenif you choose to go so fargood feeling there are numbers of socially besieged women in washington who actually put the good feeling first but the government cannot insist on that you know so it remains a matter of taste if you could draw the linebegan richard there is no line said bertha so you cant draw it and it was not myself i avenged this afternoon butthe respectably clad and before she became an astonished american put in arbuthnot this mistaken person was possibly bertha interposed with a pretty gesture which set all the bangles jingling ah she said but we have so little to do with that that i have not even the pleasure of using it in my arguments against her the only thing to be reasonably required of her now is that she should be sufficiently wellmannered during her career she might assume her deportment with her position and dispose of it at a sacrifice afterward imagine what a field in the way of advertisement for instance for sale a neatly fitting suit of good manners used through one administration somewhat worn through active service but still equal to much wear and tear that which struck tredennis more forcibly than all else was her habit of treating everything lightly and he observed that it was a habit arbuthnot shared with her the intimacy existing between the two seemed an unusual one and appeared to have established itself through slow and gradual growth it had no ephemeral air and bore somehow the impress of their having shared their experiences in common for some time beneath the very derision which marked their treatment of each other was a suggestion of unmistakable good fellowship and quick appreciation of each others moods when bertha made a fanciful speech arbuthnots laugh rang out even before richards which certainly was ready enough in response and when arbuthnot vouchsafed a semiserious remark bertha gave him an undivided attention which expressed her belief that what he said would be worth listening to amorys province it seemed to be to delight in both of themto admire their readiness to applaud their jests and to encourage them to display their powers that he admired arbuthnot immensely was no less evident than that no gift or grace of berthas was lost upon him his lighthearted inconsequent enjoyment of the pleasure of the moment impressed tredennis singularly he was so ready to be moved by any passing zephyr of sentiment or emotion and so entirely and sweettemperedly free from any fatiguing effect when the breeze had once swept over him all that i have to complain of in you two people he said gayly in the course of the evening is that you have no sentimentnone whatever we are full of it said arbuthnot both of usbut we conceal it and we feel that it makes us interesting nothing is more interesting than repressed emotion the appearance of sardonic coldness and stoicism which has deceived you is but a hollow mockery beneath it i secrete a maelstrom of impassioned feeling and a mausoleum of blighted hopes there is a fashion in emotions as in everything else said bertha and sentiment is out so is stateliness who would submit to stateliness in these days it was the highest aim of our greatgrandmothers to be stately but stateliness went out with ruffles and the minuet and a certain kind of roman nose you find in all portraits taken in the reigns of the georges now we are sprightly it is imperative that we should be sprightly i hope you are prepared to be sprightly colonel tredennis he was very conscious of not looking so in fact the idea was growing upon him that upon the whole his grave face and large figure were rather out of place among all this airy badinage his predominant feeling was that his unfortunate tendency to seriousness and silence was not a washingtonian quality and augured poorly for his future here were people who could treat lightly not only their subjects but themselves and each other the firelit room with its trifles and knickknacks and oddities the graceful easy figure of richard amory lounging idly in his chair bertha with her bright dress and fantastic little ornaments flashing and jingling arbuthnot smiling faintly and touching his mustache with a long fair handeach and all suggested to him in some whimsical vague fashion that he was too large and not pliable enough for his surroundings and that if he moved he might upset something or tread upon some sparkling not too substantial theory i am afraid i am not as well prepared as i might be he answered do you always find it easy i she returned oh perfectly it is only mr arbuthnot who finds it difficultbeing a prey to his feelings in his moments of deep mental anguish the sprightliness which society demands of him is a thing from which his soul recoils shortly after dinner arbuthnot went away he had a final call to make upon some friends who were going away after having taken an active part in the inaugural ceremonies and ball it appeared that they had come from the west with the laudable intention of making the most of these festivities and that he had felt it his duty to do his utmost for their entertainment i hope they enjoyed themselves said bertha as he stood making his adieus well was his reply it strikes me they did i took them to the treasury and the patent office and the army and navy department and up into the dome of the capitol and into the senate and the house and they heard the inaugural address and danced at the ball and saw the expresident and bought photographs of the new one and tired themselves out and are going home a party of total wrecks but without a thing on their consciences so i think they must have enjoyed themselves i hope so i didnt i dont grudge them anything but it is the ninetieth time i have been through the treasury and the twentieth time i have climbed to the dome and the exercise has lost its freshness after he had left the room he returned drawing from the pocket of his rather dandyfied light overcoat three small packages which he laid on a sidetable this is for janey and this for jack and this for marjorie he said i told them they would find them there in the morning thank you answered bertha as if the proceeding was one to which she was well accustomed when he was fairly gone richard amory broke into a half laugh what a queer fellow he is he said bertha returned to her place by the fire taking from the mantel a little screen of peacock feathers and shading her face with it do you know she said that he rarely leaves the house without one of us making that remark and yet it always has an illusive air of being entirely new well remarked richard he is a queer fellow and theres no denying it imagine a fellow like that coolly rambling about with neat packages of bonbons in his fastidious overcoat pocket to be bestowed on children without any particular claim on him why does he do it it doesnt exactly arise from enthusiasm awakened by their infant charms said bertha and he never professed that it did but he must care for them a little returned richard the fact is that you dont know what he cares for said bertha and it is rather one of his fascinations i suppose that is really what we mean by saying he is a queer fellow at all events said richard amiably he is a nice fellow and one can manage to subsist on that all i complain of is that he hasnt any object a man ought to have an objecttwo or three if he likes he doesnt like said bertha for he certainly hasnt an objectthough after all that belongs to his mode of life i should like said tredennis to know something of the mode of life of a man who hasnt an object you will gain a good deal of information on the subject if you remain long in washington answered bertha we generally have either too many objects or none at all if it is not your object to get into the white house or the cabinet or somewhere else it is probably your fate to be installed in a department and as you cannot hope to retain your position through any particular circumspectness or fitness for it you have not any object left you the fact is said richard it would have been a great deal better for larry if he had stayed where he was and fought it out the fact is said bertha it would be a great deal better for nine out of ten of the rest if they stayed where they were and when larry came he did not come under specially exhilarating circumstances and just then i suppose it seemed to him that the rest of his life was not worth much to him it has struck me said richard reflectively that he had a blow of some sort about that timesomething apart from the loss of his fortune i am not sure but that i once heard some wandering rumor of there being a young woman somewhere oh said bertha in a low rather hurried voice he had a blow there is no mistake about thathe had a blow and there was a good deal in him that did not survive it and yet he doesnt strike you as being that sort of fellow said richard still in reflection you wouldnt think of him as being a fellow with a grief bertha broke into delighted laughter a grief she exclaimed that is very good i wish he had heard it a grief i wonder what he would do with it in his moments of recreationat receptions for instance and musicales and germans he might conceal it in his opera hat but i am afraid it would be in the way poor larry griefs are as much out of fashion as stateliness and he not only couldnt indulge in one if he would but he wouldnt if he could well how would you put it said richard if you did not call it a grief bertha laughed again if i put it at all she answered i would say that he had once been very uncomfortable but had discreetly devoted himself to getting over it and had succeeded decently well and last but not least i would add that it would be decidedly difficult to make him uncomfortable again tredennis found it impossible to avoid watching her with grave interest each time she spoke or moved he was watching her now with a sort of aside sensibility to her bright drapery her flashing tinkling wrists and her screen of peacock feathers she is very light he was saying inwardly she turned to him with a smile would he strike you as a fellow with a grief she inquired no he answered i cannot say he would no she said that is certain enough if you went away and never saw him again you would remember just this of himif you remembered him at all that his clothes fitted him well that he had an agreeable laugh that he had a civil air of giving you his attention when you spoke andnothing else and that is not all there is of him tredennis asked she looked down at her feather screen still smiling slightly no she answered rather slowly not quite all but even i dont quite know how much more there is and richard who has known him at intervals all his life lapses into speaking of him as a fellow with a grief richard rose from his chair oh he said with much cheerfulness there is no denying that you two are the outgrowth of an effete civilization you are always arriving at logical deductions concerning each other and you have a tendency to the derision of all the softer emotions you are a couple of worldworn creatures and it is left to me to represent the youth and ardor of the family that is true said bertha in her soft mocking voice we are battered and worldly wiseand we have no object but i have said richard and if colonel tredennis will come upstairs with me i will show him what a few of them are if he takes an interest in such things what said berthathe laboratory or the library or all of them he answered including the new collection and he turned upon tredennis the brightest imaginable smile tredennis left his chair in response to it i am interested in all collections more or less he said so am i said berthamore or less and they went out of the room with this little gibe in their ears before the conclusion of his visit to the domains upstairs tredennis had learned a great deal of richard amory he had found that he had a taste for mechanics a taste for science a taste for literature he had a geological cabinet an entomological collection a collection of coins of old books of old engravings all in different stages of incompleteness he had even in his small workroom the unfinished models of an invention or two each of which he was ready to explain with an enthusiasm which flamed up as the demands of the moment required in the most delightful and inspiring manner i shall finish them all one of these days he said blithely i am always interested in one or the other and they give me an object and as i said downstairs what a man wants is an object that is what larry stands in need of give him an object and he would not indulge in that coldblooded introspection and retrospection bertha has told him so herself they are very good friends said tredennis oh yes they are fond of each other in their way it is their way to jeer a good deal but they would stand by each other i fancy if the time came when it was needful he referred in the course of the conversation to his profession and his reference to it caused tredennis to class it in his mind in some way or other with the unfinished models and incomplete collections i cant say i like the law he said but it was a sort of final resource i tried medicine for a whiletook a course of lectures but it didnt suit me and then two or three other things turned up but i didnt seem to suit them and so it ended in my choosing law or letting it choose me i dont know that i am exactly a success at it its well we dont depend on it berthahe broke off rather suddenly and began again at once i have plans which if they are as successful as they promise to be will change the aspect of affairs and he laughed exultantly on their way downstairs they came upon an open door which had been closed as they went up it opened into a large cheerful room with gay pictures on the walls and a high brass fender guarding the glowing fire before which a figure sat in a low rockingchair holding a child in its arms that is the nursery said richard bertha what is the matter with janey it was bertha who sat in the rockingchair and as she turned her face quietly toward them tredennis felt himself betrayed into a slight start neither her eyes nor her color were as bright as they had been downstairs she had taken off her ornaments and they lay in a small glittering heap upon the stand at her side the childs head rested upon her breast and her bare arm and hand held its body in an easy position with a light close accustomed touch she spoke in a soft lowered voice janey is nervous tonight she answered she cannot go to sleep and i am trying to quiet her will you excuse me if i do not come down she really needs me chapter vi when tredennis found himself standing out in the street half an hour later it was this picture which remained in his mind and no other if an effort had been required to retain the impression upon his mental retina he would have made the effort with the deliberate intention of excluding all else but no effort was needed i suppose it is sentiment he said taking his cigar out of his mouth and looking up at the starlit sky i have no doubt it is sentiment a man who has lived mooning alone as long as i have drifts in that direction naturally i suppose and i am a rigid oldfashioned fellow i dont fit in with the rest of it but with her child in her arms and her gewgaws laid on the table i seemed to see something i knew ill think of that and not of the other it was just at this moment that he caught sight of a figure approaching him from a distance of a few yards it was the figure of a man wrapped in a cloak and walking with bent head at a leisurely pace which argued that he was deep in meditation as it drew nearer tredennis recognized something familiar in its outlines and before it had taken halfadozen steps forward the head was raised suddenly almost as if attracted by something in his gaze and he recognized the professor who seeing him came toward him at once and laid a friendly hand on his shoulder you are coming away from the house are you he said i might have known i should have the chance of meeting you when i came out to take my ramble before going to bed i do it every night i find i sleep better for it perhaps bertha told you no answered tredennis i had not been told of it the professor gave him a little impetus forward with the hand he still kept on his shoulder walk on with me he said what i like is the deserted look of things and the silence there is nothing more silent and deserted than such a street as this at night there is a quiet and emptiness about it which impress themselves on you more than the stillness of a desert perhaps it is the sleep around you in the housesthe people who have lost their hold on the world and life for the time being they are far enough away by this time most of them and we are no more certain where they are than we shall be after they have lain down for the last time how did you find bertha his voice changed as he asked the question dropping its key somewhat and quiet though its tone was tredennis thought he recognized a faint suggestion of consciousness in it she looked very well he answered and was very bright she is generally that said the professor who was there a mr arbuthnot arbuthnot yes to be sure he generally is there he is a relative of richards they are fond of him i was to have been there myself but i had a previous engagement and i suppose they made light of each other as usual you meanbegan tredennis arbuthnot and bertha they always do it and richard looks on and enjoys it he is a queer fellow mr amory tredennis questioned uncertainly no no arbuthnot he is a queer fellow arbuthnot tredennis laughed that is what they said in the house he responded well its true said the professor reflectively and there is no denying it they said that too said tredennis and mrs amory added that it was a habit they had i dont know said the professor still keeping his hand on tredennis shoulder and seeming to study the pavement as he walkedi dont know what the man has done with his past and i dont know what he is going to do with his future i dont think he knows about the future himself it struck me said tredennisi dont know whythat he did not care thats it said the professor he doesnt care they walked a few steps in silence and then he went on he never will care he said unless something happens to rouse him i am obliged to confess said tredennis that i am afraid i am prepared to underrate him and it seemed to me that there wasnt much in him to rouse oh youll underrate him returned the professor at first and you may never get over it but there are also ten chances to one that you do i did you began by underrating him i dont overrate him now said the professor i dont know that i am particularly fond of him though there have been momentsjust momentswhen i have been threatened with it but i have come to the conclusion that there is something in him to rouse and that it wouldnt be the wisest thing in the world to rouse it do you mean said tredennis slowly that it would take a woman to rouse it yes answered the professor just as slowly it would take a woman and there are circumstances under which it would be better for the woman if she let what she might rouse lie and sleep for instance said tredennis with a fierce leap of every pulse in his body if said the professor deliberatelyif she were not free to give what his feeling for her demanded he paused to turn tredennis round confound him he said with a curiously irritable seriousness if he once reached a white heatthat fellow with his objectless follies and his dresscoat and his white necktie and his opera hat under his armif he once forgot them and himself it would be her fate to remember him as long as her life should last her fate said tredennis i said it would have to be a woman said the professor i should not like it to be a woman i felt an interest in we have reached the end of the block let us walk back again when he spoke again it was of richard armory not of arbuthnot you went upstairs into the museum as bertha calls it he said yes answered tredennis and into the workroom and saw the models and the collections and the books yes he has a good many enthusiasms richard said the professor they might form a collection of themselves he wont tire of life easily he is a fine contrast tothe other they were nearing the house again by this time and he glanced up at its front there is a light in the nursery window he said it must be one of janeys restless nights yes said tredennis mrs amory was with her when we came downstairs and she told us that the child was nervous and needed her she has wonderful patience with them said the professor and a sort of genius for understanding their vague young needs and desires she never does them an injustice for want of thought and never fails them i have seen her spend half an hour halfkneeling halfsitting on the nursery floor by one of them with her arm round it questioning it and helping it to tell its own story in a way that was very motherly there is a great deal of the maternal instinct in her tredennis made no reply but there rose before his mental vision the picture before the nursery fire and he saw again the soft close clasp of the fair hand and arm its curious how seldom we speak of paternal instinct the professor went on it is always maternal instinct well it is a great thing and it is a great safeguard wherewhere life is not satisfactory and as one grows older one sees a good deal of that it is pitiful sometimes when one finds it as one so often does in young things who havent got over their desperate mental insistence on their right to be happy he checked himself with a faint laugh im prosing my boy he said i always do it when i take my saunter at night it is a sort of safeguard against doing it in the day and i find i am specially given to it when i talk of bertha it is the paternal instinct if there is such a thing you remember how we talked of her when she came home from school do you find her much changed she has changed from a girla child almostto a woman said tredennis yes said the professor from a child to a woman and yet when you look back upon it eight years is a very short time sometimes it seems only yesterday that she startled me at the dinnertable by saying that she expected me to classify and label her there have been times said tredennis when it seemed only yesterday to me but tonight it is something far away the professor looked up at him quickly is it he said well well rather vaguely it is a habit they have fallen into that of making light of things it is a kind of fashion nowadays she did not treat things lightly then did she how she believed all that she believedhow frankly she impugned your veracity in argument without being at all conscious of the incivility how bright her eyes and lips were when she asked me if she could not have the label without the pin i wish he stopped suddenly once more we have reached the end of the block again my boy he said and i have walked long enough and talked long enough we must say goodnight to each other they were standing beneath a streetlamp and having looked up at tredennis to say this he drew back a pace to look again in whimsically gentle admiration of his stalwart proportions what a soldierly fellow you are he said and how you stand out among the rest of us and then with an odd change of manner he drew nearer and laid his hand on his shoulder once more ill say again he said what i have said before i wish you had been a son of mine my boy and as he said it there fell upon the quiet of the street the sound of approaching footsteps ringing on the pavement and turning instinctively toward them each saw an easily recognized masculine figure which reaching the house in which the amorys lived paused for a moment beneath the lighted window and flung forth to the night airily and by no means unmusically a few bars of one of the popular airs from a gay french opera and then crossing the street applied a latchkey to the door of the opposite house and entering closed it the fellow has a pleasant voice said the professor it is a voice you like to hear and that is one of his whims i thought i recognized the figure said tredennis it is arbuthnot said the professor arbuthnot and then they parted chapter vii to tredennis the next three months were full of event it was mostly quiet event and yet as day followed day he was conscious that in each twentyfour hours he lived through some new mental experience which left its mark upon him the first two weeks seemed to make his old regular routinegoverned life a thing of the far past from which he was entirely separated by a gulf which it would be impossible to recross he awakened to a recognition of this at the end of the second week and told himself that the feeling was due to the complete novelty of his surroundings and their natural influences upon him he found himself placed among people whose lives ambitions and interests were all new to him and of a kind with which he had never before been thrown into close contact for a length of time sufficient to allow of analysis in his first visit to washington he had regarded its peculiarities merely as an amateur and a visitor now he saw and studied them from a different standpoint the public buildings were no longer mere edifices in his eyes but developed into tremendous communities regulated by a tremendous system for which there could be no medium or indefinite standing but which must either be a tremendous credit or a tremendous discredit to itself and the power it represented the human side of the place grew and impressed itself upon him he began to feel the full significance of the stream of humanity which ebbed and flowed to and from these buildings at stated hours in the day after a few afternoon walks on the avenue he could recognize many a face that passed him and comprehend something of what it typified he could single out the young woman who supported her family upon her salary and the young woman who bought her ribbons with it the widow whose pay fed halfadozen children and the husband whose earnings were appropriated by a wife of fashionable aspirations the man of broken career whose wasted ambitions and frustrated purposes were buried in the monotonous routine of a government clerkship and who asked and hoped for no greater boon than to be permitted to hold his place through as much of the future as remained to him it was an orderly and respectably dressed crowd as a rule but there was many a sad face to be seen in it and many an anxious and disappointed one it never failed to interest tredennis and he took his afternoon walk so often at the same hour that the passersby began to know his tall soldierly figure and sunbrowned face and rather expected to encounter them and when the newspapers had referred to him on a dozen occasions or so there were not a few who recognized him and pointed him out to each other as something of a celebrity and a hero and so worth seeing this general knowledge which people seemed to have of one another was one thing which struck him as peculiarly local it was the rule and not the exception that in walking out he met persons he knew or knew of and he found it at no time difficult to discover the names and positions of those who attracted his attention almost all noticeable and numerous unnoticeable persons were to be distinguished in some way from their fellows the dark sinewy man he observed standing on the steps of a certain family hotel was a noted new england senator his companion was the head of an important department the man who stood near was the private secretary of the president or the editor of one of the dailies or a man with a muchdiscussed claim against the government the handsome woman whose carriage drew up before a fashionable millinery establishment was the wife of a foreign diplomat or of a wellknown politician or of a member of the cabinet the woman who crossed her path as she got out was a celebrated female suffragist or female physician or lawyer or perhaps that muchtalkedof willothewisp a female lobbyist and eight persons out of every ten passing them knew their names and not a little of their private history so much was crowded within a comparatively limited radius that it was not easy for any person or thing worthy of note to be lost or hidden from the public eye by the most natural gradations tredennis found the whole tenor of his existence changed in this atmosphere his fixed habits of life gave way before the influences surrounding him one of the most subtle of these influences was that of his intimacy with the members of the amory household which grew as he had not at all anticipated that it would he had thought of the acquaintance in the first place as one not likely to ripen into anything beyond its rather conventional significance perhaps on the whole he had been content to let it rest as it was feeling only halfconsciously that he should be in a quieter frame of mind and less liable to vague pangs and disappointments it is all different he had said to himself and it is all over it is better that it should remain as it is but after his first visit richard did not choose to lose sight of him it was his fancy to seek him out and make much of and take possession of him with an amiability and frank persistence in the chase which were at once complimentary and engaging look here he would say having followed him up to reproach him you dont suppose we intend to be treated in this manner we wont hear of it we want you your stalwart solidity is what we have been needing to give us weight and balance only yesterday bertha was holding you up to arbuthnot as a model of steadfastness of purpose we thought we were going to see you every other day at least and you have not been near us for a week bertha wonders what we have been guilty of and then he would be carried up to luncheon or dinner or to spend the evening and each visit resulted in another and another until it gradually became the most natural thing in the world that he should drop in at odd hours because it seemed that he was always expected and he appeared to have a place among them do you know what we shall do with you if you remain here a year bertha had said to him at the outset we shall domesticate you we not only domesticated mr arbuthnot but we appropriated him we feel that we have invested largely in him and that he ought to respect our rights and pay interest sometimes i wonder how he likes it and just now it occurs to me to wonder how you would like it the question is tredennis answered how you would like it he was always conscious of a silent distaste for being compared to mr arbuthnot and he was also always conscious of the youthful weakness of the feeling it is the kind of thing which belongs to a younger man he used to say to himself it is arrant folly and yet i am not fond of the fellow but as bertha had predicted he became in a manner domesticated in the household perhaps the truth was that his natural tendency was toward the comfort and easy communion of homelife he was a little surprised to find himself develop a strong fancy for children he had never been averse to them but he had known nothing of them and had never suspected himself of any definite disposition to fondness for them after he had watched berthas during a few visits he began to like them and to be oddly interested in their sayings and doings he discovered jack to be a decidedly sturdy and masculine little fellow with rather more than his share of physical strength and beauty and making amicable advances toward him was met halfway with a fearless readiness which was very attractive then he made friends with janey and found himself still more interested her childish femininity was even better worth studying than jacks miniature manhood she was a small gentle creature with clinging hands and much faith but also with a delightful sense of infantile dignity and the friendship which established itself between them was a very absorbing sentiment it was not long before it became an understood thing among the juvenile portion of the establishment that tredennis was to be counted among the spoils his incoming was greeted with rapture his outgoing was regarded as a species of calamity only to be borne because it was unavoidable he could tell stories of indians and bears and on more than one occasion was decoyed into the nursery and found to be not entirely without resources in the matter of building forts with blocks and defending them against aboriginal warriors with tin soldiers his own sense of enjoyment of the discovery of these accomplishments in himself filled him with a whimsical pleasure he began to carry toys in his pockets and became a connoisseur of such dainties as were considered harmless to the juvenile constitution and after having been reproved by janey on two or three occasions for the severity of his air he began also to have a care that the expression of his countenance should be less serious and more likely to win the approval of innocent small creatures who considered gravity uncalled for and mysterious at first he had seemed to learn but little of bertha herself notwithstanding that a day seldom passed without their meeting and there were times when he fancied he had determined that there was but little to learn the gayeties of the season over she announced her intention of resting and her manner of accomplishing this end was to inaugurate a series of small festivities with a result of occupying each day until midnight she gave small informal dinners suppers and teas to the favored few who would be most likely to enjoy and find them exhilarating and when she did not give a dinner or tea her evenings were bestowed upon arbuthnot and half a dozen of the inner circle whose habit it was to drop in and talk politics literature or entertaining nonsense at such times it was not at all unusual for the professor to ramble in at about nine oclock and profess to partake of the cup of tea bertha offered him and which he invariably left more than half full upon the small table by his chair his old tender interest in her had not lessened in degree tredennis noticed after seeing them together on two or three occasions but it had altered in kind sometimes the look of curious speculation returned to his eyes but oftener they expressed a patient kindly watchfulness it was not long before tredennis began to observe that this quietly watchful look generally showed itself when arbuthnot was present the first time that he felt the full force of the truth of this was one evening when there had been only two or three callers who had remained but a short time going away early and leaving no one in the parlors but himself the professor and arbuthnot arbuthnot had come in later than usual and had appeared to be in an unusual mood he was pale when he entered and had no jesting speech to make he took his seat by bertha and replied to her remarks with but little of his customary animation now and then lapsing into silence as if he had forgotten his surroundings bertha seemed inclined to let his humor pass without notice as if it was not exactly a new experience but richard commented upon it something has gone wrong he said what is it larry nothing has gone wrong arbuthnot answered with a short cheerless laugh i have seen a ghost that is all a ghost said bertha in a low voice and then sat silent guarding her face from the fire with her favorite peacockfeather screen the professor began to stir his tea round and round which exercise was his customary assistance to reflection or debate he glanced at the peacockfeather screen and then at arbuthnot a ghost is always an interesting scientific conundrum he observed what form did it take arbuthnot laughed his short cheerless laugh again it took the form of a sanguine young man from the west he said who has just come into a twelvehundreddollar clerkship and feels that unending vistas of fortune lie before him he was in such good spirits about it that i rather lost my hold on myself and said things i might as well have left unsaid what did you say richard asked i told him that if he had money enough left to buy a return ticket home he had better buy one and that if he had not i would lend it to him i told him that at his age it wasnt a bad idea for a man to devote his time to establishing himself in some career he could depend on and that in default of having the energy to do that he might reflect on the alternative of blowing his brains out as a preparation for a peaceful old age and i told him that i had seen young fellows like himself before and that the end had been for them what it would be for him well said richard as he had stopped it wasnt any use he answered i knew it would not be when i began i simply made a spectacle of myself in a quiet way to no purpose and as a result i am uncomfortable it was all nonsense but he reminded me of what said richard since he had paused again a peculiar expression crossed his face tredennis saw him glance at the peacockfeather screen and as quickly glance away ofa young fellow of his age iused to know he answered what was his story inquired richard with his usual desire for information where is he now dead said arbuthnot and singularly enough he half laughed again as he tossed his cigar into the grate and went to the piano he began to sing in a rather low voice and while he sang the rest listened when he referred to his musical efforts it was his habit to treat them as but trivial performances but he allowed them to lose none of their effectiveness through lack of care and culture he knew wherein his power lay and used it well tonight for some reason this power was at its strongest and as he sang song after song even tredennis was compelled to acknowledge that if it was his object to produce an emotional effect he was in a fair way to succeed richard threw himself upon a sofa and gave himself up to him with characteristic readiness to be moved the professor stirred his tea slowly and mechanically and bertha sat still in the shadow of her screen but it was she who moved first in the midst of one of the songs she left her seat slowly crossed the room to the piano and stood near it leaning against the dark wall her slight white figure thrown into strong relief her handsone of them still holding the peacockfeather screenfallen at her sides her eyes resting on arbuthnots averted face it seemed to tredennis that she had moved in obedience to some impulse of whose power she was scarcely conscious he saw that she also was pale and looked worn with fatigue and he was filled as he had been more than once before with secret resentment of the fact that no one but himself appeared to notice that she had changed even within the last month arbuthnot continued playing it was evident that she had not intended to distract his attention when she approached him and he did not look at or speak to her as she stood listening it seemed as if she had forgotten everything but the influence his voice exerted over her for the time being and that she allowed it to carry her whither it would something in the soft absorbed expression of her face reminded tredennis vaguely of the look she had worn when she turned to brood over his words on the night when he had felt nearest to her he was thinking this when a movement from the professor attracted his attentiona jingling of the teaspoon a little crash an exclamation of dismay and confusion and the little stand had mysteriously been overturned and the professor was ruefully bending down to pick up the fragments of his small cup and saucer my dear child he said to bertha who had started forward to his rescue what a stupid old vandal i am and what an insecure little table to betray me withand in the midst of schuberts serenade too which mr arbuthnot was giving us in his most effective manner suppose you take me up into the nursery as an example to the children while you dry my coat he went out of the room with her his hand upon her shoulder and arbuthnot left the piano and returned to the fire the spell had been broken with the cup and saucer and the serenade remained unfinished he produced a fresh cigarwhich luxury was one of many accorded him in the householdlighted it and rather to tredennis surprise resumed his conversation as if there had been no pause in it the fellow will be an annoyance to me every day of his life he said faint lines showing themselves upon his forehead in spite of the halfsmile which was meant to deprive them of their significance i know that confound him he is in my room and i shall have the benefit of every change in him and it will be a grindtheres no denying that it will be a grind i should like to know said tredennis what the changes will be the changes will depend upon the kind of fellow he chances to be said arbuthnot there are two varieties if there is a good deal in him he will begin by being hopeful and working hard he will think that he may make himself of value in his position and create a sort of career for himself he will do more than is required of him and neglect nothing he will keep his eyes open and make friends of the men about him he will do that for a few months and then suddenly and for no fault whatever one of these friends will be dropped out knowing the man to be as faithful as himself it will be a shock to him and he will get anxious and worry over it he will see him stranded without resources struggling to regain his place or get another treated with amiable tolerance when he is not buffeted snubbed and put off he will see him hanging about day after day growing shabbier more careworn more desperate until he disappears and is heard of no more and everybody is rather relieved than not he may have been a family man with a wife and halfadozen children all living decently on his salary somebody else wanted his place and got it not because of superior fitness for it but because the opposing influence was stronger than his the new man will go through the same experience when his turn comesthat is all well my friend will see this and be anxious and ask questions and find out that his chances are just the sameno more and no less he will try not to believe it being young enough to be betrayed into the folly and he will work harder than ever and get over his blow a little until he sees the same thing happen again and again then he will begin to lose some of his good spirits he will be a trifle irritable at times and lines will show themselves on his face and he wont be so young when he writes to the girl he is in love withi saw a letter addressed to some young woman out west lying on his desk todayshe will notice a change in him and the change will reveal itself more in each letter but he will hang on and grind away and each election will be a nightmare to him but he will grind away and then at last he stopped and made a light rather graceful gesture with his fingers what then demanded tredennis with manifest impatience there will be a new administration and if he struggles through it will be worse for him than if he were dropped as in that case he throws away another four years of his life and all the chances for a future they might hold if he were free to avail himself of them tredennis stood up looking very large under the influence of the feeling which disturbed him arbuthnot himself was not entirely unimpressed by his quick movement and the energy it expressed you treat the matter coolly he exclaimed as he rose arbuthnot turned his attention to his cigar yes he replied i treat it coolly if i treated it warmly or hotly the effect produced would be about the same my influence upon civil service is just what it might be expected to be and no more its weight is easily carried i beg your pardon said tredennis feeling the justice and adroitness of the speech not at all arbuthnot answered it is not necessary it makes you lose your hold on yourself to be brought face to face with the thing it is quite natural it has had the same effect on me and i am a coldblooded fellow and a frivolous fellow into the bargain i have never thought of the matter before said tredennis disturbedly i feel as if my indifference is something to be ashamed of if you give your attention as a duty to such subjects was arbuthnots response you will be kept actively employed if you take my advice you will let them alone the trouble is said tredennis that every one seems to let them alone richard regarded him from his place on the sofacushions delightedly heres an example for you larry he said profit by him everything is an object to himeverything is worth while he is an example to us all let us all profit by him oh he began right laughed arbuthnot he began where you began returned richard i was the airy answer i never began at all that is my little difficulty i am the other one i told you there was another one i represent him tredennis regarded him steadily for the first time in the course of their acquaintance he began to suspect him his manner was too light altogether and the odd shade which had fallen upon his eyes before during the evening showed itself again let us hear about the other one he said he is easily disposed of was the answer there was nothing of him at the outset he came to his place without an object he liked the idea of living in washington and of spending his salary we will say he was a rather welllooking young fellow and could dance and sing a little and talk decently well he had no responsibilities and never thought of the future his salary clothed him and allowed him little luxuries and ordinary pleasures he spent it when he had it and made debt when it was gone being presentable he was invited out and made himself useful and entertaining in a small way when he thought of the possibilities of his career being brought suddenly to a close he was uncomfortable so he preferred not to think of it it is not a pleasant thing to reflect that a man has about ten years in which to begin life and that after that he is ending it but it is true what he does from twenty to thirty he will be likely to find he must abide by from thirty to seventy if he lives that long this man like the better one has thrown away the years in which he might have been preparing himself to end decently when they are gone he has nothing to show for them and less than nothing he is the feather upon the current and when all is over for him he is whirled out of sight and forgotten with the rest and perhaps if he had felt there was anything to be gained by his being a steady respectable fellow he might have settled down into one he got up suddenly with a gesture as if he would shake himself free of his mood here he said im going it is quite time its all nonsense talking it over it is the old story i have made myself uncomfortable for nothing confound you dick why did you let me begin say goodnight to the professor and mrs amory for me come back called richard bertha will want to hear the rest of the serenade when she comes down the serenade he said derisively no thank you you have had enough of me and i have had too much of myself he passed into the hall just as the professor descended from the nursery and through the open door tredennis heard what they said to each other you did not finish the serenade said the professor no was the reply and i am afraid you were resigned to it professor you were singing it very well and with great effect the professor responded amicably you are very kind to say so arbuthnot answered goodnight sir goodnight replied the professor as he entered the parlor as he did so tredennis heard the sound of feet upon the stairs and caught a glimpse of berthas white figure as she came down you are not going he heard her say yes she had reached the last step by this time and stood with her hand resting upon the balustrade and she was paler than she had been before i she begani wanted to talk to you what is it larry tredennis had never heard her call him by his first name before and he felt with a keenness which startled him the soft naturalness with which it fell from her lips arbuthnots voice itself had altered when he answered her it is nothing he said but that i am not exactly in a presentable humor and i want to go and conceal myself it is the best thing i can do goodnight he held out his hand touched hers lightly and then turned away and the door opened and closed after him and bertha came into the parlor moving slowly as if she felt tired chapter viii when tredennis rose to take his leave the professor rose also i will go with you he said and if you will you shall give me a few minutes of your time before going home i have some new books to show you they went out together but until they reached the other house and entered the library very little was said the catastrophe of the broken teacup or something of greater moment seemed to occupy the professors thoughts by the time they took their accustomed chairs he appeared to have forgotten the new books his thoughtful face wore so sadly perplexed a look that he even seemed older than usual tredennis awaited his first words in silence his quiet fondness for him had become a very warm and tender feeling during the past months it had been his pleasure to try to be of use to him he had studied his needs and endeavored to supply them he had managed to share hours with him which might otherwise have been lonely he had brought to him the stir of the outside working world when he seemed to require its stimulant he had placed his own vigor and endurance at his disposal without seeming to do so and his efforts at making his rather lonely life a brighter and more attractive thing had not been in vain it was to him the professor turned in his moments of fatigue and necessity and it was to him he turned now i am going to do a curious thing he saidi am going to do a curious thing but i think it is the best thing and the simplest the simplest thing is always the best said tredennis more because there was a pause than because he felt an answer was needed yes yes said the professor seriously i think so and it is easier to be simple with you my boy than with another man it is your way to be direct and serious you always had the habit it never was your way to trifle it is rather the fashion to trifle nowadays you know but youi have always liked it in you that you were not a trifler no answered tredennis i have not trifled much it may have been against me sometimes i have thought it was i cannot count it among my merits at any rate i am a grim fellow by nature no said the professor not a grim fellow a silent fellow and rather unyielding with yourself but he stopped and looked up at him with a simple affection which made the young mans heart beat as a womans glance might have done i think you know i love you he said i have begun to depend on you and count you among my luxuries i am an old man and my luxuries are worth a great deal to me no kindly thoughtful act of yours has been unregarded and i have liked your fancy for me almost as a girl likes the attentions of her first lover sometimes it has pleased me to be half sentimental over them and half sentimental over you tredennis flushed with pleasure and warm feeling he rose impulsively and crossed the hearth i never say things well he said but i should like to try to put into words something of what i feel you once said you wished i was your son and i have been glad to remember it i have no ties let your wish be a sort of tie between us it is a tie i should be proud of and glad to honor and make an object in my life give me what affection you can i wish for it and need it if i had been your son you would have counted on me give me the pleasure and comfort of knowing you count on me now it has somehow seemed my lot to have no place in the lives of others give me this if i am worth it i shall be better for it and happier the professor gave him a quiet halfwistful glance i gave it to you long ago he said at length the wish has been a tie between us from the first and he said it even with a touch of solemnity if it had not been he added afterward i should not have come to you with my trouble tonightfeeling so sure that you would understand it he made a gesture with his hand go and walk up and down the room there as i am used to seeing you he said and i will tell you about it tredennis did as he bade himwent to the other side of the room and began his measured march we talked of bertha in this very room years ago he began it seems to be our lot to talk of bertha i am going to speak of her again tredennis continued his measured tramp without speaking the professor rested his forehead upon his hand and sat so looking downward he went on in a quiet voice and with a quiet absorbed mannerthe manner of a man who having the habit of close and careful study was giving his whole attention simply and carefully to his subject i shall have to go back to that night and repeat something i said then he went on it was that her only hope for happiness would lie in her marriage with a man she loved deeply i remember it tredennis answered and i added that the chances were that instead she would marry the man who loved her i remember that too the professor sighed heavily and wearily the chances were too many he said she married the man who loved her tredennis had marched one length of the room before he continued he did love her the professor said after his pause tempestuouslyoverwhelmingly overwhelmingly is a good word to use he overwhelmed her in the end at first she liked him but when the nature of his feeling for her began to express itself it is my impression that she felt a secret fear of and dislike to it she tried to avoid him but he absolutely refused to allow it he followed her and was picturesquely wretched before her eyes there is no denying he was picturesque that was his strong point he was picturesque and patheticand poetic she was only a girl and she was tremendously at a disadvantage before him when she treated him badly he bore it with tender patience and he devoted himself to her with a faithfulness which might have touched a heart harder and more experienced than hers was poor child of course his picturesque unhappiness and his poetic magnanimity told i knew they would and they did reaction set in and she began to feel the fascination of making him happy he stopped and suddenly lifted his head my boy he said one of the most damnable things in life is a fascination like that in the mind of a generous ignorant creature he dropped his head again that is strong language he said and i dont often use strong language idont consider it gentlemanly but i felt strongly at the moment and the word is expressive well the time came when in a moment when her mood being softer and more sympathetic than usual and she herself as a consequence at a greater disadvantage than evershe committed herself and then it was all over the trouble is that the experience of a woman of forty is what a girl needs when she chooses her husband at twenty and as the two things are incompatible the chances are always against her bertha had the faults and follies that i told you go to make a martyr when she had made her mistake she was strong and weak enough to abide by it it is mostly imagination in matters of this kind it was imagination in hers she was young enough to believe in everything she believed that if she broke her engagement she would break amorys heart and ruin his life for him there was no danger of either catastrophe but they were realities to her and they terrified her then she had never been touched by any deeper feeling than the anxious tenderness he awakened in her she had not been given to sentiments and i am afraid had regarded them rather contemptuously in others she had no conception of a feeling stronger than herself and held curiously obstinate and lofty views of the conduct of women who did not hold their emotions neatly in check her girlish bigotry was touching to me sometimes because it was so thorough and revealed such ignorance i wishi wish i could hear something of it now tredennis had reached the end of the room he turned sharply but recovered himself and said nothing lately the professor added slowly she has been more silent on such subjects than she used to be he lifted his head from his hand and looked at tredennis again philip he said ii wish to heaven chance had sent you to us that year tredennis stopped in his walk a dark and rigid figure in the shadow had sent me he said in a strained voice me whatcould i have done ii dont know answered the professor but i solemnly believe my boy that if you had come you would have averted an evil then said tredennis i wish to god i had i say it said the professor with all the more certainty remembering as i do one day when she wished for you herself she said tredennis bertha bertha yes bertha herself it was a few weeks before her marriage and she had not been exactly herself for a week or more one evening i came into the parlor and found the room full of the odor of flowers amory had been with her and had left her a bouquet of heliotrope she had some on her knee as she sat on a low seat before the fire when i seated myself near her she looked up at me suddenly and said in a rather unsteady voice papa i have been thinking about philip tredennis i have not thought of him for a long time i should like to see him iwish he could come back she half laughed at herself as she said it but her laugh was nervous and when i said to her why were you great friends i did not know that she tried to laugh again and answered yesnonot exactly but it seems to me that he was a strong sort of person and sensible andand you might rely on his decisions it is only a fancy i supposebut it just came into my mind that i should like to see him again there is no doubt in my mind that she felt a need of your obstinate strength which she did not comprehend wholly herself i wish you had comei wish from my soul you had i might have come if i had known said tredennis in a low tone there was nothingnothing to have stood in my way and he turned and began his walk again the professor sighed as he had sighed beforeheavily and drearily but you did not he said and she married amory i should like to know asked tredennis if you think she is unhappy now do not tell me if you do not wish the professors reply was very simple and direct she has never been given to taking sentimental views of herself he said and she is selfcontrolled and fond of her children but she has never been happy for an hour since her marriage i think the first year was very bitter to her amory has always been very fond of her he is fond of her now but her illusions concerning his passion for her soon died she found out in two months that he would not have perished if she had discarded him she had been his one object at first but she was only one of a dozen others after they were married he was amiable and delightful but he was not always considerate the picturesqueness of his attitude toward her was lost he did not require her care and sympathy and the sacrifices she made for him were very simple and natural matters in his eyes in the beginning she was perhaps bewildered and desperate but girl as she was she was too proud and just not to see that her youth and ignorance had led her into a folly and that the result was its natural punishment once she said to me the worse punishments in life are the punishments for ignorancethe worst the worst and i knew what she meant though she said no more when her first child was born she went down to the door of death and her physicians said there seemed to be a lack of effort and yet i tell you she might have been the happiest young mother in the world when she has been near happiness at all it has been in her quiet moments with her children if it had not been for her children she might have been a harder and more heartless creature than she can ever be now if she had been something less and slighter than fate made her she might have been either a dull nurse and housekeeper or a vapid woman of society in either case she would have been happier than she is today what a long story it is and i did not think it would be so long when i began i want to hear it all broke in tredennisevery word i have not understood the changes i saw in her i want to understand that brings me to the point of it all was the reply if she had been a laborers wife she might have been too hardworked to be restless but she has had leisure and social duties and she has set herself deliberately the desperate task of making them her pleasures she has found an exhilaration in them which has given her no time for regrets she is a woman young attractive and spirited she was too full of spirit to permit herself to be subdued by her disappointment as she cannot retrieve her mistake she will make the best of it she has reasoned herself into a belief that she is satisfied with what fortune has given her and so long as that belief remains unshaken she will be as happy as nine women out of ten are women are not happy as a rule philip they are not happy i have learned that but so long as her belief remains unshakensaid tredennis the professor interrupted him gravely sadly that is the point he said my fear is that it is shaken now tredennis stopped in the middle of the roomstood quite still she has had friends and admirers said the professor scores of them perhaps all the more because she has cared less for them than they for her she has a pretty trick of making the best of people and it wins the public heart she has friends acquaintances and even harmless devotees but among them all there is only one man who gauges her and that man is the one who very naturally presents himself to your mind as a fair dandy with a ready tongue and good manners arbuthnot exclaimed tredennis arbuthnot the professor smiled faintly what he said you recognize him at once well my one vanity is my pride in my private knowledge of the thought of others i am very proud of it in a senile way i have been studying and classifying all my life and now i sit and look on and treat human beings as i have treated insects if it had not been so i should not have known so much of bertha yes arbuthnot among all the men she knows and has knowndiplomates literati politicians honest meni have found only one to disturb me and that one laurence arbuthnot tredennis stood still looking down at the floor with folded arms ihe began i have thought the professor started what he exclaimed you have thought if you have thoughtit must be plainer than i feared no said tredennis hurriedly do not let that trouble you what i have thought is so trivial and vague that it should not weigh at all it has only been because i remembered her girlhood andand i thought her changedand did not understand ah said the professor letting his face fall upon both his hands that is not his trouble he understands and that is his strength he has had his evil hour that composed welldressed fellow and he did not come out of it without scars he covers them well with his light overcoat and the rose in his buttonhole but they are there and they have made him wise he has been silent but he has looked on tooas i haveand he has seen what others were blind to she has never suspected him but his knowledge has given him power when her mauvais quart dheure has come upon her he has known what to say and what to avoid saying and while she has not comprehended his motives she has been grateful to him she has liked his songs and his readiness and his unsentimental air and she has unconsciously learned to rely on him her first sincere liking for him arose from her discovery of his inconsistent and incongruous knack with the children she had thought of him as a rather clever selfish wellmannered creature and once in a juvenile crisis he surprised her by developing natural giftssomewhat coldblooded but still amazingly effective the children began to be fond of him and his path was smoothed she began to be fond of him herself genuinely and simply and if it had ended there she would have been safer than before but it did not end there i suppose the cup and saucer were not broken too soon this eveningthey were not broken soon enough it was not an accident exclaimed tredennis no it was not an accident i have heard his serenade before there is the danger he means no harm but his serenade and the moments when what is past gets the better of him and the little touches of passion his overcoat wont always cover and the bits of sincerity he struggles against and she ponders over are good for neither him nor her i have heard his serenade before but tonight when she got up and followed him as if he had called her andand she had only half heard his voice and yet must obey it and when she stood there against the wall with her pale face and her soft eyes fixed on him it was time for some common thing to happen to bring her back to lifeand the cup and saucer were offered as the sacrifice he said it whimsically and yet sadly poor child he added poor child i dare say it was hard enough he paused a moment and then rose went to tredenniss side and laid his hand on his shoulder there he saidthere is the confession and i can make my appeal to you with fewer words your appeal tredennis repeated i can ask you for your help if there is any help i can give which is worth the asking and giving said tredennis slowly you know it will be yours yes i know it will be mine and so i ask it easily and what i ask is this let us walk slowly while we talk and i will keep my hand on your shoulderi like to feel your support what i would say is this if you had been my son you would have watched over her and stood between her and any pain which could threaten her you know that what i fear for her now is only the desperate hopeless misery such an experience as this would be sure to bring her if it were allowed to ripen for her there is nothing else to fear no i know i need not have said that to you no answered tredennis there was no need to say it she does not know herself i know her and know what such an experience holds for her better that her life should be barren to the end than that she should bear what she must bear if her heart is once awakened better said tredennis he felt the tremulous hand weigh heavily upon him i am an old man he was answered i have lived my life nearly to its close and i say a thousand times better i married a woman i did not love and i loved a woman i could not marry and you wished to ask me said tredennis breaking the short silence which followed i ask you to defend her against this pain if i were a younger and stronger man i might do for her what i ask of you but i cannot often be with her you are with her day after day she likes you i have fancied tredennis said that she did not like me it is only fancy she sees in you the strength she vaguely longed for when she was at the turningpoint of her life let her feel that it is always near her and that she may rely upon it now you are fond of her childrentalk to her of them when you see her inclined to be silent and unlike herself bring them to her mind when that fellow is there manage that she shall think of them her tenderness for them is your stronghold and mine tonight why did i take her to the nursery because they lay asleep there and when she saw them she stopped to cover them more warmly and touch them with her hand and bend to kiss them and forgot her serenade she loves them better than she loves anything else on earthbetter than she could love anything else perhaps thats her womans way god made it so that is the one help and safeguard he gave to women out of the whole bitter universe bring her back to her children at her saddest and weariest and when the fight is hardest and they will beat the rest back it is nature you will do what i ask i know i shall be more at ease he said next that i have asked this of you when you are with her i shall feel that she is safe i trust her in your hands i will try to be worthy of the trust it is rather a strange one to repose in a man of your age but i give it to you with the restit goes with the tie you wished for it is a relief to me to share it with a strong fellow who can bear it well they talked a little longer walking across the floor two or three times together and then tredennis went away he was in a strange frame of mind it was almost as if he had received a blow which had partially stunned him when he reached the street he stood for a moment looking up at the starlit sky a strong fellow he said am i such a strong fellow and i am to stand between you and your loveri that is a strange thing berthaa strange thing and rousing himself suddenly he strode down the street and the professor who had gone to his room heard his military tread ringing steady and measured upon the pavement and felt a vague comfort in the sound chapter ix during the next few weeks bertha did not appear as well as usual the changes tredennis had seen in her became more marked she lost color and roundness and now and then was forced to show signs of fatigue which were not habitual with her she made no alteration in her mode of life however when tredennis called in the evening the parlor was always full and she was always vivaciously occupied with her guests chief among her attractions was counted her pet pretence of being interested in politics it was not a very serious pretence but being managed deftly and with a sense of its dramatic value animated many an hour which might otherwise have been dull in view of the social material which occasionally fell into her hands what should i do tredennis heard her say once if i knew nothing of politics there are times when they are my only salvation what should i have done last night with the new member from arkansas if i had not remembered that he was interested in the passage of the currency bill he is an excellent solid sensible creature we are frivolous aimless beings compared with him it is such men as he who do everything worth doing and being done but he is purely a politician and he has spent his life in a small provincial town where he has been a most important person and he cares as much for the doings of society and discussions of new novels and pictures as i do for the linseedoil marketif there is a linseedoil market when i began to ask him modest questions about his bill his face brightened at once and he became a selfrespecting and wellinformed personat ease with himself and with me and quite forgot his coat and his large boots which had been slowly and painfully dawning upon him a few moments before when he contrasted them with mr arbuthnots silk attire my very mistakes were a pleasure to him as they gave him an opportunity to say several things very well worth remembering he could not have told whether i was well or ill dressed but he detected my flimsiness in argument in a moment and gave me more information in half an hour than you scoffers could have given me in a week andwith much modesty of demeanorhe mentioned to senator vaughan in the course of the evening that i was a most intelligent woman arbuthnot and richard burst into the laughter which was always her applause upon such occasions you commented arbuthnot you are herodias daughter dancing for the head of john the baptist you are always dancing in a quiet and effective way for somebodys head whose would you like next how does mine strike you thank you said bertha would you really give it to me if i danced for you in my ablest manner and how do you think it would look on a charger there was more than one hardworked politician who after a day of exciting debate or wearisome battling with windmills found relief and entertainment in the pretty parlors some of those who came had known bertha in her girlhood and were friends of her father and with these it was the fashion to encourage her to political argument and affect the deepest confidence in her statements with a view to drawing forth all her resources these resources were varied and numerous and marked by a charming feminine daring and superiority to ordinary logic which were the delights of the senatorial mind why should i endeavor to convince you by being logical she said you have logicat least we hope soall day and sometimes all night in the senate and the house and even then you are not convinced of things it is not logic which governs you but a majority and that is what one should aspire to after allnot to be in the right but to be in the majority and i am sure ones arguments are much more untrammelled and brilliant for being illogical and if i convince you without logic i win a victory worth having it is like the triumph of an ugly woman who is called a beauty if i am pretty and you say so it is simply as if you said white is white blackness is dark but if i am not pretty and am ingenious enough to persuade you that i amthere is a triumph to be proud of it was nonsense but it was often sparkling nonsense whose very lightness was its charm and the rooms were rarely ever so gay and full of laughter as when there was among the guests a sprinkling of men no longer young who had come there to forget that they were jaded or secretly anxious or bitterly disappointed it pleases me to dance before some of them bertha said to arbuthnot i like to think i make them forget things for a little while if i can do nothing greater and wiser let me employ my one small accomplishment to the best advantage and do my harmless best to be both graceful and agile no one can persuade me that it can be a pleasant thing to engage in a handtohand conflict from three to eight months in the year and to sit day after day placidly endeavoring to confront men who differ with you on every point and who count the fact among their virtues and glory in it and watch you and listen to you with the single object of seizing an opportunity to prove in public that you are an imbecile or a falsifier or a happy combination of both when i reflect upon my own feelings she added with delightful navet when people are stupid and illmannered enough to differ with me i am filled with the deepest sympathy for the entire political body there is nothing so perfectly exasperating as to know people are differing with you and i know there is nothing so wearing to the mind an exciting debate in the senate was occupying public attention at this time and to her other duties and entertainments she added that of following it in its course she spent an hour or so at the capitol every day read the newspapers and collected evidence and information with an unflagging industry which would have been worthy of admiration if it had been inspired by any serious intention but she made no pretence of seriousness of intention she returned home from such visits with derisive little arguments jotted down in her notebook and little sketches of senatorial profiles adorning its pages and entertained a select audience with them in the eveningan audience which not infrequently included the political dignitaries themselves her manner would have been a mystery to tredennis if he had not remembered the professors words of warning and even with their memory in his mind he was often at a loss there was a restless eagerness to be amused in all she did and he felt that after all she was privately less successful in her efforts than she seemed he was at least relieved to find that he had but little to do in the role assigned him when arbuthnot appeared again he had entirely recovered his equilibrium and was unemotional selfpossessed occasionally flippant plainly cherishing at no time any intention of regarding himself seriously he did not sing his serenade again and when he sang at all committed himself to no outreaching warmth of feeling he rarely spoke to bertha alone and the old tendency to airy derision of each others weaknesses reasserted itself only once tredennis heard him address her with any degree of seriousness and this was in reference to her visits to the senate there had been an allnight session and it had been her whim to take part in it to the extent of sitting up until after midnight and she had returned home more tired than she was willing to confess arbuthnotwho with richard tredennis and a newspaper friend had been her companions in the dissipationremonstrated with her after the little supper they had on their arrival at the house bertha had left the table and was half reclining against a pile of cushions on the sofa and arbuthnot followed her and spoke in a somewhat lowered voice you are making a mistake in doing such things he said why will you keep it up its all nonsense you dont care for it really it is only one of your caprices you have not a particle of serious interest in it i have as much serious interest in it as i have in anything else she answered more indeed do you suppose i was not interested when senator ayres got up tonight to be immeasurably superior by the hour it elevated my mental plane and gave me food for reflection it filled me with a burning desire to be immeasurably superior too is he always immeasurably superior could he keep it up do you suppose in the bosom of his familywhen he is putting salt on his eggs at breakfast for instance and thinks no one is looking when he tries on a new hat does he do it with a lofty air of scorn and does he fall asleep and have the nightmare with coldly contemptuous condescension i dont mind mentioning to you that it is one of my favorite moods to be immeasurably superior it is such a good way when you cannot get what you want it disposes of your antagonists so simply and makes you feel so deserving but i never could keep it upbut that may be owing to weakness of character and the fact that i am only an unworthy imitator and lack the vigor to convince myself of my own genuineness oh i assure you i was very much interested indeed well said arbuthnot i might have expected you would say something of this kind it is your little way of evading matters you have a knack at it bertha looked down at the footstool on which her small shoe rested and then up at him with a quiet face yes it is my little way she answered i suppose i might count it among my few small accomplishments but dont you think it is as good a way as anyparticularly if it is the only way you have it is as good a way as any replied arbuthnot with the calmness of a sensible person addressing an attractive but obstinate child but you know it will not prevent my saying again what i said at first you are very foolish to tire yourself out for nothing and you will regret it when it is too late yes answered bertha if i regret it i shall naturally regret it when it is too late did you ever hear of any ones regretting a thing too early or just in time that is what regret meansthat one is too late arbuthnot sat down near her if you want to talk in that style he remarked in the most impartial manner i am entirely in the mood to listen now i have expressed my opinion it isnt worth much as my opinion but it is worth something as the truth and i am not afraid you will forget it but in the meantime until mrs dacre is in the mood to be escorted home you can pander to my lower nature by showing me the sketches you made of senator ayres and the speaker and the gentleman from iowa who was afraid to fall asleep the next morning calling with a newspaper she had wanted tredennis being handed into the room in which bertha usually spent her mornings at home found her lying upon a sofa and as she did not hear him enter he had the opportunity to stand for a few seconds and look at her while he did so she opened her eyes languidly and saw him and the thought which held his mind for the moment sprang to his lips and uttered itself i do not think you know he said how pale you are i do not want to know she answered with a rather tired little smile if it is unbecoming and i am sure it is but i will ask you to excuse my getting up he entirely passed over the first part of her reply as she had noticed he had a habit of passing in silence many of her speeches though she had not been able to decide why he did so you said he went on that when the season was over you intended to rest have you been doing it lately yes she answered with entirely unembarrassed readiness i have been very quiet indeed at this he was silent for a moment again and during the pause she lay and looked at him with an expression of curious interesttrying to make up her mind whether he did not reply because he felt himself not sufficiently ready of speech to meet her upon her own ground or whether his silence was a negative sign of disapprobation i am never tired when anything is going on she said at last that is the worst of it he replied oh nothe best of it she said and then she looked away from him across the room and added in a tone altogether different one does not want too much time on ones hands once or twice before he had seen this slight unconscious change fall upon her and without comprehending had been sharply moved by it but she always recovered herself quickly and she did so now i tried it once she said and it did not agree with me and since then i have occupied myself as richard says one must have an object and mine is to occupy myself you accomplish your end at least he remarked yes she answered i congratulate myself upon that upon the whole i do not know any one who is more fortunate than i am no other life would suit me half so well as the one i lead i am fond of gayety and change and freedom and i have all three richard is amiable the children are like him and there is nothing to interfere with my having my own way and amusing myself as i please i should be thoroughly unhappy if i could not have my own way to have it invariably is one of my laudable ambitions and as i always get it you see i have reason for being charmed with my lot you are very fortunate he said i am more than fortunate she answered then she broke into a little laugh it is rather odd she said that just before you came in i was lying thinking of the time you were in washington before and there came back to me something i said to you the night you gave me the heliotrope was it said tredennis what you said to me about being happy what she said you remember it i scarcely thought that you would remember it yes said tredennis i remember it i could not bear the thought of not being happy she went on it had never occurred to me that such a thing was a possibility until you said something which suggested it to me i recollect how it startled me it was such a new idea she stopped and lay for a moment silent and this morning suggested tredennis this morning she answered rather slowly though smiling as she spoke this morning as i said i decided that i had been very fortunate then he said you have been happy if i had not been she answered it would have been very curious i have never been interfered with in the least that is happiness indeed said tredennis just now he was reflecting upon the fact that all their conversations took the same turn and ended in the same way it mattered little how they began in all cases she showed the same aptitude for making her subject an entirely inconsequent source of amusement experience was teaching him that he need expect nothing else and even as he was thinking this he heard her laugh faintly again shall i tell you what i see in your face she saidwhat i see oftener than anything else i should be glad to know he replied i see that you are thinking that i am very much changed and that it is not for the better he paused a moment before he answered her and when he did so he spoke with his eyes fixed on the floor and slowly you are not the bertha i used to know he said but that i should have allowed myself to expect it shows simply that i am a dull unprogressive fellow it shows that you are very amiable and sanguine she said i should have been even more fortunate than it has been my fate to be if i had not changed in ten years think of the good fortune of having stood still so longof having grown no older no wiser no in a lower voice i am not the bertha you used to know but the next instant almost as soon as she had uttered the words she lifted her eyes with the daring little smile in them but i am very well preserved she said i am really very well preserved i am scarcely wrinkled at all and i manage to conceal the ravages of time and considering my years i am quite active i danced every dance at the ashworths ball with the kindly assistance of mr arbuthnot and his friends there were dbutantes in the room who did not dance half as often the young are not what they were in my generationthough probably the expiring energies of advanced age are flaming in the socket and she stopped suddenly letting her hands drop at her sides no she said again ii am not the bertha you used to knowand this morning i amtired enough to be obliged to admit it tredennis took a quick step toward her the hot blood showed itself under his dark skin what he had repressed in the last months got the better of him so far that he had no time to reflect that his stern almost denunciatory air could scarcely be ranked among ordinary conventionalities and that an ordinarily conventional expression of interest might have been more reasonably expected from him than a display of emotion denunciatory or otherwise can you expect anything else he said is your life a natural one is it a natural and healthy thing that every hour of it should contain its own excitement and that you should not know what simple normal rest means who could be blind to the change which has taken place in you during the last few weeks last night you were so tired and unstrung that your hand trembled when you lifted your glass to your lips arbuthnot told you then it was a mistake i tell you now that it is worseit is madness and crime he had not thought of what effect he would producehis words were his indignant masculine protest against her pallor and weakness and the pain he had borne in silence for so long it seemed however that he had startled her singularly she rose from her reclining posture slowly and sat upright and her hands trembled more than they had done the night before why she faltered why are you so angry that he returned bitterly means that i have no right to be angry of course well i am willing to admit iti have no right i am taking a liberty i dont even suggest that you are making a mistakeas mr arbuthnot did i am rough with you and say something worse yes she admitted you are very rough with me and she sat a few moments looking down at the floor her little hands trembling on her lap but presently she moved again she pushed one of the cushions up in the sofaarm and laid her cheek against it with a halfsigh of weariness relieved and a halfsmile go on she said after allsince i have reflectedi think i dont dislike it new things always please mefor a little whileand this is new no one ever spoke to me so before i wonder whether it was because i did not really deserve it or because people were afraid tredennis stopped in the walk he had begun and wheeled sharply about fronting her with his disproportionately stern gaze do you want to know why i do it he demanded i thinksince i have reflectedthat it is for the sake ofof the other bertha there was a slight pause of the other bertha she said after it in a low unsteady tone of the bertha who thought it an impossibility that she should be anything but happy he had not been prepared for her replies before but he was startled by what she did now she left her seat with a sudden almost impassioned action the cushion fell upon the floor she put her hand upon the mantel as if to support herself why did you say that she exclaimed i do not like it i do not like to be reminded that it is so long sincesince i was worth liking i suppose that is what it means why should you seem to accuse me when you say you speak for the sake of the other bertha am i so bad you have lived a quiet life because you liked it best i did not chance to like it best and so i have been gay i go out a great deal and am fond of the world but do i neglect my children and treat my husband badly richard is very happy and jack and janey and meg enjoy themselves and are very fond of me if i was careless of them and illtempered to richard and made my home unhappy you might accuse me it is the most mysterious thing to me but i always feel as if i was defending myself against you even when you only look at me and do not speak at all itit is a curious position i do not understand it and i do not like it her sudden change of mood was a revelation to tredennis he began to realize what he had dimly felt from the first that her mental attitude toward him was one of halfconscious defiance of his very thought of her he had not known why he had felt at times that his mere presence prompted her to present her worldly mocking little philosophies in their most incontrovertible and daring form and that it was her whim to make the worst of herself and her theories for his benefit he accused himself angrily in secret of overestimating his importance in her eyes and had reiterated impatiently that there was no reason why she should be at all specially aware of his existence when he was near her and it had been one of his grievances against himself that in spite of this every time they met he had felt the same thing and had resented and been puzzled by it but he had never before seen her look as she looked now one of his private sources of wonder had been the perfect selfcontrol which restrained her from exhibiting anything approaching a shadow of real feeling upon any subject he had seen her under circumstances which would have betrayed nine women out of ten into some slight display of irritation and she had always maintained the airy serenity of demeanor which deprived all persons and incidents of any weight whatever when they assumed the form of obstacles and her practicable little smile and calm impartiality of manner had never failed her he had heard her confess that it was her chief weakness to pride herself upon her quiet adroitness in avoiding all things unpleasant or emotional and upon her faithfulness to her resolve not to permit herself to be disturbed i have seen people who enjoyed their emotions she had said but i never enjoyed mine even when i was very young i definitely disliked them i am too selfconscious to give myself up to them simply if i had one i should think about it and analyze it and its effects upon me i should be saying all the time now i am hotnow i am cold and when it was over i should be tired not only of the feeling itself but of taking my own temperature and now she stood before him for the instant a new creatureweaker and stronger than he had dreamed it possible she could beher eyes bright with some strange feeling a spot of color burning on each pale cheek he was so bewildered and impressed that he was slow to speak and when he began felt himself at so severe a disadvantage that his consciousness of it gave his voice a rigid sound i do not think he began that i know what to say bertha stopped him there is no need that you should say anything she interrupted you cannot say anything which will disapprove of me more than your expression does and it is not you who should defend yourself but i but you were always severe i remember i felt that when i was only a child and knew that you saw all that was frivolous in me i was frivolous then as i am now i suppose i have a light naturebut i do not like to be reminded of it after all no one is harmed but myself and it would be charity in you to let me go my flippant way and not despise me too much bertha he answered it is not for me to say that i do not despise you he stood with his arms folded and looked down at her steadily it was very easy for her to place him at a disadvantage he knew nothing of feminine ways and means and his very masculine strength and largeness were against him if she gave him a wound he could not strike back or would not and in her last speech she had given him more wounds than one and they were rankling in his great breast fiercely and yet despite this it was not she who came off entirely victor after meeting his gaze with undeniable steadiness for a few seconds she turned away i told you she remarked with a persistence which was its own betrayer thatit was not necessary for you to say anything the next moment an impatient laugh broke from her she held up her unsteady hand that he might see it look she said why should i quarrel with you when you are right after all it is certainly time that i should rest when i am so absurdly unstrung as this and my very mood itself is a proof that something should be done with me for a minute or so i have actually been out of temper or something humiliatingly like it and i pride myself upon my temper you know and upon the fact that i never lose itor have not any to lose i must be worn out when a few perfectly truthful speeches will make me badtempered not that i object to it on moral grounds but it wounds my vanity to lose control of myself and now i have reached my vanity i am quite safe i will leave for fortress monroe tomorrow it would be better if you went to a quieter place he said thank you she answered i think it will be quiet enoughif i take the children and avoid the ballroom and am very decorous there seemed but little more for him to say she changed the subject by taking from the table the paper he had brought her and beginning to discuss its contents richard asked me to read the editorial and the letter from the washington correspondent she said he is more interested in the matter than i ever knew him to be in anything of the kind before he is actually making it one of his objects and flatters me by wanting to know my opinions and wishing me to share his enthusiasm she sat down to the table with the paper open before her and her hands lying clasped upon it have you read it she asked is it very clever can i understand it richard is so amiably sure i can it is well done replied tredennis and you will certainly understand it i am glad of that she said and sat still a moment with eyes lowered then she spoke rather suddenly richard is very good to me she said i ought to be very grateful to him it is just like him to feel that what i think of such things is worth hearing that is his affectionate generous way of what value could my shallow little fancies beand yet i think he really believes they should carry weight it is the most delightful flattery in the world it is your good fortune said tredennis to be able to say things well and with effect what she said with a halfsmile are you going to flatter me too no he answered grimly i am not going to flatter you you would find it a very good way she answered we should get along much better i assure you perhaps that is really what i have been resenting so longthat you show no facility for making amiable speeches i am afraid my facility lies in the opposite direction he returned i have recovered my equilibrium sufficiently not to admit that she said when he went away as he did shortly after she followed him to the door of the room was i very badtempered she said softly if i was suppose you forgive me before you go awayfor the sake of the other bertha he took the hand she offered him and looked down at it as it lay upon his big brown palm it was feverish and still a little unsteady though her manner was calm enough there is nothing to forgive he answered if there wasthis berthahe checked himself and ended abruptly i dont share your gift he said i said my say as bluntly and offensively as possible i suppose and you had a right to be angry it was all the worse done because i was in earnest so was ifor a moment she said that was the trouble and that was the end of it though even when he dropped her hand and turned away he was aware of her slender figure standing in the doorway and of a faint inexplicable shadow in the eyes that followed him he went back to his quarters bitterly out of humor with himself a nice fellow i am to talk to women he said i have not lived the life to fit me for it military command makes a man authoritative what right had i to seem to assume control over her shes not used to that kind of thing even from those who might be supposed to have the right to do it some one ought to have the rightthough that has gone out of fashion too i suppose something like a groan burst from him as he laid his forehead upon his hands resting his elbows on the table before him if a man loved her well enough he said he might do it and never hurt her but if she loved him perhaps there would be no need of it he had passed through many such brief spasms of resentful misery of late and he was beginning to acknowledge to himself that each one was stronger than the last he had contended his ground with steady persistence and with stubborn condemnation of his own weakness but he had lost it inch by inch until there were times when he felt his foothold more insecure than he could have believed possible a year ago why should i think of myself as a man who has lost something he was wont to say to himself bitterly and impatiently i had won nothing and might never have won it i had what would have been opportunity enough for a quicker temperament it is nothing but sentiment and even as he said it there would come back to him some tone of berthas voice some pretty natural turn of her head or figure as she sat or stood in the parlor with her small court around her and slight as the memory might be the sudden leap of his pulses had more power than his argument it was these trifles and their habit of haunting him which were harder to combat than all the rest his life had been so little affected by femininity that hers had a peculiarly persistent influence upon him he noted in her things he might have seen in scores of other women but half fancied belonged specially to herself the sweep and fall of her dress the perfume she used the soft ruffles of lace she was given to wearingeach of her little whims of adornment had its distinct effect and seemed in some mysterious way to have been made her own and to be shared with no other being other women wore flowers but what flowers had ever haunted him as he had been haunted by the knot of heliotrope and violets he had seen her tuck carelessly into the belt of her dress one day he had remembered them with a start again and again and each time they had bloomed and breathed their soft scent afresh it is all sentiment he persisted there would be nothing new in it toto that fellow arbuthnot for instance but it is new to me and i cant get rid of it somehow he had heard in his past stories of men who cherished as treasures for a lifetime a ribbon or a flower and had passed them by in undisturbed composure as incidents belonging only to the realms of wild romance but he had never in the course of his existence felt anything so keen as the inconsequent thrill which was the result of his drawing suddenly from his pocket one night on his return to his quarters after a romp with the children a small soft longwristed glove which it had been master jacks pleasure to hide there he had carried it sternly back the next morning and returned it to bertha but the act cost him an effort it had been like a living presence in his room the night before and he had slept less well because of it he had used his very susceptibility to these influences as an argument against his feeling there is nothing substantial in it he had saidnothing but what a man should find it easy to live down it is the folly of a boy intoxicated by the color of a girls cheek and the curl of her hair an old fellow who any day may find a sprinkling of gray in his scalplock should know better than to ponder over a pretty gown anda bunch of flowers and yet how one remembers them and today it was the little things as usual almost as much as the great ones the memory of the small bright room with its air of belonging to bertha and being furnished by bertha and strewed with appendages of bertha the slight figure in its white morning dress lying upon the sofa or standing between the foldingdoors the soft full knot of her hair as he saw it when she turned her head proudly away from himwhat trifles they were and yet if the room had been another and the pretty dress not white and the soft hair coiled differently everything might have had another effect and he might have been in another moodor so he fancied but he gave himself little leisure for the indulgence of his fancies and he made his usual effort to crush them down and undervalue them his groan was followed by a bitter laugh it is the old story he said i please myself by fancying that what would please me would make her happier arbuthnot would know better control would not suit her even the gentlest she has had her own way too long she is a small slight creature but it has been her lot to rule all her life in a small slight creatures way it is the natural sentimentality of an obstinate bigboned fellow to fancy she would thrive under it she would know better herself she would laugh the thought to scorn and be wise in doing it chapter x as he was saying it bertha had gone back to her sofa and sat there with the faint troubled smile still on her face he was angry she said and so was i it made him look very large but i was not at all afraid of himno positively i was not afraid of him and i am glad of that it is bad enough to remember that i was emotional and said things i did not mean to say it is not like me to say things i dont mean to say i must be more tired out than i knew ah there is no denying that he was in the right i will go away and stay some time it will be better in every way for some minutes she sat motionless her hands clasped lightly upon her knee her eyes fixed on a patch of sunlight on the carpet she did not move indeed until she heard the sound of her husbands foot upon the steps and his latchkey in the door he entered the room immediately afterward looking rather warm and a trifle exhilarated and all the handsomer in consequence ah bertha you are here he said i am glad you are not out how warm it is fancy having such weather early in may and three days ago we had fires what a climate there is something appropriate in it it is purely washingtonian and as uncertain asas senators theres a scientific problem for the signal service bureau to settledoes the unreliability of the climate affect the senatorial mind or does the unreliability of the senatorial mind affect the climate it sounds like a conundrum said bertha and the signal service bureau would give it up you have been walking too fast you foolish boy and have overheated yourself come and lie down on the sofa and rest she picked up the cushion which had fallen and put it in place for him there was always a pretty touch of maternal care for him in her manner he accepted her invitation with delighted readiness and when he had thrown himself at luxurious full length upon the sofa she took a seat upon its edge near him having first brought from the mantel a large japanese fan with which she stirred the air gently why were you glad that i had not gone out she said did you want me oh he answered i always want you you are the kind of little person one naturally wantsand it is a sort of relief to find you on the spot how nice this grand pasha business islying on cushions and being fannedand how pretty and cool you look in your white frills white is very becoming to you bertha bertha glanced down at the frills is it she said yes i think it is and this is a pretty gown richard well you said it was a sort of relief to find me on the spot did you say it because i am not always here when you want me do you think i go out too much does it ever seem to you that i neglect you a little and am not quite as domesticated as i should be should you behappierif i lived a quieter life and cared less for society there was a touch of unusual earnestness in her voice and her eyes were almost childishly eager as she turned them upon him happier he exclaimed gayly my dear child i could not easily be happier than i am how could i accuse you of neglecting me you satisfy me exactly in everything whose home is more charming and whose children are better cared for than mine it is not necessary for you to cook my dinner but you are the most delightful sauce to it in the world when you sit at the head of the table what more could a man want ii dont know she said slowly but i could not bear to think that i was not what i should be in my own home it has always seemed to me that there could be no bad taste and bad breeding so inexcusable as the bad taste and bad breeding of a woman who is disagreeable and negligent in her own house one has no need to put it on moral grounds eventhe bad taste of it is enough i dont think i could ever be disagreeable or that you could think me so but it struck me dont let it strike you again he interrupted amiably it has struck me that there were never two people so well suited to each other as our married life has proved us to be i dont mind admitting now that once or twice during the first year i thought that you were a little restless or unhappy but it was when you were not well and it was quite natural and it all passed away and i dont think it would occur to any one in these days to ask whether you are happy or not bertha was playing with his watchchain and she separated one charm upon it from another carefully as she answered him in a soft natural voice there is a legend you know she said that the first year of ones marriage is always uncomfortable oh mine was not uncomfortable he returnedit was delightful as all the other years have been butjust occasionally you knowthere was awell a vague somethingwhich never troubles me now i must have behaved badly in some way said bertha smiling or it would not have troubled you then and she stooped and kissed him on the forehead i have a horrible conviction she said after it that i was a vixen was i a vixen perhaps i was a vixen and never suspected it and no one suspected it but you poor boy why didnt you return me to papa with thanks well as you have kept me so long you must make the best of me and it is very nice and polite in you to pretend that i am satisfactory and dont make you wretched and your hearth a wilderness by being a hollow worldling you are exactly what i want he responded i am a hollow worldling myself if i were a bricklayer my idea of domestic bliss might be to spend my evenings at home and watch you mending stockings or knitting or doing something of that sort but even then i am afraid i should tire of it and secretly long for something more frivolous for something as frivolous as i am she said with a nervous little laugh quite as frivolous richardreally but i know you will say so you are always good to me and spoil me no i am not he answered it is simply true that you always please me it is true i am a rather easynatured fellow but i know plenty of goodnatured fellows whose wives are terribly unsatisfactory you are clever and pretty and dont make mistakes and you are never exacting nor really out of humor and it is impossible for me to tire of you really she said quickly is that last true entirely true well she commented the color rising in her cheek that is a good deal for ones husband to say that is a triumph it amounts to a certificate of character well he admitted after a seconds reflection upon the whole it is i know more husbands than one but no matter i was going to add that long agobefore i met you you knowmy vague visions of matrimonial venture were always clouded by a secret conviction that when i had really passed the rubicon and had time for reflection things might begin to assume a rather serious aspect and i said bertha a little thoughtfully have never assumed a serious aspect never he replied exultingly you have been a perfect success there is but one bertha and her husband is her prophet she added you are very good to me richard and it is entirety useless for you to deny it because i shall insist upon it withwith wild horses if necessary which figure of speech i hope strikes you as being strong enough she was herself againneither eager nor in earnest ready to amuse him and to be amused waving her fan for his benefit touching up his cushions to make him more comfortable and seeming to enjoy her seat on the edge of his sofa very much indeed do you know she said at length what i have thought of doing i have thought quite seriously of going in a day or so to fortress monroe with the children she felt that he started slightly and wondered why are you surprised she asked would you rather i would not go no he answered if you think it would be better for you you are tired and the weather is very warm buthave you set any particular day no she said i should not do that without speaking to you first well he returned then suppose you do not go this week i have halfinvited senator planefield and macpherson and ashley to dinner for thursday is it because you want them to talk about the bill she said how interested you are in it richard why is it railroads never struck me as being particularly fascinating material it seems to me that amateur enthusiasm would be more readily awakened by something more romantic and a little intangiblea tremendous claim for instance which would make some poor struggling creatures fabulously rich i am always interested in claims the wilder they are the better and it invariably delights me when the people get them through to the utter consternation of the government it has faintly dawned upon me on two or three such occasions that i have no political morality and i am afraid it is a feminine failing it is not a masculine one of course so it must be feminine i wish you had chosen a claim richard instead of a railroad i am sure it would have been far more absorbing the railroad is quite absorbing enough he answered and there is money enough involved in it just think of those westoria lands and what they will be worth if the road is carried through themand as to romance what could be more romantic than the story attached to them but i dont know the story said bertha what is it it is a very effective story he replied and it was the story which first called my attention to the subject there was a poor visionary fellow whose name was westor to whom a large tract of this land came suddenly as an inheritance from a distant relative he was not practical enough to make much use of it and he lived in the house upon it in a desolate shiftless way for several years when he had the illfortune to discover coal on the place i say it was illfortune because the discovery drove him wild he worked and starved and planned and scraped together all the money he could to buy more land keeping his secret closely for some time when he could do no more he came to washington and began to work for a railroad which would make his wealth available his energy was a kind of frenzy they say he neither ate slept nor rested and really managed to get the matter into active movement he managed to awaken a kind of enthusiasm and for a short time was a good deal talked of and noticed he was a big rawboned young westerner and created a sensation by his very uncouthness in its connection with the wildly fabulous stories told about his wealth he had among his acquaintances a man of immense influence and at this mans house he met the inevitable young woman she amused herself and he fell madly in love and became more frenzied than ever it was said that she intended to marry him if he was successful and that she made his poor helpless life such an anguish to him that he lost his balance entirely there came a time when he was entirely penniless and his prospects were so unpromising and his despair so great that he went to his boardinghouse one day with the intention of killing himself and just as he finished loading his pistol a letter was handed in to him and when he opened it he found it contained the information that another distant relative affected by the rumors concerning him had left him twenty thousand dollars he laid his pistol in a drawer and left the house to begin again he had an interview with his ladylove and one with his man of influence and at the end of a few weeks had bought more land and parted in some mysterious way with the rest of his money and was on the very eve of success poor fellow poor fellow said bertha oh dont say that any thing went wrong it would not be half so dramatic a story if everything had gone right said richard with fine artistic appreciation you could never guess what happened everything he did seemed to work to a miracle every train was laid and every match applied on the day that was to decide his fate he did not go near the capitol but wandered out and took his place on one of the seats in the park which faced the house at which the young woman was visiting and sat there a lank unshorn haggard figure either staring at her window or leaning forward with his head upon his hands people actually heard of his being there and went to look at him and came away without having dared to address him the young woman looked out from behind her blind and was furious and even sent word to him to go away but he would not go and only glared at this man who was sent to him with the message he sat there until night and then staggered across and rang at the bell and inquired for the man of influence and was toldwhat do you suppose he was told oh cried bertha desperately i dont know he was told that he was occupied occupied echoed bertha richard clasped his hands comfortably and gracefully behind his head thats the climax of the story he said he was occupiedin being married to the young woman of whom he had been greatly enamored for some time and who had discreetly decided to marry him because he had proved to her that the other mans bill could not possibly pass it could not pass because he had the energy and influence to prevent its doing so and he prevented its passing because he knew he would lose the young woman otherwise at least that is the story and i like the version i dont like it said bertha it makes me feel desperate what it made the poor fellow feel richard went on nobody ever found out as he said nothing at all about it on hearing the truth he sat down on the steps for a few minutes and then got up and went away he went to his boardinghouse and had an interview with his landlady who was a kindhearted creature and when she saw him began to cry because his bill had not passed but when she spoke of it she found he knew nothing of it he had never asked about it and he said to her oh that doesnt matterit isnt of any consequence particularly im only troubled about your bill i havent money enough to pay it ive only enough to take me home and youll have to let me give you the things i have in my room for pay i only want one thing out of thereif youll let me go and get it i wont take anything else so she let him go and stood outside his door and cried while he went in and took something out of a drawer richard cried bertha yes said richard he actually found a use for it after allbut not in washington he went as far as he could by rail and then he tramped the rest of the way to westoria they say it must have taken him several days and that his shoes were worn to shreds and his feet cut and bruised by the walk when he reached the house it had been shut up so long that the honeysuckle which climbed about it had grown across the door and he could not have got in without breaking or pushing it aside people fancied that at first he thought of going in but that when he saw the vine it stopped himslight barrier as it was they thought he had intended to go in because he had evidently gone to the door and before he turned away had broken off a spray of the flowers which was just beginning to bloom he held it crushed in his hand when they found him two or three days later he had carried it back to the edge of the porch and had sat downand finished everythingwith the only thing he had brought back from washingtonthe pistol how does that strike you as the romance of a railroad bertha clenched her hand and struck her knee a fierce little blow richard she said if that had happened in my day i should have turned lobbyist and every thought and power and gift i had would have been brought to bear to secure the passage of that bill richard laugheda pleased but slightly nervous laugh suppose you bring them to bear now he suggested there would not be any reason for my doing it now she answered but i shall certainly be interested richard laughed again by jove he said the poor devils who own it would think there was reason enough who owns it several people who speculated in it because the railroad was talked of again and on a more substantial footing it fell to westors only living relation who was an ignorant old woman and sold it without having any idea of its real value her impression was that if she kept it it would bring her illluck there is no denying that it looks just now like a magnificent speculation and that poor fellow said berthathat poor fellow that poor fellow richard interposed yesbut his little drama is over you know and perhaps there are others going on quite as interesting if we only knew them it is very like you berthaand it is very adorable touching her shoulder caressingly with his hand to lose sight entirely of the speculation and care only for the poor fellow you insist upon having your little drama under all circumstances yes she admitted i confess that i like my little drama and i have not a doubt thatas i said beforei could not have lived in the midst of that without turning lobbyistwhich is certainly not my vocation not your vocation said richard you would make the most successful little lobbyist in the world bertha turned upon him an incredulous and rather bewildered smile i she exclaimed i yes you well she replied after a seconds pause given to inspection of him this is open derision it is perfectly true was his response and it is true for good reasons your strength would lie in the very fact that you would be entirely unlike your colaborers in the field you have a finished little air of ingenuousness which would be your fortune she shook her head with a pretty gesture no she said i am very clever and of course you cannot help observing it but i am not clever enough for that he gave her a glance at once curious and admiring by jove he exclaimed it is my belief you are clever enough for anything richard she said shall i tell you a secret yes and you will bury it in the innermost recesses of your soul and never divulge it certainly and brace yourself for a shock when i reveal it to you yes well here it is my cleverness is like what youand two or three other most charming peopleare good enough to call my prettiness it is a delusion and a snare come he said you are attempting to deceive me no she answered i am attempting to undeceive you i am not really pretty or clever at all and it has been the object of my life to prevent its being detected she opened her eyes in the most charmingly ingenuous manner and nodded her head i discovered it myself she said long agocomparatively early in lifeand resolved to conceal it and nothing but the confidence i repose in you would have induced me to mention it well he replied you have concealed it pretty well under the circumstances ah she said but you dont know what a burden it is to carry about and what subterfuges i have to resort to when i seem on the very verge of being found out there is larry for instancei am almost sure that larry suspects me especially when i am tired or chance to wear an unbecoming gown you know how particular i am about my gowns well that is my secret i havent an attraction really but my gowns and my spirits and my speciousness the solitary thing i do feel i have reason to pride myself on is that i am bold enough to adapt my gowns in such a way as to persuade you that i am physically responsible for the color and shape of them you fancy you are pleased with me when you are simply pleased with some color of which i exist on the reflection or glow in nine cases out of ten it is merely a matter of pale blue or pink and silk or crpe or cashmere and in the tenth it is nothing but spirits and speciousness oh he said there is no denying that you would make a wonderful lobbyist well she answered rising and going to the table to lay her fan down when you invest largely in westoria lands and require my services in that capacity i will try to distinguish myself i think i should like to begin with the westoria lands if i begin at all but in the meantime i must go upstairs and talk to the seamstress about janeys new white dresses you are cool enough now to enjoy your lunch when the bell rings and you shall have some iced tea if you would like it i would like it very well and by the by did tredennis bring the clarion as he said he would yes it is here and she handed it to him from the table you can read it while i am upstairs have you read it he said opening it and turning to the editorial not yet i shall read it this afternoon yes do the facts are put very forcibly andyou will decide not to go to fortress monroe just yet she hesitated a moment but he did not observe it i must be here when your friends dine with you of course she said and a week or even a little more does not make so much difference after all it may be quite cool again tomorrow and she went out of the room and left him to his paper chapter xi it was two weeks after this that arbuthnot sauntering down the avenue in a leisurely manner on his way from his office and having a fancy to stroll through lafayette park which was looking its best in its spring bravery and bloom on entering the iron gateway found his attention attracted by the large figure of colonel tredennis who was approaching him from the opposite direction walking slowly and appearing deeply abstracted it cannot be said that mr arbuthnot felt any special delight in the prospective encounter he had not felt that he had advanced greatly in colonel tredennis good opinion and had it must be confessed resigned himself to that unfortunate condition of affairs without making any particular effort to remedy ithis private impression being that the result would scarcely be likely to pay for the exertion taking into consideration the fact that he was constitutionally averse to exertion why he had said to bertha should i waste my vital energies in endeavoring to persuade a man that i am what he wants when perhaps i am not there are scores of people who will naturally please him better than i do and there are people enough who please me better than he does let him take his choiceand it is easy enough to see that i am not his choice what is he thinking of now i wonder he said a vague plan for turning into another walk flitting through his mind are his friends the piutes on the warpath and actively engaged in dissecting agents or is he simply out of humor he is not thinking of where he is going he will walk over that nursemaid and obliterate the twinsyes i thought so the colonel had verified his prophecy and aroused from his reverie by the devastation he had caused he came to a standstill with a perplexed and distressed countenance i beg your pardon arbuthnot heard him say in his great deep voice i hope i did not hurt you i had forgotten where i was and he stooped and set the nearest twin on its feet on the grass and then did the same thing for the other upon which both stood and stared at him and not being hurt at all having merely rolled over on the sod were in sufficiently good spirits to regard with interest the fact that he was fumbling in his coatpocket for something the article in question was a package of bonbons which he produced and gave to the nearest toddler here he said i bought these for another little girl but i can get some more they are all right he added turning to the mulatto girl whose admiration of his martial bearing revealed itself in a most lenient grinthey wont hurt them they can eat them all without being harmed and then he turned away and in doing so caught sight of arbuthnot and somewhat to the surprise of the latter advanced toward him at once with the evident intention of joining him it is rather a curious thing that i should meet you here he said i was thinking of you when i met with the catastrophe you saw just now do you often go home this way not very often arbuthnot replied sometimes when things look as they do now with a gesture indicating the brilliant verdure everything looks very fresh and luxuriant said tredennis the season is unusually far advanced i suppose it is sometimes a great deal too warm to be pleasant it will be decidedly warmer every day said arbuthnot we shall have a trying summer the president is going out to the soldiers home next weekwhich is earlier than usual there are only two or three of the senators families left in the city the exodus began weeks ago such weather as we have had the last few days said the colonel with his slight frown must be very exhausting to those who are not strong and who have gone through a gay winter the best thing such people can do responded arbuthnot dryly is to make their way to the mountains or the sea as soon as possible most of them do tredennis reply was characteristically abrupt mrs amory does not he said no answered arbuthnot and he looked at the end of his cigar as if he saw nothing else why doesnt she demanded tredennis she ought to said arbuthnot with calm adroitness ought to tredennis repeated she should have gone months ago sheshe is actually ill why in heavens name does she stay she told me two weeks since that she was going to fortress monroe or some such place she had better go to a new england farmhouse and wear a muslin gown and swing in a hammock said arbuthnot you see that as well do you said the colonel why dont you tell her so and having said it seemed to pull himself up suddenly as if he felt he had been unconsciously impetuous arbuthnot laughed his smile had died completely away however when he gave his side glance at his companions face a moment later she was quite serious in her intention of going away two weeks ago he said she told me so nothing but richards dinnerparty prevented her departure in the first place he spoke in an entirely noncommittal tone but there was a touch of interest in his quiet glance at tredennis you dined there with planefield and the rest didnt you he added yes i didnt richard was kind enough to invite me but i should only have been in the way he paused an instant and then added without any change of tone or manner i know nothing of the westoria lands was it necessary that you should said tredennis i did not oh arbuthnot answered i knew they would discuss them and the bill as it pleases amory to be interested in them just now i remember that the matter was referred to several times said tredennis even mrs amory seemed to know a good deal of it a good deal said arbuthnot in favor of the bill yes tredennis answered she had been reading up it appeared she said some very good things about itin a laughing way why does she waste her time and strength on such folly he added hotly whywhy is she allowed to do it the new england farm would be better for her just now said arbuthnotagain adroitly why should amory waste his time upon it the colonel went on though that is his affair of course and not mine they had reached the gate by this time but they did not pass through it finding themselves near it they turnedas if by mutual consent and yet without speaking of doing sointo the walk nearest them it was after taking a few steps in silence down this path that colonel tredennis spoke again abruptly when i was thinking of you just before we met he said i was thinking of you in connection withwith the amorys he knew the statement had a blunt enough sound and his recognition of it irritated him but he was beginning to be accustomed to his own bluntness of statement and at any rate this led him to the point he meant to reach arbuthnots reply was characteristic it was not blunt at all and had an air of simple directness which was the result not only of a most creditable tact and farsightedness but of more private good feeling and sincerity than he was usually credited with i am always glad to be thought of in connection with the amorys he said and i am glad that it is perfectly natural that i should be connected with them in the minds of their friends there has been a very close connection between us for several years and i hope they have found as much pleasure in it as i have tredennis recognized the tact even if he was not aware of the good feeling and farsightedness the obstacles had been removed from his path and the conversation had received an air of unconstrained naturalness which would make it easier for him to go on then he said there will be no need to explain what i mean by saying that i was thinking specially of your interest in mrs amory herselfand your influence over her i wish my influence over her was as strong as my interest in her was his companions reply my interest in her is a sincere enough feeling and a deep one there is every reason why it should be ibegan the coloneliand then he stopped your interest in her arbuthnot went on seeming to enjoy his cigar very much is even a more natural feeling than minethough i scarcely think it can be stronger it is not a matter of relationship so muchas a rule relationship does not amount to a great dealbut the fact that you knew her as a girl and feel toward the professor as you do must give her a distinct place in your mind it is a feeling said tredennis which disturbs me when i see that she is in actual danger through her own want of care for herself are women always so reckless is it a washington fashion why should she forget that her children need her care if she does not choose to think of herself is that a washington fashion too you were thinking said arbuthnot and flattering me in doing it that what i might say to her on the necessity of leaving the city might have some little effect yes tredennis answered and if not upon herself upon amory he is always ready to listen to you arbuthnot was silent for some moments he was following a certain train of thought closely and rapidly but his expression did not betray him at all she would have gone two weeks ago he said quietly next if it had not been for richards engagements with planefield and the rest he has had them at his house two or three times since then and they have made little parties to mount vernon and arlington and great falls planefield is a ladys man and he finds mrs amory very charming what exclaimed tredennis with intolerant haughtinessthat coarse fellow he isnt a nice fellow said arbuthnot but he wont show his worst side to herany more than he can help he is a very powerful fellow they say here he stopped they had reached their gateway again ill do what i can he said it wont be much perhaps but i will do what i can i fully appreciate the confidence you showed in speaking to me i fully appreciate the manner in which you listened to what i had to say said tredennis and somewhat to arbuthnots surprise he held out his hand to him chapter xii instead of making his way home at once arbuthnot turned up the side of the street on which the amorys house stood as he reached the house the door was opened and a man came out and walked down the steps he was a man with a large frame a darkly florid complexion and heavily handsome features as he passed arbuthnot he gave him a glance and a rather grudging bow which expressed candidly exactly the amount of pleasure he derived from encountering him bertha was in the parlor alone when arbuthnot entered he found her standing in the middle of the room looking down at the roses on her gayly painted fan and evidently not seeing them well he began by way of greeting i hope you have been enjoying yourselfwith your senators she looked up and made a quick eager little movement toward him as if she was more glad to see him than usual ah she exclaimed i believe i was wishing you would come thank you he said but the compliment would be greater if you were sure of it i think i am sure of it now you are here she answered though i dont know at all why i wanted youunless it was to tell you that i have not been enjoying myself in the leastwith my senators i am delighted to hear it he replied nothing could please me better they are always too numerous and lately one is continually meeting them on the steps and being scowled at she shut her fan quickly with a slight frown why scowled at she said that would be absurd enough absurd or not he laughed it is true but notwithstanding his laugh there was no change in her face he did not see they had seated themselves by this time and bertha was looking at her fan again and opening and shutting it slowly they are not my senators she said they are richards andi am getting a little tired of them though i should not like to tell him so when it is warm as it is today i am very tired of them i should not think it at all improbable remarked arbuthnot dryly it has struck me that it would be necessary for the mercury to be several degrees below zero before you would find the one who went out just now for instance especially exhilarating he is not exhilarating at all she said richard likes him she added a moment afterward i dont know exactly why but he really seems to admire him they are quite intimate i think the acquaintance began through some law business he gave him in connection with the westoria lands i have tried to like him on richards account you must remember she said with a smile i first tried to like you on richards account i hope you succeeded better than you will with planefield he said i might succeed with him if i persevered long enough she answered the difficulty lies in the perseverance richard says i would make a good lobbyist but i am sure i should not i could not be persistently amiable and entertaining to people who tired me dont deplore your deficiencies until it becomes necessary for you to enter the profession said arbuthnot i dont like to hear you speak of it he added with a touch of sharpness i dont deplore them said bertha and it is only one of my little jokes but if the fortunes of the westoria lands depended on me i am afraid they would be a dismal failure as they dont depend on you he remarked doesnt it occur to you that you might as well leave them to senator planefield i must confess it has presented itself to me in that light it is rather odd she said in a tone of reflection that though i have nothing whatever to do with them they actually seem to have detained me in town for the last two weeks it is quite time you went away said arbuthnot i know that she answered and i feel it more every day she raised her eyes suddenly to his laurence she said i am not well dont tell richard but i think i am not well at all ii am restless and nervousandand morbid i am actually morbid things trouble me which never troubled me before sometimes i lose all respect for myself you know i always was rather proud of my selfcontrol i am not quite as proud of it as i used to be about two weeks ago ii positively lost my temper he did not laugh as she had been halfafraid he would his manner was rather quiet on the contraryit was as if what she said struck him as being worth listening to with some degree of serious attention though his reply was not exactly serious i hope you had sufficient reason he said no she answered i had no reason at all which makes it all the more humiliating i think i have been rather irritable for a month or two i have allowed myself toto be disturbed by things which were really of no consequence and i have taken offence at things andandresented trifles and it was the merest trifle which made me lose my temperyes actually lose my temper and say what i did not intend to say in the most open and abject manner what could be more abject than to say things you did not intend to say you know i never was given to that kind of thing no he responded it cannot be said that you were it was soso revolting to me after it was over she went on that it seemed to make me more weakminded than ever when you once give way to your emotions it is all going downhillyou do it again and again i never did it before but i have been on the verge of doing it two or three times since dont go any farther than the verge he said i dont intend to she answered i dont like even the verge i resent it with all my strength i should like to invent some kind of horrible torture to pay myself forfor what i did he was watching her very closely but she was not aware of it she had arrested his attention completely enough by this time and the fact made itself evident in his intent and rather startled expression i hope it was nothing very serious he said it was serious enough for me she replied nobody else was hurt but it was serious enough for methe mere knowing that for a few minutes i had lost my hold on myself i didnt like iti didnt like it there was an intensity in her manner in her voice in her face in her very figure itself which was curiously disproportionate to her words she leaned forward a little and laid her small clenched hand upon her knee in all my life she said slowlyin all my life i have never had a feeling which was as strong as myself i have been that fortunate i have been angry but never so angry that i could not seem perfectly still and calm i have been happy but never so happy that i could not have hidden it if i chose i have been unhappyfor a moment or sobut never so unhappy that i had the horrible anguish of being found out i am not capable of strong real emotions i am too shallow andand light i have been light all my life and i will be light until the end only the children could make me suffer really she said after itonly the children and all women are like that through janey or jack or meg my heart could be torn in two if they were in pain or badly treated or taken from methat is nothing but common nature but nothing else could hurt me so that i should cry outnothing and nobodynot even richard she stopped herself and opened her fan again there she exclaimed why did i say so much then and say it so vehemently as if it was of consequence nothing is of consequencenothing nothing and she laughed and rose and began to take up and set down again some trifles on the mantel arbuthnot still watched her no he said you are quite right nothing is of consequence really and the sooner one learns that the better for ones peace of mind the worst pain you could have to bear could not last you more than a few score years and you would get used to it in that time the greatest happiness you could yearn for would not last any longer and you would get tired of it in time too tired of it she echoed one could tire of anything in threescore years and ten how tired one must be of ones self before it is overhow tired how tired and she threw up her hands in a sudden desperate gesture no he answered in a tone whose level coolness was a forcible contrast to her own not necessarily if one doesnt expect too much if we take things for what they are worth and dont let ourselves be deceived by them there is plenty of rational entertainment to be had by the way we maynt like it quite as well as what we set out with expecting but we can manage to subsist upon it i hope i am logical i know i am not eloquent he said it bitterly no she returned without looking at him you are not eloquent perhaps but you are speaking the truthand i like to hear it i want to hear it it is good for me it is always good for people to hear the truth the bare unvarnished unadorned truth go on if i go on he said still bitterly i shall begin to drag myself in and i dont care to do it it is natural that i should feel the temptation i never knew the man yet who could talk in this strain and not drag himself in drag yourself in as much as you like she said even fiercely and be an example to me i should be example enough if i said all i could he replied am i a happy man she turned and for a moment they looked into each others eyes his were stern hard and miserable no she cried out you are not no one is happy in the world and she dropped her face upon her hands as she leaned upon the mantel i might have been happier if i had begun right i suppose he said begun she repeated does any one ever begin right one ought to begin at the end and go backward and then one might make something of it all i didnt make much of it he said i was not as wise as you i began with emotions and follies and firesand the rest of it and the enjoyment i derived from them was scarcely what i anticipated it would be the emotions didnt last and the follies didnt pay and the fires burnt outand that was the worst of all and they always doand that is worse still it is in the nature of things look at that grate pointing to it it looked different a week ago when we had a rainy night and sat around it we could have burned ourselves at it then if we had been feebleminded enough to try it we couldnt do it now and yet a few days ago it was hot enough the fire has burned out and even the ashes are gone she stooped down picked up her fan and reseated herself upon the sofa she did not look quite like herselfher face was very pale but for the two red spots tredennis had seen on her cheeks when her display of feeling had startled him but all at once a change had taken place in her manner there was a sort of deadly stillness in it we are a long way from my temper she saida long way yes he replied about as far as we could get in the space of time allowed us and we have been a trifle emotional and it was my fault she continued isnt it time i went somewhere cool and bracing i think you must admit it is yes he said it is time take my advice and go ill go she said steadily the day after tomorrow and ill not go to fortress monroe ill go into the mountains of virginiato a farmhouse i know of where one has forests and silence and natureand nothing else ill take the children and live outofdoors with them and read to them and talk to them and sew for them when i want anything to do i always was happy and natural when i was sewing and doing things for them i like it living in that simple natural way and having the children with me will rest and cure me if anything will on earth the children alwaysthe children she stopped and sat perfectly still her voice had broken and she had turned her face a little away arbuthnot got up he stood a moment as he always did before going but he did not look directly at her though he did not seem to avoid her in his glance it is the best thing you can do he saidthe very best thing you will be thoroughly rested when you come home and that is what you need i will go now i hear richard and i want to speak to him alone and by the time the door opened and richard stood on the threshold he had reached him and turned him around throwing his arm boyishly over his shoulder you are just in time he said take me into the museum or the library i want to have a confidential chat with you and they went out together chapter xiii the following day richard presented himself to tredennis in the morning looking a little disturbed and scarcely in such excellent spirits as usual bertha and the children are going away tomorrow he said and if you have no other engagement you are to come and dine with us this evening and say goodby i have no other engagement tredennis answered i shall be glad to come they are really going to fortress monroe tomorrow richard threw himself into a chair with a rather discontented air they are not going to fortress monroe at all he said they are going to bury themselves in the mountains of virginia it is a queer fancy of berthas i think she is making a mistake she wont like it really when she tries it if she needs rest said tredennis certainly the mountains of virginia the mountains of virginia interrupted richard were not made for bertha she will tire of them in a week i wish she would not go he said with the faintest possible touch of petulance you will miss her very much of course said tredennis oh yes i shall miss her i always miss herand i shall miss her specially just now just now said tredennis oh said richard straightening himself somewhat and clearing his slightly knitted brow i was only thinking of two or three plans which had halfformed themselves in my mind i was looking at it from a selfish point of view which i had no right to do i suppose things might waituntil she comes back are you going with her said tredennis i exclaimed richard no i could not do that my business would not allow of it i have more than usual on hand just now i shall run down to see them once a week if possible i must confess with a laugh that i could not make up my mind to three months of it bertha knows that taking all things into consideration he bore the prospect of his approaching loneliness very well he soon began to speak of other matters and before he took his departure had quite recovered his usual gayety as he talked tredennis regarded him with some curiosity he has a fortunate temperament he was thinking he would have been happy if she had remained but he is not unhappy because she goes there are men who would take it less lightlythough after all he is the one to be envied tredennis did not feel that he himself was greatly to be envied he had said that she ought to go and had been anxious and unhappy because she had not gone but now that she was going he was scarcely happier there were things he should miss every day as he remembered them he knew he had not allowed himself to admit what their value had been to him the very fact that they had not been better friends made it harder from the first he had been aware that a barrier stood between them and in the interview which had revealed to him something of its nature he had received some sharp wounds there was truth in what she said he had often pondered since though she put it in a womans way i have resented what she has said and done often enough and have contrasted it bitterly with what i rememberedgod knows why i had no right to do it and it was all folly but i did it and made myself wretched through itand she saw the folly and not the wretchedness but now that her presence would no longer color and animate the familiar rooms he realized what their emptiness would be he could not endure the thought of what it would be to go into them for the first time and sit alone with richardno bright figure moving before them or sitting in its chair by the table or the window or the hearth the absence of the very things which had angered and disturbed him would leave a blank it would actually be a wretchedness to see no longer that she often chose to be flippant and mocked for mere mockings sake what he said savagely am i beginning to care for her very faults then it is best that she should go but his savageness was not against bertha but against himself and his weakness when he arrived at the house in the evening he found bertha in the parlor with jack and janey who were to be allowed to share the farewell dinner as she advanced to meet him with a child on either side he was struck by certain changes which he observed in her dress and manner she wore a dark simple gown her hair was dressed a trifle more closely and plainly than usual and there was no color about her when she gave him her hand and stood with the other resting on jacks shoulder her eyes uplifted to his own he was bewildered by a feeling that he was suddenly brought face to face with a creature quite strange to him he could not have said that she was actually cold and reserved but there was that in the quiet of her manner which suggested both reserve and coldness i have allowed the children to stay downstairs she said and they are to dine with us if they will be good they wished very much to see as much of you as possibleas it will be some time before they returnand i think they will be quiet if you will seat one on each side of me said tredennis i will keep them quiet you are very kind she answered but i should scarcely like to do that and then she returned to her seat by the window and he sat opposite her on the end of a sofa with janey leaning against his knee you are not going to fortress monroe he said no she replied i am going to the virginia mountains i should think that would be better he said putting an arm around janey i thought so she answered upon reflection i am not as strong as i should be and i think i dislike illhealth even more than most people do she held jacks hand and spoke in a quiet tone of common thingsof her plans for the summer of the children of richard and tredennis listened like a man in a dream missing the color and vivacity from her manner as he had known he should miss her presence from the rooms when she was gone tell uncle philip something of what we are going to do she said to jack tell him about the hammocks and the spades we are to dig with and the books we are to live out of doors and enjoy ourselves immensely she added with a faint smile mamma is going to play with us every day said jack triumphantly and we are going to lie in our hammocks while she reads to us and tells us stories and there will be no parties and no company added janey only we are to be the company and jack is to take care of me said bertha because i am growing old and he is so big jack regarded her dubiously you havent any wrinkles he said yes i have jack she answered but they dont show and a little laugh broke from her and she let her cheek rest against his dark lovelocks for a moment in a light caress glancing up at the colonels face at this juncture janey found cause in it for serious dissatisfaction she raised her hand and drew a small forefinger across his forehead uncle philip she said you are bad again the black marks have come back and you are quite ugly and you promised you would try not to let them come any more i beg your pardon janey he answered and then turned to bertha she does not like my black face he said and no wonder i am rather an unfortunate fellow to have my faults branded upon me so plainly that even a child can see them there was a touch of bitterness in the words and in his manner of uttering them bertha answered him in a soft level voice you are severe upon yourself she said it is much safer to be severe upon other people it was rather cruel but she did not object to being cruel there come to most women moments when to be cruel is their only refuge against themselves and others and such a moment had come to her in looking back upon the evening when it was over the feeling that it had been unreal was stronger in tredenniss mind than any other it was all unreal from beginning to endthe halfhour before dinner when arbuthnot and richard and the professor came in and bertha stood near her fathers chair and talked to him and tredennis holding janey on his knee and trying to answer her remarks lucidly was aware only of the presence of the dark slender figure near him and the strange quiet of the low voice the dinner itself during which richard was in the most attractive mood and the professor was rather silent and arbuthnots vivacity was a little fitful at first and afterward seemed to recover itself and rise to the occasion while bertha with jack on one hand and janey on the other cared for their wants and answered richards sallies and aided him in them and yet was not herself at all but a new being and you think said the professor later in the evening when they had returned to the parlorsyou think that you will like the quiet of the mountains i think it will be good for me she answered and the children will like it she will not like it at all said richard she will abhor it in ten days and she will rush off to fortress monroe and dance every night to make up for her temporary mental aberration no she will not said arbuthnot she has made preparations to enjoy her seclusion in its dramatic aspects she is going to retire from the world in the character of a graceful anchorite and she has already begun to dress the part she is going to be simple and serious and a trifle severe and it even now expresses itself in the lines and color of her gown she turned toward him with the sudden gleam of some new expression in her eyes how well you understand me she said no one else would have understood me so well i never can deceive you at least yes you are quite right i am going to enjoy the thing dramatically i dont want to go but as i feel it discreet i intend to amuse myself and make the best of it i am going to play at being maternal and amiable and even domesticated i have a costume for it as i have one for bathing and dining and making calls this she said touching her dress is part of it upstairs i have a little mobcap and an apron and a workbasket to carry on my arm they are not unbecoming either shall i run up into the nursery and put them on and show them to you then you can be sure that i comprehend the part have you a mobcap and an apron asked richard have you really yes really she answered dont you remember that i told you that it was my dresses that were of consequence and not myself shall i go and put them on her tone was soft no longer it was a little hard and so was the look which half hid itself behind the brightness of the eyes she turned toward him yes he answered put them on and let us see them she turned round and went out of the room and arbuthnot followed her with a rather anxious glance the professor stirred his tea as usual and tredennis turned his attention to janey while richard laughed i have no doubt she has all three he said and they will be well worth seeing they were worth seeing in a few minutes she returnedthe little workbasket on her arm the mobcap upon her head the apron around her waist and a plain square of white muslin crossed upon her bosom she stopped in the doorway and made a courtesy there ought to be a curtain and somebody ought to ring it up she said enter the domestic virtues and she came and stood before them her eyes shining still and her head erect butperhaps through the rather severe black and white of her costumeseeming to have a shade less color than before i did not make them for this occasion she said they have appeared before you dont remember them richard but i had them when jack was a babyand a novelty i tried being maternal then why yes said richard to be sure i remember themand very becoming they were too oh yes she answered i knew they were becoming she turned and fronted tredennis i hope they are becoming now she said and made her little courtesy again they are very becoming he answered looking at her steadily i like them better thanthe silks and brocades thank you she said i thought you wouldor i would not have put them on jack and janey come and stand on each side of me while i sit down i have always congratulated myself that you were becoming this is what we shall be constrained to do when we are in virginia only we shall not have the incentive of being looked at we will make up a party said richard and come down once a week to look at you planefield would enjoy it i am sure thank you said bertha and i will always bring out the workbasket with a lacecollar for meg in it lacecollars are more becoming than small aprons or stockingmending do you remember the little shirt mrs rawdon crawley was making for her boy and which was always produced when she was in virtuous company poor rawdon was quite a big boy and very much too large for it by the time it was finished i wonder if meg will be grown up before she gets her collar she produced a needle threaded it and took a few stitches bending her head over her task with a serious air does it look as if i had done it before she said i hope it does i really have you know once i sewed on a button for richard but she did not sew many minutes soon she laid her work down in the basket there she said that is enough i have made my impression and that is all i care foror i should have made my impression if you had been strangers if you had not known me you would have had time to say to one another what a simple affectionate little creature she must be after all there is nothing which becomes a woman so well as to sit at her work in that quiet natural way with her children about her come jack and janey it is time for you to say goodnight and let me make a pretty exit with you in my mobcap and apron she took them away and remained upstairs with them until they were in bed when she came back she did not bring the workbasket but she had not taken off the cap and handkerchief she held an open letter in her hand and went to richard and sat down by him her manner had changed again entirely it was as if she had left upstairs something more than the workbasket richard she said i did not tell you i had had a letter from agnes sylvestre from agnes sylvestre he exclaimed why no you didnt but it is good news laurence you must remember agnes sylvestre perfectly was the answer she was not the kind of person you forget she was a beautiful creature said richard and i always regretted that we lost sight of her as we did after her marriage where is she now bertha when she wrote she was at castellamare she went abroad you know immediately after her husbands death he was not the nicest fellow in the worldthat sylvestre said richard he was not the man for a woman like that to marry i wonder if she did not find out that she had made a mistake if she did said bertha she bore it very well and it has been all over for more than two years she turned suddenly to tredennis did not you once tell meshe began yes he replied i met her in chicago and mr sylvestre was with her it must have been two or three weeks before his death said bertha he died quite suddenly and they were in chicago at the time do you remember how she looked and if you liked herbut of course you liked her i saw her only for a short time he answered we talked principally of you she was very handsome and had a sweet voice and large calm eyes bertha was silent a moment yes she said next she has beautiful eyes they are large and clear like a childs but they are not childish eyes she sees a great deal with them i think there was never anything more effective than a way she has of looking at you quietly and directly for a few seconds without saying anything at all you wonder what she is thinking of said arbuthnot and you hope she is thinking of yourself and are inclined to believe she is when there are ten chances to one that she is not at all but she generally is said bertha the trouble is that perhaps she is not thinking exactly what you would like best though she will never tell you so and you would not discover it from her manner she had an adorable manner it is soft and wellbred but she never wastes herself i remember said tredennis that i thought her very attractive bertha turned more directly toward him she is exactly what you would like she saidexactly when i said just now that her way of looking at people was effective i used the worst possible word and did her an injustice she is never effectivein that way to be effective it seems to me you must apply yourself agnes sylvestre never applies herself trifles do not amuse her as they amuse me i entertain myself with my whims and with all sorts of people she has no whims and cares only for the people she is fond of if she were here tonight she would look calmly at my mobcap and apron and wonder what i meant by them and what mental process i had gone through to reach the point of finding it worth while to wear them oh said arbuthnot i should not think she was slow at following mental processes no answered bertha i did not mean that she would reason clearly enough after she had looked at me a few moments and asked herself the question but in talking of her i am forgetting to tell you that she is coming home and will spend next winter in washington congratulate yourself laurence said richard we may all congratulate ourselves it will be something more to live for as to congratulating myself said arbuthnot i should have no objection to devoting the remainder of the evening to it but i am afraid of what demanded bertha oh he answered she will see through me with her calm eyes and as you say she never wastes herself no said bertha she never wastes herself and after all it is colonel tredennis who has most reason to congratulate himself he has not thrown away his time i am obliged to admit that she once said to me of you why does he throw away his time does he never think at all yes it is colonel tredennis who must be congratulated it was chiefly of agnes sylvestre they talked during the rest of the evening she is a person who says very little of herself was berthas comment but there is a great deal to say of her and so there seemed to be there were anecdotes to be related of her the charm of her beauty and manner was to be analyzed and all of her attributes were found worth touching upon it was tredennis who took his departure first when he rose to go bertha who was talking to arbuthnot did not at first observe his movement and when he approached her she turned with an involuntary start youare going now she said yes he answered i wish you a pleasant summer and all the rest you require she stood up and gave him her hand thank you she replied i shall be sure to have the rest it scarcely seemed more than the ordinary conventional parting for the night to tredennis it seemed something less there were only a few words more and he dropped her hand and went out of the room he had certainly felt that this was the last and only a powerful effort of will held in check a feeling whose strength he would have been loath to acknowledge such things are always a wrench he said mentally i never bore them well and he had barely said it when he heard bertha cross the parlor quickly and pass through the door he had bent to take up a paper he had left on the hatstand and when he turned she was close to him something in her look was so unusual that he recognized it with an inward start her eyes were a little dilated and her breath came with soft quickness as if she had moved rapidly and impulsively she put out both her hands with a simple sudden gesture and with an action as simple and unpremeditated he took them and held them in his own i came she said to say goodby again all at once i seemed toto realize that it would be months before iwe saw you again and so many things happen and she stopped a second but went on after it when i come back she said i shall be well and strong and like a new person say goodby to this person and a smile came and went as she said it a moment ago he answered i was telling myself that goodbyes were hard upon me theythey are not easy she said this at least was not easy for him her hands were trembling in his clasp the thought came to him that perhaps some agitation she wished to hide had driven her from the room within and she had come to him for momentary refuge because he was near she looked up at him for a second with a touch of desperation in her eyes and then he saw her get over it and she spoke jack and janey will miss you very much she said you have been very kind to them i thinkit is your way to be good to every one my opportunities of being good have been limited he said ifif one should present itselfand he held her hands a little closeryou wont let me miss my chance will you there is no reason for my saying so much of course butbut you will try to remember that i am here and always ready to come when i am called yes she said i think you would come if i called you and i thank you very much and goodbygoodby and she drew her hands away and stood with them hanging clasped before her as if she meant to steady them and so she stood until he was gone he was breathing quickly himself when he reached the street yes he said the professor was right it is arbuthnotit is arbuthnot chapter xiv when he passed the house the next day they were gone the nursery windows were thrown open and he fancied that the place wore a deserted look the very streets seemed empty and the glare of sunshine whose heat increased with every hour added to the air of desolateness he imagined it is imagination he said and the feeling will die away all the more quickly because i recognize the unreality of it by tomorrow or the day after i shall have got over it and yet a week later when he dropped in upon the professor one sultry evening to spend an hour with him his old friend found cause for anxious inspection of him what he said the hot weather begins to tell on you already you are not acclimatized yetthats it you must spare yourself as much as possible it doesnt promise well that you look fagged so soon i should say you had not slept well i dont sleep well tredennis answered you are working too hard said the professor that is it perhaps i am not working hard enough replied tredennis with a slight knitting of the brows i wish i had more to do leisure does not agree with me one must occupy ones self said the professor he spoke halfabsently and yet with a touch of significance in his tone whichcombined with the fact that he had heard the words beforecaused tredennis to glance at him quickly he smiled slightly in answer to the glance bertha he said oh yes i am quoting bertha your manner is not as light as hers but it reminded me of her in some way perhaps because i had a letter from her today and she was in my thoughts i hope she is well said tredennis and does not find her farmhouse too dull she does not complain of it the professor answered and she says nothing of her own health but tells me she is a little anxious about janey who does not seem quite herself tredennis looked out into the darkening street they were sitting by the opened window she was not well when she went away he said a trifle abstractedly janey asked the professor as if the idea was new to him i did not know that tredennis roused himself iwas thinking of bertha he said oh of bertha said the professor and then he lapsed into a reverie himself for a few moments and seemed to watch the trees on the street without seeing them no she was not well he said at length but i think she will be better when she comes back the rest and quietbegan tredennis i think she had determined to be better said the professor determined repeated tredennis she has a strong will returned the professor though it is a thing she is never suspected of she does not suspect herself of it and yet she has relied upon its strength from the first and is relying upon it now i am convinced that she went away with the determination to conquer a restlessness whose significance she is just awakening to and she deliberately chose nature and the society of her children as the best means of cure do you think asked tredennis in a low voice that she will get over it the professor turned to look at him i dont know he answered with a slight tone of surprise why did you fancy i would you seem to understand her said tredennis the professor sighed i have studied her so long he replied that i imagine i know what she is doing but you cant safely go beyond that with women you cant say what they are going to dowith any degree of certainty they are absorbingly interesting as a study but they are not to be relied on and they rarely compliment your intelligence by doing what you expect of them she has not done what i expected she has lived longer than i thought she would without finding herself out a year ago she believed that she had proved to herself that such an emotion asas this was impossible to her it was a very innocent belief and she was entirely sincere in it and congratulated herself upon it he turned to tredennis again with a sudden movement and a curious look of pain in his face i am afraid its a great mistake he said what tredennis asked thisthis feeling he said in a tremulous and troubled voice i dont mean in her alone but in any one everywhere i am not sure that it ever brings happiness really in the end i am afraid there always is an end if there wasnt it might be different but i am afraid there is there are those of us who try to believe there is none butbut i am afraid those are happiest who lose all but their ideal there are many who lose even that and fate has done her worst by them he checked himself and sank back in his chair ah he said smiling half sadly i am an old manan old manand it is an old mans fancy that the best thing in life is death and fate did not do her worst by me she left me my ideal she had gray eyes he added and a bright face like berthas perhaps after all if i had won what i wanted i should not feel so old tonight and so tired her face was very bright he had not been wholly well for some days and tonight seemed fatigued by the heat and languor in the air but he was somewhat more hopeful when he spoke of bertha than he had been i have confidence in the strength of her will he said and i like her pride and courage she does not give away to her emotions she resents them fiercely and refuses to acknowledge their powers over her she insists to herself that her restlessness is nervousness and her sadness morbid she said as much to me said tredennis did she exclaimed the professor that is a good sign it shows that she has confidence in you and that it is a feeling strong enough to induce her to use you as a defence against her own weakness she would never have spoken if she had not believed that you were a sort of stronghold it is the old feeling of her girlhood ruling her again thank heaven for that there was a ring at the frontdoor bell as he spoke and a moment or so later it was answered by a servant buoyant feet were heard in the hall and paused a second on the threshold are you here professor some one inquired and may i come in professor herrick turned his head come in richard he said come in by all means and amory entered and advanced toward them the slight depression of manner tredennis had fancied he had seen in him on the last two occasions of their meeting had disappeared altogether he seemed even in gayer spirits than usual i have come to tell you he said to the professor that i am going away for a short time it is a matter of business connected with the westoria lands i may be away a week or two isnt it rather a long journey asked the professor oh yes he replied with no air of being daunted by the prospectand a tiresome one but it is important that i should make it and i shall not be alone who is to be your companion planefieldand hes rather an entertaining fellow in his wayplanefield oh it wont be so bad on the whole it is planefield who is interested in the lands if i remember rightly suggested the professor oh planefield richard replied carelessly well more or less he is given to interesting himself in things and by jove he added with a laugh this promises to be a good thing to be interested in i shouldnt mind if i my dear richard interposed the professor allow me to advise you not to do so youll really find it best such things rarely end well richard laughed again my dear professor he answered with much goodhumor you may rely upon me i havent any money of my own and if you had money said the professor i think i should risk it i really do though why i should say risk i hardly know there is scarcely enough risk to make it exciting he was very sanguine and once or twice became quite brilliant on the subject the great railroad which was to give the lands an enormous value was almost an established fact everything was being laid in train a man influenced here a touch given there a vigorous move made in this direction an interest awakened in that and the thing was done there isnt a doubt of the termination he said not a doubt its a brilliant sort of thing that is its own impetus one might say and the right men are at work for it and the right wom were you going to say women asked tredennis when he pulled himself up somewhat abruptly well yes richard said blithely after all why not i must confess to finding the fact lend color and vivacity to the thing and the delightful cleverness the clever ones show is a marvellous power for or against a thing though i think the feminine tendency is to work for a thing not against it i should like to know said tredennis how they begin it for a moment he thought he did not know why he asked the question but the selfdelusion did not last long he felt an instant later that he did know and wished that he did not in nine cases out of ten richard replied giving himself up at once to an enjoyable analysis of the subjectin nine cases out of ten it is my impression they begin with almost entire lack of serious intention and rarely if ever even in the end admit to themselves that they have done what they are accused of given a clever and pretty woman whose husband or other male relative needs her assistance why should she be less clever and pretty in the society of one political dignitary than in that of another whose admiration of her charms may not be of such importance i suppose that is the beginning and then come the sense of power and the fascination of excitement what woman does not like both what woman is better and more charming than bertha and bertha does not hesitate to admit in her own delightful way that there must have been a fascination in the lives of those historical charmers before whom prime ministers trembled and who could make and unmake a cabinet with a smile what was the thought that leaped into tredennis mind do we begin to compare bertha with a kings favorite but he did not say it aloudit was not for him to defend her against her husbands lightness and were they not her own words after all and so he could only sit silent in the shadow of his darkening corner and knit his heavy brows with hot resentment in his heart while richard went on there are some few who make a profession of it he said but they do not carry the most power the woman who is ambitious for her husband or eager for her son or who wishes to escape from herself and find refuge in some absorbing excitement necessarily is more powerful than the more sordid element if i were going in for that kind of thing he went on settling himself in his favorite graceful lounging posture and throwing his arm lightly behind his headif i were going in for it and might make a deliberate choice i think i should choose a woman who had something to forgeta woman who had reached an emotional crisiswho was young and yet who could not take refuge in girlish forgetfulness and who in spite of her youth had lived beyond trusting in the futurea woman who represented beauty and wit and despair the despair would be the strongest lever of all there isnt a doubt of it that such a woman taken at such a turningpoint in her existence could movethe world if you likethe world itself and he arranged himself a trifle more comfortably and halflaughed again but suggested the professor you are not going in for that sort of thing my dear richard oh no no answered richard but if i were i must confess it would have a fascination for me which would not permit of my regarding it in cold blood i am like bertha you knowi like my little drama and speaking of bertha said the professor if anything should happen while you are away now really said richard that shows what a careless fellow i am do you know it never once occurred to me that anything could happen we have such an admirable record to look back upon bertha and i though i think i usually refer the fact to berthas tact and executive ability nothing ever has happened and i feel that we have established a precedent but if anything should happen you had better telegraph to merritsville in any ordinary event however i feel quite safe in leaving bertha in your hands and tredenniss he said smiling at the large shadow in the corner one is always sure in the midst of the ruling frivolity that tredennis is to be relied on he went away soon after and tredennis bidding the professor goodnight left the house with him as they passed down the steps richard put his arm through his companions with caressing friendliness it wouldnt do you any harm to take a run up into virginia yourself once in a while he said you have been losing ground since the heat set in and we cant submit to that we need your muscular development in its highest form as an example to our modern deterioration kill two birds with one stone when you have a days leisurego and see bertha and the children and lay in a new supply of that delightful robustness we envy and admire i should be glad to see bertha said tredennis she would be glad to see you richard answered and while i am away it will be a relief to me to feel that she has you to call upon in case of need the professordear old fellowis not as strong as he was and youas i said beforeone naturally takes the liberty of relying upon your silent substantiality thank you said tredennis if it is a matter of avoirdupois richard turned quickly to look at him ah no he said not that though being human we respect the avoirdupois its something else you know upon my word i cant exactly say what but something which makes a man feel instinctively that he can shift his responsibilities upon you and they will be in good hands perhaps it is not an enviable quality in ones self after all here am i you see shifting bertha and the children off on your shoulders if i can be of any use to bertha and the children why not said tredennis tersely oh but one might also say why returned richard we havent any claim on you really and yet we do it or rather i do it which speaks all the more strongly for your generosity and trustworthiness and you will be awaytredennis began two or three weeks it might be more but i think not we separate here i think as i am going to drop in on planefield goodnight and thanks goodnight responded tredennis and they shook hands and parted chapter xv during the hot days and nights of the next few weeks tredennis found life rather a dreary affair gradually the familiar faces he met on the avenue became fewer and fewer the houses he knew one after another assumed their air of summer desertion offering as their only evidences of life an occasional colored servant sunning him or herself on the steps the crowds of nurserymaids with their charges thinned out in the parks and the freshness of the leaves was lost under a coating of dust while the countenances of those for whom there was no prospect of relief expressed either a languid sense of injury or the patience of despair but after all tredennis said on two or three occasions as he sat in one of the parks in the eveningafter all i suppose most of them havean object adding the last two words with a faint smile he was obliged to confess to himself that of late he found that the work which he had regarded as his object had ceased to satisfy him he gave his attention to it with stern persistence and refused to spare himself when he found his attention wandering he even undertook additional labor writing in his moments of leisure several notable articles upon various important questions of the day and yet he had time left to hang heavily on his hands and fill him with weariness and at last there came an evening when after sitting in one of the parks until the lamps were lighted he rose suddenly from his seat and spoke as if to the silence and shadow about him why should i try to hide the truth from myself he said it is too late for that i may as well face it like a man and bear it like one many a brave fellow has carried a bullet in his body down to his grave and seldom winced this is something like that i suppose only that painand he drew a sharp hard breath and walked away down the deserted path without ending the sentence he made a struggle after this to resist one poor temptation which beset him dailythe temptation to pass through the street in which stood the familiar house with its drawn blinds and closed doors sometimes when he rose in the morning he was so filled with an unreasoning yearning for a sight of its blankness that he was overwhelmed by it and went out before he breakfasted it is weakness and selfindulgence he would say but it is a very little thing and it can hurt no oneit is only a little thing after all and he found a piteous pleasureat which at first he tried to smile but at which before long he ceased even to try to smilein the slow walk down the street on which he could see this window or that and remember some day when he had caught a glimpse of bertha through it or some night he had spent in the room within when she had been gayer than usual or quieterwhen she had given him some new wound perhaps or when she had halfhealed an old one in some mood of relenting he had not understood there is no reason why i should understand any woman was his simple thought and why should i understand her unless she chose to let me she is like no other woman he was quite sure of this in his thoughts of her he found every word and act of hers worth remembering and even repeating mentally again and again for the sake of the magnetic grace which belonged only to herself and it never once occurred to him that his own deep sympathy and tender fancy might brighten all she did when she speaks he thought how the dullest of them stir and listen when she moves across a room how natural it is to turn and look at her and be interested in what she is going to do what life i have seen her put in some poor awkward wretch by only seating herself near him and speaking to him of some common thing one does not know what her gift is and whether it is well for her or ill that it was given her but one sees it in the simplest thing she does it was hard to avoid giving himself up to such thoughts as these and when he most needed refuge from them he always sought it in the society of the professor so there were few evenings when he did not spend an hour or so with him and their friendship grew and waxed strong until there could scarcely have been a closer bond between them about two weeks after richard amorys departure making his call later than usual one evening he met coming down the steps mr arbuthnot who stopped with his usual civility to shake hands with him it is some weeks since we have crossed each others paths colonel he said scrutinizing him rather closely and in the meantime i am afraid you have not been well amory called my attention to the fact a short time ago responded tredennis and so did the professor so perhaps there is some truth in it i hadnt noticed it myself you will presently i assure you said arbuthnot still regarding him with an air of interest perhaps washington doesnt agree with you i have heard of people who couldnt stand it they usually called it malaria but i think there was generally somethinghe checked himself somewhat abruptly which was a rather unusual demonstration on his part as it was his habit to weigh his speech with laudable care and deliberation you are going to see the professor he inquired yes answered tredennis the idea was presenting itself to his mind that there was a suggestion of something unusual in the questioners manner that it was not so entirely serene as was customary that there was even a hint of some inward excitement strong enough to be repressed only by an effort and the consciousness of this impressed itself upon him even while a flow of light talk went on and arbuthnot smiled at him from his upper step i have been to see the professor too he was saying and i felt it was something of an audacity his invitations to me have always been of the most general nature but i thought i would take the liberty of pretending that i fancied he regarded them seriously he was very good to me and exhibited wonderful presence of mind in not revealing that he was surprised to see me i tried not to stay long enough to tire him and he was sufficiently amiable to ask me to come again he evidently appreciated the desolation of my circumstances you are finding it dull said tredennis dull repeated arbuthnot yes i think you might call it dull the people who kindly condescend to notice me in the winter have gone away and my dresscoat is packed in camphor i have ceased to be useful and even if fate had permitted me to be ornamental where should i air my charms there seems really no reason why i should exist until next winter when i may be useful again and receive in return my modicum of entertainment to be merely a superior young man in a department is not remunerative in summer as one ceases to glean the results of ones superiority at present i might as well be inferior and neither dance nor talk nor sing and be utterly incapacitated by nature for either carrying wraps or picking up handkerchiefs and you cannot disport yourself at the wateringplaces of the rich and great on a salary of a hundred dollars a month and you could only get your sordid months leave if such a thing were possible ihave been dull myself said tredennis hesitantly if it should ever occur to you to drop in and see a fellowsufferer said arbuthnot it would relieve the monotony of my lot at least and might awaken in me some generous emotions tredennis looked up at him it never has occurred to you so far i see was arbuthnots light reply to the look but if it should dont resist the impulse i can assure you it is a laudable one and my humble apartment has the advantage of comparative coolness when tredennis entered the library he found the professor sitting in his usual summer seat near the window a newspaper lay open on his knee but he was not reading it he seemed indeed to have fallen into a reverie of a rather puzzling kind did you meet any one as you came in he asked of tredennis as soon as they had exchanged greetings i met mr arbuthnot tredennis answered and stopped a few moments on the steps to talk to him he has been entertaining me for the last hour said the professor taking off his glasses and beginning to polish them now will you tell me he asked with his quiet air of reflective inquiry into an interesting subjectwill you tell me why he comes to entertain me he gave me the impression answered tredennis that his object in coming was that you might entertain him and he added that you were very good to him and he appeared to have enjoyed his call very much that is his way responded the professor impartially and a most agreeable way it is to be born with such a way as a natural heritage is to be a social millionnaire and the worst of it is that it may be a gift entirely apart from all morals and substantial virtues bertha has it i dont know where she got it not from me and not from her poor mother i say it may be apart from all morals and substantial virtues i dont say it always is i havent at all made up my mind what attributes go along with it in arbuthnots case i should like to decide but it would be an agreeable way in a criminal of the deepest dye it is certainly agreeable that he should in some subtle manner be able to place me in the picturesque attitude of a dignified and entertaining host i didnt entertain him at all he added simply i sat and listened to him he is frequently well worth listening to commented tredennis he was well worth listening to this evening said the professor and yet he was light enough he had two or three english periodicals under his armone of them was punchandand i found myself laughing quite heartily over it and then there was something about a new comic opera and he seemed to know the libretto by heart and ran over an air or so on the piano and he had been reading a new book and was rather clever about itin his way of course but still it was cleverness and then he went to the piano again and sang a captivating little lovesong very well and after it got up and said goodnightand on the whole i regretted it i liked his pictures i liked his opera i liked his talk of the book and i liked his little lovesong and how should he know that an old drybones would like a tender little ballad and be touched by it and pleased because his sentiment was discovered and pandered to oh it is the old story its his wayits the way i am beginning to think said tredennis slowly that his way might be called sympathy and good feeling and fine tact if one wanted to be specially fair to him the professor looked up rather quickly i thought you did not like him he said tredennis paused a moment looking down at the carpet as if deliberating i dont think i do he said at length but its no fault of histhe fault lies in me i havent the way and i am at a disadvantage with him he is never at a loss and i am he is readywitted and selfpossessed i am slow and rigid and i suppose it is human that i should try to imagine at times that i am at a disadvantage only because my virtues are more solid than his they are not more solid they are only more clumsy and less available you dont spare yourself said the professor why should i spare myself said tredennis knitting his brows after all he never spares himself he knows better he would be just to me why should i let him place me at a disadvantage again by being unjust to him and why should we insist that the only good qualities are those which are unornamental it is a popular fallacy we like to believe it it is very easy to suspect a man of being shallow because we are sure we are deep and he is unlike us this arbuthnot this arbuthnot interposed the professor with a smile it is curious enough to hear you entering upon a defence of this arbuthnot you dont like him philip you dont like him i dont like myself said tredennis when i am compared with him and i dont like the tendency i discover in myself the tendency to disparage him i should like to be fair to him and i find it difficult upon my word said the professor it is rather fine in you to make the effort butgiving him one of the old admiring looksyou are always rather fine philip it would be finer sir said tredennis coloring if it were not an effort no said the professor quietly it would not be half so fine and he put out his hand and let it rest upon the arm of the chair in which tredennis sat and so it rested as long as their talk went on in the meantime arbuthnot walked rather slowly down the street quite conscious of finding it necessary to make something of an effort to compose himself it was his recognition of this necessity which had caused him to change his first intention of returning to his bachelor apartment after having made his call upon professor herrick and he felt the necessity all the more strongly after his brief encounter with colonel tredennis i will go into the park and think it over he said to himself ill give myself time he turned into lafayette park found a quiet seat and took out a very excellent cigar he was not entirely surprised to see that as he held the match to it his hand was not as steady as usual tredennis had thought him a little pale the subject of his reflections as he smoked his cigar was a comparatively trivial incident taken by itself but he had not taken it by itself because in a flash it had connected itself with a score of others which at the times of their occurring had borne no significance whatever to him his visit to the professor had not been made without reasons but they had been such reasons as simply stated to the majority of his ordinary acquaintance would have been received with open amazement or polite discredit and this principally because they were such very simple reasons indeed if such persons had been told that finding himself without any vestige of entertainment he had wandered in upon the professor as a last resource or that he had wished to ask of him some trivial favor or that he had made his call without any reason whatever they would have felt such a state of affairs probable enough but being informed that while sitting in the easiest of chairs in the coolest possible neglige reading an agreeable piece of light literature and smoking a cigar before his open window he had caught sight of the professor at his window sitting with his head resting on his hand and being struck vaguely by some air of desolateness and lassitude in the solitary old figure had calmly laid aside book and cigar had put himself into conventional attire and had walked across the street with no other intention than that of making the best of gifts of entertainment it was certainly not his habit to overvaluethose to whom the explanation had been made would have taken the liberty of feeling it somewhat insufficient and would in nine cases out of ten privately have provided themselves with a more complicated one cautiously insuring themselves against imposture by rejecting at the outset the simple and unvarnished truth upon the whole the visit had been a success on entering it is true he found himself called upon to admire the rapidity with which the professor recovered from his surprise at seeing him but as he had not been deluded by any hope that his first appearance would awaken unmistakable delight he managed to make the best of the situation his opening remarks upon the subject of the weather were not altogether infelicitous and then he produced his late number of punch and the professor laughed and the ice being broken conversation flourished and there was no further difficulty he discovered somewhat to his surprise that he was in better conversational trim than usual it is a delusive condition to be in he explained to the professor but experience has taught me not to be taken in by it and expect future development it wont continue as you no doubt suspect it is the result of entire social stagnation for several weeks i am merely letting off all my fireworks at once inspired to the improvidence by your presence i am a poor creature as you know but even a poor creature is likely to suffer from an idea a day the mental accumulations of this summer carefully economized will support me in penury during the entire ensuing season i only conjure you not to betray me when you hear me repeat the same things by instalments at mrs amorys evenings and saying it he saw the professors face change in some subtle way as he looked at him what there was in this look and change to make him conscious of an inward start he could not have told it was the merest lifting of the lids combined with an almost imperceptible movement of the muscles about the mouth and yet he found it difficult to avoid pausing for a moment but he accomplished the feat and felt he had reason to be rather proud of it though what there is to startle him in my mention of mrs amorys evenings he reflected it would require an intellect to explain being somewhat given to finding entertainment in quiet speculation upon passing events he would doubtless have given some attention to the incident even if it had remained a solitary unexplained and mystifying trifle but it was not left to stand alone in his mind it was not fifteen minutes before in drawing his handkerchief from his breastpocket he accidentally drew forth with it a letter which fell upon the newspaper lying upon the professors lap and for a moment rested there with the address upward and the instant he glanced from the pretty feminine envelope to the professors face arbuthnot recognized the fact that something altogether unexpected had occurred again as he had looked from the envelope to the professor so the professor looked from the envelope to him then he picked the letter up and returned it it is a letter arbuthnot begana letterand paused ignominiously yes said the professor as if he had lost something of his own gentle selfpossession i see it is a letter it was not a happy remark nor did arbuthnot feel his own next effort a particularly successful one it is a letter from mrs amory he said she is kind enough to write to me occasionally yes responded the professor i saw that it was from bertha her hand is easily recognized it is an unusual hand said arbuthnot and her letters are very like herself when it occurs to her to remember mewhich doesnt happen as frequently as i could wishi consider myself fortunate she writes as she talks and very few people do that he ended with a greater degree of composure than he had begun with but to his surprise he felt that his pulses had quickened and that there had risen to his face a touch of warmth suggestive of some increase of color and he did not enjoy the sensation he began to open the letter shall ihe said and then suddenly stopped he knew why he had stopped but the professor did not and to make the pause and return the letter to its envelope and its place in his pocket without an explanation required something like hardihood she is well and seems to be taking advantage of the opportunity to rest he said and picked up his punch again returning to his halffinished comment upon its cartoon as if no interruption had taken place as he sat on his seat in the park apparently given up to undivided enjoyment of his cigar his mind was filled with a tumult of thought he had not been under the influence of such mental excitement for years suddenly he found himself confronting a revelation perfectly astounding to him and so i am the man he said at last i am the man he took his cigar out of his mouth and looked at the end of it with an air of deliberate reflection as is the masculine habit it doesnt say much for me he added that i never once suspected itnot once then he replaced his cigar with something like a sigh we are a blind lot he said he did not feel the situation a pleasant one there were circumstances under which he would have resented it with a vigor and happy ingenuity of resource which would have stood him in good stead but there was no resentment in his present mood from the moment the truth had dawned upon him he had treated it without even the most indirect reference to his own very natural feelings and there had been more sacrifice of himself and his own peculiarities in his action when he had returned the letter to his pocket than even he himself realized it was not the letter to show him was his thought she does not know how much she tells me he would have understood it as i do he went over a good deal of ground mentally as he sat in the deepening dusk and he thought clearly and dispassionately as was his habit when he allowed himself to think at all by the time he had arrived at his conclusions it was quite dark then he threw the end of his last cigar away and arose and there was no denying that he was pale still and wore a curiously intense expression if there is one thing neither man nor devil can put a stop to he said it is an experience such as that it will go on to one of two endsit will kill her or she will kill it the wider of the mark they shoot the easier for her and as for me he added with a rather faint and dreary smile perhaps it suits me well enough to be merely an alleviating circumstance its all im good for let them think as they please and he brushed an atom of cigarash from his sleeve with his rather too finely feminine hand and walked away chapter xvi he paid the professor another visit a few days later and afterwards another and another what said the professor at the end of his second visit is it ten oclock i assure you it is usually much later than this when it strikes ten thank you said arbuthnot i never heard that civility accomplished so dexterously before it is perfectly easy to explain the preternatural adroitness of speech on which mrs amory prides herself but dont be too kind to me professor and weaken my resolution not to present myself unless i have just appropriated an idea from somewhere if i should appear some day au naturel not having taken the precaution to attire myself in the mature reflections of my acquaintance i shouldnt pay you for the wear and tear of seeing me ill confess beforehand i once told you said the professor to tredennis after the fourth visit that i was not fond of him but there had been times when i had been threatened with it this is one of the times ah with a sigh of fatigue i understand the attractioni understand it the following week tredennis arrived at the house one evening to find it in some confusion the coup of a prominent medical man stood before the pavement and the servant who opened the door looked agitated the professor sir he said has had a fall we hope he aint much hurt and mr arbuthnot and the doctor are with him ask if i may go upstairs said tredennis and as he asked it arbuthnot appeared on the landing above and seeing who was below came down at once there is no real cause for alarm he said though he has had a shock he had been out and the heat must have been too much for him as he was coming up the steps he felt giddy and lost his footing and fell doctor malcolm is with him and says he needs nothing but entire quiet i am glad you have come did you receive my message no answered tredennis i have not been to my room come into the library said arbuthnot i have something to say to you he led the way into the room and tredennis followed him wondering when they got inside arbuthnot turned and closed the door i suppose he said you know no more certainly than i do where mr amory is to be found and as he spoke he took a telegram from his pocket what is the matter demanded tredennis what has this came almost immediately after the professors accident said arbuthnot it is from mrs amory asking him to come to her janey is very ill what exclaimed tredennis and she alone and probably without any physician she relies on some one must go to her said arbuthnot and the professor must know nothing of it if we knew of any woman friend of hers we might appeal to her but everybody is out of town he paused a second his eyes fixed on tredenniss changing face if you will remain with the professor he said i will go myself and take doctor wentworth with me you said tredennis i shall be better than nothing replied arbuthnot quietly i can do what i am told to do and she mustnt be left alone if her mother had been alive she would have gone if her father had been well he would have gone if her husband had been here but he is not here said tredennis with a bitterness not strictly just heaven only knows where he is it would be rather hazardous to trust to a telegram reaching him at merrittsville said arbuthnot we are not going to leave her alone even until we have tried merrittsville what must be done must be done now i will go and see doctor wentworth at once and we can leave in an hour if i find him you can tell the professor i was called away he made a step toward the door and as he did so tredennis turned suddenly wait a moment he said arbuthnot came back what is it he asked there was a curious pause which though it lasted scarcely longer than a second was still a pause if i go said tredennis it will be easier to explain my absence to the professor and then there was a pause again and each man looked at the other and each was a trifle pale it was arbuthnot who spoke first i think he said without moving a muscle that you had better let me go why said tredennis and the unnatural quality of his voice startled himself because said arbuthnot as calmly as before you will be conferring a favor on me if you do i want an excuse for getting out of town andi want an opportunity to be of some slight service to mrs amory before the dignity of the stalwart figure towering above his slighter proportions he knew he appeared to no advantage as he said the words but to have made the best of himself he must have relinquished his point at the outset and this he had no intention of doing though he was not enjoying himself a certain coldblooded pertinacity which he had acquired after many battles with himself was very useful to him at the moment the worst thing that could happen to her just now he had said to himself ten minutes before would be that he should go to her in her trouble and upon this conviction he took his stand in placing himself in the breach he knew that he had no means of defence whatever that any reasons for his course he might offer must appear by their flimsiness to betray in him entire inadequacy to the situation in which he seemed to stand and that he must present himself in the character of a victim to his own bold but shallow devices and simply brazen the matter out and when one reflects upon human weakness it is certainly not to his discredit that he had calmly resigned himself to this before entering the room there was no triviality in tredenniss mood and he made no pretence of any the half darkness of the room which had been shaded from the sun during the day added to the significance of every line in his face as he stood with folded arms the shadows seemed to make him look larger to mark his pallor and deepen the intensity of his expression give me a better reason he said arbuthnot paused what he saw in the man moved him strongly in the light of that past of his which was a mystery to his friends he often saw with terrible clearness much he was not suspected of seeing at all and here he recognized what awakened in him both pity and respect i have no better one he answered i tell you i miss the exhilaration of mrs amorys society and want to see her and hope she will not be sorry to see me and having said it he paused again before making his coup dtat then he spoke deliberately looking tredennis in the eyes that you should think anything detrimental to mrs amory even in the most shadowy way is out of the question he said think of me what you please i shall think nothing that is detrimental to any man who is her friend said tredennis and there was passion in the words though he had tried to repress it her friendship would be a good defence for a man against any wrong that was in him said arbuthnot and this time the sudden stir of feeling in him was not altogether concealed let me have my way he ended it will do no harm it will do no good said tredennis no answered arbuthnot recovering his impervious air it will do no good but one has to be sanguine to expect good perhaps i need pity he added suppose you are generous and show it me he could not help seeing the dramatic side of the situation and with halfconscious irony abandoning himself to it all at once he seemed to have deserted the wellregulated and decently arranged commonplaces of his ordinary life and to be taking part in a theatrical performance of rather fine and subtle quality and he waited with intense interest to see what tredennis would do what he did was characteristic of him he had unconsciously taken two or three hurried steps across the room and he turned and stood still it is i who must go he said you are sure of that said arbuthnot we have never found it easy to understand each other tredennis answered though perhaps you have understood me better than i have understood you you are quicker and more subtle than i am i only seem able to see one thing at a time and do one thing i only see one thing now it is better that i should go you mean said arbuthnot better for me tredennis looked down at the floor yes he answered a second or so of silence followed in which arbuthnot simply stood and looked at him the utter uselessness of the effort he had made was borne in upon him in a manner which overpowered him then he remarked at length if you are considering me there seems nothing more to be said will you go and tell the professor that you are called away or shall i i will go myself replied tredennis he turned to leave the room and arbuthnot walked slowly toward the window the next moment tredennis turned from the door and followed him if i have ever done you injustice he said the time is past for it and i ask your pardon perhaps it is not justice i need said arbuthnot but mercyand i dont think you have ever been unjust to me it wouldnt have been easy in my place said tredennis with a visible effort you would find it easier than i do to say what you wished i you mean that you pity me arbuthnot interposed as i said before perhaps i need pity sometimes i think i do and the slight touch of dreariness in his tone echoed in tredenniss ear long after he had left him and gone on his way chapter xvii it was ten oclock and bright moonlight when tredennis reached his destination the train having brought him to a wayside station two miles distant where he had hired a horse and struck out into the county road in those good old days when the dwelling of every virginia gentleman was his mansion the substantial pile of red brick before whose gateway he dismounted had been a mansion too and had not been disposed to trifle with its title but had insisted upon it with a dignified squareness which scorned all architectural devices to attract attention its first owner had chosen its site with a view to the young shadetrees upon it and while he had lived upon his property had been almost as proud of his trees as of his mansion and when long afterward changes had taken place and the objects of his pride fell into degenerate hands as the glories of the mansion faded its old friends the trees grew and flourished and seemed to close kindly in about it as if to soften and shadow its decay on each side of the drive which led down to the gateway grew an irregular line of these trees here and there shading the way from side to side and again leaving a space for the moonlight to stream upon as he tied his horse tredennis glanced up this driveway toward the house there is a light burning in one of the rooms he said it must be there thathe broke off in the midst of a sentence his attention suddenly attracted by a figure which flitted across one of the patches of moonlight he knew it at once though he had had no thought of seeing it before entering the house it was bertha in a white dress and with two large dogs following her leaping and panting when she spoke in a hushed voice as if to quiet them she came down toward the gate with a light hurried tread and when she was within a few feet of it spoke doctor she said oh how glad i amhow glad and as she said it came out into the broad moonlight again and found herself face to face with tredennis she fell back from him as if a blow had been struck herfell back trembling and as white as the moonlight itself what she cried is it youyou he looked at her bewildered by the shock his presence seemed to her i did not think i should frighten you he said i came tonight because the professor was not well enough to make the journey doctor wentworth will be here in the morning he would have come with me but he had an important case to attend i did not think you would come she said breathlessly and put out her hand groping for the support of the swinging gate which she caught and held there was no one else he answered he felt as if he were part of some strange dream the stillness the moonlight the heavy shadows of the great trees all added to the unreality of the moment but most unreal of all was bertha herself clinging with one trembling hand to the gate and looking up at him with dilated eyes i did not think you would come she said again and it startled meandshe paused with a poor little effort at a smile which the next instant died away dontdont look at me she said and turning away from him laid her face on the hand clinging to the gate he looked down at her slight white figure and bent head and a great tremor passed over him the next instant she felt him standing close at her side you must notdo that he said and put out his hand and touched her shoulder his voice was almost a whisper he was scarcely conscious of what his words were he had scarcely any consciousness of his touch the feeling which swept over him needed no sense of touch or sound the one thing which overpowered him was his sudden sense of a nearness to her which was not physical nearness at all perhaps i was wrong to come he went on but i could not leave you alonei could not leave you alone i knew that you were suffering and i could not bear that she did not speak or lift her head has it been desolate he asked yes she answered in a hushed voice i was afraid so he said you have been alone so longi thought of it almost every hour of the day you are not used to being alone perhaps it was a mistake why do you tremble so i dont know she answered my poor child he said my poor child and then there was a pause which seemed to hold a lifetime of utter silence it was bertha who ended it she stirred a little and then lifted her face she looked as he remembered her looking when he had first known her only that she was paler and there was a wearied softness in her eyes she made no attempt at hiding the traces of tears in them and she spoke as simply as a child i thought it was the doctor when i heard the horses feet she said and i was afraid the dogs would bark and waken janey she has just fallen asleep and she has slept so little she has been very ill you have not slept he said no she replied this is the first time i have left her he took her hand and drew it gently through his arm i will take you up to the house he said so that you can hear every sound but you must stay outside for a little while the fresh air will do you good and we can walk up and down while i tell you the reason the professor did not come all the ordinary conventional barriers had fallen away from between them he did not know why or how and he did not ask suddenly he found himself once again side by side with the bertha he had fancied lost forever all that had bewildered him was gone the brilliant little figure with its tinkling ornaments the unemotional little smile the light laugh were only parts of a feverish dream it was bertha whose hand rested on his armwhose fair young face was pale with watching over her childwhose soft voice was tremulous and tender with innocent natural tears she spoke very little when they had walked to and fro before the house for a short time she said let us go and sit down on the steps of the porch and they went and sat there togetherhe upon a lower step and she a few steps above her hands clasped on her knee her face turned half away from him she rarely looked at him he noticed even when he spoke to her or she spoke to him her eyes rested oftener than not upon some faraway point under the trees you are no better than you were when you went away he said looking at her cheek where the moonlight whitened it no she answered i did not think to find you looking like this he said perhaps she said still with her eyes fixed on the faraway shadows perhaps i have not had time enough you must give me time you have had two months he returned two months she said is not so long as it seems and between the words there came a curious little catch of the breath it has seemed long to you he asked yes she turned her face slowly and looked at him has it seemed long to you she said yes he replied long and dreary she swayed a little toward him with a sort of unconscious movement her eyes were fixed upon his face with a wistful questioning he had seen her look at her children so was it very hot she said were you tired why did you not go away i did not want to go away he answered but you ought to have gone away she said you were not used to the heat andlet the light fall on your face so that i can see it he came a little nearer to her and as she looked at him the wistfulness in her eyes changed to something else oh she cried it has done you harm your face is quite changed why didnt i see it before what have you been doing nothing he answered he did not stir or want to stir but sat almost breathlessly still watching her the sudden soft anxiousness in her eyes setting every pulse in his body throbbing oh she said you are illyou are ill how could you be so careless why did not papa she falteredher voice fell and broke she even drew back a little though her eyes still rested upon his you were angry with me when you thought i did not take care of myself she said and you have been as bad as i was and worse you had not so many temptations and she turned away and he found himself looking only at her cheek again and the soft sidecurve of her mouth there is less reason why i should take care of myself he said you meanshe asked without movingthat there are fewer people who would miss you i do not know of any one who would miss me her hands stirred slightly as they lay in her lap that is underrating your friends she said slowly butaltering her toneit is true i have the children and richard where is richard he asked i dont know when you heard from him last he began he is a bad correspondent she said he always finds so much to fill his time when he is away there is an understanding between us that he shall write very few letters i am responsible for it myself because i know it spoils everything for him when he has an unwritten letter on his conscience i havent heard from him first yet since he went west she arose from her seat on the step i will go in now she said i must speak to mrs lucas about giving you a room and then i will go to janey she is sleeping very well he arose too and stood below her looking up you must promise not to think of me he said i did not come here to be considered do you think an old soldier who has slept under the open sky many a night cannot provide for himself have you slept so often she asked the very triviality of the question giving it a strange sweetness to his ears yes he answered and often with no surety of wakening with my scalp on oh she exclaimed and made an involuntary movement toward him he barely restrained his impulse to put out his hands but hers fell at her sides the next instant i am a great coward she said it fills me with terror to hear of things like that is it at all likely that you will be ordered back i dont know he replied his uplifted eyes devouring all the sweetness of her face would that the very madness of the question forming itself on his lips was his own check i dont want to think of it he said then he added as i stand here i look up at you i never looked up at you before nor i down at you she returned you are always so high above me it seems strange to look down at you it was all so simple and inconsequent but every word seemed full of the mystery and emotion of the hour when he tried afterward to recall what they had said he was bewildered by the slightness of what had been uttered even though the thrill of it had not yet passed away he went up the steps and stood beside her yes he said speaking as gently as he might have spoken to a child you make me feel what a heavylimbed clumsy fellow i am all women make me feel it but you more than all the rest you look almost like a child but i am not very little she said it is only because i am standing near you i always think of you as a small creature he said i used to think long ago that some one should care for you you were very good long ago she answered softly and you are very good now to have come to try to help me will you come in no he said not now it might only excite the child tonight if she saw me and so long as she is quiet i will not run the risk of disturbing her i will tell you what i am going to do i am not going to leave you alone i shall walk up and down beneath your window and if you need me you will know i am there and you have only to speak in your lowest voice if she should be worse my horse is at the gate and i can go for the doctor at once she looked up at him with a kind of wonder do you mean that you intend to stand sentinel all night she said i have stood sentinel before was his reply i came to stand sentinel all that i can do is to be ready if i am wanted but i cannot let you stay up all night she began you said it had been desolate he answered wont it be less desolate to know thatthat some one is near you oh yes oh yes she said but go upstairs he said and promise me that if she still sleeps you will lie down and let your nurse watch her the gentle authority of his manner seemed to impress her curiously she hesitated as if she scarcely understood it idontknow she faltered you will be better for it tomorrow he persisted and so will she i never did such a thing before she said slowly i shall be beneath the open window he said and i have the ears of an indian i shall know if she stirs she drew a soft troubled breath well she said i willgo and without another word she turned away he stood and watched her as she moved slowly across the wide porch at the door she stopped and turned toward him but she said faint lines showing themselves on her forehead i shall be remembering that youare not asleep you must not remember me at all he answered and then he stood still and watched her again until she had entered the house and noiselessly ascended the staircase which was a few yards from the open door and then when he could see her white figure in the darkness no more he went out to his place beneath the window and strode silently to and fro keeping watch and listening until after the moon had gone down and the birds were beginning to stir in the trees chapter xviii at six oclock in the morning bertha came down the stairs again her simple white gown was a fresh one and there was a tinge of color in her cheeks she slept nearly all night she said to tredennis when he joined her and so did i i am sure she is better then she put out her hand for him to take it is all because you are here she said when i wakened for a moment once or twice and heard your footsteps it seemed to give me courage and make everything quieter are you very tired no he answered i am not tired at all i am afraid you would not tell me if you were she said you must come with me now and let me give you some breakfast she led him into a room at the side of the hall when the house had been a mansion it had been considered a very imposing apartment and with the assistance of a few washingtonian luxuries which she had dexterously grafted upon its bareness it was by no means unpicturesque even now i think i should know that you had lived here he said as he glanced around have i made it so personal she replied i did not mean to do that it was so bare at first and as i had nothing to do it amused me to arrange it richard sent me the rugs and odds and ends and i found the spindlelegged furniture in the neighborhood i am afraid it wont be safe for you to sit down too suddenly in the chairs or to lean heavily on the table i think you had better choose that leathern armchair and abide by it it is quite substantial he took the seat and gave himself up to the pleasure of watching her as she moved to and fro between the table and an antique sideboard from whose recesses she produced some pretty cups and saucers what are you going to do he asked i am going to set the table for your breakfast she said because maria is busy with the children and the other nurse is with janey and the woman of the house is making your coffee and rolls you are going to set the table he exclaimed it doesnt require preternatural intelligence she answered it is rather a simple thing on the whole it seemed a very simple thing as she did it and a very pretty thing as he leaned against the leathern back of his chair beginning vaguely to realize by a dawning sense of weariness that he had been up all night he felt that he had not awakened from his dream yet or that the visions of the past months were too far away and too unreal to move him the early morning sunlight made its way through the vines embowering the window and cast lacelike shadows of their swaying leaves upon the floor and upon berthas dress when she passed near the softness of the light mellowed everything and intensified the touches of color in the fans and ornaments on the walls and mantel and in the bits of drapery thrown here and there as if by accident and in the midst of this color and mellowed light bertha moved before him a slender quiet figure making the picture complete it was her quietness which impressed itself upon him more than all else after the first moments when she had uttered her cry on seeing him and had given way in her momentary agitation he had noticed that a curious change fell upon her when she lifted her face from the gate all emotion seemed to have died out of it her voice was quiet one of the things he remembered of their talk was that they had both spoken in voices so low as to be scarcely above a whisper when the breakfast was brought in she took a seat at the table to pour out his coffee and attend to his wants she ate very little herself but he rarely looked up without finding her eyes resting upon him with wistful interest at least she said once i must see that you have a good breakfast the kindest thing you can do this morning is to be hungry please be hungry if you can the consciousness that she was caring for him was a wonderful and touching thing to him the little housewifely acts with which most men are familiar were bewilderingly new to him he had never been on sufficiently intimate social terms with women to receive many of these pretty services at their hands his unsophisticated reverence for everything feminine had worked against him with the reserve which was one of its results it had been his habit to feel that there was no reason why he should be singled out for the bestowal of favors and he had perhaps ignored many through the sheer ignorance of simple and somewhat exaggerated humility to find himself sitting at the table alone with bertha in her new moodbertha quiet and beautifulwas a moving experience to him it was as if they two must have sat there every day for years and had the prospect of sitting so together indefinitely it was the very simplicity and naturalness of it all which stirred him most her old vivid gayety was missing she did not laugh once but her smile was very sweet they talked principally of the children and of the common things about them but there was never a word which did not seem a thing to be cherished and remembered after a while the children were brought down and she took meg upon her knee and jack leaned against her while she told tredennis what they had been doing and the sun creeping through the vines touched her hair and the childs and made a picture of them when she went upstairs she took meg with her holding her little hand and talking to her in pretty maternal fashion and after the two had vanished tredennis found it necessary to pull himself together with a strong effort that he might prove himself equal to the conversational demands made upon him by master jack who had remained behind i will go and see janey again she had said and then perhaps you will pay her a visit when he went up a quarter of an hour later he found his small favorite touchingly glad to see him the fever from which she had been suffering for several days had left her languid and perishablelooking but she roused wonderfully at the sight of him and when he seated himself at her bedside regarded him with adoring admiration finally expressing her innocent conviction that he had grown very much since their last meeting but it doesnt matter she hastened to assure him because i dont mind it and mamma doesnt either when in the course of the morning doctor wentworth arrived he discovered him still sitting by the bedside only janey had crept close to him and fallen asleep clasping both her small hands about his large one and laying her face upon his palm what said the doctor can you do that sort of thing i dont know answered tredennis slowly i never did it before he looked down at the small frail creature and the color showed itself under his bronzed skin i think shes rather fond of meor something he added with navet and i like it she likes it thats evident said the doctor he turned away to have an interview with bertha whom he took to the window at the opposite end of the room and after it was over they came back together she is not so ill as she was yesterday he said and she was not so ill then as you thought her he turned and looked at bertha herself she doesnt need as much care now as you do he said thats my impression what have you been doing with yourself taking care of her she answered since she began to complain of not feeling well he was a bluff kindly fellow with a bluff kindly way and he shook a big forefinger at her you have been carrying her up and down in your arms he said dont deny it no she answered i wont deny it of course he said i know youcarrying her up and down in your arms and singing to her and telling her stories and holding her on your knee when you werent doing anything worse youd do it if she were three times the size she blushed guiltily and looked at janey good heaven he said you women will drive me mad dont let me hear any more about fashionable mothers who kill their children i find my difficulty in fashionable children who kill their mothers and in little simpletons who break down under the sheer weight of their maternal nonsense who was it who nearly died of the measles butbut she faltered deprecatingly i dont think i ever had the measles they werent your measles he said with amiable sternness they were jacks and janeys and megs and so much the worse but she interposed with a very pretty eagerness they got through them beautifully and there wasnt a cold among them there wouldnt have been a cold among them if youd let a couple of sensible nurses take care of them do you suppose im not equal to bringing three children through the measles its all nonsense and sentiment and selfindulgence you like to do it and you do it and as a natural consequence you die of somebody elses measlesor come as near it as possible she blushed as guiltily as before and looked at janey again i think she is very much better she said yes he answered she is better and i want to see you better who is going to help you to take care of her i came to try to do that said tredennis bertha turned to look at him you she exclaimed oh no you are very good but now the worst is over i couldnt should i be in the way he asked she drew back a little for a moment she had changed again and returned to the ordinary conventional atmosphere no she said you know that you would not be in the way but i should scarcely be likely to encroach upon your time in such a manner the doctor laughed he is exactly what you need he said and he would be of more use to you than a dozen nurses he wont stand any of your maternal weakness and he will see that my orders are carried out hell domineer over you and youll be afraid of him you had better let him stay but you must settle it between you after i am gone bertha went downstairs with him to receive a few final directions and when she returned tredennis had gently released himself from janey and had gone to the window where he stood evidently awaiting her do you know he said with his disproportionately stern air when she joined himdo you know why i came here you came she answered because i alarmed you unnecessarily and it seemed that some one must come and you were kind enough to assume the responsibility i came because there was no one else he began she stopped him with a question she had not asked before and he felt that she asked it inadvertently where was laurence arbuthnot she said that is true he replied grimly laurence arbuthnot would have been better no she said he would not have been better she looked up at him with a curious mixture of questioning and defiance in her eyes i dont know why it is that i always manage to make you angry she said i must be very stupid i always know you will be angry before you have done with me when we were downstairs when we were downstairs he put in hotly we were two honest human beings without any barriers of conventional pretence between us and you allowed me to think you meant to take what i had to offer and then suddenly all is changed and the barrier is between us again because you choose to place it there and profess that you must regard me in your pretty civil way as a creature to be considered and treated with form and ceremony thank you for calling it a pretty way she said and yet there was a tone in her low voice which softened his wrath somehowa rather helpless tone which suggested that she had said the words only because she had no other resource and still must utter her faint protest it is for me he went on to come to you with a civil pretence instead of an honest intention i am not sufficiently used to conventionalities to make myself bearable i am always blundering and stumbling no one can feel that more bitterly than i do but you have no right to ignore my claim to do what i can when i might be of use i might be of use because the child is fond of me and in my awkward fashion i can quiet and amuse her as you say no one but yourself can will you tell me she asked frigidly what right i have to permit you to make of yourself aa nursemaid to my child call it what you like he answered speak of it as you like what right does it need i came because his recollection of her desolateness checked him it was not for him to remind her again by his recklessness of speech that her husband had not felt it necessary to provide against contingencies but she filled up the sentence yes you are right she said as you said before there was no one elseno one it chanced to be so he said and why should i not be allowed to fill up the breach for the time being because it is almost absurd she said inconsequently dont you see that no he answered obstinately their eyes met and rested upon each other you dont care she said no i knew you wouldnt she said you never care for anything that is what i like in youand dread dread he said and in the instant he saw that she had changed again her cheeks had flushed and there was upon her lips a smile halfbitter halfsweet i knew you would not go she said as well as i knew that it was only civil in me to suggest that you should you are generous enough to care for me in a way i am not quite used toand you always have your own way have it now have it as long as you are here until you go away i shall do everything you tell me to do and never once oppose you again andperhaps i shall enjoy the novelty there was a chair near her and she put her hand against it as if to steady herself and the color in her face died out as quickly as it had risen i did not want you to go she said you did not want me to go no she answered in a manner more baffling than all the rest more than anything in the world i wanted you to stay there janey is awakening and she went to the bed and kneeled down beside it and drew the child into her arms against her bosom chapter xix from that day until they separated there was no change in her it was scarcely two weeks before their paths diverged again but in looking back upon it afterward it always seemed to tredennis that some vaguely extending length of time must have elapsed between the night when he dismounted at the gate in the moonlight and the morning when he turned to look his last at bertha standing in the sun each morning when she gave him his breakfast in the oldfashioned room and he watched her as she moved about or poured out his coffee or talked to meg or jack who breakfasted with them each afternoon when janey was brought down to lie on the sofa and she sat beside her singing pretty foolish songs to her and telling her stories each evening when the child fell asleep in her arms as she sang each brief hour later on when the air had cooled and she went out to sit on the porch or walk under the treesseemed an experience of indefinite length not to be marked by hours nor by sunrise and sunset but by emotions her gentle interest in his comfort continued just what it had been the first day he had been so moved by it and his care for her she accepted with a gratitude which might have been sweet to any man having long since established his rank in janeys affections it was easy for him to make himself useful in his masculine fashion during her convalescence his strong arms became the childs favorite restingplace when she was tired of her couch he could carry her up and down the room without wearying she liked his long steady strides and the sound of his deep voice and his unconscious air of command disposed of many a difficulty when bertha herself was the nurse he watched her faithfully and when he saw in her any signs of fatigue he took her place at once and from the first she made no protest against his quietly persistent determination to lighten her burdens perhaps through the fact that they were so lightened or through her relief from her previous anxiety she seemed to grow stronger as the child did her color became brighter and steadier and her look of lassitude and weariness left her one morning having been beguiled out of doors by jack and meg tredennis heard her laugh in a tone that made him rise from his chair by janey and go to the open window he reached it just in time to see her run like a deer across the sundappled grass after a bright ball meg had thrown to her with an infantile aimlessness which precluded all possibility of its being caught she made a graceful dart at it picked it up and came back under the trees tossing it in the air and catching it again with a deft turn of hand and wrist she was flushed with the exercise and for the moment almost radiant she held her dress closely about her figure her face was upturned and her eyes were uplifted and she was as unconscious as meg herself when she saw him she threw the ball to the children and came forward to the window does janey want me she asked no she is asleep do you want me i want to see you go on with your game it is not my game she answered smiling it is jacks and megs suppose you come and join them it will fill them with rapture and i shall like to look on when he came out she sat down under a tree leaning against the trunk and watched him her eyes following the swift flight of the ball high into the blue above them as he flung it upward among the delighted clamor of the children he had always excelled in sports and feats of strength and in this simple feat of throwing the ball his physical force and grace displayed themselves to decided advantage the ball went up as an arrow flies from the bow hurtling through the air until it was little more than a black speck to the eye when it came back to earth he picked it up and threw it again and each time it seemed to reach a greater height than the last that is very fine she said i like to see you do it why he asked pausing i like the force you put into it she answered it scarcely seems like play i did not know that he said but i am afraid i am always in earnest that is my misfortune it is a great misfortune she said dont be in earnest with a gesture as if she would sweep the suggestion away with her hand go on with your game let us be like children and play our holiday will be over soon enough and we shall have to return to washington and effete civilization is it a holiday he asked her yes she answered now that janey is getting better i am deliberately taking a holiday nothing rests me so much as forgetting things are you forgetting things he asked yes she replied looking away everything then the children demanded his attention and he returned to his ballthrowing if she was taking a holiday with deliberate intention she did it well in a few days janey was well enough to be carried out and laid on one of the two hammocks swung beneath the trees and then far the greater part of the day was spent in the open air to tredennis it seemed that bertha made the most of every hour whether she swung in her hammock with her face upturned to the trees or sat reading or talking as she worked with the decorous little basket at which she had jeered upon her knee he was often reminded in these days of what the professor had said of her tenderness for her children it revealed itself in a hundred trifling ways in her touch in her voice in her almost unconscious habit of caring for them and more than all in a certain pretty inconvenient fashion they had of getting close to her and clinging about her at all sorts of inopportune moments once when she had run to comfort meg who had fallen down and had come back to the hammock carrying her in her arms he was betrayed into speaking i did not thinkhe began and then he checked himself guiltily you did not think she repeated he began to recognize his indiscretion i beg your pardon he said i was going to make a blunder she sat down in the hammock with the child in her arms you were going to say that you did not think i cared so much for my children she said gently do you suppose i did not know that well perhaps it was not a blunder perhaps it is only one of my pretences dont speak like that he implored the next instant he saw that tears had risen in her eyes no she said i will not why should i it is not true i love them very much however bad you are i think you must love your children of course my saying that i loved them might go for nothing but dont you see she went on with a pathetic thrill in her voice that they love me they would not love me if i did not care for them i know that he returned remorsefully it was only one of my blunders as i said but you have so bewildered me sometimes when i first returned i could not understand you it was as if i found myself face to face with a creature i had never seen before you did she said that was it perhaps i never was the creature you fancied me dont say that he replied since i have been here i have seen you as i used to dream of you when i sat by the fire in my quarters in the long winter nights did you ever think of me like that she said slowly and with surprise in her face he had not thought of what he was revealing and he did not think of it now i never forgot you he said never it seems very strangeto hear that now she said i never dreamed of your thinking of meafterwards you seemed to take so little notice of me it is my good fortune he said with a touch of bitterness that i never seem to take notice of anything i suppose she went on that you remembered me because you were lonely at first and there was no one else to think of perhaps that was it he answered after all she said it was naturalonly i never thought it was as natural that you should forget as that i should remember he said her face had been slightly averted and she turned it toward him but i did not forget she said you did not no at first it is true i scarcely seemed to have time for anything but to be happy and enjoy the days as they went by oh what bright days they were and how far away they seem perhaps if i had known that they would come to an end really i might have tried to make them pass more slowly they went slowly for me he said i was glad when they were over were you so very lonely she asked yes would it have pleased you if i had written to you when papa did did you ever think of doing it he asked the expression dawning in her eyes was a curious onethere was a suggestion of dread in it once she replied i began a letter to you it was on a dull day when i was restless and unhappy for the first time in my life and suddenly i thought of you and i felt as if i should like to speak to you againand i began the letter but you did not finish it no i only wrote a few lines and then stopped i said to myself that it was not likely that you had remembered me in the way i had remembered you so i laid my letter aside i saw it only a few days ago among some old papers in my trunk you have it yet i did not know that i had it until i saw it the other day it seems strange that it should have lain hidden all these years and then have come to light i laid it away thinking i might find courage to finish it sometime there are only a few lines but they prove that my memory was not so bad as you thought he had been lying on the grass a few feet away from her as she talked he had looked not at her but at the bits of blue sky showing through the interlacing greenness of the trees above him now he suddenly half rose and leaned upon his elbow will you give it to me he said do you want it it is only a yellow scrap of paper i think it belongs to me he said i have a right to it she got up without a word and went toward the house leading meg by the hand tredennis watched her retreating figure in silence until she went in at the door his face set and his lips pressed together then he flung himself backward and lay at full length again seeing only the bright green of the leaves and the bits of intense blue between it was well that he was alone his sense of impotent anguish was more than he had strength to bear and it wrung a cry from him my god he said my god he was still lying so when bertha returned she had not been away many minutes and she came back alone with the unfinished letter in her hand he took it from her without comment and looked at it the faint odor of heliotrope he knew so well floated up to him as he bent over the paper as she had said there were only a few lines and she had evidently been dissatisfied with them and irresolute about them for several words were erased as if with girlish impatience at the head of the page was written first dear philip and then dear captain tredennis and there were two or three different opening sentences as he read each one through the erasures he thought he understood the innocent unconscious appeal in it and he seemed to see the girlface bending above it changing from eagerness to uncertainty and from uncertainty to the timidity which had made her despair i wish you had finished it he said i wish i had she answered and then she added vaguely if it would have pleased you he folded it and put it in his breastpocket and laid down once more and it was not referred to again it seemed to tredennis at least that there never before had been such a day as the one which followed after a night of rain the intense heat subsided leaving freshness of verdure skies of the deepest clearest blue and a balmy luxurious sweetness in the air deliciously pungent with the odors of cedar and pine when he came down in the morning and entered the breakfast room he found it empty the sunlight streamed through the latticework of vines and the cloth was laid with the pretty blue cups and saucers in waiting but bertha was not there and fancying she had risen later than usual he went out into the open air the next morning he was to return to washington there was no absolute need of his remaining longer the child had so far recovered that at the doctors suggestion in a few days she was to be removed to the seaside nevertheless it had cost him a struggle to arrive at his decision and it had required resolution to announce it to bertha it would have been far easier to let the days slip by as they would and when he told her of his intended departure and she received the news with little more than a few words of regret at it and gratitude for the services he had rendered he felt it rather hard to bear if it had been arbuthnot he thought she would not have borne it so calmly and then he reproached himself bitterly for his inconsistency did i come here to make her regret me when i left her he said what a fool a man can make of himself if he gives way to his folly as he descended the steps of the porch he saw her and he had scarcely caught sight of her before she turned and came toward him he recognized at once that she had made a change in her dress that it was no longer such as she had worn while in attendance upon janey and that it had a delicate holiday air about it notwithstanding its simplicity was there ever such a day before she said as she came to him i thought not as i looked out of my window he replied it is your last she said and i should like you to remember it as being pleasanter than all the rest though she added thoughtfully the rest have been pleasant then she looked up at him with a smile do you see my gala attire she said it was janey who suggested it she thinks i have not been doing myself justice since you have been here that he said regarding her seriously is a very beautiful gown butwith an entirely respectful sense of inadequacy of expressionyou always wear beautiful gowns i believe did mr arbuthnot tell you so she said or was it miss jessup they breakfasted together in the sunny room and after breakfast they rambled out together it was she who led and he who followed with a curious dreamy pleasure in all he did and in every beauty around him even in the unreal passiveness of his very mood itself he had never been so keenly conscious of things before everything impressed itself upon himthe blue of the sky the indolent sway of the leaves the warmth of the air and the sweet odors in it the broken song of the birds the very sound of berthas light tread as they walked i am going to give the day to you she had said and you shall see the childrens favorite campingground on the hill before janey was ill we used to go there almost every day behind the house was a woodcovered hill and halfway up was the favored spot it was a sort of bower formed by the clambering of a great vine from one tree to another making a canopy under which through a break in the trees could be seen the most perfect view of the country below and the bend of the river the ground was carpeted with moss and there was a mosscovered rock to lean against which was still ornamented with the acorn cups and saucers with which the children had entertained their family of dolls on their last visit see said bertha taking one of them up when she sat down when we were here last we had a teaparty and it was poor janeys headache which brought it to a close at the height of the festivities she laid down her best doll and came to me to cry and we were obliged to carry her home poor child said tredennis he saw only her face upturned under the shadow of the white hata pretty hat with small soft downy plumes upon it and a general air of belonging to the great world sit down said bertha or you may lie down if you like and look at the river and not speak to me at all he lay down stretching his great length upon the soft moss and clasping his hands beneath his head bertha clasped her hands about her knee and leaned slightly forward looking at the view as if she had never seen it before is this a dream tredennis said languidly at last i think it must be yes she answered that is why the air is so warm and fragrant and the sky so blue and the scent of the pines so delicious it is all different when one is awake that is why i am making the most of every second and am determined to enjoy it to the very utmost that is what i am doing he said it is not a good plan as a rule she began and then checked herself no she said i wont say that it is a worldly and washingtonian sentiment i will save it until next winter dont save it at all he said it is an unnatural sentiment it isnt true and you do not really believe it it is safer she said he lay still a moment looking down the hillside through the trees at the broad sweep of the river bend and the purple hills beyond bertha he said at last sometimes i hate the man who has taught you all this she plucked at the redtipped moss at her side for a second or so before she replied she showed no surprise or hurry when she spoke laurence arbuthnot she said sometimes i hate him too but it is only for a momentwhen he tells me the simple deadly truth and i know it is the truth and wish i did not she threw the little handful of moss down the hill as if she threw something away with it but this is not being happy she said let us be happy i will be happy janey is better and all my anxiety is over and it is such a lovely day and i have put on my favorite gown to celebrate it in look at the color of the hills over therelisten to those doves in the pines how warm and soft the wind is and how the scent of my carnations fills the air ah what a bright world it is after all she broke into singing softly and half under breath a snatch of a gay little song tredennis had never heard her sing it before and thought it wonderfully sweet but she sang no more than a line or two and then turned to him with a smile in her eyes now she said it is your turn talk to me tell me about your life in the west tell me all you did the first year and beginbegin just where you left me the night you bade me goodby at the carriagedoor i am afraid it would not be a very interesting story he said it would interest me she answered there are campfires in it and scalps and indians and probably warpaths and her voice falling a little i want to discover why it was that you always seemed to be so much alone and sat and thought in that dreary way by the fire in your quarters it seems to me that you have been a great deal alone i have been a great deal alone he said that is true it must have been so even when you were a child she went on i heard you tell janey once that when you were her age you belonged to no one i dont like to think of that it touches the maternal side of me it makes me think of jack suppose jack belonged to no one and you were not so old as jack i wonder if you were at all like him and how you looked i wish there was a picture of you i could see he had never regarded himself as an object likely to interest in any degree and had lost many of the consolations and excitements of the more personal kind thereby and to find that she had even given a sympathetic thought to the faraway childhood whose desolateness he himself had never quite analyzed at once touched and bewildered him i have not been without friends he said but i am sure no one ever gave much special thought to me perhaps it is because men are scarcely likely to give such thoughts to men and i have not known women my parents died before i was a year old and i dont think any one was ever particularly fond of me people did not dislike me but they passed me over i never wondered at it but i saw it i knew there was something a little wrong with me but i could not understand what it was i know now i was silent and could not express what i thought and felt oh she cried and was there no one to help you there was no thought of him as a fullgrown person in the exclamation it was a womanish outcry for the child whose desolate childhood seemed for the moment to be an existence which had never ended i know about children she said and what suffering there is for them if they are left alone they can say so little and we can say so much havent i seen them try to explain things when they were at a disadvantage and overpowered by the sheer strength of some fullgrown creature havent i seen them make their impotent little struggle for words and fail and look up with their helpless eyes and see the uselessness of it and break down into their poor little shrieks of wrath and grief the happiest of them go through it sometimes and those who are left alonewhy didnt some woman see and understandsome woman ought to have seen and cared for you tredennis found himself absorbed in contemplation of her he was not sure that there were not tears in her eyes and yet he could hardly believe it possible that is all true he said you understand it better than i did i understood the feeling no better than i understood the reason for it i understand it because i have children she answered and because i have watched them and loved them and would give my hearts blood for them to have children makes one like a tiger at times the passion one can feel through the wrongs of a child is something awful one can feel it for any childfor all children but for ones own she ended with a sharply drawn breath the sudden uncontrollable fierceness which seemed to have made her in a secondin her soft white gown and lace and her pretty hat with its air of good societya small wild creature whom no law of man could touch affected him like an electric shock perhaps the thrill it gave him revealed itself in his look and she saw it for she seemed to become conscious of herself and her mood with a start she made a quick uneasy movement and effort to recover herself i beg your pardon she said with a half laugh but i couldnt help it it wasand she paused a second for reflectionit was the primeval savage in me and she turned and clasped her hands about her knee again resuming her attitude of attention even while the folds of lace on her bosom were still stirred by her quick breathing but though she might resume her attitude it was not so easy to resume the calmness of her mood having been stirred once it was less difficult to be stirred again when he began at last to tell the story of his life on the frontier if his vanity had been concerned he would have felt that she made a good listener but his vanity had nothing to do with his obedience to her wish he made as plain a story as his material would allow and also made persistent though scarcely successful efforts to avoid figuring as a hero he was indeed rather abashed to find on recurring to facts that he had done so much to bring himself to the front he even found himself at last taking refuge in the subterfuge of speaking of himself in the third person as one of the party when recounting a specially thrilling adventure in which he discovered that he had unblushingly distinguished himself it was an exciting story of the capture of some white women by the indians at a critical juncture when but few men could be spared from the fort and the fact that the deadly determination of one of the party that no harm should befall them was not once referred to in words and only expressed itself in daring and endurance for which every one but himself was supposed to be responsible did not detract from its force this one of the party who seemed to have sworn a silent oath that he would neither eat nor sleep nor rest until he had accomplished his end of rescuing the captives and who had been upon the track almost as soon as the news had reached the fort and who had followed it night and day with his hastily gathered and altogether insufficient little band and at last had overtaken the captors and through sheer courage and desperate valor had overpowered them and brought back their prisoners unharmedthis one of the party silent and wouldbe insignificant was in spite of himself a figure to stir the blood it was you who did that she said when he had finished i was only one of the company he answered abashed and obeyed orders of course a man obeys orders chapter xx when he took her hand to assist her to rise he felt it tremble in his own it was not a pleasant story he said i ought not to have told it to you they scarcely spoke at all as they descended he did not understand his own unreasoning happiness what reason was there for it after all if he had argued the matter he was in the mood to have said that what he gained in the strange sweetness of the flying moments could only hurt himself and was enough in itself to repay him for any sense of pain and loss which might follow but he did not argue at all in laurence arbuthnots place he would scarcely have given himself the latitude he was giving himself now it is safe enough for me was the sharpedged thought which had cut through all others once or twice it is safe enough for me to be as happy as i may but he forgot this as they went down the hill side by side for the time being he only felt and each glance he turned upon berthas downcast face gave him cause to realize what intensity his feelings had reached and wakened him to that sudden starting of pulse and heart which is almost a pain when they reached the house bertha went in search of janey she remained with her for about half an hour and then came out to the hammock with her workbasket the carnations at her waist were crushed a little and something of the first freshness of her holiday air was gone she held a letter in her hand which she had evidently been reading she had not returned it to its envelope and it was still half open it is from richard she said after she had taken her seat in the hammock it was brought in from the postoffice at lowville about an hour ago from richard he said he is coming home i suppose no she answered looking down at the closely written sheetshe is not coming yet he was wise enough not to take a serious view of janeys case he is very encouraging and expresses his usual confidence in my management there was nothing like bitterness in her voice and it struck him that he had never seen so little expression of any kind in her face she opened the letter and looked over the first page of it he has a great many interesting things to say she went on and he is very enthusiastic about what tredennis asked she looked up about the westoria lands she answered he finds all sorts of complications of good fortune connected with them i dont understand them all by any means i am not good at business but it seems as though the persons who own the westoria lands will be able to command the resources of the entire surrounding countryif the railroad is carried through of course it all depends upon the railroad and the railroad suggested tredennis depends upon i dont know she replied on several people i suppose i wish it depended on me why said tredennis she smiled slightly and rather languidly i should like to feel that anything so important depended on me she said i should like the sense of power i am very fond of power i once heard it said that you had a great deal of it tredennis said far more than most women she smiled again a trifle less languidly that is laurence arbuthnot she observed i always recognize his remarks when i hear them he did not mean a compliment exactly either though it sounds rather like one he has a theory that i affect people strongly and he chooses to call that power but it is too trivial it is only a matter of pleasing or displeasing and i am obliged to exert myself it does not enable me to bestow things and be a potentate i think that to be a potentate might console one for a great many thingsand for the lack of a great many if you cant take it must distract your attention to be able to give i do not like to hear you speak as if the chief thing to be desired was the ability to distract ones self tredennis said she paused a second then she said i will not speak so now today i will do nothing you do not like then she added as it is your last day i wish to retrieve myself what have you to retrieve he asked myself she answered as i said she spread the letter upon her lap and gave her attention to it isnt it rather like richard she said that when he begins to write he invariably writes a letter like that theoretically he detests correspondence but when he once begins his letter always interests him and even awakens him to a kind of enthusiasm so that instead of being brief he tells one everything he has written twelve pages here and it is all delightful that is a wonderful thing to do remarked tredennis but it does not surprise me in richard no she replied richard can always interest himself or rather he does not interest himselfit is that he is interested without making an effort that is his strong point she replaced the letter in the envelope and laid it in the basket from which she took a strip of lacework beginning to employ herself with it in a manner more suggestive of graceful leisure than of industrious intention it seemed to accentuate the fact that they had nothing to do but let the day drift by in luxurious idleness but tredennis could not help seeing that for a while the tone of her mood so to speak was lowered and yet curiously enough nothing of his own dreamy exaltation died away the subtle shadow which seemed to have touched her for a moment only intensified his feeling of tenderness in fact there were few things which would not have so intensified it his mental condition was one which must advance by steady silent steps of development to its climax he was not by nature a reckless man but he was by no means unconscious that there was something very like recklessness in his humor this last day as for the day itself it also advanced by steady steps to its climax unfolding its beauties like a perfect flower the fresh rainwashed morning drifted into a warm languorous noon followed by an afternoon so long and golden that it seemed to hold within itself the flower and sun shade and perfume of a whole summer tredennis had never known so long an afternoon he thought and yet it was only lengthened by the strange delight each hour brought with it and was all too short when it was over it seemed full of minute details which presented themselves to his mind at the time as discoveries bertha worked upon her lace and he watched her waiting for the moment when she would look up at him and then look down again with a quick or slow droop of the lids which impressed itself upon him as a charm in itself there was a little ring she wore which made itself a memory to hima simple turquoise which set upon the whiteness of her hand like a blue flower he saw with a new sense of recognition every fold and line of her thin white drapery the slight girlish roundness of her figure the dashes of brightness in the color of her hair the smallness of the gold thimble on her finger her grace when she rose or sat down or rested a little against the red cushions in her hammock touching the ground now and then with her slender slipper and swaying lightly to and fro do you know he said to her once as he watched her do this do you knowwith absorbed hesitationthat i feel as ifas if i had never really seen you until todayuntil this afternoon you seem somehow to look different i am not sure she answered that i have ever seen you before but it is not because you look different why is it he asked quite ready to relinquish any idea of his own in the pursuit of one of hers she looked down a moment today she said i dont think you have anything against me you think he returned that i have usually something against you yes she answered will you tell me what you think it is i do not need to tell you she said you know so welland it would rather hurt me to put it into words hurt you he repeated i should be harder than i am she returned if it had not hurt me to know it myselfthough i would not tell you that at any other time than now i dare say i shall repent it tomorrow she said no he answered you wont repent it dont repent it he felt the vehemence of his speech too late to check it when he ended she was silent and it was as if suddenly a light veil had fallen upon her face and he felt that too and tried to be calmer no he repeated you must not repent it is i who must repent that i have given you even a little pain it is hard on me to know that i have done that the afternoon stretched its golden length to a sunset which cast deep velvet shadows upon the grass and filled the air with an enchanted mellow radiance everything took a tinge of goldthe green of the pines and the broadleaved chestnut trees the gray and brown of their trunks the red of the old house the honeysuckle and virginia creeper clambering about it the birds flying homeward to their nests when the rich clearness and depth of color reached its greatest beauty bertha folded her strip of lace and laid it in the little basket we ought simply to sit and watch this she said i dont think we ought even to speak it will be all over in a few minutes and we shall never see it again no said tredennis with a sad prescience nor anything at all like it ah was berthas rejoinder to me it has always seemed that it is not the best of such hours that one does see others like them i have seen the sun set like this before i have not he said as he stood silent in the stillness and glow a faint rather bitter smile touched his lips and faded out he found himself he fancied face to face with laurence arbuthnot again he was sharing the sunset with him there were ten chances against one that he had shared the day with him also bertha sat in the deepening enchanted light with a soft dreamy look he thought it meant that she remembered something but he felt that the memory was one to which she yielded herself without reluctance or that she was happy in it at last she lifted her eyes to his and their expression was very sweet in its entire gentleness and submission to the spell of the moment see she said the sun has slipped behind the pines already we have only a few seconds left and then even as they looked at the great fire made brighter by the dark branches through which they saw it it sank a little lower and a little lower and with an expiring flame was gone bertha drew a quick breath there was a second or so of silence and then she stirred it is over she said and it has been like watching some one die only sadder she took up the little workbasket and rose from her seat it seems a pity to speak of mundane things she said but i think we must go in to tea when the children were taken upstairs for the night bertha went with them it had been her habit to do this during their sojourn in the country and naturally janey had been her special care of late i cannot often do such things when i am in washington she had explained once to tredennis and i really like it as much as they do it is part of the holiday as he sat on the porch in the starlight tredennis could hear her voice mingling with the childrens the windows were wide open she was moving from one room to the other and two or three times she laughed in answer to some childish speech it was one of these laughs which at last caused tredennis to leave his seat and go to the place under the trees where the hammocks were swung and which was far more the place of general rendezvous than the parlor windows from this point he could see the corner of the brightly lighted room near the window where it was berthas custom to sit in her low chair and rock janey to sleep when she was restless she was doing it tonight he could see the childs head lying on her bosom and her own bent so that her cheek rested against the bright hair in a few moments all was quiet and she began to sing and as she sang swaying to and fro tredennis looked and listened without stirring but though it was gay no longer he liked to hear her song and to his mind the moments in which he stood in the odorous dark looking upward at the picture framed by the vinehung window were among the tenderest of the day it was his fate to be full of a homely sentiment which found its pleasure in unsophisticated primary virtues and affections any deep passion he might be moved by would necessarily have its foundation in such elements he was slow at the subtle analysis whose final result is frequently to rob such simplicities of their value his tendency was to reverence for age tenderness to womanhood and childhood faithfulness to all things there was something boyish and quixotic in his readiness to kindle in defence of any womanly weakness or pain nothing he had ever said or done had so keenly touched and delighted professor herrick as his fiery denunciation one night of a man who was the hero of a scandalous story there had been no qualifications of his sweeping assertion that in such cases it must be the man who had earned the right to bear the blame it is always the man who is in the wrong he had cried flushing fiercely coward and devilit is in the nature of things that he should be let him stand at the front and take what follows if he has ever been a man for an hour and the professor had flushed alsothe fainter flush of ageand had given some silent moments to reflection afterwards as he sat gazing at the fire it was these primitive beliefs and sentiments which stirred within him now he would not have lost one low note of the little song for the world and he had left his seat only that he might see what he saw nowher arm about her child her cheek pressed against its hair it was not long before her little burden fell asleep he saw but she did not rise as soon as this happened she sat longer and her song went on finally dying away into brooding silence which reigned for some time before she moved at length she lifted her face gently she looked down at the child a few seconds and slowly changed the position in which she lay with an indescribably tender and cautious movement then she rose and after standing an instant holding her in her folding arms crossed the room and passed out of sight tredennis turned and began mechanically to arrange the cushions in the hammock he felt sure she would come tonight and talk to him for a little while at least it was not very long before he recognized her white figure in the doorway and went toward it they are all asleep she said in a voice whose hushed tone seemed to belong half to the slumber she had left and half to the stillness of the hour will you come out to the hammock he said or will you sit here she came forward and descended the steps i will sit in the hammock she replied i like the trees above me they went down the path together and reaching the hammock she took her usual seat among its cushions and he his upon a rough rustic bench near her i was thinking before you came he said of what you said this afternoon of my having something against you i wont deny that there has been something in my thoughts of you that often has been miserable and you were right in saying it was not in them today it has not been in them for several days what i was thinking just now was that it could never be in them again she did not stir dont you see he went on i cant go back if there had been nothing but today i could not go backbeyond today it would always be a factor in my arguments about you i should always say to myself when things seemed to go wrong there was no mistake about that dayshe was real then and i should trust you against everything todayand in the other days tooi have seen you as you are and because of that i should trust you in spite of everything oh she cried dont trust me too much there was anguish in the sound and he recognized it i cant trust you too much he answered with obstinacy no honest human being can trust another honest human being too much am i an honest human being she said i shall believe you one until the end he returned that is saying a great deal was her reply listen he said you know i am not like arbuthnot and the rest if i were to try to be like them i should only fail but though you never told me that i could be of any use to you and you never will i shall know if the time should comeand i shall wait for it have we not all of us something that belongs to ourselves and not to the worldit may be a pleasure or a pain it does not matter which no she put in it does not matter which it does not matter to those on the outside he went on it only matters to us and i think we all have it to bear even i what she said you too yes he answered i too but it does not matter if no one is hurt but ourselves there are so many things that do not matter she said to say that only means that there is no help that is true was his reply and i did not intend to speak of myself but of you no she said dont speak of medont speak of me why not he asked because i tell you that you are trusting me too much go on he said she had covered her face with her hands and held them so for a little while then she let them fall slowly to her lap if i tell you the truth she said it will not be my fault if you still trust me too much i dont want it to be my fault the worst of me is that i am neither bad nor good and that i cannot live without excitement i am always changing and trying experiments when one experiment fails i try another they all fail after a while or i get tired of them poor child he said she stirred slightly one of the flowers fell from her belt upon her lap and she let it lie there it does not matter she answered all that matters is that you should know the truth about methat i am not to be depended upon and that above all you need not be surprised at any change you see in me when we meet again in washington he suggested she hesitated a moment and then made her response when we meet again in washington or at any time are you warning me he inquired yes was her reply and he recognized that in spite of her effort it was faintly given i am warning you he looked down at the grass and then at her the determined squareness of chin which was one of the chief characteristics of his face struck her as being more marked than she had ever seen it it is unnecessary he said i wont profit by it he rose abruptly from his seat and there was meaning in the movement and in his eyes looking down upon her deep and dark in the faint light you cannot change me he said and you would have to change me before your warning would carry weight change yourself as you liketry as many experiments as you likeyou cannot change the last ten days even as the words were uttered the day was ended for them as they had never once thought of its ending there fell upon the quiet the sound of horses feet approaching at a rapid pace and coming to a stop before the gate the dogs came bounding and baying from the house and above their deepmouthed barking a voice made itself heard calling to some one to come outa voice they both knew tredennis turned toward it with a sharp movement do you hear that he exclaimed yes said bertha and suddenly her manner was calm almost to coldnessit is laurence arbuthnot and papa is with him let us go and meet them and in a few seconds they were at the gate and the professor was explaining their unexpected appearance it is all mr arbuthnots fault my dear he said he knew that i wished to see you and having an idea that i was not strong enough to make the journey alone he suddenly affected to have business in this vicinity it was entirely untrue and i was not in the least deceived but i humored him as i begin to find it best to do and allowed him to bring me to you arbuthnot had dismounted and was fastening his horse to the gate and he replied by one of the gayest and most discriminatingly pitched of the invaluable laughs it is no use he said the professor does not believe in me he refuses to recognize in me anything but hollow mockery bertha went to him there was something hurried in her movement it was as if she was strangely almost feverishly glad to see him she went to his horses head and laid her hand on the creatures neck that takes me back to washington she said to washington it was like you to come and i am glad butyou should have come a little sooner and as she stood there faintly smiling up at him her hand was trembling like a leaf chapter xxi it was newyears day and his excellency the president had had several months in which to endeavor to adjust himself to the exigencies of his position though whether he had accomplished this with a result of entire satisfaction to himself and all parties concerned and unconcerned had perhaps unfortunately not been a matter of record according to a timehonored custom he had been placed at the slight disadvantage of being called upon to receive from time to time the opinions of the nation concerning himself without the opportunity of expressing with any degree of publicity his own opinions regarding the nation no bold spirit having as yet suggested that such a line of procedure might at least be embellished with the advantage of entire novelty apart from the possibility of its calling forth such originality and force of statement as would present to the national mind questions never before discussed and perhaps not wholly unimportant all had however been done which could be done by a nation justly distinguished for its patriotic consideration for and courtesy toward the fortunate persons elevated to the position of representing its dignity at home and abroad nothing which could add to that dignity had been neglected no effort which could place it in its proper light and remove all difficulty from the pathway of the figure endeavoring creditably to support it had been spared the character of the successful candidate for presidential office having been during the campaign effectually disposed ofhis morals having been impugned his honor rent to tatters his intellectual capacity pronounced far below the lowest averageunited good feeling was the result and there seemed little more to attain his past had been exhausted every event of his political career and domestic life had been held up to public derision laudation and criticism it had been successfully proved that his education had been entirely neglected and that his advantages had been marvellous that he had read greek at the tender age of four years and that he had not learned to read at all until he attained his majority that his wife had taught him his letters and that he had taught his wife to spell that he was a liar a forger and a thief that he was a model of virtue probity and honoreach and all of which incontrovertible facts had been public property and a source of national pride and delight after the election however the fact that he had had a past at all had ceased to be of any moment whatever a futureof four yearslay before him and must be utilized after that the deluge the opposing party sneered vilified and vaunted themselves in the truth of their predictions concerning his incapacity the nonopposing party advised lauded cautioned mildly discouraged and in a most human revulsion of feeling showed their unprejudiced frankness by openly condemning on frequent occasions the head of the nation having appointed an official from among his immediate supporters there arose a clamor of adverse criticism upon a course which lowered the gifts of his sacred office to the grade of mere payment for value received having made a choice from without the circle he called down upon himself frantic accusations of ingratitude to those to whom he owed all there lay before him the agreeable alternatives of being a renegade or a monument of bribery and corruption and if occasionally these alternatives lost for a moment their attractiveness and the head of the nation gave way to a sense of perplexity and was guilty of forming in secret a vague wish that the head of the nation was on some other individuals shoulders or even went to the length of wishing that the head upon his own shoulders was his own property and not a football for the vivacious strength of the nation to expend itself uponif this occurred though it is by no means likely it certainly revealed a weakness of character and inadequacy to the situation which the nation could not have failed to condemn the very reasonable prophecymade by the party whose candidate had not been electedthat the government must inevitably go to destruction and the country to perdition had through some singular oversight on the part of the powers threatened not been fulfilled after waiting in breathless suspense for the occurrence of these catastrophes and finding that they had apparently been postponed until the next election the government had drawn a sigh of relief and the country had gained courage to bestir itself cheerfully with a view to such perquisites as might be obtained by active effort and a strong sense of general personal worthiness and fitness for any position there had descended upon the newly elected ruler an avalanche of seekers for office a respectable number of whom laid in his hands the future salvation of their souls and bodies and generously left to him the result he found himself suddenly established as the guardian of the widow the orphan and the friendless and required to repair fortunes or provide them as the case might be at a moments notice his sympathies were appealed to his interests his generosity as an altogether omnipotent power in whose hands all things lay and whose word was naturally law upon all occasions great or small and any failure on his part to respond to the entirely reasonable requests preferred was very properly laid to a tendency to abandoned scheming or to the heartless indifference of the great which decision disposed of all difficulties in the argument apart from such trivial ones as were left to the portion of the delinquent and were not referred to being called upon in his selection of his cabinet to display the judgment of solomon the diplomacy of talleyrand and the daring of napoleon and above all to combine like powers in each official chosen he might have faltered but for the assistance proffered him from all sides this and the fact that there was no lack of the qualifications required supported him each day some monument of said qualifications and others too numerous to mention was presented to his notice to propitiate the south it was suggested that he should appoint a to secure the north b to control the east c to sweep the west d and to unite the country e circumstances having finally led him to decide upon g the government appeared to be in jeopardy again butpossibly through having made use of its numerous opportunities of indulging in acrobatic efforts in the direction of losing its balance and regaining it again in an almost incredible mannerit recovered from the shock and even retained its equilibrium upon finding itself in the end saddled with a cabinet whose selection was universally acknowledged to be a failure when it was not denounced as a crime on this particular new years day there were few traces on the social surface of the disasters which so short a time before had threatened to engulf all washington wore an aspect even gayer than usual the presidential reception began the day in its most imposing manner lines of carriages thronged the drive before the white house and the diplomatists statesmen officials and glittering beings in naval and military uniform who descended from them were possibly cheered and encouraged by the comments of the lookerson who knew them and their glories and their shortcomings by heart the comments were not specially loud however that which in an english crowd takes the form of amiable or unamiable clamor in an american gathering of a like order resolves itself into a serene readiness of remark which exalts or disposes of a dignity with equal impartiality and an ingenuous fearlessness of any consequence whatever which would seem to argue that all men are born free and some equal though the last depends entirely upon circumstances each vehicle having drawn up deposited upon the stone steps of the broad portico a more or less picturesque or interesting personage now it was the starred and ribboned representative of some european court again a calmvisaged japanese or chinese official in all the splendor of flowing robes and brilliant color and again a man in citizens clothes whose unimposing figure represented such political eminence as to create more stir among the lookerson than all the rest among equipages there drove up at length a rather elegant little coup from which when its door was opened there sprang lightly to the stone steps the graceful figure of a young man followed by an elder one the young fellow who was talking with much animation turned an exhilaratingly bright face upon the crowd about him on the whole i rather like it he said oh responded his companion as to that you like everything i never saw such a fellow the younger man laughed quite joyously there is a great deal of truth in that he said and i dont suppose you will deny that it is an advantage an advantage repeated the other by jupiter i should think it was an advantage now how long do you think this fellow will keep us waiting when we want him oh was the answer he is mrs amorys coachman you know and there isnt a doubt that he has had excellent training she isnt fond of waiting no said the other with a peculiar smile i should fancy she wasnt well i guess well go in they turned to do so and found themselves near a tall man in uniform who almost immediately turned also and revealed the soldierly visage of colonel tredennis he made a quick movement forward which seemed to express some surprise what amory he exclaimed you here too i was not at all sure that you had returned i am scarcely sure myself yet answered richard as he shook hands it only happened last night but bertha has been home a week is it possible you havent seen her i have not seen anybody lately said tredennis and i did not know that she had returned until i read her name in the list of those who would receive oh of course she will receive said richard and planefield and iyou have met senator planefield how do you do said senator planefield without any special manifestation of delight tredennis bowed and richard went on airily as they made their way in planefield and i have been sent out to do duty and our list extends from capitol hill to georgetown heights and he said senator planefield professes to enjoy the prospect why not said richard it is a bright bracing day and there is something exhilarating in driving from house to house to find ones self greeted at each by a roomful of charming womenmost of them pretty some of them brilliant all of them well dressed and in holiday spirits it is delightful do you find it delightful inquired planefield turning with some abruptness to tredennis i am obliged to own that i dont shine in society answered tredennis he knew there was nothing to resent in the question but he was conscious of resenting something in the man himself his big prosperouslooking body and darkly florid face with its heavy handsome outlines and keen bold eyes had impressed him unpleasantly from the first and on each occasion of their meeting the impression seemed to deepen well amory shines was his response and so does mrs amory we are to drop in and see her shine as often as we happen to be in the neighborhood through the day they had reached the threshold of the receptionroom by this time and richard catching the last words turned and spoke of course you will be there yourself in the course of the day he said we shall possibly meet youand bytheby you will see mrs sylvestre she arrived two days ago when they came out again richard was in more buoyant spirits than before the lighted rooms the brilliant dresses the many faces he knew or did not know the very crush itself had acted upon him like a fine wind he issued forth into the light of day again girded and eager for his days work there is nothing like washington he announced and especially nothing like washington at the beginning of the season just at the outset when one is meeting people for the first time since their return they actually have the air of being glad to see one and a man has a delightful evanescent sense of being somehow positively popular does it make you feel popular demanded planefield of tredennis in his unceremonious fashion tredennis presented to him an entirely immovable front how do you find it he inquired the man laughed not as amory does he answered when the coup appeared and he took his place at richards side he bent forward to bestow on tredennis as they drove away a glance expressive of but little favor i dont like that fellow he said confound him richard settled himself in his corner of the carriage folding his furtrimmed coat about him quite luxuriously oh no not confound him he replied he is a delightful fellowin his way confound his way then responded planefield theres too much of it richard leaned slightly forward to look at the tall motionless figure himself and the faintest possible change passed over his face as he did so he is not exactly a malleable sort of fellow he remarked and i suppose there might arise occasions when he would be a little in the way but there is no denying that he is picturesque oh exclaimed his companion with more fervor than grace the devil take his picturesqueness in the meantime colonel tredennis awaited the arrival of his own carriage which had fallen back in the line the surging of the crowd about him the shouts of the policemen as they called up the vehicles the rolling of vehicles and opening and shutting of doors united themselves in an uproar which seemed to afford him a kind of seclusion the subject of his thoughts as he stood in the midst of the throng was not a new one it was one from whose presence he had ceased to expect to free himself but as the information in the morning paper had accelerated the pulse of emotion in him so his brief interview with richard amory had quickened it again since the day when he had left her in virginia five months before he had not seen bertha at all and had only heard from her directly once she had been at long branch saratoga newport and afterward visiting friends in the northern cities after his return from the west richard had frequently been with her and their letters to the professor had informed him that they were well and were involved in a round of gayeties how the time had passed for tredennis he could not himself have told when he had returned to washington he had lived and moved as a man in a dream the familiar streets and buildings wore an unfamiliar look it was a relief to find the places more deserted than before his chief desire was to be if possible entirely alone in the first vivid freshness of his impressions it seemed incredible that the days he had been living through had come to an end and that absolutely nothing remained but the strange memory of them at times it appeared that something must happensome impossible thing which would give reality to the past and motive to the future if in any of his nightly walks before the closed and silent house he had suddenly seen that the shutters were opened and lights were shining within if bertha herself had without warning stood at the window and smiled upon him he would have felt it at first only natural even though he knew she was hundreds of miles away this for a few weeks and then his exaltation died a gradual death for want of sustenance and there remained only the long sultry days to be lived through and their work to be done they were lived through and their work was not neglected but there was no one of them which dragged its slow length by without leaving marks upon him which neither time nor change could erase in any future that might come five months he said as he waited with the clamor about him is longer than it seemsit is longer and miss jessup passing him at the moment and looking up found herself so utterly at a loss for an adjective adequate to the description of his expression that her own bright and alert little countenance fell and existence temporarily palled upon her it was late in the day when he reached the amorys when he drove up several carriages stood before the door one of them berthas own from which richard and planefield had just descended two or three men were going into the house and one or two were leaving it through the open door were to be seen the lighted hall and glimpses of bright rooms beyond from which came the sound of voices laughter and the clink of glass richard entered the house with tredennis and flung off his rather sumptuous outer garment with a laugh of relief we have made fifty calls so far he said and have enjoyed them enormously what have you accomplished not fifty by any means tredennis answered and then the manservant took his coat and they went into the parlors they seemed to be full of menyoung men middleaged men old men even a halfgrown boy or two had timorously presented themselves with large hopes of finding dazzling entertainment in the convivialities of the day the shutters were closed and the rooms brilliantly alight there were flowers in every available corner and three or four charmingly dressed women each forming a bright central figure in a group of black coats gave themselves to their task of entertainment with delightful animation for a moment tredennis stood still he did not see bertha at once though he fancied he heard her voice in the room adjoining where through the halfdrawn portires were to be seen men standing with coffeecups wineglasses or little plates in their hands about a table bright with flowers fruits and all the usual glittering appurtenances the next instant amid a fresh burst of laughter which she seemed to leave behind her she appeared upon the threshold as she paused a second between the heavy curtains tredennis thought suddenly of a brilliant tropical bird he had once seen somewhere and the fancy had scarcely formed itself in his mind before she recognized him and came forward he had never seen her so brilliantly dressed before the wonderful combination of rich and soft reds in her costume the flash of the little jewelled bands clasped close about her bare throat and arms their pendants trembling and glowing in the light the color on her cheeks the look in her eyes had a curiously bewildering effect upon him when she gave him her hand he scarcely knew what to do with it and could only wait for her to speak and she spoke as if they had parted only an hour ago at last she said and it was very nice in you to leave me until the last because now i know you will not feel obliged to go away so soon and she withdrew her hand and opened her fan and stood smiling up at him over its plumy border you see she said that we have returned to our native atmosphere and may begin to breathe freely now we are real creatures again are we he answered is that it and he glanced over the crowd and then came back to her and looked her over from the glittering buckle on her slipper to the scintillating arrow in her hair i suppose we have he added i begin to realize it if you need anything to assist you to realize it she said cast your eye upon mr arbuthnot and i think you will find him sufficient for me everything crystallized itself and all my doubts disappeared the moment i saw his opera hat and heard his first remark about the weather it is a very fine day she added with a serene air of originality a little cold but fine and clear delightful weather for those of you who are making calls it has often struck me that it must be unpleasant to undertake so much when the weather is against you it is colder today than it was yesterday but it will be likely to be warmer tomorrow it is to be hoped that we shall have an agreeable winter you might he said looking at her over the top of her fan induce them to mention it in the churches that she answered is the inspiration of true genius and it shall be attended to at once orhere is senator planefield perhaps he might accomplish something by means of a bill the senator joined them in his usual manner which was not always an engaging manner and was at times a little suggestive of a disposition to appropriate the community and was also a somewhat loudvoiced manner and florid in its decorative style it was on the whole less engaging than usual upon the present occasion the fact that he was for some reason not entirely at ease expressed itself in his appearing to be very wonderfully at ease indeed metaphorically speaking he appeared to have his hands in his pockets a bill he said you have the floor and i stand ready to second any motion you choose to make i think we might put it through together what can we do for you we want an appropriation bertha answeredan appropriation of fine weather which will enable colonel tredennis to be as giddy a butterfly of fashion as his natural inclination would lead him to desire to be planefield glanced at tredennis with a suggestion of grudging the momentary attention is he a butterfly of fashion he asked what exclaimed berthais it possible that you have not detected it it is the fatal flaw upon his almost perfect character can it be that you have been taking him seriously and mistakenly imagining that it was mr arbuthnot who was frivolous arbuthnot repeated the senator which is arbuthnot how is a man to tell one from the other there are too many of them what an agreeable way of saying that colonel tredennis is a host in himself said bertha but i have certainly not found that there were too many of him and i assure you that you would know mr arbuthnot from the other after you had exchanged remarks with him he has just been beguiled into the next room by mrs sylvestre who is going to give him some coffee mrs sylvestre said tredennis richard told me she was with you and i was wondering why i did not see her you did not see her said bertha because i wished her to dawn upon you slowly and having that end in view i arranged that mr arbuthnot should occupy her attention when i saw you enter he couldnt stand it all at once could he remarked planefield whose manner of giving her his attention was certainly not grudging he kept his eyes fixed on her face and apparently found entertainment in her most trivial speech it was not that exactly she answered then she spoke to tredennis she is ten times as beautiful as she was she said and it would not be possible to calculate how many times more charming that was not necessary responded tredennis he could not remove his own eyes from her face even while he was resenting the fact that planefield looked at her he himself watched her every movement and change of expression it was entirely unnecessary she returned but it is the truth you are trying to prejudice him against her said planefield she is my ideal of all that a beautiful woman ought to be she replied and i should like to form myself upon her oh we dont want any of that put in planefield you are good enough for us she turned her attention to him her eyes met his with the most ingenuous candor and yet the little smile in them was too steady not to carry suggestion with it quite she said yes quite he answered not so entirely at ease as before her little smile did not waver in the least do you know she said it seems almost incredible but i will try to believe it now she said to tredennis if senator planefield will excuse me for a moment i will take you into the other room you shall speak to mrs sylvestre he has already seen her will you come i shall be very glad he answered he followed as she led him to the adjoining room on its threshold she paused an instant exactly as i expected she said she is listening to mr arbuthnot mr arbuthnot was standing at the end of the low mantel he held a cup of coffee in his hand but had apparently forgotten it in giving his attention to his very charming companion this companion was of course mrs sylvestre herself tredennis recognized her clear faintly tinted face and light willowy figure at once she wore a dress of black lace with purple passionflowers and she was looking at arbuthnot with reflective eyes almost the color of the flowers she did not seem to be talking herself but she was listening beautifully with a graceful receptive attention arbuthnot evidently felt it and was improving his shining hour with a sense of enjoyment tempered by no lack of ability to avail himself of its fleeting pleasure it is possible however that his rapture at seeing tredennis may have been tempered by the natural weakness of man but he bore himself with his usual unperturbed equanimity there he remarked to mrs sylvestre is the most objectionable creature in washington objectionable mrs sylvestre repeated bertha is bringing him here yes responded arbuthnot that is the objection to him and it leaves him without a redeeming quality mrs sylvestre gave him a charmingly interested glance and the next instant made a slight movement forward ah she exclaimed it is colonel tredennis and she held out her hand with the most graceful gesture of welcome imaginable it is very good of you to remember me tredennis said it was not difficult she answered with a smile and they fell in the most natural manner a step apart from the others and she stood and looked at him as he spoke just as she had looked at arbuthnot a moment before arbuthnot began to give mild attention to his coffee it is quite cold he said to bertha will you give me another cup yes she answered and took it from his hand to carry it to the table he followed her and stood at her side as she poured the fresh cup out it is my impression he said with serene illiberality that she did not remember him at all yes she did bertha replied she remembers everybody that is one of her gifts she has a great many gifts i did not place implicit confidence in her intimation that she remembered me he proceeded still serenely i liked the statement and saw the good taste of it and the excellent reasons for its being true but i managed to restrain the nave impulses of a trusting nature and it doesnt strike me as being so entirely plausible that she should have remembered tredennis he paused suddenly and looked at berthas hand in which she held the sugartongs and a lump of sugar will you have one lump or two she asked then he looked from her hand to her face her hand was trembling and her face was entirely without color the look of strained steadiness in her uplifted eyes was a shock to him it seemed to him that any one who chanced to glance at her must see it you have been standing too long he said you have tired yourself out again he took the cup of coffee from her it is too late for you to expect many calls now he said and if any one comes you can easily be found in the conservatory i am going to take you there and let you sit down for a few seconds at least he gave her his arm and carried the cup of coffee with him you will have to drink this yourself he said have you eaten anything today no she replied i thought not and then you are surprised to find your hand trembling dont you see what nonsense it is yes he stepped with her into the tiny conservatory at the end of the room and gave her a seat behind a substantial palm on a red stand his eyes never left her face though he went on talking in the most matteroffact tone drink that coffee he said and then i will bring you a glass of wine and a sandwich she put out her hand as if to take the cup but it fell shaking upon her lap i cant she said you must he replied the inflexibility of his manner affected her as he had known it would when he sat down in the low seat at her side and held out the cup she took it go and get the wine she said without looking at him he went at once neither speaking nor glancing back at her he was glad of the opportunity of turning his face away from her since he felt that in spite of his determination it was losing something of its expressionless calm when he entered the room mrs sylvestre still stood where he had left her it was she who was speaking now and tredennis who was listening looking down upon her with an expression of much interest when he had procured a glass of wine and a sandwich arbuthnot went to her i have secreted mrs amory in the conservatory he said with a view of inducing her to take something in the form of sustenance i can produce her at a moments notice if she is needed that was consideration she replied it was humanity he answered and went away bertha had finished the coffee when he returned to her the blanched look had left her and her voice when she spoke sounded more natural and steady it did me good she said and this time she looked at him and there was something in her uplifted eyes which touched him i knew it would he answered you always know she said there is no one who knows so well what is good for me and she said it with great gentleness he took refuge from himself as he sometimes found it discreet to do in his usual airy lightness i am all soul myself he remarked as you may have observed and i understand the temptation to scorn earthly food and endeavor to subsist wholly upon the plaudits of the multitude you will perhaps permit me to remark that though the new gownwith an approving glance at itis an immense and unqualified success i doubt its power to sustain nature during the six or eight hours of a new years reception bertha glanced down at it herself do you think it is pretty she asked i shouldnt call it pretty he replied i should call it something more impressive she still looked at it it is a flaring thing she said no it isnt he returned promptly not in the least you might call it brilliantif you insist on an adjective it is a brilliant thing and it is not like you in the least she turned toward him no she said it isnt like me in the least it looks remarked arbuthnot giving it some lightly critical attention as if you had taken a new departure that is it exactly she returned you always say the right thing i have taken a new departure might i ask in what direction he inquired yes she responded i will tell you as a fair warning i am going to be a dazzling and worldly creature you are he said now that is entirely sensible though i should scarcely call it a new departure you know you tried it last winter with the most satisfying results when lent came on you had lost several pounds in weight and all your color you had refined existence until neither rest nor food appeared necessary to you and the future was naturally full of promise be gay by all means youll find it pay i assure you go to a lunchparty at one and a reception at four a dinner in the evening and drop in at a german or so on your way home taking precautions at the same time against neglecting your callinglist in the intervals these slight recreations allow you oh i should certainly advise you to be gay laurence she said do you think if one should do that every day every day and give ones self no rest that after a while it would kill one he regarded her fixedly for an instant do you want to die he asked at last she sat perfectly still and something terribly like and yet terribly unlike a smile crept slowly into her eyes as they met his then she replied without flinching in the least or moving her gaze no he held up a long slender forefinger and shook it at her slowly in his favorite gesture of warning no he said you dont but even if you fancied you did dont flatter yourself that it would happen shall i tell you what would occur you would simply break down you would lose your selfcontrol and do things you did not wish to do you would find it a physical impossibility to be equal to the occasion and you would end by being pale and haggardhaggard and discovering that your gowns were not becoming to you how does the thing strike you it is very brutal she said with a little shudder but it is true when you make ten remarks that are true he returned nine of them are brutal that is the charm of life i dont think she said with inconsequent resentment that you very much mind being brutal to me a few minutes ago you said i knew what was good for you he responded you do she said that is it and it is only like me that i should hate you because you do you must think with a pathetic tone of appeal for herself in her voice that i do not mind being brutal to you but i dont want to be i dont want to do any of the things i am doing now she picked up the bouquet of jacqueminot roses she had been carrying and had laid down near her dont talk about me she said let us talk about something elsethese for instance do you know where they came from i could scarcely guess senator planefield sent them to me he regarded them in silence they match the dress she said and they belong to it yes he answered they match the dress then he was silent again well she said restlessly why dont you say something to me there isnt anything to say he replied you are thinking that i am very bad she said you are trying to persuade yourself that you are very bad and are finding a fictitious excitement in it but it is all a mistake it wont prove the consolation you expect it to he answered suppose you give it up before it gives rise to complications we are talking of bertha amory again she said let us talk about agnes sylvestre dont you find her very beautiful yes he replied why dont you say more than yes she asked you mean more i couldnt mean more he answered i should think it was enough to mean that much there are even circumstances under which it might be too much she is lovelier than she used to be said bertha reflectively and more fascinating yes to that also he responded any one might love her she went on in the same tone any one i should think so he replied quietly i do not see how it would be possible she added for any onewho was thrown with herto resist herunless it was some one like you she turned a faint smile upon him i am glad she said that you are not susceptible so am i he said with some dryness if you were susceptible you would go too she ended and i dont want every one to leave me every one he repeated she rose as if to go giving a light touch to the folds of her dress and still smiling a little colonel tredennis has fallen a victim she said in the most natural and proper manner i knew he would and he has distinguished himself by at once carrying out my plans for him now we must go back to the parlors i have rested long enough they returned just in time to meet a fresh party of callers and arbuthnot was of necessity thrown for the time being upon his own resources these did not fail him he found entertainment in his surroundings until a certain opportunity he had rather desired presented itself to him he observed that mrs sylvestre was once more near him and that the men occupying her attention were on the point of taking their leave by the time they had done so he had dexterously brought to a close his conversation with his male companion and had unobtrusively forwarded himself in an entirely incidental manner as an aspirant for her notice she received him with a quiet suggestion of pleasure in her smile have you enjoyed the day he asked yes she replied i am almost sorry that it is so nearly over it has been very agreeable then he found her eyes resting upon him in the quiet and rather incomprehensible way which bertha had counted among her chiefest charms have you enjoyed it she inquired if i had not he said i should feel rather like a defeated candidate one may always enjoy things if one applies ones self she seemed to reflect upon him an instant again you see a great deal of bertha she said yes a great deal would you mind telling me why you ask because that remark was so entirely like her she replied well he returned there is no denying that i have formed myself upon her and though the fact reveals me in all my shallow imitative weakness i can offer the apology that the means justifies the end upon the whole i am glad to be detected as it points to a measure of success in the attempt but she went on she tells me that she has formed herself upon you ah he said she meant you to repeat it to me her design being to betray me into a display of intoxicated vanity she is very fond of you she remarked i am very fond of her he answered quicklyand then relapsing into his usual mannerthough that is not a qualification sufficiently rare to distinguish me no she said it is not then she gave bertha one of the glances it was very thoughtful in you to take her into the conservatory she said i was startled to see how pale she looked as you left the room she is not strong he said and she insists on ignoring the fact do you know said mrs sylvestre that was what struck me when we met for the first time in the autumnthat she was not strong she used to be strong if she would accept the fact she would get over it he said but she wont i met her first at newport said mrs sylvestre just after janeys illness for a day or so i felt that i did not know her at all but in course of time i got over the feeling or she changedi scarcely know which i suppose the strain during the little girls illness had been very severe there is no doubt of that said arbuthnot and her anxiety had been much exaggerated i shall see a great deal of her this winter she returned and perhaps i may persuade her to take care of herself he spoke with a touch of eager seriousness in his manner i wish you would he said it is what she needs that some woman should call her attention to the mistake she is making i will try to do it she responded gently i am fond of her too and you intend remaining in washington he asked yes i have had no plans for three years when first it dawned on me that it would interest me to make plans again i thought of washington i have found a house in lafayette square and i think i shall be established in it with the assistance of my aunt who is to live with me in about three weeks that sounds very agreeable he remarked i shall hope to make it sufficiently so she said will you come sometimes to see if my efforts are successful if you knew how unworthy i am he responded even my abject gratitude for your kindness would not repay you for it are you so very unworthy she was beginning when her eyes appeared to be caught by some object at the other side of the room it was not a particularly interesting object it was merely the figure of an unprepossessing boy whose provincial homeliness was rendered doubly impressive by his frightful embarrassment he had arrived a few moments before with two more finished youths whose mother bertha knew and having been basely deserted by them at the outset had stranded upon the treacherous shores of inexperience as soon as he had shaken hands mrs sylvestres beautiful eyes dwelt upon him a moment with sympathy and interest will you excuse me she said to arbuthnot if i go and talk to that boy bertha is too busy to attend to him and he seems to know no one arbuthnot gave the boy a glance he would not have regretted any comparatively harmless incident which would have removed him but his own very naturally ignoble desire not to appear to a disadvantage restrained the impulse prompting a derisive remark and while he objected to the boy in his most pronounced manner he did not object in the least to what he was clever enough to see in his companions words and the ready sympathy they expressed indeed there was a side of him which derived definite pleasure from it i will excuse you he answered but i need you more than the boy does and i cannot help believing that i am more worthy of you though of course i only use the word in its relative sense as i remarked before i am unworthy but as compared to the boyhe is a frightful boy he added seeming to take him in more fully but i dare say his crimes are unpremeditated let me go with you and find out if i know his mother i frequently know their mothers if you do know his mother i am sure it will be a great relief to him and it will assist me said mrs sylvestre they crossed the room together and seeing them approach the boy blushed vermilion and moved uneasily from one foot to the other gradually however his aspect changed a little here were rather attractive worldlings whose bearing expressed no consciousness whatever of his crime of boyhood he met mrs sylvestres eyes and blushed less he glanced furtively at arbuthnot and suddenly forgot his hands and became almost unconscious of his legs i have been asking mrs sylvestre said arbuthnot with civil mendacity if you did not come with the bartletts i thought i saw you come in together yes responded the boy i am a cousin of theirs then i have heard them speak of you arbuthnot returned and i think i had the pleasure of meeting your sister several times last wintermiss hemmingway yes said the boy she was here on a visit in two minutes he found himself conversing almost fluently and it was arbuthnot who was his inspiration equally with mrs sylvestre he was a modest and inoffensive youth and overestimated the brilliance of the scenes surrounding him and the gifts and charms of his newfound friends with all the ardor of his tender years to him arbuthnots pale wellbred face and simple immaculate attire represented luxury fashion and the whirling vortex of society the kindly imagination of simplicity bestowed upon him an unlimited income and an exalted position in the diplomatic corps at least his ease of manner and readiness of speech seeming gifts only possible of attainment through familiarity with foreign courts and effete civilizations when he was asked how he liked washington if he intended to spend the season with his relations if he had made many calls and if the day did not seem to be an unusually gay one he accomplished the feat of answering each question even adding an original remark or so of his own the conversation seemed to assume a tone of almost feverish brilliancy in view of the social atmosphere surrounding these queries when he was led into the adjoining room to partake of refreshments he ate his lobstersalad with an honest young appetite much aided by the fact that mrs sylvestre gave him his coffee and taking a cup herself sat down by him on a sofa as he watched her arbuthnot was thinking her manner very soft and pretty and inspired by it his own became all that could be desired in the way of dexterity and tact as he exercised himself in his entertainment his first objections to the boy gradually vanished he plied him with refreshments and encouraged him to renewed conversational effort deriving finally some satisfaction from finding himself able to bring to bear upon him with successful results his neatly arranged and classified social gifts when the young bartlettswho had been enjoying themselves immensely in the next roomsuddenly remembered their charge and came in search of him their frank countenances expressed some surprise at the position they found him occupying he was relating with some spirit the story of a boatrace and mrs sylvestre who sat at his side was listening with the most perfect air of attention and pleasure while arbuthnot stood near apparently bent upon losing nothing of the history he ended the story with some natural precipitation and rose to go a trifle of his embarrassment returning as he found himself once more as it were exposed to the glare of day he was not quite sure what conventionality demanded of him in the way of adieus but when mrs sylvestre relieved him by extending her hand nature got the better of him and he seized it with ardor ive had a splendid time he said blushing this is the nicest reception ive been to yet the house is so pretty andand everything i was thinking i shouldnt go anywhere else but i believe i shall now when he shook hands with arbuthnot he regarded him with admiration and awe im much obliged to you he said his vague sense of indebtedness taking form if you ever come to whippleville im sure my father would like toto see you and he retired with his young relatives blushing still and occasionally treading on their feet but his modesty notwithstanding bearing with him an inoffensive air of selfrespect which would be more than likely to last him through the day and perhaps a little beyond it mrs sylvestres eyes met arbuthnots when he was gone you were very kind to him she said i am obliged to confess he replied that it was nothing but the low promptings of vanity which inspired me it dawned upon me that he was impressed by my superior ease and elegance and i seized the opportunity of exhibiting them you knew just what to say to him she added that he replied was entirely owing to the fact that i was a boy myself in the early part of the last century he was an appreciative boy she said and a grateful one but i am sure i could not have made him comfortable if you had not been so kind and she once again bestowed upon him the subtle flattery of appearing to lose herself an instant in reflection upon him there were no more callers after this later on an unconventional little dinner was served during which mrs sylvestre was placed between arbuthnot and tredennis planefield loomed up massive and florid at berthas side and richard devoted himself with delightful ardor to discussing french politics with the young woman who fell to his share this young woman whose attire was perfect and whose manner was admirable and who was furthermore endowed with a piquant irregular face and a captivating voice had attracted tredenniss attention early in the evening she had been talking to richard when he had seen her first and she had been talking to richard at intervals ever since and evidently talking very well i dont know your friend he said to bertha after dinner and i did not hear her name when i was presented then you have hitherto lived in vain said bertha glancing at her that is what richard would tell you her name is helen varien it is a very pretty name remarked tredennis ah said bertha you certainly might trust her not to have an ugly one she has attained that state of finish in the matter of her appendages which insures her being invariably to be relied on i think she must even have invented her relativesor have ordered them giving carte blanche she watched her a moment with a smile of interest do you see how her sleeves fit she asked it was her sleeves which first attracted my attention i saw them at a luncheon in new york and they gave me new theories of life when a woman can accomplish sleeves like those society need ask nothing further of her tredennis glanced down at her own have you accomplishedhe suggested in moments of rashness and folly she answered i have occasionally been betrayed into being proud of my sleeves but now i realize that the feeling was simply impious he waited with grim patience until she had finished and then turned his back upon miss variens sleeves will you tell me about janey he said when last i saw her which was this morning she replied she was as well as usual and so were the others now i have no doubt they are all in bed may i come and see them tomorrow or the day after yes she answered and at anytime i hope you will come often mrs sylvestre will be with me until her house is ready for her and as i said before i wish you to know her well i shall feel it a great privilege he responded she leaned back a little in her chair and regarded her with an expression of interest even greater than she had been aroused to by the contemplation of miss variens sleeves have you found out yet she inquired what her greatest charm is is it by any chance a matter of sleeves he asked and he made the suggestion stolidly no she answered it is not sleeves ones difficulty is to decide what it is a week ago i thought it was her voice yesterday i was sure it was her eyelashes and the soft shadow they make about her eyes about an hour ago i was convinced it was her smile and now i think it must be her power of fixing her attention upon you see how it flatters mr arbuthnot and how though he is conscious of his weakness he succumbs to it it will be very pleasant occupation during the winter to watch his struggles will he struggle said tredennis still immovably i dont think i would in his place oh no she answered you mustnt struggle i will not he returned she went on with a smile as if he had spoken in the most responsive manner possible mr arbuthnots struggles will not be of the usual order she remarked he will not be struggling with his emotions but with his vanity he knows that she will not fall in love with him and he has no intention of falling in love with her he knows betterand he does not like affairs but he will find that she is able to do things which will flatter him and that it will require all his selfcontrol to refrain from displaying his masculine delight in himself and the goodfortune which he has the secret anguish of knowing does not depend upon his merits and his struggles at a decently composed demeanor entirely untinged by weak demonstrations of pleasure or consciousness of himself will be a very edifying spectacle she turned her glance from arbuthnot and mrs sylvestre whom she had been watching as she spoke and looked up at tredennis she did so because he had made a rather sudden movement and placed himself immediately before her bertha he said i am going away her jacqueminot roses had been lying upon her lap she picked them up before she answered him you have made too many calls she said you are tired i have not made too many calls he replied but i am tired i am tired of this i was afraid you were she said and kept her eyes fixed upon the roses you were very fair to me he said and you gave me warning i told you i should not profit by it and i did not i dont know what i expected when i came here today but it was not exactly this you are too agile for me i cannot keep up with you you are not modern she said you must learn to adjust yourself rapidly to changes of mental attitude no i am not modern he returned and i am always behindhand i do not enjoy myself when you tell me it is a fine day and that it was colder yesterday and will be warmer tomorrow and i am at a loss when you analyze mr arbuthnots struggles with his vanity i am not serious enough she interrupted you would prefer that i should be more serious it would avail me but little to tell you what i should prefer he said obstinately i will tell you a simple thing before i goall this counts for nothing she moved slightly all this she repeated counts for nothing for nothing he repeated you cannot change me i told you that you may give me some sharp woundsi know you wont spare thoseand because i am only a man i shall show that i smart under them but they will not move me otherwise be as frivolous as you like mock at everything human if you choose but dont expect me to believe you she put the flowers to her face and held them there a second the one thing i should warn you against she said would be against believing me i dont make the mistake of believing myself she put the flowers down you think i am trying to deceive you she said there would have to be a reason for my doing it what should you think would be the reason so help me god he answered i dont know neither do i she said then she glanced about her over the roomat planefield rather restively professing to occupy himself with a pretty girl at miss varien turned a trifle sidewise in her large chair so that her beautiful sleeve was displayed to the most perfect advantage and her vivacious face was a little uplifted as she spoke to richard who leaned on the high back of her seat at arbuthnot talking to agnes sylvestre and plainly at no loss of words at the lights and flowers and ornamented tables seen through the portiresand then she spoke again i tell you she said it is this that is realthis the other was only a kind of dream she made a sudden movement and sat upright on her chair as if she meant to shake herself free from something there was no other she said it wasnt even a dream there never was anything but this she left her chair and stood up before him smiling the sky was not blue she said nor the hills purple there were no chestnut trees and no carnations let us go and sit with the rest and listen to mr arbuthnot and admire miss variens sleeves but he stood perfectly still i told you i was going away he said and i am going tomorrow i shall come and see the childrenunless you tell me that you do not wish to see me again i shall not tell you that she returned because it would be at once uncivil and untrue then i shall come he said that will be kind of you she responded and gave him her hand and after he had made his bow over it and his adieus to the rest of the company he left them bertha crossed the room and stood near the fire putting one foot on the fender and shivering a little are you cold asked miss varien yesno she answered if i did not know better i should think i was allow me said miss varien to make the cheerful suggestion that that sounds quite like malaria thank you said bertha that seems plausible and i dont rebel against it it has an air of dealing with glittering generalities and yet it seems to decide matters for one we will call it malaria chapter xxii the room which mrs sylvestre occupied in her friends house was a very pretty one it had been one of mrs amorys caprices at the time she had fitted it up and she had amused herself with it for two or three months arranging it at her leisure reflecting upon it and making additions to its charms every day as soon as they suggested themselves to her it is to be a purely feminine apartment she had said to richard and arbuthnot and i have a sentiment about it when it is complete you shall go and stand outside the door and look in but nothing would induce me to allow you to cross the threshold when this moment had arrived and they had been admitted to the private view from the corridor they had evidently been somewhat impressed it is very pretty mr arbuthnot had remarked with amiable tolerance but i dont approve of it its object is plainly to pamper and foster those tendencies of the feminine temperament which are most prominent and least desirable nothing could be more apparent than its intention to pander to a taste for luxury and selfindulgence combined in the most shameless manner with vanity and lightness of mind it will be becoming to the frivolous creatures and will exalt and inflate them to that extent that they will spend the greater portion of their time in it utterly ignoring the superior opportunities for cultivating and improving their minds they might enjoy downstairs on occasions when richard remains at home and my own multifarious duties permit me to drop in it strikes me as offering a premium to feminine depravity and crime that expresses it exactly agreed richard arbuthnot turned him round will you he said kindly give your attention to the length and position of that mirror and the peculiar advantages to be derived from the fact that the light falls upon it from that particular point and that its effects are softened by the lace draperies and suggestions of pink and blue the pink and blue idea is merely of a piece with all the rest and is prompted by the artfulness of the serpent if it had been all pink the blondes would have suffered and if it had been all blue the brunettes would have felt that they were not at their best this ineffably wily combination however truckles to either and intimates that each combines the attractions of both take me away richard it is not for the ingenuous and serious mind to view such spectacles as these take me awayfirst however making a mental inventory of the entirely debasing sofas and chairs and the flagrant and openly sentimental nature of the pictures all depicting or insinuating the drivelling imbecility and slavery of manthe huguenot lovers you observe the black brunswicker and others of like nature mrs sylvestre had thought the room very pretty indeed when she had first taken possession of it and its prettiness and comfort impressed her anew when the excitement of the new years day at last at an end she retired to it for the night when she found herself within the closed doors she did not go to bed at once too many impressions had been crowded into the last ten hours to have left her in an entirely reposeful condition of mind and body and though of too calm a temperament for actual excitement she was still not inclined to sleep so having partly undressed and thrown on a loose wrap she turned down the light and went to the fire it was an open woodfire and burned cheerily behind a brass fender a large rug of white fur was spread upon the hearth before it a low broad sofa luxurious with cushions was drawn up at one side of it and upon the rug at the other stood a deep easychair it was this chair she took and having taken it she glanced up at an oval mirror which was among the ornaments on the opposite wall in it she saw reflected that portion of the room which seemed to have arranged itself about her own graceful figurethe faint pinks and blues the flowered drapery the puffed and padded furniture and the hundred and one entirely feminine devices of ornamentation and she was faintly aware that an expression less thoughtful than the one she wore would have been more in keeping with her surroundings i look too serious to harmonize she said if bertha were here she would detect the incongruity and deplore it but she was in a thoughtful mood which was not an uncommon experience with her and the faint smile the words gave rise to died away as she turned to the fire again what she thought of as she sat and looked into it it would have been difficult to tell but there was evidence that she was mentally well occupied in the fact that she sat entirely still and gazed at its flickering flame for nearly half an hour she would not have moved then perhaps if she had not been roused from her reverie by a sound at the doora low knock and a voice speaking to her agnes it said agnes she knew it at once as berthas and rose to reply to the summons almost as if she had expected or even waited for it when she unlocked the door and opened it bertha was standing on the threshold she had partly undressed too she had laid aside the red dress and put on a long white neglige bordered with white fur there was no color about her and it made her look cold perhaps she was cold for agnes thought she seemed to shiver a little may i come in she asked i know it is very inconsiderate but i had a sort of conviction that you would not be asleep i was not thinking of going to sleep yet said agnes i am glad you have come bertha entered and the door being closed crossed the room to the fire she did not take a chair but sat down upon the hearthrug this is very feminine she said and we ought to be in bed but the day would not be complete without it then she turned toward agnes you must have a great deal to think of tonight she said agnes sylvestre looked at the fire yes she answered i have a great deal to think of are they things you like to think of some of themnot all it must be a curious experience said bertha to find yourself here again after so many yearswith all your life changed for you mrs sylvestre did not reply you have not been here bertha continued since you went away on your wedding journey you were nineteen or twenty thenonly a girl i was young said mrs sylvestre but i was rather mature for my years i did not feel as if i was exactly a girl then she added in a lower voice i had experienced something which had ripened me you mean said bertha that you knew what love was she had not intended to say the words and their abrupt directness grated upon her as she spoke but she could not have avoided uttering them mrs sylvestre paused a moment the experience i passed through she said did not belong to my age it was not a girls feelings i think it came too soon you had two alternatives to choose from said berthathat it should come too soon or too late mrs sylvestre paused again you do not think she said that it ever comes to any one at the right time bertha had been sitting with her hands folded about her knee she unclasped and clasped them with a sharply vehement movement it is a false thing from beginning to end she said i do not believe in it ah said mrs sylvestre softly i believe it i wish i did not what is there to be gained by it said bertha a feeling that is not to be reasoned about or controlled a miserable feverish emotion you cannot understand and can only resent and struggle against blindly when you let it conquer you how can you respect yourself or the object of it what do women love men for who knows it is like madness all you can say is i love him he is life or death to me it is so unreasoningso unreasoning she stopped suddenly as if all at once she became conscious that her companion was looking at herself instead of at the fire you love a man generally said mrs sylvestre in her tenderly modulated voiceat least i have thought sobecause he is the one human creature who is capable of causing you the greatest amount of suffering i dont know of any other reason and i have thought of it a great deal it is a good reason said berthaa good reason then she laughed this is just a little tragic isnt it she said what a delightfully emotional condition we must be in to have reached tragedy in less than five minutes and entirely without intention i did not come to be tragic i came to be analytical i want you to tell me carefully how we strike you we said mrs sylvestre bertha touched herself on the breast we she saidi richard laurence arbuthnot colonel tredennis senator planefield the two hundred men callerswashington in short how does washington strike you now that you have come to it again wont you give me two weeks to reflect upon it said agnes no i want impressions not reflections is it all very much changed i am very much changed was the reply and we said bertha supposesuppose you begin with laurence arbuthnot i do not think i could he is not one of the persons i have remembered agnes said bertha only wait with patience for one of those occasions when you feel it necessary to efface him and then tell him that in exactly that tone of voice and he will in that instant secretly atone for the crimes of a lifetime he wont wince and he will probably reply in the most brilliant and impersonal manner but figuratively speaking you will have reduced him to powder and cast him to the breeze we shall not be sufficiently intimate to render such a thing possible said mrs sylvestre one must be intimate with a man to be angry enough with him to wish to avenge ones self bertha smiled you dont like him she said poor larry on the contrary was her friends reply but it would not occur to me to begin with him as you suggested just now with whom then said bertha would you begin her guest gave a moment to reflection during which bertha regarded her intently if i were going to begin at all she said rather slowly i think it would be with colonel tredennis there was a moment of silence and then bertha spoke in a somewhat cold and rigid voice what do you like about him she asked i think i like everything if you were any one else said bertha i should say that you simply like his size i think that is generally it women invariably fall victims to men who are big and a little lumbering they like to persuade themselves that they are overawed and subjected i never understood it myself big men never pleased me very muchthey are so apt to tread on you i like his eyes said agnes apparently reflecting aloud they are very kind and i like his voice it is rather too deep remarked bertha and sometimes i am a little afraid it will degenerate into a growl though i have never heard it do so yet mrs sylvestre went on when he bends his head a little and looks down at you as you talk she said he is very nice he is really thinking of you and regarding you seriously i do not think he is given to trifling no returned bertha i do not think he is given to anything special but being massive that is what you are thinkingthat he is massive there is no denying said her friend that that is one of the things i like ah said bertha you find the rest of us very flippant and trivial that is how we strike you a fatigued little sigh escaped her lips after all she said it is true and we have obliged ourselves to be trivial for so long that we are incapable of seriousness sometimesgenerally toward lent after i have been out a great deali wonder if the other would not be interesting for a change but at the same time i know i could not be serious if i tried your seriousness will be deeper said mrs sylvestre when you accomplish it without trying she was serious herself as she spoke but her seriousness was extremely gentle she looked at bertha even tenderly and her clear eyes were very expressive we are both changed since we met here last she said with simple directness and it is only natural that what we have lived through should have affected us differently we are of very different temperaments you were always more vivid and intense than i and sufferingif you had suffered her soft voice faltered a little and she paused bertha turned and looked her unflinchingly in the face ihave not suffered she said agnes spoke as simply as before i have she said bertha turned sharply away i was afraid so was her response if we are to be as near to each other as i hope agnes continued it would be useless for me to try to conceal from you the one thing which has made me what i am the effort to hide it would always stand between us and our confidence in each other it is much simpler to let you know the truth she put her hands up to her face an instant and bertha broke the silence with a curiously incisive question was he very cruel to you agnes withdrew her hands and if her shadow of a smile had not been so infinitely sad it would have been bitter he could not help it she said and when i was calm enough to reason i knew he was not to blame for my imagination it was all over in a few months and he would have been quite content to bear what followed philosophically when the worst came to the worst he told me that he had known it could not last because such things never did but that he had also known that even after the inevitable termination i should always please him and display good taste he had lived through so much and i had known so little i only spoke openly to him onceone awful day and after that i scarcely know what happened to me for months i asked him to let me go away alone and i went to the seaside since then the sound of the sea has been a terror to me and yet there are times when i long to hear it i used to tell myself that on one of those days when i sat on the sand and looked at the sea i died and that i have never really lived since something happened to mei dont know what it was one brilliant morning when the sun beat on the blue water and the white sand and everything was a dazzling glare i sat on the beach for hours without moving and when i got up and walked away i remember hearing myself saying i have left you behindi have left you behindi shall never see you again i was ill for several days afterward and when i recovered i seemed to have become a new creature when my husband came i was able to meet him so calmly that i think it was even a kind of shock to him and that was the end said bertha yes that was the endfor me and for him once or twice afterward it interested him to try experiments with me and when they failed he was not pleased were you never afraid said bertha that they would not fail no there is nothing so final as the ending of such a feeling there is nothing to come after it because it has taken everything with itpassion bitterness sorroweven regret i never wished that it might return after the day i spoke of i have thought if by stretching forth my hand i could have brought it all back just as it was at first i should not have wished to do it it had been too much it is a false thing said berthaa false thing and there must always be some such end to it agnes sylvestre was silent again and because of her silence bertha repeated her words with feverish eagerness it must always end so she said you know thatyou must know it i am only one person was the characteristic answer and i do not know i do not want to know i only want quiet now i have learned enough agnes said bertha that is very pathetic yes agnes answered i know it is pathetic when i allow myself to think of it and for the first time her voice broke a little and was all the sweeter for the break in it but it was over in a moment and she spoke as she had spoken before but i did not mean to be pathetic she said i only wanted to tell you the entire truth so that there should be nothing between us and nothing to avoid there can be nothing now you know of me all that is past and you can guess what is to come no i cannot do that said bertha agnes smiled it is very easy she responded i shall have a pretty house and i shall amuse myself by buying new or old things for it and by moving the furniture i shall give so much thought to it that after a while it will be quite celebrated in a small way and miss jessup will refer to it as unique mrs merriam will be with me and i shall have my reception day and perhaps my evening and i shall see as many of the charming people who come to washington as is possible you will be very good to me and come to see me often andso i hope will mr arbuthnot and colonel tredennis agnes interposed bertha with an oddly hard manner if they do one or both of them will fall in love with you if it is either responded mrs sylvestre serenely i hope it will be mr arbuthnot as he would have less difficulty in recovering you think said bertha that nothing could ever touch you againnothing think was the response my safety lies in the fact that i do not think of it at all if i were twenty i might do so and everything would be different life is very short it is not long enough to run risks in i shall not trifle with what is left to me oh cried bertha how calm you arehow calm you are yes she answered i am calm now but she put her hands up to her face again for an instant and her eyelashes were wet when she withdrew them it was a horribly dangerous thing she said brokenly there were so many temptations the temptation to find excitement in avenging myself on others was strongest of all i suppose it is the natural savage impulse there were times when i longed to be cruel and then i began to thinkand there seemed so much suffering in lifeand everything seemed so pitiful and i could not bear the thought of it and she ended with the sob of a child it is very womanish to cry she whispered and i did not mean to do it butyou look at me so and she laid her cheek against the cushioned back of her chair and for a little while was more pathetic in her silence than she could have been in any words she might have uttered it was true that bertha had looked at her there were no tears in her own eyes her feeling was one of obstinate resistance to all emotion in herself but she did not resent her friends on the contrary she felt a strange enjoyment of it dont stop crying because i am here she said i like to see you do it mrs sylvestre recovered herself at once she sat up smiling a little there were no disfiguring traces of her emotion on her fair face thank you she answered but i do not like it myself so much and i have not done it before for a long time it was perhaps because mr arbuthnot presented himself as an entirely safe topic with no tendency whatever to develop the sensibilities that she chose him as the subject of her next remarks i do not see much change in your friend she observed if you mean laurence bertha replied i dare say not he does not allow things to happen to him he knows better and he has done nothing whatever during the last seven years he has been to a great many parties said bertha and he has read a book or so and sung several songs i hope he has sung them well was her friends comment it always depends upon his mood bertha returned but there have been times when he has sung them very well indeed it can scarcely have been a great tax to have done it occasionally said mrs sylvestre but i should always be rather inclined to think it was the result of chance and not effort stillwith a sudden conscientious scruple brought about by her recollection of the fact that these marks of disapproval had not expressed themselves in her manner earlier in the daystill he is very agreeable one cannot deny that it is always safe not to attempt to deny it even if you feel inclined was berthas comment because if you do he will inevitably prove to you that you were in the wrong before he has done with you he did one thing i rather liked her companion proceeded he was very nicein that peculiar impartial way of histo a boy the boy who came with the bartletts bertha interposed i saw him and was positively unhappy about him because i could not attend to him did he take him in hand she asked brightening visibly i knew he would if he noticed him particularly it was just like him to do it i saw him first mrs sylvestre explained but i am afraid i should not have been equal to the occasion if mr arbuthnot had not assisted me it certainly surprised me that he should do it he knew the bartletts and had met the boys sister and in the most wonderful yet the most uneffusive and natural way he utilized his material until the boy felt himself quite at home and not out of place at all one of the nicest things was the way in which he talked about whipplevillethe boy came from whippleville he seemed to give it a kind of interest and importance and even picturesqueness he did not pretend to have been there but he knew something of the country which is pretty and he was very clever in saying neither too much nor too little of course that was nice colonel tredennis could not have done it said bertha agnes paused she felt there was something of truth in the statement but she was reluctant to admit it why not she inquired by reason of the very thing which is his attraction for youbecause he is too massive to be adroit agnes was silent was it not colonel tredennis who went to virginia when your little girl was ill she asked in a few moments yes was berthas response he came because richard was away and papa was ill it was janey who told me of it said agnes quietly and she made a very pretty story of it in her childish way she said that he carried her up and down the room when she was tired and that when her head ached he helped her not to cry he must be very gentle i like to think of it it is very picturesque the idea of that great soldierly fellow nursing a frail little creature and making her pain easier to bear do you know i find myself imagining that i know how he looked bertha sat perfectly still she too knew how he had looked but there was no reason she told herself for the sudden horrible revulsion of feeling which rushed upon her with the remembrance a little while before when agnes had told her story there had been a reason why she should be threatened by her emotions but now it was differentnow that there was so to speak no pathos in the air now that they were merely talking of commonplace unemotional things but she remembered so well if she could have forced herself to forget for one instant she might have overcome the passion of unreasoning anguish which seized her but it was no use and as she made the effort agnes sat and watched her a strange questioning dawning slowly in her eyes he lookedvery large she stopped short and her hands clutched each other hard and close a wild thought of getting up and leaving the room came to her and then she knew it was too late a light flickered up from the woodfire and fell upon her face as she slowly turned it to agnes for an instant agnes simply looked at her then she uttered a terrorstricken exclamation bertha she cried well said bertha well but at her next breath she began to tremble and left her place on the hearth and stood up trembling still i am tired out she said i must go away i ought not to have come here but agnes rose and went to her laying her hand on her arm she had grown pale herself and there was a thrill of almost passionate feeling in her words when she spoke no she said you were right to come this is the place for you she drew her down upon the sofa and held both her hands do you think i would let you go now she said until you had told me everything do you think i did not know there was something you were struggling with when i told you of my own unhappiness it was because i hoped it would help you to speak if you had not known that i had suffered you could not have told me you must tell me now what barrier could there be between ustwo women who havewho have been hurt and who should know how to be true to each other bertha slipped from her grasp and fell upon her knees by the sofa covering her face agnes she panted i never thought of thisi dont know how it has come about i never meant to speak almost the worst of it all is that my power over myself is gone and that it has even come to thisthat i am speaking when i meant to be silent dont look at me i dont know what it all means all my life has been so differentit is so unlike methat i say to myself it cannot be true perhaps it is not i have never believed in such things i dont think i believe now i dont know what it means i say or whether it will last and if it is not only a sort of illness that i shall get better of i am trying with all my strength to believe that and to get better but while it lasts go on said agnes in a hushed voice bertha threw out her hands and wrung them the pretty baubles she had not removed when she undressed jingling on her wrists it is worse for me than for any one else she cried worse worse it is not fair i was not prepared for it i was so sure it was not true i cant understand it but whether it is true or not while it lasts agnes while it lastsand she hid her face again and the bangles and serpents of silver and gold jingled more merrily than ever you think said agnes that you will get over it get over it she cried how often do you suppose i have said to myself that i must get over it how many thousand times i must get over it is it a thing to trifle with and be sentimental over it is a degradation i dont spare myself no one could say to me more than i say to myself i cannot spare it and i must get over it but i donti donti dont and sometimes the horrible thought comes to me that it is a thing you cant get over and it drives me mad butbut but what said agnes her hands dropped away from her face if i tell you this she said breathlessly you will despise me i think i am going to tell it to you that you may despise me the torture of it will be a sort of penance when the thought comes to me that i may get over it that it will go out of my life in time and be lost forever then i know that compared to that all the rest is nothingnothing and that i could bear it for an eternity the anguish and the shame and the bitterness if only it might not be taken away oh cried agnes i can believe it i can believe it you can believe it said bertha fiercely you yes but ii cannot for some minutes after this agnes did not speak she sat still and looked down at berthas cowering figure there came back to her with terrible distinctness times when she herself must have looked soonly she had always been aloneand there mingled with the deep feeling of the moment a faraway pity for her own helpless youth and despair will you tell me she said at last how it began she was struck when bertha lifted her face from its cushions by the change which had come upon her all traces of intense and passionate feeling were gone it was as if her weeping had swept them away and left only a weariness which made her look pathetically young and helpless as she watched her agnes wondered if she had ever looked up at tredennis with such eyes i think she said that it was long before i knew if i had not been so young and so thoughtless i think i should have known that i began to care for him before he went away the first time but i was very young and he was so quiet there was one day when he brought me some heliotrope when i wondered why i liked the quiet things he said and after he went away i used to wonder in a sort of fitful way what he was doing and the first time i found myself face to face with a trouble i thought of him and wished for him without knowing why i even began a letter to him but i was too timid to send it oh if you had sent it agnes exclaimed involuntarily yesif i had sent it but i did not perhaps it would not have made much difference if i had only when i told him of it you told him of it said agnes yesin virginia all the wrong i have done all the indulgence i have allowed myself is the wrong i did and the indulgence i allowed myself in virginia there were days in virginia when i suppose i was bad enough tell me that afterward said agnes i want to know how you reached it i reached it answered bertha in this way the thing that was my first trouble grew until it was too strong for meor i was too weak for it it was my own fault perhaps i ought to have known but i did not i dont think that i have let any one but myself suffer for my mistake i couldnt do that when i found out what a mistake it was i told myself that it was mine and that i must abide by it and in time i thought i had grown quite hard and i amused myself and said that nothing mattered and i did not believe in emotion and thought i enjoyed living on the surface i disliked to hear stories of any strong feeling i tried to avoid reading them and i was always glad when i heard clever worldly speeches made i liked laurence first because he said such clever coldblooded things he was at his worst when i first knew him he had lost all his money and some one had been false to him and he believed nothing i did not know said agnes that he had a story and then she added a trifle hurriedly but it does not matter it mattered to him said bertha and we all have a storyeven poor larryand even ieven i then she went on again there was one thing she said that i told myself oftener than anything else and that was that i was not unhappy i was always saying that and giving myself reasons when my dresses were becoming and i went out a great deal and people seemed to admire me i used to say how few women are as happy how many things i have to make me happy and when a horrible moment of leisure came and i could not bear it i would say how tired i must be to feel as i do and what nonsense it is the one thing richard has liked most in me has been that i have not given way to my moods and have always reasoned about them ah agnes if i had been happier i might have given way to them just a little sometimes and have been less tired if i were to die now i know what they would remember of me that i laughed a great deal and made the house gay she went on without tears i think she said that i never felt so sure of myself as i did last winterso sure that i had lived past things and was quite safe it was a very gay season and there were several people here who amused me and made things seem brilliant and enjoyable when i was not going out the parlors were always crowded with clever men and women and when i did go out i danced and talked and interested myself more than i had ever seemed to do before i shall never forget the inauguration ball laurence and richard were both with me and i danced every dance and had the most brilliant night i dont think one expects to be actually brilliant at an inauguration ball but that night i think we were and when we were going away we turned to look back and laurence said what a night it has been we couldnt possibly have had such a night if we had tried i wonder if we shall ever have such a night again and i said scores of them i havent a doubt but that was the last night of all the last night of all repeated agnes there have been no more nights at all like it and no more days the next night but one the winter gardners gave a party and i was there laurence brought me some roses and heliotrope and i carried them and i remember how the scent of the heliotrope reminded me of the night i sat and talked to philip tredennis by the fire it came back all the more strongly because i had heard from papa of his return i was not glad that he had come to washington and i did not care to see him he seemed to belong to a time i wanted to forget i did not know he was to be at the gardners until he came in and i looked up and saw him at the door you know how he looks when he comes into a roomso tall and strong and different from all the rest does he look different from all the rest agnesor is it only that i think so he is different said agnes even i could see that oh said bertha despairingly i dont know what it is that makes it so but sometimes i have thought that perhaps when first men were on earth they were like thatstrong and earnest and simple and bravenever trifling with themselves or others and always ready to be tender with those who suffer or are weak if you only knew the stories we have heard of his courage and determination and endurance i do not think he ever remembers them himself but how can the rest of us forget the first thought i had when i saw him was that it was odd that the mere sight of him should startle me so and then i watched him pass through the crowds and tried to make a paltry satirical comment to myself upon his size and his grave face and then against my will i began to wonder what he would do when he saw me and if he would see what had happened to me since he had given me the flowers for my first party and i wished he had stayed awayand i began to feel tiredand just then he turned and saw me she paused and sank into a wearied sitting posture resting her cheek against the sofa cushion it seems so long agoso long ago she said and yet it is not one short year since she went on almost monotonously he saw the change in mei knew thatthough he did not know what it meant i suppose he thought the bad side of me had developed instead of the good because the bad had predominated in the first place he never thought that agnes interposed never dont you think so said bertha well it was not my fault if he didnt i dont know whether it was natural or not that i should always make the worst of myself before him but i always did i did not want him to come to the house but richard brought him again and again until he had been so often that there must have been some serious reasons if he had stayed away and thenand then what then said agnes she made a gesture of passionate impatience oh i dont know she said i dont know i began to be restless and unhappy i did not care for going out and i dared not stay at home when i was alone i used to sit and think of that first winter and compare myself with the bertha who lived then as if she had been another creaturesome one i had been fond of and who had died in some sad unexpected way while she was very young i used to be angry because i found myself so easily movedthings touched me which had never touched me before and one day as i was singing a little german song of farewellthat poor little piteous auf wiedersehn we all knowsuddenly my voice broke and i gave a helpless sob and the tears streamed down my cheeks it filled me with terror i have never been a crying woman and i have rather disliked people who cried when i cried i knew that some terrible change had come upon me and i hated myself for it i told myself i was ill and i said i would go away but richard wished me to remain and every day it was worse and worse and when i was angry with myself i revenged myself on the person i should have spared when i said things of myself which were false he had a way of looking at me as if he was simply waiting to hear what i would say next and i never knew whether he believed me or not and i resented that more than all the rest she broke off for an instant and then began again hurriedly why should i make such a long story of it she said i could not tell it all nor the half of it if i talked until tomorrow if i had been given to sentiments and emotions i could not have deceived myself so long as i did that is all i have known women who have had experiences and sentiments all their lives one after another i used to know girls when i was a girl who were always passing through some sentimental adventure but i was not like that and i never understood them but i think it is better to be so than to live unmoved so long that you feel you are quite safe and then to waken up to face the feeling of a lifetime all at once it is better to take it by instalments if i had been more experienced i should have been safer but i deceived myself and called what i suffered by every name but the right one i said it was resentment and wounded vanity and weakness but it was notit was not there was one person who knew it was not though he let me call it what i pleased he said agnes it was laurence arbuthnot who knew he had been wretched himself once and while he laughed at me and talked nonsense he cared enough for me to watch me and understand it would never have occurred to me remarked agnes to say he did not care for you i think he cares for you very much yes he cares for me said bertha and i can see now that he was kinder to me than i knew he stood between me and many a miserable moment and warded off things i could not have warded off myself i think he hoped at first that i would get over it it was he who helped me to make up my mind to go away it seemed the best thing but it would have been better if i had not gone better agnes repeated there was a fate in it she said everything was against me when i said goodby toto the person i wished to escape fromthough i did not admit to myself then that it was from him i wished to escapewhen i said goodby i thought it was almost the same thing as saying goodby forever i had always told myself that i was too superficial to be troubled by anything long and that i could always forget anything i was determined to put behind me i had done it before and i fancied i could do it then and that when i came back in the winter i should have got over my moods and be stronger physically and not be emotional any more i meant to take the children and give them every hour of my days and live outofdoors in a simple natural way until i was well i always called it getting well but when he came to say goodbyit was very hard it was so hard that i was terrified again he spent the evening with us and the hours slipped awayslipped away and every time the clock struck my heart beat so fast that at last instead of beating it seemed only to tremble and make me weak and at last he got up to go and i could not believe that it was true that he was really going until he went out of the door and then so much seemed to go with him and we had only said a few commonplace wordsand it was the lastlast time and it all rushed upon me and my heart leaped in my side andand i went to him there was no other way and o agnes i knowi know said agnes brokenly buttry not to do that it is the worst thing you can doto cry so he did not know why i came bertha said i dont know what he thought i dont know what i said he looked pale and startled at first and then he took my hand in both his and spoke to me i have seen him hold janeys hand soas if he could not be gentle enough and he said it was always hard to say goodby and would i rememberand his voice was quite unsteadywould i remember that if i should ever need any help he was ready to be called i had treated him badly and coldly that very evening but it was as if he forgot it and i forgot too and for just one little moment we were near each other and there was nothing in our hearts but sadness and kindness as if we had been friends who had the right to be sad at parting and we said goodby againand he went away i fought very hard in those next two months and i was very determined i never allowed myself time to think in the daytime i played with the children and read to them and walked with them and when night came i used to be tired out but i did not sleep i laid awake trying to force my thoughts back and when morning broke it seemed as if all my strength was spent and i did not get well and when it all seemed at the worst suddenly janey was taken ill and i thought she would die and i was all alone and i sent for papa she broke off with the ghost of a bitter little laugh i have heard a great deal said about fate she went on perhaps it was fate i dont know i dont care nowit doesnt matter that very day papa was ill himself and philip tredennis came to mephilip tredennis oh cried agnes it was very cruel was it cruel said bertha it was something perhaps it would do to call it cruel i had been up with janey for two or three nights she had suffered a great deal for a little creature and i was worn out with seeing her pain and not being able to help it i was expecting the doctor from washington and when she fell asleep at last i went to the window to listen so that i might go down and keep the dogs quiet if he came it was one of those still white moonlight nightsthe most beautiful night after a while i fancied i heard the faraway hoofbeat of a horse on the road and i ran down the dogs knew me and seemed to understand i wished them to be quiet when i spoke to them as the noise came nearer i went down to the gate i was trembling with eagerness and anxiety and i spoke before i reached it i was sure it was doctor malcolm but it was some one larger and taller and the figure came out into the moonlight and i was looking up at philip tredennis agnes laid her hand on her arm wait a moment before you go on she said give yourself time no said bertha hurrying i will go on to the end agnes i have never lied to myself since that minutenever once where would have been the use i thought he was forty miles away and there he stood and the terror and joy and anguish of seeing him swept everything else away and i broke down i dont know what he felt and thought there was one strange moment when he stood quite close to me and touched my shoulder with his strong kind hand he seemed overwhelmed by what i did and his voice was only a whisper there seemed no one in all the world but ourselves and when i lifted my face from the gate i knew what all i had suffered meant as he talked to me afterward i was saying over to myself as if it was a lesson i was learning you are mad with joy just because this man is near you all your pain has gone away everything is as it was before but you dont careyou dont care i said that because i wished to make it sound as wicked as i could but it was of no use i have even thought since then that if he had been a bad man thinking of himself i might have been saved that night by finding it out but he was not thinking of himselfonly of me he came not for his own sake but for mine and janeys he came to help us and stand by us and care for us to do any common simple service for us as well as any great one we were not to think of him he was to think of us and he sent me away upstairs to sleep and walked outside below the window all night and i slept like a child i should not have slept if it had been any one else but it seemed as if he had brought strength and quietness with him and i need not stay awake because everything was so safe that has been his power over me from the firstthat he rested me sometimes i have been so tired of the feverish restless way we have of continually amusing ourselves as if we dare not stop and of reasoning and wondering and arguing to no end we are all introspection and retrospection and we call it being analytical and clever if it is being clever then we are too clever one gets so tired of it one wishes one could stop thinking and know lessor more he was not like that and he rested me that was it he made life seem more simple well he rested me then and though i made one effort to send him away i knew he would not go and i did not try very hard i did not want him to go so when he refused to be sent away an obstinate feeling came over me and i said to myself that i would not do or say one unkind thing to him while he was there i would be as gentle and natural with him as ifas if he had been some slight paltry creature who was nothing and less than nothing to me i should have been amiable enough to such a man if i had been indebted to him for such service ah sighed agnes but it could not end there end said bertha there is no end there never will be do you think i do not see the bitter truth one may call it what one likes and make it as pathetic and as tragic and hopeless as words can paint it but it is only the old miserable undignified story of a woman who is married and who cares for a man who is not her husband nothing can be worse than that it is a curious thing isnt it that somehow one always feels as if the woman must be bad agnes sylvestre laid a hand on her again without speaking i suppose i was bad in those days bertha continued i did not feel as if i wasthough i dare say that only makes it worse i deliberately let myself be happy i let him be kind to me i tried to amuse and please him janey got well and the days were beautiful i did all he wished me to do and he was as good to me as he was to janey when you spoke of his being so gentle it brought everything back to me in a rushhis voice and his look and his touch there are so many people who when they touch you seem to take something from you he always seemed to give you somethingprotection and sympathy and generous help he had none of the gallant tricks of other men and he was often a little shy and restrained but the night he held my hand in both his and the moment he touched my shoulder when i broke down so at the gate i could not forget if i tried but perhaps said agnes sadly you had better try bertha looked up at her when i have tried for a whole year she said i will tell you what success i have had oh agnes cried desperately it will take more than a year i have thought it might said bertha perhaps it may take even two the fire gave a fitful leap of flame and she turned to look at it the fire is going out she said and i have almost finished do you care to hear the rest you have been very patient to listen so long go on agnes said well much as i indulged myself then i knew where i must stop and i never really forgot that i was going to stop at a certain point i said that i would be happy just so long as he was there and that when we parted that would be the end of it i even laid out my plans and the night before he was to go awayin the evening after the long beautiful day was overi said things to him which i meant should make him distrust me the shallowest man on earth will hate you if you make him think you are shallow and capable of trifling as he does himself the less a man intends to remember you the more he intends you shall remember him it will be his religious belief that women should be truesome one should be true you know and it is easier to let it be the woman what i tried to suggest that night was that my treatment of him had only been a capricethat what he had seen of me in washington had been the real side of my life and that he would see it again and need not be surprised o bertha her friend cried o bertha and she threw both arms about her with an intensely feminine swiftness and expressiveness yes said bertha it was not easy i never tried anything quite so difficult before and perhaps i did not do it well forhe would not believe me there was quite a long pause in which she leaned against agnes breathing quickly i think that is really the end she said at last it seems rather abrupt but there is very little more he is a great deal stronger than i am and he is too true himself to believe lies at the first telling one must tell them to him obstinately and often i shall have to be persistent and consistent too what do you mean exclaimed agnes what are you thinking of doing there will be a great deal to be done she answereda great deal there is only one thing which will make him throw me aside throw you asideyou yes i have always been very proudit was the worst of my faults that i was so deadly proudbut i want him to throw me asideme surely one could not care for a man when he was tired and did not want one any more that must end it and there is something else i dont knowi am not surei could not trust myselfbut there have been times when i thought that he was beginning to care toowhether he knew it or not i dont judge him by the other men i have known but sometimes there was such a look in his eyes that it made me tremble with fear and joy and he shall not spoil his life for me it would be a poor thing that he should give all he might giveto bertha amory he had better give it toto you agnes she said with a little tightening grasp i do not want it said agnes calmly i have done with such things and he is not the man to change he must said bertha in timeif i am very unflinching and clever they always said i was clever you know and that i had wonderful control over myself but i shall have to be very clever the only thing which will make him throw me aside is the firm belief that i am worth nothingthe belief that i am false and shallow and selfish and as wicked as such a slight creature can be let me hide the little that is good in me and show him always day by day what is bad there is enough of that and in the end he must get tired of me and show me that he has done with me forever you cannot do it said agnes breathlessly i cannot do it for long i know that but i can do it for a while and then i will make richard let me go awayto europe i have asked him before but he seemed so anxious to keep mei cannot tell whyand i have never opposed or disobeyed him i try to be a good wife in such things as that i ought to be a good wife in something just now he has some reason for wishing me to remain here he does not always tell me his reasons but perhaps in the spring he will not object to my going and one can always spend a year or so abroad and when he joins us as he will afterward he will be sure to be fascinated and in the end we might stay away for years and if we ever come back all will be over andand i shall be forgotten she withdrew herself from her friends arms and rose to her feet i shall be forgottenforgotten she said oh how can i be how can such pain pass away and end in nothing just while everything is at the worst it is not easy to remember that one only counts for one after all and that a life is such a little thing it seems so much to ones self and yet what does it matter that bertha amorys life went all wrong and was only a bubble that was tossed away and broken there are such millions and millions of people that it means nothing only to bertha amory and it cannot mean anything to her very long only just while it lastsand before one gets used toto the torture of it she turned away and crossed the room to the window drawing aside the curtain there is a little streak of light in the east she said it is the day and you have not slept at all agnes went to her and they stood and looked at it togethera faint thin line of gray tinged with palest yellow tomorrow has come said bertha and we must begin the new year properly i must make up my visitingbook and arrange my lists dontdont call any one agnesit is onlyfaintness and with the little protesting smile on her lips she sank to the floor agnes knelt down at her side and began to loosen her wrapper at the throat and chafe her hands yes it is only faintness she said in a low voice but if it were something more you would be saved a great deal chapter xxiii on dit that the charming mrs sylvestre so well known and so greatly admired in society circles as miss agnes wentworth has after several years of absence much deplored by her numberless friends returned to make her home in washington having taken a house on lafayette square the three years of mrs sylvestres widowhood have been spent abroad chiefly in italythe land of love and beautywhere tasso sang and raphael dreamed of the immortals thus the society column of a daily paper and a week later mrs merriam arrived and the house on lafayette square was taken possession of it was one of the older housesa large and substantial one whose rather rigorous exterior still held forth promises of possibilities in the way of interior development arbuthnot heard bertha mention one day that one of mrs sylvestres chief reasons for selecting it was that it looked quiet and he reflected upon this afterward as being rather unusual as the reason of a young and beautiful woman though after all she looks quiet herself was his mental comment if i felt called upon to remark upon her at all i should certainly say that she was a perfectly composed person perhaps that is the groove she chooses to live in or it may be simply her nature i shouldnt mind knowing which he was rather desirous of seeing what she would make of the place inside but the desire was by no means strong enough to lead him to make his first call upon her an hour earlier than he might have been expected according to the strictest canons of good taste on her part mrs sylvestre found great pleasure in the days spent in establishing herself for years her life had been an unsettled one and the prospect of arranging a home according to her own tastesand especially a home in washingtonwas very agreeable to her her fortune was large her time was her own and as in the course of her rambling she had collected innumerable charming and interesting odds and ends there was no reason why her house should not be a delightful one for several days she was quite busy and greatly interested she found her pictures plaques and hangings even more absorbing than she had imagined they would be she spent her mornings in arranging and rearranging cabinets walls and mantels and moved about her rooms wearing a faint smile of pleasure on her lips and a faint tinge of color on her cheeks really she said to bertha who dropped in to see her one morning and found her standing in the middle of the room reflecting upon a pretty old blue cup and saucer i am quite happy in a quiet way i seem to be shut in from the world and life and all busy things and to find interest enough in the color of a bit of china or the folds of a portire it seems almost exciting to put a thing on a shelf and then take it down and put it somewhere else when arbuthnot passed the house he saw that rich easternlooking stuffs curtained the windows and great indian jars stood on the steps and balconies as if ready for plants in exhausting the resources of the universe mr sylvestre had given some attention to india and being a man of caprices had not returned from his explorings emptyhanded a carriage stood before the house and the door being open revealed glimpses of pictures and hangings in the hall which were pleasantly suggestive she will make it attractive arbuthnot said to himself that goes without saying and she will be rather perilously so herself his first call upon her was always a very distinct memory to him it was made on a rather chill and unpleasant evening and being admitted by a servant into the hall he had before caught a glimpse of its picturesque comfort and warmth impressed themselves upon him in the strongest possible contrast to the raw dampness and darkness of the night through halfdrawn portires he had a flitting glance at two or three rooms and a passing impression of some bright or deep point of color on drapery bricbrac or pictures and then he was ushered into the room in which mrs sylvestre sat herself she had been sitting before the fire with a book upon her lap and she rose to meet him still holding the volume in her hand she was dressed in violet and wore a large cluster of violets loosely at her waist she looked very slender and tall and fair and the rich darkly glowing colors of the furniture and hangings formed themselves into a background for her as if the accomplishment of that end had been the sole design of their existence arbuthnot even wondered if it was possible that she would ever again look so well as she did just at the instant she rose and moved forward though he recognized the folly of the thought before ten minutes had passed she looked quite as well when she reseated herself and even better when she became interested in the conversation which followed it was a conversation which dealt principally with the changes which had taken place in washington during her absence from it she found a great many it strikes me as a little singular that you do not resent them more said arbuthnot most of them are changes for the better she answered ah he returned but that would not make any difference to the ordinary mindunless it awakened additional resentment there is a sense of personal injury in recognizing that improvements have been made entirely without our assistance i do not feel it was her reply or it is lost in my pleasure in being at home again she has always thought of it as home then was arbuthnots mental comment that is an inadvertent speech which tells a story his impressions of the late mr sylvestre were not agreeable ones he had heard him discussed frequently by men who had known him and the stories told of him were not pleasant after fifteen minutes in the crucible of impartial public opinion his manifold brilliant gifts and undeniable graces and attainments had a habit of disappearing in vapor and leaving behind them a residuum of coldblooded selfishness and fine disregard of all human feelings in others not easily disposed of arbuthnot had also noticed that there was but one opinion expressed on the subject of his marriage he married a lovely girl twelve or fifteen years younger than himself he had heard a man say once i should like to see what he has made of her you would ejaculated an older man i shouldnt heaven forbid it added greatly to arbuthnots interest in her that she bore no outward signs of any conflict she might have passed through whatever it had been she had borne it with courage and kept her secret her own the quiet of her manner was not suggestive either of sadness or selfrepression and she made no apparent effort to evade mention of her married life though as she spoke of herself but seldom it seemed entirely natural that she should refer rarely to the years she had passed away from washington when a little later mrs merriam came in she proved to be as satisfactory as all other appurtenances to the household she was a picturesque elderly woman with a small elegant figure an acute little countenance and large dark eyes which sparkled in the most amazing manner at times she was an old washingtonian herself had lived through several administrations and had made the most of her experience she seemed to have personally known the notabilities of half a century and her reminiscences gave arbuthnot a feeling of being surpassingly youthful and modern she had been living abroad for the last seven years and finding herself at home once more seemed to settle down with a sense of relief it is a bad habit to get intothis of living abroad she said it is a habit and it grows on one i went away intending to remain a year and i should probably have ended my existence in europe if mrs sylvestre had not brought me home i was always a little homesick too and continually felt the need of a new administration but i lacked the resolution it required to leave behind me the things i had become accustomed to when he went away arbuthnot discovered that it was with her he had talked more than with mrs sylvestre and yet while he had been in the room it had not occurred to him that mrs sylvestre was silent her silence was not unresponsiveness when he looked back upon it he found that there was even something delicately inspiring in it it is that expression of gentle attentiveness in her eyes he said it makes your most trivial remark of consequence and convinces you that if she spoke she would be sure to say what it would please you most to hear it is a great charm for a few moments before returning to his rooms he dropped in upon the amory household there was no one in the parlor when he entered but colonel tredennis who stood with his back to the fire apparently plunged deep in thought his glance fixed upon the rug at his feet he was in evening dress and held a pair of white gloves in his hand but he did not wear a festive countenance arbuthnot thought that he looked jaded and worn certainly there were deep lines left on his forehead even when he glanced up and straightened it i am waiting for mrs amory he said amory is out of town and as we were both going to the reception at the secretary of states i am to accompany her i think she will be down directly yes there she is they saw her through the portires descending the staircase as he spoke she was gleaming in creamy satin and lace and carried a wrap over her arm she came into the room with a soft rustle of trailing draperies and tredennis stirred slightly and then stood still did i keep you waiting very long she said i hope not and then turned to arbuthnot as she buttoned her long glove deliberately richard has gone to baltimore with a theatre party she explained miss varien went and halfadozen others i did not care to go and richard persuaded colonel tredennis to assume his responsibilities for the evening and take me to the secretary of states the president is to be there and as i have not yet told him that i approve of his cabinet and dont object to his message i feel i ought not to keep him in suspense any longer your approval will naturally remove a load of anxiety from his mind said arbuthnot can i be of any assistance to you in buttoning that glove she hesitated a second and then extended her wrist to arbuthnot who had occasionally performed the service for her before there was something novel both in the hesitation and the delicate suggestion of coquettish surrender in her gesture it had been the chief of her charms for him that her coquetries were of the finer and more reserved sort and that they had never expended themselves upon him this was something so new that his momentary bewilderment did not add to his dexterity and the glovebuttoning was of longer duration than it would otherwise have been while it was being accomplished colonel tredennis looked on in silence he had never buttoned a womans glove in his life it seemed to him that it was scarcely the thing for a man who was neither husband brother nor lover to do if there was any deep feeling in his heart how could this careless conventional fellow stand there and hold her little wrist and meet her lifted eyes without betraying himself his reasoning was not very logical in its nature it was the reasoning of pain and hot anger and other uneasy and masterful emotions which so got the better of him that he turned suddenly away that he might not see scarcely knowing what he did it was an abrupt movement and attracted arbuthnots attention as also did something elsea movement of berthasan unsteadiness of the gloved hand which however was speedily controlled or ended he glanced at her but only to find her smiling though her breath came a little quickly and her eyes looked exceedingly bright i am afraid you find it rather troublesome she said extremely he replied but i look upon it in the light of moral training and sustained by a sense of duty will endeavor to persevere he felt the absurdity and triviality of the words all the more perhaps because as he uttered them he caught a glimpse of tredennis halfaverted face there was that in its jaded look which formed too sharp a contrast to inconsequent jesting it is not getting easier for him was his thought it wont until it has driven him harder even than it does now perhaps there was something in his own humor which made him a trifle more susceptible to outward influences than usual as has been already intimated he had his moods and he had felt one of them creeping upon him like a shadow during his brief walk through the dark streets i hear the carriage at the door he said when he had buttoned the glove dont let me detain you i am on my way home you have beenquestioned bertha suddenly awakening to a new interest on her own part i called upon mrs sylvestre he answered and then he assisted her to put on her wrap and they all went out to the carriage together when she was seated and the door closed bertha leaned forward and spoke through the open window dont you think the house very pretty she inquired very was his brief reply and though she seemed to expect him to add more he did not do so and the carriage drove away and left him standing upon the sidewalk ah said bertha leaning back with a faint smile he will go again and again and yet again will he said the colonel let us hope he will enjoy it but the truth was that the subject did not awaken in him any absorbing interest oh he will enjoy it she responded and mrs sylvestre suggested tredennis he will never be sure what she thinks of him or what she wishes him to think of her though she will have no caprices and will always treat him beautifully and the uncertainty will make him enjoy himself more than ever such a state of bliss said the colonel is indeed greatly to be envied he was always conscious of a rather dreary sense of bewilderment when he heard himself giving voice in his deep tones to such small change as the above remark under such circumstances there was suggested to him the idea that for the moment he had changed places with some more luckily facile creature and represented him but awkwardly and yet of late he had found himself gradually bereft of all other conversational resource since the new years day when bertha had called his attention to the weather he had seen in her no vestige of what had so moved him in the brief summer holiday in which she had seemed to forget to arm herself against him it appeared that his place was fixed for him and that nothing remained but to occupy it with as good a grace as possible but he knew he had not borne it well at the outset it was but nature that he should have borne it ill and have made some effort at least to understand the meaning of the change in her all this goes for nothing he had said to her but it had not gone for nothing after all a man who loves a woman with the whole force of his being whether it is happily or unhappily is not a wellregulated creature wholly under his own control his imagination will play him bitter tricks and taunt him many an hour both in the bright day and in the dead watches of the night when he wakens to face his misery alone he will see things as they are not and be haunted by phantoms whose vague outlines torture him while he knows their unreality it is not true he will say it cannot beand yet if it should bethough it is not a word a smile the simplest glance or tone will distort themselves until their very slightness seems the most damning proof but that he saw his own folly and danger there were times on those first days when tredennis might have been betrayed by his fierce sense of injury into mistakes which it would have been impossible for him to retrieve by any after effort but even in the moments of his greatest weakness he refused to trifle with himself on the night of the new years day when bertha and agnes had sat together he had kept a vigil too the occupant of the room below his had heard him walking to and fro and had laid his restlessness to a great number of new years calls instead of to a guilty conscience but the colonel had been less lenient with himself and had fought a desperate battle in the silent hours what rights have i he had said in anguish and humiliationwhat rights have i at the best if her heart was as tender toward me as it seems hard that would be worse than all it would seem then that i must tear myself from her for her sake as well as for my own as it is i can at least be near her and torture myself and let her torture me and perhaps some day do her some poor kindness of which she knows nothing only i must face the truth that i have no claim upon hernone if she chooses to change her mood why should i expect or demand an explanation the wife of one man thethe beloved of anothero bertha bertha and he buried his face in his hands and sat so in the darkness and in the midst of his misery he seemed to hear again the snatch of song she had sung as she sat on the hillside with her face half upturned to the blue sky the memory of that day and of some of those which had gone before it cost him more than all else it came back to him suddenly when he had reduced himself to a dead level of feeling once or twice when he was with bertha herself it returned to him with such freshness and vivid truth that it seemed for a moment that a single word would sweep every barrier away and they would stand face to face speaking the simple truth whatever it might be why not he thought why not after all if she is unhappy and needs a friend why should it not be the man who would bear either death or life for her but he said nothing of this when he spoke to her after their first two or three interviews he said less than ever each of those interviews was like the first she talked to him as she talked to arbuthnot to planefield to the attachs of the legations to the clever newspaper man from new york or boston who was brought in by a friend on one of her evenings because he wished to see if the paragraphists had overrated her attractions she paid him graceful conventional attentions she met him with a smile when he entered if he was grave she hoped he was not unwell or out of spirits she made fine feathery jesting little speeches as if she expected them to amuse him she gave him his share of her presence of her conversation of her laugh and went her way to some one else to whom she gave the same things and why should i complain he said but he did complain or some feverish bitter ache in his soul complained for him and wrought him all sorts of evil and wore him out and deepened the lines on his face and made him feel old and hopeless he was very kind to janey in those days and spent a great deal of time with her it was janey who was his favorite though he was immensely liberal to jack and bestowed upon meg who was too young for him elaborate and expensive toys which she reduced to fragments and dissected and analyzed with her brothers assistance he used to go to see janey in the nursery and take her out to walk and drive and at such times felt rather glad that she was not like her mother she bore no likeness to bertha and was indeed thought to resemble the professor who was given to wondering at her as he had long ago wondered at her mother the colonel fancied that it rested him to ramble about in company with this small creature they went to the parks hand in hand so often that the nursemaids who took their charges there began to know them quite well the popular theory among them being that the colonel was an interesting widower and the little one his motherless child the winter was a specially mild one even for washington and it was generally pleasant out of doors and frequently janeys escort sat on one of the green benches and read his paper while she disported herself on the grass near him or found entertainment in propelling her family of dolls up and down the walk in their carriage they had long and interesting conversations together and once or twice even went to the capitol itself and visited the house and the senate deriving much pleasure and benefit from looking down upon the rulers of their country rising to points of order in their customary aweinspiring way on one of these occasions possibly overpowered by the majesty of the scene janey fell asleep and an hour later as bertha stepped from her carriage with cards and callinglist in hand she encountered a large wellknown figure bearing in its arms with the most astonishing accustomed gentleness and care a supine little form whose head confidingly reposed on the broadest of shoulders she went to sleep said the colonel with quite a paternal demeanor he thought at first that bertha was going to kiss the child she made a step forward an eager tenderness kindling in her eyes then checked herself and laughed half shrugging her shoulders may i ask if you carried her the entire length of the avenue in the face of the multitude she said you were very good and displayed most delightful moral courage if you did but it must not occur again she must not go out without a nurse if she is so much trouble she is no trouble he answered and it was not necessary to carry her the length of the avenue bertha went into the house before him i will ring for a nurse she said at the parlor door she will be attended toand you are extremely amiable i have been calling all the afternoon and have just dropped in for richard who is going with me to the drummonds musicale but tredennis did not wait for the nurse he knew the way to the nursery well enough and bore off his little burden to her own domains sans crmonie while bertha stood and watched him from below if she had been gay the winter before she was gayer still now she had her afternoon for reception and her evening at home and gave also a series of more elaborate and formal entertainments at these festivities the political element was represented quite brilliantly she professed to have begun at last to regard politics seriously and though this statement was not received with the most entire confidence the most liberal encouragement was bestowed upon her richard especially seemed to find entertainment in her whim he even admitted that he himself took an interest in the affairs of the nation this winter he had been awakened to it by his intimacy with planefield which increased as the business connected with the westoria lands grew upon him there was a great deal of this business to be transacted it appeared though his references to the particular form of his share of it were never very definite being marked chiefly by a brilliant vagueness which bertha was wont to observe added interest to the subject i should not understand if you explained it of course she said and as i dont understand i can give play to a naturally vivid imagination all sorts of events may depend upon you perhaps it is even necessary of you to lobby and you are engaged in all sorts of machinations how do people lobby richard and is there an opening in the profession for a young person of undeniable gifts and charms in these days planefield presented himself more frequently than ever people began to expect to see his large florid figure at the evenings and dinnerparties and gradually he and his friends formed an element in them it was a new element and not altogether the most delightful one some of the friends were not remarkable for polish of manner and familiarity with the convenances and one or two of them after they began to feel at ease talked a good deal in rather pronounced tones and occasionally enjoyed themselves with a freedom from the shackles of ceremony which seemed rather to belong to some atmosphere other than that of the pretty bright parlors but it would not have been easy to determine what bertha thought of the matter she accepted richards first rather apologetic mention of it gracefully enough and after a few evenings he no longer apologized they may be a trifle uncouth he had said but some of them are tremendous fellows when you understand themshrewd farseeing politicians who may astonish the world any day by some sudden brilliant move such men nearly always work their way from the ranks and have had no time to study the graces but they are very interesting and will appreciate the attention you show them there is that man bowman for instancebegan life as a boy in a blacksmiths shop and has been in congress for years they would send him to the senate if they could spare him he is a positive mine of political information and knows the westoria business from beginning to end they all seem to know more or less of it said bertha that is our atmosphere now i am gradually assimilating information myself but tredennis did not reconcile himself to the invasion he looked on in restless resentment what right had such men to be near her was his bitter thought being a man himself he knew more of some of them than he could remember without anger or distaste he could not regard them impartially as mere forces forgetting all else when he saw planefield at her side bold fulsome bent on absorbing her attention and frequently succeeding through sheer thickskinned pertinacity he was filled with wrathful repulsion this man at least he knew had no right to claim consideration from her and yet somehow he seemed to have established himself in an intimacy which appeared gradually to become a part of her everyday life this evening on entering the house he had met him leaving it and when he went into the parlor he had seen upon berthas little worktable the customary sumptuous offering of jacqueminot roses she carried the flowers in her hand nowtheir heavy perfume filled the carriage there is no use in asking why she does it he was thinking i have given up expecting to understand her i suppose she has a reason i wont believe it is as poor a one as common vanity or coquetry such things are beneath her he understood himself as little as he understood her there were times when he wondered how long his unhappiness would last and if it would not die a natural death no mans affection and tenderness could feed upon nothing and survive he told himself again and again and what was there to sustain his this was not the woman he had dreamed offrom her it should be easy enough for him to shake himself free what to him were her cleverness her bright eyes her power over herself and others the subtle charms and graces which were shared by all who came near her they were only the gift of a finer order of coquette who was a greater success than the rest because nature had been lavish with her it was not these things which could have changed and colored all life for him if all his thoughts of her had been mere fancies it would be only natural that he should outlive his experience and in time look back upon it as simply an episode which might have formed a part of the existence of any man there had been nights when he had left the house thinking it would be far better for him never to return if he could remain away without awakening comment but once in the quiet of his room there always came back to him memories and fancies he could not rid himself of and which made the scenes he had left behind unreal he used to think it must be this which kept his tenderness from dying a lingering death when he was alone it seemed as if he found himself face to face again with the old innocent ideal that followed him with tender appealing eyes and would not leave him he began to have an odd fancy about the feeling it was as if when he left the silent room he left in it the truth and reality of his dream and found them there when he returned why do you look at me so bertha said to him one night turning suddenly aside from the group she had been the central figure of you look at me as ifas if i were a ghost and you were ready to see me vanish into thin air he made a slight movement as if rousing himself that is it he answered i am waiting to see you vanish but you will not see it she said you will be disappointed i am realreal a ghost could not laugh as i doand enjoy itself its laugh would have a hollow sound i assure you i am very real indeed but he did not answer her and after looking at him with a faint smile for a second or so she turned to her group again tonight as they drove to their destination once or twice in passing a streetlamp the light flashing into the carriage showed him that bertha leaned back in her corner with closed eyes her flowers lying untouched on her lap he thought she seemed languid and pale though she had not appeared so before they left the house and this touched him as such things always did there was no moment however deep and fierce his bewildered sense of injury might have been before it when a shade of pallor on her cheek or of sadness in her eyes a look or tone of weariness would not undo everything and stir all his great heart with sympathy and the tender longing to be kind to her the signs of sadness or pain in any human creature would have moved him but such signs in her overwhelmed him and swept away every other feeling but this yearning desire to shield and care for her he looked at her now with anxious eyes and bent forward to draw up her wrap which had slipped from her shoulders are you warm enough bertha he said with awkward gentleness it is a raw night you should have had moremore shawlsor whatever they are she opened her eyes with a smile more shawls she said we dont wear shawls now when we go to receptions they are not becoming enough even when they are very grand indeed this is not a shawlit is a sortie du bal and a very pretty one but i think i am warm enough thank you and it was very good in you to ask and though he had not known that his own voice was gentle he recognized that hers was somebody ought to ask he answered and just then they turned the corner into a street already crowded with carriages and their own drew up before the lighted front of a large house tredennis got out and gave bertha his hand as she emerged from the shadow of the carriage the light fell upon her again and he was impressed even more forcibly than before with her pallor you would have been a great deal better at home he said impetuously why did you come here she paused a second and it seemed to him as if she suddenly gave up some tense hold she had previously kept upon her external self there was only the pathetic little ghost of a smile in her lifted eyes yes i should be better at home she said almost in a whisper i would rather be asleep withwith the children then why in heavens name do you go he protested bertha let me take you home and leave you to rest it must be soi but the conventionalities did not permit that he should give way to the fine masculine impulse which might have prompted him in the heat of his emotions to return her to the carriage by the sheer strength of his unaided arm and he recognized his own tone of command and checked himself with a rueful sense of helplessness there is the carriage of the french minister said bertha and madame wonders who detains her butif i were a regiment of soldiers i am sure i should obey you when you spoke to me in such a tone as that and as if by magic she was herself again and taking her roses from him went up the carpeted steps lightly and with a gay rustle of trailing silk and lace the large rooms inside were crowded with a distinguished company made up of the material which forms the foundation of every select washingtonian assemblage there were the politicians military and naval men attachs of legations foreign ministers and members of the cabinet with their wives and daughters or other female relatives a distinguished scientist loomed up in one corner looking disproportionately modest a wellknown newspaper man chatted in another the chinese minister accompanied by his interpreter received with a slightly wearied air of quiet patience the conversational attentions proffered him the wife of the secretary of state stood near the door with her daughter receiving her guests as they entered she was a kindly and graceful woman whose good breeding and selfpoise had tided her safely over the occasionally somewhat ruffled social waters of two administrations she had received a hundred or so of callers each wednesdaythe majority of them strangers and in the moments of her greatest fatigue and lassitude had endeavored to remember that each one of them was a human being endowed with human vanity and sensitiveness she had not flinched before the innocent presumption of guileless ignorance she had done her best by timorousness and simplicity she had endeavored to remember hundreds of totally uninteresting people and if she had forgotten one of them who modestly expected a place in her memory had made an effort to repair the injury with aptness and grace she had given up pleasures she enjoyed and repose she needed and had managed to glean entertainment and interesting experience by the way and in course of time having occupied for years one of the highest social positions in the land and done some of the most difficult and laborious work would retire simply and gracefully more regretted than regretting and would look back upon her experience more as an episode in her husbands career than her own she was one of the few women who produced in professor herrick neither mild perturbation nor mental bewilderment he had been a friend of her husbands in his youth and during their residence in washington it had been his habit to desert his books and entomological specimens once or twice in the season for the purpose of appearing in their parlors there was a legend that he had once presented himself with a large and valuable beetle pinned to the lapel of his coat he having absentmindedly placed it in that conspicuous position in mistake for the flower bertha had suggested he should decorate himself with he was among the guests tonight her hostess told bertha as she shook hands with her we were very much pleased to see him though we do not think he looks very well she said i think you will find him talking to professor borrowdale who has just returned from central america she gave bertha a kind glance of scrutiny are you looking very well she said i am afraid you are not that is not a good way to begin a season i am afraid said bertha laughing that i have not chosen my dress well colonel tredennis told me a few moments ago that i ought to be at home they passed on shortly afterward and on the way to the other room bertha was unusually silent tredennis wondered what she was thinking of until she suddenly looked up at him and spoke am i so very haggard she said i should not call it haggard he answered you dont look very well she gave her cheek a little rub with her gloved hand no you should not call it haggard she said that is true it is bad enough not to look well one should always have a little rouge in ones pocket but you will see that the excitement will do me good will it bertha said the colonel but whether the effect it produced upon her was a good or bad one it was certainly strong enough the room was full of people she knew or wished to know she was stopped at every step by those who spoke to her exchanging gay speeches with her paying her compliments giving her greeting dazzling young dandies forgot their indifference to the adulation of the multitude in their eagerness to make their bows and their bon mots before her their elders and superiors were as little backward as themselves and in a short time she had gathered quite a little court about her in which there was laughter and badinage and an exhilarating exchange of gayeties the celebrated scientist joined the circle the newspaper man made his way into it and a stately grayhaired member of the supreme bench relaxed his grave face in it and made more clever and gallant speeches than all his younger rivals put together it was even remarked that the oriental visage of the chinese ambassador himself exhibited an expression of more than slight curiosity and interest he addressed a few words to his interpreter as he passed but somehow colonel tredennis found himself on the outer edge of the enchanted ground it was his own fault perhaps yes it was his own fault without a doubt such changes were too rapid for him as he himself had said before he did not understand them they bewildered and wounded him and gave him a sense of insecurity seeming to leave him nothing to rely on was it possible that sadness or fatigue which could be so soon set aside and lost sight of could be very real and if these things which had so touched his heart were unreal and caprices of the moment what was there left which might not be unreal too could she look pale and make her voice and her little hand tremulous at will when she chose to produce an effect and why should it please her to produce effects upon him she had never cared for him or shown kindness or friendly feeling for him but in those few brief days in virginia was she so flippant such a coquette and trifler that when there was no one else to play her pretty tricks upon she must try them on him and work upon his sympathies in default of being able to teach him the flatteries and follies of men who loved her less he had heard of women who were so insatiable in their desire for sensation that they would stoop to such things but he did not believe he had ever met one perhaps he had met several and had been too ingenuous and generous to understand their wiles and arts at any rate they had always been myths to him and it seemed to him that he himself as well as all existence must have changed when he could even wonder if such a thing might be true of bertha but nothing could be more certain than that there were no longer any traces of her weariness about her a brilliant color glowed in her cheeks her eyes were as bright as diamonds there was somethingsome vividness about her before which every other woman in the room paled a little though there were two or three great beauties present and she had never taken the attitude of a beauty at all the colonel began to see at last that there was a shade of something else too in her manner from which it had always before been free in the midst of all her frivolities she had never been reckless and there had never been any possibility that the lookeron could bear away with him any memory which had not the charm of fineness about it but tonight as one man hung over her chair and others stood around and about it one holding her fan another wearing in his coat a rose which had fallen from her bouquet all sharing her smiles and vying in their efforts to win them tredennis turned away more than once with a heavy heart i would go home if i could leave her he said i dont want to see this i dont know what it means this is no place for me but he could not leave her and so lingered about and looked on and when he was spoken to answered briefly and abstractedly scarcely knowing what he said there was no need that he should have felt himself desolate since there were numbers of pretty and charming women in the rooms who would have been pleased to talk to him and who indeed showed something of this kindly inclination when they found themselves near him his big soldierly figure his fine sunbrowned face his grave manner and the stories they heard of him made him an object of deep interest to women though he had never recognized the fact they talked of him and wondered about him and made up suitable little romances which accounted for his silence and rather stern air of sadness the favorite theory was that he had been badly treated in his early youth by some soulless young person totally unworthy of the feeling he had lavished upon her and there were two or three young personsperhaps even a larger numberwho secretly conscious of their own worthiness of any depth of affection would not have been loath to bind up his wounds and pour oil upon them and frankincense and myrrh if such applications would have proved effectual there were among these some very beautiful and attractive young creatures indeed and as their parents usually shared their interest in the colonel he was invited to kettledrums and musicales and theatre parties and dinners and always welcomed warmly when he was encountered anywhere but though he received these attentions with the simple courtesy and modest appreciation of all kindness which were second nature with him and though he paid his party calls with the most unflinching conventional promptness and endeavored to return the hospitalities in masculine fashion by impartially sending bouquets to mammas and daughters alike it frequently happened that various reasons prevented his appearing at the parties or if he appeared he disappeared quite early and indeed if he had been any other man he would have found it difficult to make his peace with the young lady who discovered that the previous engagement which had kept him away from her kettledrum had been a promise made to little janey amory that he would take her to see tom thumb it is very kind in you to give us any of your time at all bertha had said to him once when you are in such demand richard tells me your table is strewn with invitations and there is not a belle of his acquaintance who is so besieged with attentions mr arbuthnot is filled with envy he has halfadozen new songs which he plays without music and he has learned all the new dances and yet is not invited half so much it is my conversational powers they want was the colonels sardonic reply that goes without saying responded bertha and if you would only condescend to waltz poor laurences days of usefulness would be over wont you be persuaded to let me give you a lesson and she came toward him with mocking in her eyes and her hands extended but the colonel blushed up to the roots of his hair and did not take them i should tread on your slippers and knock off the buckles and grind them into powder he said i should tear your gown and lacerate your feelings and you could not go to the german tonight i am afraid i am not the size for waltzing you are the size for anything and everything said bertha with an exaggerated little obeisance it is we who are so small that we appear insignificant by contrast this indeed was the general opinion that his stalwart proportions were greatly to his advantage and only to be admired among those who admired them most were graceful young waltzers who would have given up that delightful and exhilarating exercise on any occasion if colonel tredennis would have sat out with them in some quiet corner where the eyes of a censorious world might be escaped several such were present tonight and cast slightly wistful glances at him as they passed to and fro or deftly managed to arrange little opportunities for conversations which however did not flourish and grow strong even when the opportunities were made it was not entertainment of this sortinnocent and agreeable as it might bethat colonel tredennis wanted it would be difficult to say exactly what he wanted indeed or what satisfaction he obtained from standing gnawing his great mustache among mrs amorys more versatile and socially gifted adorers he did not want to be a witness of her coquetriesthey were coquetries though to the sophisticated they might appear only delightful ones and a very proper exercise of feminine fascination upon their natural prey but to this masculine prude who unhappily loved her and had no honest rights in her and whose very affection was an emotion against which his honor must struggle it was a humiliation that others should look on and see that she could so amuse herself so he stood on the outer edge of the little circle and was so standing when he first caught sight of the professor at the opposite end of the room he left his place then and went over to him the sight of the refined gentle old face brought to him something bordering on a sense of relief it removed a little of his totally unreasonable feeling of friendlessness and isolation i have been watching you across the room the professor said kindly i wondered what you were thinking about you looked fierce my boy and melancholy i think there were two or three young ladies who thought you very picturesque as you stared at the floor and pulled your mustache but it seemed to me that your air was hardly gay enough for a brilliant occasion i was thinking i was out of place and wishing i was at home replied the colonel with a short laugh unconsciously pulling his mustache again and i dare say i was wishing i had mrs amorys versatility of gifts and humor i thought she was tired and unwell when i helped her out of the carriage but it seems that i was mistaken or that the atmosphere of the great world has a most inspiring effect the professor turned his spectacles upon the corner tredennis had just left ah he remarked quietly it is bertha is it i fancied it might be though it was not easy to see her face on account of the breadth of commander barnacles back and it was you who came with her yes said tredennis i rather expected to see mr arbuthnot said the professor i think richard gave me the impression that i should we saw mr arbuthnot just before we left the house returned the colonel he had been calling upon mrs sylvestre upon mrs sylvestre echoed the professor and then he added rather softly ah she is another another tredennis repeated i only mean said the professor that i am at my old tricks again i am wondering what will happen now to that beautiful graceful young woman he turned his glance a little suddenly upon tredennis face have you been to see her he inquired not yet why not yet perhaps because she is too beautiful and graceful tredennis answered i dont know of any other reason i have not sufficient courage mr arbuthnot has sufficient courage said the professor and some of those gentlemen across the room would not shrink from the ordeal they will all go to see hercommander barnacles includedand she will be kind to them every one she would be kind to me if i went to see herand some day i think i shall he glanced across at bertha she was talking to commander barnacles who was exhibiting as much chivalric vivacity as his breadth would allow the rest of her circle were listening and laughing people outside it were looking at her with interest and curiosity she is very gay tonight the professor added and i dare say mrs sylvestre could give us a better reason for her gayety than we can see on the surface is there always a reason said the colonel for the moment he was pleasing himself with the fancy that he was hardening his heart but just at this moment a slight stir at one of the entrances attracted universal attention the president had come in and was being welcomed by his host and hostess he presented to the inspection of those to whom he was not already a familiar object the unimposing figure of a man past middle life his hair grizzled his face lined his expression a somewhat fatigued one yes he looks tired said bertha to the newspaper man who stood near her though it is rather unreasonable in him he has nothing to do but satisfy the demands of two political parties who hate each other and to retrieve the blunders made during a few score years by his predecessors and he has four years to do it inand every one will give him advice i wonder how he likes it and if he realizes what has happened to him if he were a king and had a crown to look at and try on in his moments of uncertainty or if he were obliged to attire himself in velvet and ermine occasionally he might persuade himself that he was real but how can he do so when he never wears anything but an ordinary coat and cannot cut peoples heads off or bowstring them and hasnt a dungeon about him perhaps he feels as if he is imposing on us and is secretly a little ashamed of himself i wonder if he is not haunted by a disagreeable ghost who persists in reminding him of the day when he will only be an abject expresident and we shall pity where we dont condemn him and he will be dragged to the capitol in the triumphal car of the new one and know that he has awakened from his dream or perhaps he will call it a nightmare and be glad it is over that is planefield who came in with him said her companion he would not object to suffer from a nightmare of the same description would he be willing to dine off the indigestibles most likely to produce it said bertha you have indigestibles on your political menu i suppose i have heard so and that they are not always easy to swallow because the cooks at the capitol differ so about the flavoring planefield would not differ was the answer and he would dine off them and breakfast and sup off them and get up in the night to enjoy them if he could only bring about the nightmare is there any possibility that he will accomplish it bertha inquired if there is i must be very kind to him when he comes to speak to me i feel a sort of eagerness to catch his eye and nod and beck and bestow wreathed smiles upon him already but dont let my modest thrift waste itself upon a mere phantasy if the prospect is that the indigestibles will simply disagree with him and will not produce the nightmare and the colonel who was just approaching with the professor heard her and was not more greatly elated than before it was not very long of course before there was an addition to the group senator planefield found his way to itto the very centre of it indeedand so long as it remained a group formed a permanent feature in its attractions when he presented himself bertha gave him her hand with a most bewitching little smile whose suggestion of archness was somehow made to include the gentleman with whom she had previously been talking her manner was so gracious and inspiring that planefield was intoxicated by it and wondered what it meant he was obliged to confess to himself that there were many occasions when she was not so gracious and if he had been easily rebuffed the wounds his flourishing and robust vanity received might have led him to retire from the field frequently when he was most filled with admiration of her cleverness and spirit he was conscious of an uneasy sense of distrust not only of her but of himself there was one special innocent and direct gaze of which her limpid eyes were capable which sometimes made him turn hot and cold with uncertainty and there was also a peculiarly soft and quiet tone in her voice which invariably filled him with perturbation shes such a confounded cool little devil he had said gracefully to a friend on one occasion when he was in a bad humor shes afraid of nothing and shes got such a hold on herself that she can say anything she likes with a voice as soft as silk and look you straight in the eyes like a baby while she does so and when you say the words over to yourself you cant find a thing to complain of while you know they drove home like knives when she said them herself she looks like a schoolgirl half the time but shes made up of steel and iron andthe devil knows what she did not look like a schoolgirl this eveningshe was far too brilliant and selfpossessed and entertaining but he had nothing to complain of and plenty to congratulate himself upon she allowed him to take the chair near her which its occupant reluctantly vacated for him she placed no obstacles in the way of his conversational desires and she received all his jokes with the most exhilarating laughter perhaps it was because of all this that he thought he had never seen her so pretty so well dressed and so inspiring when he told her so in a clumsy whisper a sudden red flushed her cheek her eyes fell and she did not reply as he had feared she would with a keen little twoedged jest far more discouraging than any displeasure at his boldness would have been he could scarcely believe the evidence of his senses and found it necessary to remain silent a few seconds to give himself time to recover his equilibrium it was he who was with her when tredennis saw her presentation to the president who it was said had observed her previously and was pleased after the interview was over to comment admiringly upon her and ask various questions concerning her it doubtless befell his excellency to be called upon to be gracious and ready of speech when confronted with objects less inspiring than this young person and it might have been something of this sort which caused him to wear a more relaxed countenance and smile more frequently than before when conversing with her and also to appear to be in no degree eager to allow her to make her bow and withdraw it was just after she had been permitted to make this obeisance and retire that colonel tredennis standing near a group of three persons heard her name mentioned and had his ears quickened by the sound the speakers were a man and two women her name he heard a feminine voice say is amory she is a little married woman who flirts oh exclaimed the man that is mrs amory is itthe little mrs amory andyesthat is planefield with her now he generally is with her isnt he at present was the answer yes the colonel felt his blood warming he began to think he recognized the voice of the first speaker and when he turned found he was not mistaken it belonged to the great lady who had figured prominently in the cheery little encounter whose story had been related with such vivacity the first evening he had dined with the amorys she had perhaps not enjoyed this encounter as impartially as had her opponent and had probably not forgotten it so soon she wore the countenance of a woman with an excellent memory and not totally devoid of feminine prejudice perhaps she had been carrying her polished little stone in her pocket and turning it occasionally ever since the memorable occasion when justice had been meted out to her not so largely tempered with mercy as the faultless in character might have desired the matter gives rise to all the more comment she remarked because it is something no one would have expected her family is entirely respectable she was a miss herrick and though she has always been a gay little person she has been quite cleverly prudent her acquaintances are only just beginning to realize the state of affairs and there is a great division of opinion of course the westoria lands have dazzled the husband it is supposed as he is a person given to projects and he has dazzled herand the admirer is to be made use of the mana quiet elderly man with an astutely humorous countenanceglanced after bertha as she disappeared into the supperroom she held her roses to her face and her eyes smiled over them as planefield bent to speak to her it is a tremendous affairthat westoria business he said and it is evident she has dazzled the admirers there is a good deal of life and color andaudacity about her isnt there there is plenty of audacity responded his companion with calmness i think that would be universally admitted though it is occasionally referred to as wit and selfpossession but she has been very much liked timorously suggested the third member of the group who was younger and much less imposing andand i feel sure i have heard women admire her as often as men a great deal may be accomplished by cleverness and prudence of that particular kind was the answer and as i said she has been both prudent and clever it isnt pleasant to think about remarked the man she will lose her friends andand all the rest of it and may gain nothing in the end but i suppose there is a good deal of that sort of thing going on here we outsiders hear it said so and are given to believing the statement it does not usually occur in the class to which this case belongs was the response the female lobbyist is generally not sonot so not so picturesque as she is painted ended her companion with a laugh well i consider myself all the more fortunate in having seen this one who is picturesque and has quite a charming natural color of her own chapter xxiv they moved away and went to the supperroom themselves leaving tredennis to his reflections what these were he scarcely knew himself for a few seconds the murmur of voices and passing to and fro confused him for half an hour of quiet in some friendly corner where none could see his face he felt that he would have given a year or so of his lifeperhaps a greater number of years than a happier man would have been willing to part with it was of bertha these people had been speakingof bertha and it was bertha he could see through the open doors of the supperroom eating ices listening to compliment and laughter and jest it was planefield who was holding her flowers and the man who had just picked up her fan was one of his friends in two or three others near her tredennis recognized his associates it seemed as if the ground had been ceded to them by those who had at first formed her little court tredennis was seized with a wild desire to make his way into their midst take her hand in his arm and compel her to come awayto leave them all to let him take her hometo safety and honor and her children he was so filled with the absurd impulse that he took half a step forward stopping and smiling bitterly when he realized what he was prompted to do how she would like it he thought and like me for doing it and what a paragraph it would make for the society column incidents which had occurred within the last few weeks came back to him with a significance they had never before borne speeches and moods of richards things he had done occasional unconscious displays of eagerness to please planefield and cultivate him his manner toward bertha and certain touches of uneasiness when she was not at her best from the first the colonel had not felt himself as entirely prepossessed by this amiable and charming young man as he desired to be and he had been compelled to admit that he was not always pleased by his gay goodhumor evanescent enthusiasms and by his happy irresponsible fashion of looking at life when he had at last made this confession to himself he had not shrunk from giving himself an explanation of the matter from which a nature more sparing of itself would have flinched he had said that his prejudice was one to blush at and conquer by persistent effort and he had done his sternly honest best to subdue it but he had not succeeded as he had hoped he should when he fancied he was making progress and learning to be fair some trifle continually occurred which made itself an obstacle in his path he saw things he did not wish to see and heard things he did not wish to hearlittle things which made him doubt and ponder and which somehow he could not shake off even when he tried to forget them and persuade himself that after all they were of slight significance and as he had seen more of the gay goodhumor and readiness to be moved his first shadowy feeling had assumed more definite form he had found himself confronted by a distrust which grew upon him he had met the young mans smiling eyes with a sense of being repelled by their very candor and brightness he had learned that they were not so candid as they seemed and that his boyish frankness was not always to be relied upon he had discovered that he was ready to make a promise and forget it that his impressionable mind could shift itself and change its color and that somehow its quickness of action had a fashion of invariably tending toward the accomplishment of some personal enda mere vagary or graceful whim perhaps but always a fancy pertaining to the indulgence of self tredennis had heard him lienot wickedly or awkwardly so far but with grace and freedom from embarrassment it was his accidental detection of one of the most trivial and ready of these falsehoods which had first roused him to distrust he remembered now as by a flash that it had been a lie about planefield and that it had been told to bertha he had wondered at the time what its object could be now he thought he saw and in a measure comprehended the shortsighted folly which had caused the weak easily swayed nature to drift into such danger he does not realize what he is doing was his thought he would lie to me if i accused him of it of these two things he was convinced that the first step had been merely one of many whims whatever the results following might be and that no statement or promise amory might make could be relied on there was no knowing what he had done or what he would do as he had found entertainment in the contents of the museum so it was as probable he had at the outset amused himself with his fancies concerning the westoria lands which had at last so far fascinated and dazed him as to lead him into the committal of follies he had not paused to excuse even to himself he had not thought it necessary to excuse them why should he not take the legal business in hand and since there was no reason against that why should he not also interest himself in the investigations and be on intimate terms with the men who were a part of the brilliant project why should not his wife entertain them as she entertained the rest of her friends and acquaintances tredennis felt that he had learned enough of the mans mental habits to follow him pretty closely in his reasoningwhen he reasoned while he had looked on silently the colonel had learned a great deal and grown worldlywise and quicker of perception than he could have believed possible in times gone by he was only half conscious that this was because he had now an object in view which he had not had before that he was alert and watchful because there was some one he wished to shield that he was no longer indifferent to the world and its waysno longer given to underrating its strength and weaknesses its faults and follies because he wished to be able to defend himself against them if such a thing should become necessary he had gained wisdom enough to appreciate the full significance of the lowvoiced apparently carelessly uttered words he had just heard and to feel his own almost entire helplessness in the matter to appeal to amory would be useless to go to the professor impossible how could he carry to him such a story unless it assumed proportions such as to make the step a last terrible resource he had been looking older and acknowledging himself frailer during the last year certainly he was neither mentally nor physically in the condition to meet such a blow if it was possible to spare it to him tredennis looked across the room at bertha again it seemed that there was only one very simple thing he could do now she will probably be angry and think i have come to interfere if i go to her he said but i will go nevertheless at least i am not one of themevery one knows thatand perhaps it will occur to her to go home there was resolution on his face when he approached her he wore the look which never failed to move her more strongly than any other thing on earth had ever done before and whose power over her cost her all the resistance of which she was capable it had sometimes made her wonder if after all it was true that women liked to be subduedto be ruled a littleif their rulers were gentle as well as strong she had heard it said so and had often laughed at the sentiment of the popular fallacy she used to smile at it when it presented itself to her even in this manner but there had been occasionstimes perhaps when she was very tiredwhen she had known that she would have been glad to give way before this look to obey it to feel the relief of deciding for herself no more such a feeling rose within her now she looked neither tired nor worn but a certain deadly sense of fatigue which was becoming a physical habit with her had been growing upon her all the evening the color on her cheeks was feverish her limbs ached her eyes were bright with her desperate eagerness to sustain herself once or twice when she had laughed or spoken she had been conscious of such an unnatural tone in her voice that her heart had trembled with fear lest others should have heard it too it seemed impossible to her that they should not and that these men who listened and applauded her should not see that often she scarcely heard them and that she dare not stop for fear of forgetting them altogether and breaking down in some dreadful way which would show that all her spirit and gayety was a lie and only a lie poorly acted after all she thought she knew what tredennis had come to her for she had not lost sight of him at any time she had known where he stood or sat and whom he spoke to and had known that he had seen her also she had met his eyes now and then and smiled and looked away again beginning to talk to her admirers with more spirit than ever each time what else was there to do but go on as she had begun she knew only too well what reason there was in herself that she should not falter if it had been strong yesterday it was ten times stronger today and would be stronger tomorrow and for many a bitter day to come but when he came to her she only smiled up at him as she would have smiled at planefield or the gallant and spacious barnacles or any other of the men she knew i hope you have had a pleasant evening she said you enjoy things of this sort so much however that you are always safe i saw you talking in the most vivacious manner to that pretty miss stapletonthe one with the eyelashesor rather you were listening vivaciously you are such a good listener thats an accomplishment isnt it said planefield with his easy air it is a gift of the gods she answered and it was bestowed on colonel tredennis there are talkers you know suggested the senator who would make a good listener of a man without the assistance of the gods do you mean the miss stapleton with the eyelashes inquired bertha blandly oh come now was the response i think you know i dont mean the miss stapleton with the eyelashes if i did it would be more economical to make the remark to her ah said bertha blandly again you mean me i hoped so thank you very much and i am glad you said it before colonel tredennis because it may increase his confidence in me which is not great i am always glad when any one pays me a compliment in his presence does he never pay you compliments himself asked planefield bertha gave tredennis a bright full glance did you ever pay me a compliment she said will you ever pay me a complimentif i should chance to deserve one yes he answered his face unsmiling his voice inflexible may i begin now you always deserve them my only reason for failing to pay them is because i am not equal to inventing such as would be worthy of you your eyes are like starsyour dress is the prettiest in the roomevery man present is your slave and every woman pales before youthe president is going home now only because you have ceased to smile upon him the color on berthas cheek faded a little but her smile did not she checked him with a gesture thank you she said that will do you are even better than senator planefield my eyes are like starsmy dress is perfection i myself am as brilliant asas the chandelier really there seems nothing left for me to do but to follow the president who as you said has been good enough to take his leave and give us permission to retire and she rose from her chair she made her adieus to planefield who bestowed upon tredennis a sidelong scowl thinking that it was he who was taking her away it consoled him but little that she gave him her handin a most gracious farewell he had been enjoying himself as he did not often enjoy himself and the sight of the colonels unresponsive countenance filled him with silent rage it happened that it was not the first time or even the second that this gentleman had presented himself inopportunely the devil take his grim airs was his cordial mental exclamation what does he mean by them and what is he always turning up for when no one wants to see him something of this amiable sentiment was in his expression but the colonel did not seem to see it his countenance was as unmoved as ever when he led his charge away her little hand resting on his arm in truth he was thinking of other things suddenly he had made up his mind that there was one effort he could make that if he could conquer himself and his own natural feeling of reluctance he might speak to bertha herself in such words as she would be willing to listen to and reflect upon it seemed impossible to tell her all but surely he might frame such an appeal as would have some small weight with her it was not an easy thing to do he must present himself to her in the rle of an individual who having no right to interfere with her actions still took upon himself to do so who spoke when it would have seemed better taste to be silent who delivered homilies with the manner of one who thought himself faultless and so privileged to preach and advise but what of that he said checking himself impatiently in the midst of these thoughts i am always thinking of myself and of how i shall appear in her eyes am i a boy lover trying to please her or a man who would spare and shield her let her think poorly of me if she chooses if she will only listen and realize her danger when her anger is over the standard for his own conduct which he had set up was not low it will be observed all that he demanded of himself was utter freedom from all human weakness and even liability to temptation an unselfishness without blemish a selfcontrol without flaw that he should bear his own generous anguish without the movement of a muscle that he should wholly ignore the throbbing of his own wounds remembering only the task he had set himself that his watchfulness over himself should never falter and his courage never be shaken it was perhaps indicative of a certain degree of noble simplicity that he demanded this of himself which he would have asked of no other human creature and that at no time did the thought cross his mind that the thing he demanded was impossible of attainment when he failed as he knew he often did when he found it difficult to efface himself utterly from his own thoughts and was guilty of the weakness of allowing himself to become a factor in them when his unhappiness was stronger than himself when he was stirred to resentment or conscious of weariness and the longing to utter some word which would betray him and ask for pityhe never failed to condemn himself in bitterness of spirit as ignoble and unworthy let her be angry with me if she chooses he thought now it is for me to say my say and leave the rest to herand i will try to say it kindly he would set aside the bitter feeling and resentment of her trifling which had beset him more than once during the evening he would forget them as it was but right and just that they should be forgotten when he spoke as they went up the staircase together his tone was so kind that bertha glanced up at him and saw that his face had changed and though still grave was kind too when she joined him after leaving the cloakroom he spoke to her of her wrap again and asked her to draw it more closely about her when he helped her into the carriage there was that in his light touch which brought back to her with more than its usual strength the familiar sense of quiet protection and support it would be easier she thought if he would be angry why is he not angry he was an hour agoand surely i have done enough but he showed no signs of disapprovalhe was determined that he would not do thatthough their drive was rather a silent one again and yet by the time they reached home bertha was in some indefinite way prepared for the question he put to her as he assisted her to alight may i come in for a little while he asked i know it is late butthere is something i must say to you something you must say to me she repeated i am sure it must be something interesting and something i should like to hear come in by all means so they entered the house together and went into the parlor they found a fire burning there and berthas chair drawn up before it she loosened her wrap rather deliberately and threw it off and then sat down as deliberately arranging her footstool and draperies until she had attained the desired amount of languid comfort in her position tredennis did not speak until she was settled he leaned against the mantel his eyes bent on the fire being fairly arranged bertha held out her hand will you give me that feather screen if you please she saidthe one made of peacock feathers when one attains years of discretion one has some care for ones complexion did it ever occur to you how serious such matters are and that the difference between being eighteen and eighty is almost wholly a matter of complexion if one could remain pink and smooth one might possibly overcome the rest and there would be no such thing as growing old it is not a single plank which is between ourselves and eternity but awould the figure of speech appear appropriate if one said a single cuticle i am afraid not he took the screen from its place and regarded it a little absently you had this in your hand the first night i came here he said when you told the story of your great lady she took it from him that was a pretty little story she said it was a dear little story my great lady was present tonight we passed and repassed each other and gazed placidly at each others eyebrows we were vaguely haunted by a faint fancy that we might have met before but the faculties become dimmed with advancing years and we could not remember where or how it happened one often feels that one has met people you know she balanced her gleaming screen gracefully looking at him from under its shadow and it is not only on account of my complexion that i want my peacock feathers she continued dropping her great lady by the way as if she had not picked her up in the interim i want them to conceal my emotions if your revelations surprise me have you never seen me use them when receiving the compliments of senator planefield and his friends a little turn to the right or the leftthe least graceful little turnand i can look as i please and they will see nothing and only hear my voice which i trust is always sufficiently under control she wondered if it was sufficiently under control now she was not sure and because she was not sure she made the most reckless speeches she could think of there was a story she had heard of a diplomatist who once so entirely bewildered his fellowdiplomats that they found it impossible to cope with him they were invariably outwitted by him the greatest subtlety the most wondrous coup dtat he baffled alike mystery surrounded him his every act was enshrouded in it with such diplomatic methods it was madness to combat when his brilliant and marvellous career was at an end his secret was discovered on every occasion he had told the simple exact truth as she leaned back in her chair and played with her screen bertha thought of this story she had applied it to herself before this the one thing which would be incredible to him at this moment the one thing it would appear more than incredible that she should tell him would be the truthif he realized what that truth was any other story however wild might have its air or suggestion of plausibility but that being what it was she should have the nerve the daring the iron strength of selfcontrol which it would require to make a fearless jest of the simple terrible truth it would seem to him the folly of a madman to believe she knew to look him in the eye with a smile and tell him that she feared his glance and dreaded his words would place the statement without the pale of probability she had told him things as true before and he had not once thought of believing them it is never difficult to persuade him not to believe me she thought there was no one of her many moods of which she felt such terror in her more natural moments as of the one which held possession of her now and yet there was none she felt to be so safe which roused her to such mental exhilaration while its hour lasted or resulted in such reaction when it had passed i am never afraid then she said to agnes once there is nothing i could not bear it seems as if i were made of steel and had never been soft or timid in my life everything is gone but my power over myself andyes it intoxicates me until it is over i am not really hurt i think there was something i read once about a man who was broken on the wheel and while it was being done he laughed and shrieked and sang i think all women are like that sometimes while they are being broken they laugh and shriek and sing but afterwardafterward so now she spoke the simple truth i shall have you at a disadvantage you may observe she said i shall see your face and you will not see mineunless i wish you to do so a little turn of my wrist and you have only my voice to rely upon do you wish to speak to me before richard comes in if so i am afraid you must waste no time as his train is due at twelve you were going to say i am afraid it is something you will not like to hear he answered though i did not contradict you when you suggested that it was you were outside then she replied and i might not have let you come in no he said you might not he looked at the feather screen which she had inclined a trifle your screen reminded me of your great lady bertha he said because i saw her tonight andand heard herand she was speaking of you of me she replied that was kind indeed no he returned it was not she was neither generous nor lenient she did not even speak the truth and yet as i heard her i was obliged to confess that to those who did not know you and only saw you as you were tonight what she said might not appear so false bertha turned her screen aside and looked at him composedly she was speaking of senator planefield she remarked and judge ballard and commander barnacles she reprehended my frivolity and deplored the tendency of the age she was speaking of senator planefield he answered she moved the screen a little has senator planefield been neglecting her she said i hope not lay your screen aside bertha he commanded hotly you dont need it what i have to say will not disturb you as i feared it wouldno i should say as i hoped it would it is only this that these people were speaking lightly of youthat they connected your name with planefields asas no honest man is willing that the name of his wife should be connected with that of another man that was all and i who am always interfering with your pleasures could not bear it and so have made the blunder of interfering again there were many things she had borne of which she had said nothing to agnes sylvestre in telling her storythings she had forced herself to ignore or pass by but just now some sudden passionate realization of them was too much for her and she answered him in words she felt it was madness to utter even as they leaped to her lips richard has not been unwilling she said richard has not resented it if he had been in my place he began feeling ill at easeif he understood she dropped her screen upon her lap and looked at him with steady eyes no she interposed that is a mistake he would not have looked upon the matter as you do it is only a trifle after all you are overestimating its importance am i he said do you regard it in that light yes she replied you are too fastidious is the spiteful comment of an illnatured unattractive woman upon a woman who chances to be more fortunate than herself of such weight that it is likely to influence people greatly women are always saying such things of one another when they are angry i cannot say them of our friend it is true becausebecause she is so fortunate as to be placed by nature beyond reproach if i had her charms and her manner and her years i should perhaps be beyond reproach too she wondered if he would deign to answer her at all it seemed as if the execrable bad taste of her words must overwhelm him if he had turned his back upon her and left the room she would have felt no surprise to have seen him do so would have been almost a relief but for him he merely stood perfectly still and watched her go on he said at length she faintly smiled do you want me to say more she asked is not that enough my great lady was angry and was stupid enough to proclaim the fact she made a quick turn toward him to whom was she speaking she demanded to a man or a woman to a man he answered she sank back into her chair and smiled again ah she said then it is of less consequence even than i imagined it is pleasant to reflect that it was a man one is not afraid of men she lifted the screen from her lap and for a moment he could not see her face now he will go she was saying to herself breathlessly behind it now he must go he will go nowand he will not come back but he did not go it was the irony of fate that he should spare her nothing in the few moments of silence which followed he had a great struggle with himself it was such a struggle that when it was at an end he was pale and looked subdued there was a chair near her he went to it and sat down at her side bertha he said there has been one thing in the midst of allall this to which you have been true you have loved your children when it has seemed that nothing else would touch you i say seemed because i swear to you i am unmoved in my disbelief in what you persist in holding before mefor what reason you know best you love your children you dont lie to me about thatyou dont lie to yourself about it perhaps it is only nature as you said once and not tenderness i dont know i dont understand you but give yourself a few moments to think of them now he saw the hand holding the screen tremble he could not see her face whatmust i think of them he looked down at the floor knitting his brows and dragging at his great mustache i overestimate the importance of things he said i dont seem to know much about the standards society sets up for itself but it does not seem a trifle to me that their mother should be spoken of lightly there was a girl i knew oncelong agohe stopped and looked up at her with sudden sad candor it is you i am thinking of bertha he said you as i remember you first when you came home from school i was thinking of your mother and your dependence upon her and the tenderness there was between you and you were thinking she added that janeys mother would not be so good and worthy of trust that is true i have no answer to make to that bertha he said none she laid the screen upon her lap once more but it is true she said it is true why do you refuse to believe it are you so good that you cannot yes you are as for mewhat did i tell you i am neither good nor bad and i want excitement nine people out of ten are so and i am no worse than the rest of the nine one must be amused if i were religious i should have dorcas societies and missions as i am not i haveshe paused one second no morei have senator planefield she could bear the inaction of sitting still no longer she got up you have an ideal for everything she said for men women and childrenespecially for women i think you are always telling yourself that they are good and pure and loving and faithful that they adore their children and are true to their friends it is very pretty but it is not always the fact you try to believe it is true of me but it is not i am not your ideal woman i have told you so have you not found out yet that bertha amory is not what you were so sure bertha herrick would be yes he answered youyou have convinced me of that it was inevitable she continued i was very young then i knew nothing of the world or of its distractions and temptations a thousand things have happened to change me and after all what right had you to expect so much of me i was neither one thing nor the other even then i was only ignorant you could not expect me to be ignorant always bertha he demanded what are you trying to prove to me only a little thing she answered that i need my amusements and cannot live without them he rose from his seat also that you cannot live without senator planefield he said go and tell him so was her reply it would please him and perhaps this evening he would be inclined to place some confidence in the statement she turned and walked to the end of the room then she came back and stood quite still before him i am going to tell you something i would rather keep to myself she said it may save us both trouble if i dont spare myself as my vanity prompts me to do i said i was no worse than the other nine but i ama little i am not very fond of anything or any one not so fond even ofrichard and the children as i seem i know that though they do not if they were not attractive and amiable or if they interfered with my pleasures my affection would not stand many shocks in a certain way i am emotional enough always to appear better than i am things touch me for a moment i was touched a little just now when you spoke of remembering my being a girl i was moved when janey was ill and you were so good to me i almost persuaded myself that i was good too and faithful and affectionate and yet at the same time i knew it was only a fancy and i should get over it it is easy for me to laugh and cry when i choose there are tears in my eyes now butthey dont deceive me they look like real tears bertha he said they would have deceived meif you had not given me warning they always look real she answered and is not there a sort of merit in my not allowing you to believe in them call it a merit wont you his face became like a mask for several seconds he did not speak the habit he had of taking refuge in utter silence was the strongest weapon he could use against her he did not know its strength he only knew that it was the signal of his own desperate helplessness but it left her without defence or resource wont you she said feeling that she must say something he hesitated before replying no he answered stonily after the pause i wont call it a merit i wish you would leave mesomething that was very hard it is true she returned that i do notleave you very much the words cost her such an effort that there were breaks between them no he said not much there was something almost dogged in his manner he could not bear a great deal more and his consciousness of this truth forced him to brace himself to outward hardness i dont ask very much he said i only ask you to spare yourself and your children i only ask you to keep out of danger it is yourself i ask you to think of not me treat me as you like but dontdont be cruel to yourself i am afraid it does not do for a womaneven a woman as cool as you areto trifle with herself and her name i have heard it said so and i could not remain silent after hearing what i did tonight he turned as if to move away you are going she said yes he replied it is very late and it would be useless to say any more you have not shaken hands with me she said when he was half way to the door the words forced themselves from her her power of endurance failed her at the last moment as it had done before and would do again he came back to her you will never hold out your hand to me when i shall not be ready to take it bertha he said you know that she did not speak you are chilled he said your hand is quite cold yes she replied i shall lie down on the sofa by the fire a little while before going upstairs without saying anything he left her drew the sofa nearer to the hearth and arranged the cushions i would advise you not to fall asleep he said when this was done i shall not fall asleep she answered she went to the sofa and sat down on it goodnight she said and he answered her goodnight and went out of the room she sat still a few seconds after he was gone and then lay down her eyes wandered over the room she saw the ornaments the pictures on the wall the design of the rug every minute object with a clearness which seemed to magnify its importance and significance there was a little cloisson jar whose pattern she never seemed to have seen before she was looking at it when at last she spoke it is very hard to live she said i wish it was notso hard i wish there was some way of helping ones self but there is not one can only go onand onand there is always something worse coming she put her hand upon her breast something rose beneath it which gave her suffocating pain she staggered to her feet pressing one hand on the other to crush this pain down no woman who has suffered such a moment but has done the same thing and done it in vain she fell halfkneeling halfsitting upon the rug her body against her chair her arms flung out why do you struggle with me she cried between her sobs why do you look at me so youhurt me i love you oh let me golet me go dont you knowi cant bear it in the street she heard the carriages rolling homeward from some gay gathering one of them stopped a few doors away and the people got out of it laughing and talking dont laugh she said shuddering no oneshould laugh i laugh o god o god in half an hour richard came in he had taken miss varien home and remained to talk with her a short time as he entered the house bertha was going up the staircase her gleaming dress trailing behind her her feathertrimmed wrap over her arm she turned and smiled down at him your charms will desert you if you keep such hours as these she said how did you enjoy yourself or rather how did you enjoy miss varien and how many dazzling remarks did she make more than i could count he said laughing wait a moment for mei am coming up and he ran up the steps lightly and joined her slipping his arm about her waist you look tired he said but your charms never desert you was that the shudder of guilt whose peace of mind have you been destroying colonel tredennis she answered then it was not the shudder of guilt he returned laughing again and as she leaned gently against him he bent and kissed her chapter xxv it was generally conceded that nothing could be more agreeable than mrs sylvestres position and surroundings those of her acquaintance who had known her before her marriage seeking her out pronounced her more full of charm than ever those who saw her for the first time could scarcely express with too much warmth their pleasure in her grace gentleness and beauty her house was only less admired than herself and mrs merriam promptly gathering a coterie of old friends about her established herself most enviably at once it became known to the world through the medium of the social columns of the dailies that mrs sylvestre was at home on tuesday afternoons and that she also received her friends each wednesday evening on these occasions her parlors were always well filled and with society so agreeable that it was not long before they were counted among the most attractive social features of the week professor herrick himself appeared on several wednesdays and it was gradually remarked that colonel tredennis presented himself upon the scene more frequently than their own previous knowledge of his habits would have led the observers to expect on seeing mrs sylvestre in the midst of her guests and admirers miss jessup was reminded of madame rcamier and the salons of paris and wrote almost an entire letter on the subject which was printed by the wabash times under the heading of a recent rcamier and described mrs sylvestres violet eyes soft voice and willowy figure with nothing short of enthusiasm under these honors mrs sylvestre bore herself very calmly if she had a fault an impetuous acquaintance once remarked it was that she was too calm she found her life even more interesting than she had hoped it would be there was pleasure in the renewal of old friendships and habits and the formation of new ones and in time it became less difficult to hold regrets and memories in check with a steady hand she neither gave herself to retrospection nor to feverish gayety she felt she had outlived her need of the latter and her inclination for the former without filling her life with excitement she enjoyed the recreations of each day as they came and felt no resulting fatigue when professor herrick came to spend an evening hour with her and sat by the fire gently admiring her as he was led on to talk and also gently admiring mrs merriam who was in a bright shrewd humor she herself was filled with pleasure in them both she liked their ripeness of thought and their impartial judgment of the life whose prejudices they had outlived and as genuinely as she liked this she enjoyed colonel tredennis who now and then came too in the first place he came because he was asked but afterwards because at the end of his first visit he left the house with a sense of being in some vague way the better for it agnes manner toward him had been very kind she had shown an interest in himself and his pursuits which had somehow beguiled him out of his usual reticence and brought the best of his gifts to the surface though nothing could have been more unstrained and quiet than the tone of their conversation he was at no disadvantage when they talked together he could keep pace with her and understand her gentle thoughts she did not bewilder him or place him on the defensive once as he looked at her sweet reposeful face he remembered what bertha had said of his ideal woman and the thought rose in his mind that this was shefair feminine full of all tender sympathy and kindly thought not ignorant of the world nor bitter against it only bearing no stain of it upon her all women should be so he thought sadly and agnes saw the shadow fall upon his face and wondered what he was thinking of she began to speak to him of bertha soon afterward and perhaps if the whole truth were told it was while she so spoke that he felt her grace and sweetness most movingly the figure her words brought before him was the innocent one he loved the one he only saw in memory and dreams and whose eyes followed him with an appeal which was sad truth itself at first agnes spoke of the time when they had been girls together making their entre into society with others as young and untried as themselvesbertha the happiest and brightest of them all she was always a success she said she had that quality one dont know how to analyze it people remembered her and were attracted and she never made them angry or envious men who had been in love with her remained her friends it was because she was so true to them she was always a true friend she remembered so many incidents of those early days and in her relation of them bertha appeared again and again the same graceful touching young presence always generous and impetuous ready of wit bright of spirit and tender of heart we all loved her said agnes she was worth loving and she is not changed not changed said tredennis involuntarily did you think her so she asked gently sometimes he answered looking down i am not sure that i know her very well but he knew that he took comfort with him when he went away and that he was full of heartfelt gratitude to the woman who had defended him against himself when he sat among his books that night his mind was calmer than it had been for many a day and he felt his loneliness less what wonder that he went to the house again and again and oftener to spend a quiet hour than when others were there when his burdens weighed most heavily upon him and his skies looked darkest agnes sylvestre rarely failed to give him help when he noted her thoughtfulness for others he did not know what method there was in her thoughtfulness for himself and with what skilful tact and delicate care she chose the words in which she spoke to him of bertha he only felt that after she had talked to him the shadow which was his companion was less a shadow and more a fair truth to be believed in and to draw faith and courage from the professor who met him once or twice during his informal calls spoke of the fact to arbuthnot with evident pleasure he was at his best he said and i have noticed that it is always so when he is there the truth is it would be impossible to resist the influence of that beautiful young woman his acquaintance with mr arbuthnot had taken upon itself something of the character of an intimacy they saw each other almost daily the professor had indeed made many discoveries concerning the younger man but none which caused him to like him less he had got over his first inclination towards surprise at finding they had many things in common having early composed himself to meet with calmness any source of momentary wonder which might present itself deciding at length that he himself was either younger or his new acquaintance older than he had imagined without making the matter an affair of years the two fell into a comfortable habit of discussing the problems of the day and though their methods were entirely different and arbuthnot was at the outset much given to a light treatment of argument they always understood each other in the end and were drawn a trifle nearer by the debate it was actually discovered that laurence had gone so far as to initiate the unwary professor into the evil practice of smoking having gradually seduced him by the insidious temptings of the most delicate cigars the discussions it was observed were always more enjoyable when the professor having his easychair placed in exactly the right position with regard to light and fire found himself with his cigar in hand carefully smoking it and making the most of its aroma his tranquil enjoyment of and respect for the rite were agreeable things to see it soothes me he would say to arbuthnot it even inspires and elevates me i feel as if i had discovered a new sense i am really quite grateful it was arbuthnot who generally arranged his easychair showing a remarkable instinct in the matter of knowing exactly what was necessary to comfort among his discoveries concerning him the professor counted this one that he had in such things the silent quickness of perception and defthandedness of a woman and perhaps it had at first surprised him more than all else it may have been for some private reason of his own that the professor occasionally gave to the conversation a lighter tone even giving a friendly and discursive attention to social topics and showing an interest in the doings of pleasurelovers and the butterfly of fashion at such times arbuthnot noticed that beginning with a reception at the british embassy they not unfrequently ended with bertha or opening with the last dinner at the white house closed with richard and the weekly evenings adorned by the presence of senator planefield and his colleague so it was perfectly natural that they should not neglect mrs sylvestre to whom the professor had taken a great fancy and whose progress he watched with much interest he frequently spoke of her to arbuthnot dwelling upon the charm which made her what she was and analyzing it and its influence upon others it appeared to have specially impressed itself upon him on the occasion of his seeing tredennis and having said that it would be impossible to resist this beautiful young womanas he had fallen into the unconscious habit of calling herhe went on to discourse further she is too tranquil to make any apparent effort he said and yet the coldest and most reserved person must be warmed and moved by her you have seen that though you are neither the most reserved nor the coldest arbuthnot was smoking the most perfectly flavored of cigars and giving a good deal of delicate attention to it at this he took it from his mouth looked at the end and removed the ash with a touch of his finger in doing which he naturally kept his eyes upon the cigar and not upon the professor yes he said i have recognized it of course you see her rather often i think said the professor i am happy to be permitted that privilege was the answer though i am aware i am indebted for it far more to mrs amory than to my own fascinations numberless and powerful though they may be it is a privilege said the professor but it is more of one to philip than to youeven more of one than he knows he needs what such a woman might give him does he said arbuthnot might i ask what that is and he was angry with himself because he did not say it with more ease and less of a sense of unreasonable irritation the professor seemed to forget his cigar he held it in the hand which rested on his chairarm and neglected it while he gave himself up to thought he has changed very much during the past year he said in the few last months i have noticed it specially i miss something from his manner and he looks fagged and worn it has struck me that he rather needs an interest and feels his loneliness without being conscious that he does so after all it is only natural a man who leads an isolated life inevitably reaches a period when his isolation wearies him and he broods over it a little and you think said arbuthnot that mrs sylvestre might supply the interest dont you think so yourself suggested the professor mildly oh said laurence i think the man would be hard to please who did not find she could supply him with anything and everything and he laughed and made a few rings of smoke watching them float upward toward the ceiling he would have a great deal to bring her said the professor speaking for the moment rather as if to himself than to any audience and she would have a great deal in return for what she could bestow he has always been what he is today and only such a man is worthy of her no man who has trifled with himself and his past could offer what is due to her that is true said laurence he made more rings of smoke and blew them away as for tredennis he said with a deliberateness he felt necessary to his outward composure his advantage is that he does not exactly belong to the nineteenth century he has no place in parlors when he enters one without the least pretension or consciousness of himself he towers over the rest of us with a gigantic modesty it is useless to endeavor to bear up against he ought to wear a red cross and carry a battleaxe and go on a crusade or right the wrongs of the weak by unhorsing the oppressor in single combat he might found a round table his crush hat should be a helmet and he should appear in armor the professor smiled that is a very nice figure he said though you dont treat it respectfully it pleases my fancy arbuthnot laughed again not the gayest laugh possible it is he who is a nice figure he returned and though he little suspects it he is the one most admired of women he could win anything he wanted and would deserve all he won oh im respectful enough im obliged to be theres the rub is it a rub asked the professor a little disturbed by an illogical fancy which at the moment presented itself without a shadow of warning you dont want the kind of thing he might care for this time laurences laugh had recovered its usual delightful tone he got up and went to the mantel for a match to light a new cigar i he said i want nothing but the assurance that i shall be permitted to retain my position in the treasury until i dont need it it is a modest ambition isnt it and yet i am afraid it will be thwarted and thenin the next administration perhapsi shall be seedy and out at elbows and mrs amory wont like to invite me to her thursday evenings because she will know it will make me uncomfortable and thenthen i shall disappear something has disturbed you commented the professor rather seriously you are talking nonsense and as he said it the thought occurred to him that he had heard more of that kind of nonsense than usual of late and that the fact was likely to be of some significance it is the old story he thought and it is beginning to wear upon him until he does not control himself quite so completely as he did at first that is natural too perhaps bertha herself has been a little cruel to him in her womans way she has not been bearing it so well either my dear professor said laurence everything is relative and what you call nonsense i regard as my most successful conversational efforts i could not wield excalibur dont expect it of me i beg you if he had made an effort to evade any further discussion of mrs sylvestre and the possibilities of her future he had not failed in it they talked of her no more in fact they talked very little at all a shade had fallen upon the professors face and did not pass away he lighted his cigar again but scarcely seemed to enjoy finishing it if arbuthnot had been in as alert a mental condition as usual his attention would have been attracted by the anxious thoughtfulness of his old friends manner but he himself was preoccupied and rather glad of the opportunity to be silent when the cigars were finished and he was on the point of taking his departure the professor seemed to rouse himself as if from a reverie that modest ambition of yourshe began slowly thank you for thinking of it said arbuthnot as he paused it interests me replied the professor you are continually finding something to interest me there is no reason why it should be thwarted you know i wish i did returned laurence but i dont you see they are shaky pieces of architecture those government buildings the foundationstones are changed too often to insure a sense of security to the occupants no my trouble is that i dont know you have a great many friends said the professor i have a sufficient number of invitations to make myself generally useful said laurence and of course they imply an appreciation of my social gifts which gratifies me but a great deal depends on a mans wardrobe i might as well be without talents as minus a dresscoat it interests me sometimes to recognize a brother in the song and dance artist who is open to engagements i my dear professor am the song and dance artist when i am agile and in good voice i am recalled but they would not want me if i were hoarse and out of spirits and had no spangles you might get something better than you have said the professor reflectively you ought to get something to whom shall i apply said laurence do you think the president would receive me tomorrow perhaps he has already mentioned his anxiety to see me then his manner changing he added with some hurry you are very good but i think it is of no use the mistake was in letting myself drift as i did it would not have happened ifif i hadnt been a fool it was my own fault thank you dont think of me it wouldnt pay me to do it myself and you may be sure it would not pay you and he shook the professors hand and left him he was not in the best of humor when he reached the street and was obliged to acknowledge that of late the experience had not been as rare a one as discretion should have made it his equable enjoyment of his irresponsible existence had not held its own entirely this winter it had been disturbed by irrational moods and touches of irritability he had broken in spite of himself the strict rules he had laid down against introspection and retrospection he had found himself deviating in the direction of shadowy regrets and discontents and this in the face of the fact that no previous season had presented to him greater opportunities for enjoyment than this one certainly he counted as the most enviable of his privileges those bestowed upon him by the inmates of the new establishment in lafayette place his intimacy with the amorys had placed him upon a more familiar footing than he could have hoped to attain under ordinary circumstances and this much gained his social gifts and appreciation of the favor showed him did the rest your mr arbuthnot remarked mrs merriam after having conversed with him once or twice or i suppose i ought rather to say little mrs amorys mr arbuthnot is a wonderfully suitable person suitable repeated agnes for what for anythingfor everything he would never be out of place and his civility is absolute genius mrs sylvestres smile was for her relatives originality of statement and apparently bore not the slightest reference to mr arbuthnot himself people are never entirely impersonal mrs merriam went on but an appearance of being so may be cultivated as this gentleman has cultivated his until it is almost perfection he never projects himself into the future when he picks up your handkerchief he does not appear to be thinking how you will estimate his civility he simply restores you an article you would miss he does nothing with an air and he never forgets things perhaps the best part of his secret is that he never forgets himself i am afraid he must find that rather tiresome agnes remarked my dear said mrs merriam no one could forget herself less often than you do that is the secret of your repose of manner privately you are always on guard and your unconsciousness of the fact arises from the innocence of youth you are younger than you think ah said mrs sylvestre rising and crossing the room to move a yellow vase on the top of a cabinet dont make me begin life over again you have reached the second stage of existence said the older woman her bright eyes sparkling there are three the first when one believes everything is white the second when one is sure everything is black the third when one knows that the majority of things are simply gray if i were called upon to find a color for your favorite said agnes bestowing a soft abstracted smile on the yellow vase i think i should choose gray he is certainly neutral he is a very good color replied mrs merriam the best of colors he matches everythingones tempers ones moods ones circumstances he is a very excellent color indeed yes said agnes quietly and she carried her vase to another part of the room and set it on a little ebony stand it had become an understood thing indeed that her relative found laurence arbuthnot entertaining and was disposed to be very gracious toward him on his part he found her the cleverest and most piquant of elderly personages when he entered the room where she sat it was her habit to make a place for him at her own side and to enjoy a little agreeable gossip with him before letting him go after they had had a few such conversations together arbuthnot began to discover that his replies to her references to himself and his past had not been so entirely marked by reticence as he had imagined when he had made them his friend had a talent for putting the most adroit leading questions which did not betray their significance upon the surface and once or twice after answering such a one he had seen a look in her sparkling old eyes which led him to ponder over his own words as well as hers still she was always astute and vivacious and endowed him for the time being with a delightful sense of being at his best for which he was experienced enough to be grateful he had also sufficient experience to render him alive to the fact that he preferred to be at his best when it was his good fortune to adorn this particular drawingroom with his presence he knew before long that when he had made a speech upon which he privately prided himself after the manner of weak humanity he found it agreeable to be flattered by the consciousness that mrs sylvestres passionflowercolored eyes were resting upon him with that delicious suggestion of reflection he was not rendered happier by the knowledge of this susceptibility but he was obliged to admit its existence in himself few men of his years were as little prone to such natural weaknesses and he had not attained his somewhat abnormal state of composure without paying its price perhaps the capital had been too large if one has less one is apt to be more economical bertha had heard him remark and at least retain a small annuity to exist upon in ones maturer years i did not retain such an annuity certainly there was one period of his life upon which he never looked back without a shudder and this being the case he had taught himself as time passed not to look back upon it at all he had also taught himself not to look forward finding the one almost as bad as the other as bertha had said he was not fond of affairs and even his enemies were obliged to admit that he was ordinarily too discreet or too cold to engage in the most trivial of such agreeable entanglements if i pick up a redhot coal he said i shall burn my fingers even if i throw it away quickly why should a man expose himself to the chance of being obliged to bear a blister about with him for a day or so if i may be permitted i prefer to stand before the fire and enjoy an agreeable warmth without personal interference with the blaze nothing could have been farther from his intentions than interference with the blaze where mrs sylvestre was concerned though he had congratulated himself upon the glow her grace and beauty diffused certainly no folly could have been nearer akin to madness than such folly if he had been sufficiently unsophisticated to indulge in it and he was not unsophisticated few were less so his perfect and just appreciation of his position bounded him on every side and it would have been impossible for him to lose sight of it he had never blamed any one but himself for the fact that he had accomplished nothing particular in life and had no prospect of accomplishing anything it had been his own fault he had always said if he had been a better and stronger fellow he would not have been beaten down by one blow however sharp and heavy he had given up because he chose to give up and let himself drift his life since then had been agreeable enough he had had his moments of action and reaction he had laughed one day and felt a little glum the next and had let one mood pay for the next and trained himself to expect nothing better he had not had any inclination for marriage and had indeed frequently imagined that he had a strong disinclination for it his position in the amory household had given him an abidingplace which was like having a home without bearing the responsibility of such an incumbrance i regard myself bertha sometimes said to him as having been a positive boon to you if i had not been so good to you there would have been moments when you would have almost wished you were married and if you had had such moments the day of your security would have been at an end perfectly true he invariably responded and i am grateful accordingly he began to think of this refuge of his after he had walked a few minutes he became conscious that the longer he was alone with himself the less agreeable he found the situation there was a sentence of the professors which repeated itself again and again and made him feel restive somehow he could not rid himself of the memory of it no man who had trifled with himself and his past could offer what is due to her it was a simple enough truth and he found nothing in it to complain of but it was not an exhilarating thing to dwell upon and be haunted by he stopped suddenly in the street and threw his cigar away a halflaugh broke from him i am resenting it he said it is making me as uncomfortable as if i was a human being instead of a mechanical invention in the employ of the government my works are getting out of order i will go and see mrs amory she will give me something to think of she always does a few minutes later he entered the familiar parlor the first object which met his eye was the figure of bertha and as he had anticipated would be the case she gave him something to think of but it was not exactly the kind of thing he had hoped for though it was something it is true which he had found himself confronted with once or twice before it was something in herself which on his first sight of her presented itself to him so forcibly that it gave him something very near a shock he had evidently broken in upon some moment of absorbed thought she was standing near the mantel her hands clasped behind her head her eyes seeming fixed on space the strangeness of her attitude struck him first and then the unusualness of her dress whose straight long lines of unadorned black revealed as he had never seen it revealed before the change which had taken place in her she dropped her hands when she saw him but did not move toward him did you meet richard she said no he replied did he want to see me he said something of the kind though i am not quite sure what it was their eyes rested on each other as he approached her in the questioning of hers there was a touch of defiance but he knew its meaning too well to be daunted by it i would not advise you to wear that dress again he said why not she asked go to the mirror and look at yourself he said she turned walked across the room with a slow careless step as if the effort was scarcely worth while there was an antique mirror on the wall and she stopped before it and looked herself over it isnt wise is it she said it makes me look like a ghost no it doesnt make me look like one it simply shows me as i am it couldnt be said of me just now that i am at my best could it then she turned around i dont seem to care she said dont i care that would be a bad sign in me wouldnt it i should consider it one he answered it is only in novels that people can afford not to care you cannot afford it dont wear a dress again which calls attention to the fact that you are so ill and worn as to seem only a shadow of yourself it isnt wise why should one object to being ill she said it is not such a bad idea to be something of an invalid after all it insures one a great many privileges it is not demanded of invalids that they shall always be brilliant they are permitted to be pale and silent and heavyeyed and lapses are not treasured up against them she paused an instant when one is ill she said nothing one does or leaves undone is of any special significance it is like having a holiday do you want to take such a holiday he asked do you need it she stood quite still a moment and he knew she did it because she wished to steady her voice sometimes she said at last i think i do since he had first known her there had been many times when she had touched him without being in the least conscious that she did so he had often found her laughter as pathetic as other peoples tears even while he had joined in it himself perhaps there was something in his own mood which made her seem in those few words more touching than she had ever been before suppose you begin to take it now he said while i am with you she paused a few seconds again before answering then she looked up when people ask you how i am she said you might tell them that i am not very well that i have not been well for some time and that i am not getting better are you gettingworse he asked her replyif reply it waswas a singular one she pushed the sleeve of her black dress a little way from her wrist and stood looking down at it without speaking there were no bangles on the wrist this morning and without these adornments its slenderness seemed startling the small delicate bones marked themselves and every blue vein was traceable neither of them spoke and in a moment she drew the sleeve down again and went back to her place by the fire to tell the truth arbuthnot could not have spoken at first it was she who at length broke the silence turning to look at him as he sat in the seat he had taken his head supported by his hand will you tell me she said what has hurt you why should you ask that he said i should be very blind and careless of you if i had not seen that something had happened to you she answered you are always caring for me andunderstanding me it is only natural that i should have learned to understand you a little this has not been a good winter for you what is it larry i wish it was something interesting he answered but it is not it is the old story i am out of humor im dissatisfied i have been guilty of the folly of not enjoying myself on one or two occasions and the consciousness of it irritates me it is always indiscreet not to enjoy ones self she said and then there was silence for a moment while she looked at him again suddenly she broke into a laugha laugh almost hard in its tone he glanced up to see what it meant do you want to know what makes me laugh she said i am thinking how like all this is the oldfashioned tragedy where all the dramatis person are disposed of in the last act we go over one by one dont we soon there will be no one left to tell the tale even colonel tredennis and richard show signs of their approaching doom and yousome one has shown you your dagger i think and you know you cannot escape it i am the ghost he answered the ghost who was disposed of before the tragedy began and whose business it is to haunt the earth and remind the rest of you that once i had blood in my veins too he broke off suddenly and left his seat the expression of his face had altogether changed we always talk in this strain he exclaimed we are always jeering is there anything on earth any suffering or human feeling we could treat seriously if there is for gods sake let us speak of it just for one hour she fixed her eyes on him and there was a sad little smile in their depths yes you have seen your dagger she said you have seen it poor larry poor larry she turned away and sat down clasping her hands on her knee and he saw that suddenly her lashes were wet and thought that it was very like her that though she had no tears for herself she had them for him dont be afraid that i will ask you any questions she said i wont you never asked me any perhaps words would not do you any good nothing would do me any good just now he answered let it go at that it maynt be as bad as it seems just for the momentsuch things seldom are if it gets really worse i suppose i shall find myself coming to you some day to make my plaint but its very good in you to look at me like that and i was a fool to fancy i wanted to be serious i dont on the whole no you were not a fool she said there is no reason why you should not be what you want laurence with something like sudden determination in her tone there is something i want to say to you what is it he asked i have got into a bad habit lately she saida bad habit of thinking when i lie awake at night do you lie awake at night he interrupted she turned her face a little away as if she did not wish to meet his inquiring gaze yes she answered after a pause i suppose it is because of thishabit i cant help it but it doesnt matter oh he exclaimed it does matter you cant stand it is there anything people cannot stand she said if there is i should like to try it you may well look as you do he said yes i may well she answered and it is the result of the evil practice of thinking when once you begin it is not easy to stop and i think you have begun i shall endeavor to get over it he replied no she said dont she rose from her seat and stood up before him trembling and with two large tears falling upon her cheeks larry she said that is what i wanted to saythat is what i have been thinking of i shall not say it well because we have laughed at each other so long that it is not easy to speak of anything seriously but i must try see i am tired of laughing i have come to the time when there seems to be nothing left but tearsand there is no help but you are different and if you are tired too and if there is anything you want even if you could not be sure of having it it would be better to be trying to earn it and to be worthy of it he rested his forehead on his hands and kept his eyes fixed on the carpet that is a very exalted way of looking at things he said in a low voice i am afraid i am not equal to it in the long nights when i have lain awake and thought so she went on i have seemed to find out thatthere were things worth altering all ones life for i did not want to believe in them at first but now it is different with me i could not say so to any one but youand perhaps not to you tomorrow or the day afterand you will hear me laugh and jeer many a time again that is my fate but it need not be yours your life is your own if mine were my ownoh if mine were my own she checked the passionate exclamation with an effort when ones life belongs to ones self she added one can do almost anything with it i have not found it so he replied you have never tried it she said one does not think of these things until the day comes when there is a reasona reason for everythingfor pain and gladness for hope and despair for the longing to be better and the struggle against being worse oh how can one give up when there is such a reason and ones life is in ones own hands i am saying it very badly larry i know that agnes sylvestre could say it better though she could not mean it more she would not take the trouble to say it at all he said bertha drew back a pace with an involuntary movement the repressed ring of bitterness in the words had said a great deal is it she exclaimed involuntarily as she had moved and then stopped i said i would not ask questions she added and clasped her hands behind her back standing quite still in an attitude curiously expressive of agitation and suspense what he said have i told you i was afraid i should yes it is mrs sylvestre who has disturbed me it is mrs sylvestre who has stirred the calm of ages she was silent a second and when she spoke her eyes looked very large and bright i suppose she said slowly that it is very womanish in methat i almost wish it had been some one else why he asked you all have been moved by mrs sylvestre she replied more slowly than beforeall of you how many of us are there he inquired colonel tredennis has been moved too she said not long before you came in he paid me a brief visit he does not come often now and his visits are usually for janey and not for me i displeased him the night he went with me to the reception of the secretary of state and he has not been able to resign himself to seeing me often but this evening he came in and we talked of mrs sylvestre he had been calling upon her and her perfections were fresh in his memory he finds her beautiful and generous and sincere she is not frivolous or capricious i think that was what i gathered from the few remarks he made i asked him questions you see i wanted to know and she has this advantageshe has all the virtues which the rest of us have not you are very hard on tredennis sometimes he said answering in this vague way the look on her face which he knew needed answer sometimes she said sometimes he is hard on me he has not been easy on me today he returned poor larry she said again poor larry he smiled a little you see what chance i should be likely to have against such a rival he said i wonder if it ought to be a consolation to me to reflect that my position is such that it cannot be affected by rivals if i had the field to myself i should stand exactly where i do at this moment it saves me from the risk of suffering dont you see i know my place too well to allow myself to reach that point i am uncomfortable only because circumstances have placed it before me in a strong light and i dont like to look at it what is your place she asked it is in the treasury he replied the salary is not large i am slightly in debtto my tailor and hosier who are however patient because they think i am to be relied on through this administration i wish i knew what to say to you she exclaimed i wish i knew i wish you did he answered you have said all you could i wish i believed what you say it would be more dignified than to be simply out of humor with ones self and resentful larry she said gently i believe you are something more no no nothing more he exclaimed nothing more for heavens sake and he made a quick gesture as if he was intolerant of the thought and would like to move it away so they said no more on this subject and began soon after to talk about richard what did you mean arbuthnot asked by saying that richard showed signs of his approaching doom isnt he in good spirits it seems incredible she answered that richard should not be in good spirits but it has actually seemed to me lately that he was not the westoria lands appear to have worried him the westoria lands he repeated slowly he has interested himself in them too much she said things dont go as easily as he imagined they would and it annoys him today what happened today laurence asked as she stopped it was not very much she said but it was unlike him he was a little angry with whom with me i think lately i have thought i would like to go abroad and i have spoken of it to him once or twice and he has rather put it off and today i wanted to speak of it again and it seemed the wrong time somehow and he was a trifle irritable about it he has not always been quite himself this winter but he has never been irritable with me that isnt like him you know no it isnt like him was laurences comment afterward when he was going away he asked her a question do you wish very much to go abroad he said yes she answered you think the change would do you good change often does one good she replied i should like to try it i should like to try it myself he said go if you can though no one will miss you more than i shall and having said it he took his departure chapter xxvi but bertha did not go abroad and the season reached its height and its wane and though miss jessup began to refer occasionally to the muchtobe regretted delicacy of the charming mrs amorys health there seemed but little alteration in her mode of life i will confide to you she said to colonel tredennis that i have set up this effective little air of extreme delicacy as i might set up a carriageif i needed one it is one of my luxuries do you remember lord farintoshs tooth which always ached when he was invited out to dinner and did not want to gothe tooth which ethel newcome said nothing would induce him to part with my indisposition is like that i refuse to become convalescent dont prescribe for me i beg of you it was true as she had said that the colonel presented himself at the house less often than had been his wont and that his visits were more frequently for janey than for herself you will never hold out your hand to me when i shall not be ready to take it he had said but she did not hold out her hand and there was nothing that he could do and if he went to her he must find himself confronted with things he could not bear to see and so he told himself that until he was needed it was best that he should stay away or go only now and then but he always knew what she was doing the morning papers told him that she was involved in the old unceasing round of excitementannouncing that she was among the afternoon callers that she received at home that she dined lunched danced appeared at charitable entertainments and was seen at the theatre it became his habit to turn unconsciously to the society column before he read anything else though he certainly found himself none the happier for its perusal but though he saw bertha less frequently he did not forget richard at this time he managed to see him rather often and took some pains to renew the bloom of their first acquaintance which had perhaps shown itself a little on the wane as richards friendships usually did in course of time and perhaps this waning having set in richard was not at first invariably so enthusiastically glad to see the large military figure present itself in his office he had reasons of his own for not always feeling entirely at ease before his whilom favorite as he had remarked to planefield philip tredennis was not a malleable fellow he had unflinching habits of truth and remorseless ideas of what a mans integrity should be and would not be likely to look with lenient or halfseeing eyes upon any palterings with falsehood and dishonor however colored or disguised and he did not always appear at the most convenient moment there were occasions indeed when his unexpected entrance had put an end to business conferences of a very interesting and slightly exciting nature these conferences had it is true some connection with the matter of the westoria lands and the colonel had lately developed an interest in the project in question which he had not shown at the outset he had even begun to ask questions about it and shown a desire to inform himself as to the methods most likely to be employed in manipulating the great scheme he amassed in one way and another a large capital of information concerning subsidies and land grants and exhibited remarkable intelligence in his mental investment of it indeed there were times when he awakened in richard a rather uneasy sense of admiration by the clearness of his insight and the practical readiness of his views he has always been given to digging into things amory said to planefield after one of their interviews that is his habit of mind and he has a steady business capacity you dont expect to find what is he digging into this thing for planefield asked he will be digging up something one of these days that we are not particularly anxious to have dug up i am not overfond of the fellow myself i never was richard laughed a trifle uneasily oh hes well enough he said though ill admit he has been a little in the way once or twice it is quite possible that the colonel himself had not been entirely unaware of this latter fact though he had exhibited no signs of his knowledge either in his countenance or bearing indeed it would be difficult for one so easily swayed by every passing interest as richard amory was to have long resisted his manly courtesy and good nature men always found him an agreeable companion and he made the most of his powers on the occasions which threw him or in which he threw himself in amorys way even planefield admitted reluctantly once or twice that the fellow had plenty in him it was not long before richard succumbed to his personal influence with pleasurable indolence it would have cost him too much effort to combat against it and besides this it was rather agreeable to count among ones friends and supporters a man strong enough to depend on and desirable enough to be proud of there had been times during the last few months when there would have been a sense of relief in the feeling that there was within reach a stronger nature than his ownone on whose strength he knew he could rely as their intimacy appeared to establish itself if he did not openly confide in tredennis he more than once approached the borders of a confidence in his moments of depression that he had such moments had become plain he did not even look so bright as he had looked something of his carefree joyous air had deserted him and now and then there were to be seen faint lines on his forehead there is a great deal of responsibility to be borne in a matter like this he said to tredennis and it wears on a man to which he added a few seconds later with a delightfully unconscious mixture of petulance and protest confound it why cant things as well turn out right as wrong have things been turning out wrong the colonel ventured richard put his elbows on the table before him and rested his forehead on his hands a second well yes he admitted several things and just at the wrong time too there seems a kind of fate in itas if when one thing began the rest must follow the colonel began to bite one end of his long mustache reflectively as he looked at the young mans knitted brow there is one thing you must understand at the outset he said at length when i can be made usefulsupposing such a thing were possiblei am here richard glanced up at him quickly he looked a little haggard for the moment what a steady reliable fellow you are he said yes i should be sure of you ifif the worst came to the worst the colonel bit the ends of his mustache all the way home and more than one passerby on the avenue was aroused to wonder what the subject of his reflections might be he strode along with so absorbed an air and frowned so fiercely i should like to know what the worst is he was saying to himself i should like to know what that means it was perhaps his desire to know what it meant which led him to cultivate richard more faithfully still to join him on the street to make agreeable bachelor dinners for him to carry him off to the theatres and in a quiet way to learn something of what he was doing each day it was in fact a delicate diplomatic position the colonel occupied in these days and it cannot be said that he greatly enjoyed it or liked himself in it he was too honest by nature to find pleasure in diplomacy and what he did for another he would never have done for himself for the sake of the woman who rewarded his generosity and care with frivolous coldness and slight he had undertaken a task whose weight lay heavily upon him since his first suspicions of her danger had been aroused he had been upon the alert continually and had seen many things to which the more indifferent or less practical were blind as richard had casually remarked he was possessed of a strong business sense and faculty of which he was not usually suspected and he had seen signs in the air which he felt boded no good for richard amory or those who relied on his discretion in business affairs that the professor had innocently relied upon it when he gave his daughter into his hands he had finally learned that bertha never gave other than a transient thoughtmore than half a jestto money matters he knew her good fortune it had been to be trammelled neither by the weight of money nor the want of ita truly enviable condition which had not unnaturally engendered in her a confidence at once unquestioning and somewhat perilous tredennis had recalled more than once of late a little scene he had taken part in on one occasion of her signing a legal document richard had brought to her shall i sign it here she had said with exaggerated seriousness or shall i sign it there what would happen to me if i wrote on the wrong line could not laurence sign it for me in his government hand and give it an air of distinction suppose my hand trembled and i made a blot i am not obliged to read it am i i think i should insist that she read it the colonel had said to richard with some abruptness bertha had looked up and smiled shall you insist that i read it she said i know what it says it says whereas and moreover and in accordance with said agreement and in consideration of those are the prevailing sentiments and i am either the party of the first part or the party of the second part and if it was written in sanskrit it would be far clearer to my benighted mind than it is in its present lucid form but i will read it if you prefer it even though delirium should supervene it was never pleasant to colonel tredennis to remember this trivial episode and the memory of it became a special burden to him as time progressed and he saw more of amorys methods and tendencies but it was scarcely for him to go to her and tell her that her husband was not as practical a business man as he should be that he was visionary and too easily allured by glitter and speciousness he could not warn her against him and reveal to her the faults and follies she seemed not to have discovered but he could revive something of richards first fancy for him and make himself in a measure necessary to him and perhaps gain an influence over him which might be used to good purpose possibly despite his modesty he had a halfconscious knowledge of the power of his own strong will and nature over weaker ones and was resolved that this weak one should be moved by them if the thing were possible nor was this all there were other duties he undertook for reasons best known to himself he became less of a recluse socially and presented himself more frequently in the fashionable world he was no fonder of gayety than he had been before but he faced it with patience and courage he went to great parties and made himself generally useful he talked to matrons who showed a fancy for his company and was the best and most respectful of listeners he was courteous and attentive to both chaperones and their charges and by quietly persistent good conduct won additional laurels upon each occasion of his social appearance those who had been wont to stand somewhat in awe of him finding nothing to fear on more intimate acquaintance added themselves to the list of his admirers before the season was over he had made many a stanch friend among matronly leaders of fashion whose word was law if such a thing could be spoken of a person of habits so grave it might have been said that he danced attendance upon these ladies but though such a phrase would seem unfitting it may certainly be remarked that he walked attendance on them and sought their favor and did their bidding with a silent faithfulness wonderful to behold he accepted their invitations and attended their receptions he escorted them to their carriages found their wraps and carried their light burdens with an imperturbable demeanor what said bertha one night when she had seen him in attendance on the wife of the secretary of state whose liking for him was at once strong and warm what is it colonel tredennis who curries the favor of the rich and great it has seemed so lately is there any little thing in foreign missions you desire or do you think of an assistantsecretaryship there is some dissatisfaction expressed with regard to the minister to the court of st james was his reply it is possible that he will be recalled in that case may i hope to command your influence but many a time as he carried his shawls or made his grave bow over the hand of a stately dowager a halfsad smile crossed his face as he thought of the true reason for his efforts and realized with a generous pang the depth of his unselfish perfidy they were all kind to him and he was grateful for their favors but he would rather have been in his room at work or trying to read or marching up and down thinking in his solitude janey entertained him with far more success than the prettiest dbutante of the season could hope to attain though there was no dbutante among them who did not think well of him and admire him not a little but the reason which brought him upon this brightly lighted stage of action well there was only one reason for everything now he knew full well for his being sadder than usual or a shade less heavy of heart for his wearing a darker face or a brighter one for his interest in society or his lack of interest in it for his listening anxiously and being upon the alert the reason was bertha when he heard her name mentioned he waited in silent anxiety for what followed when he did not hear it he felt ill at ease lest it had been avoided from some special cause what she will not do for herself he said i must try to do for her if i make friends and win their good opinions i may use their influence in the future if the worst should come to the worst and she should need to be upheld it is women who sustain women or condemn them god forbid that she should ever lack their protection and so he worked to earn the power to call upon this protection if it should be required and performed his part with such steadfastness of purpose that he made a place for himself such as few men are fortunate enough to make there was one friendship he made in these days which he felt would not be likely to fade out or diminish in value it was a friendship for a woman almost old enough to have been his mothera woman who had seen the world and knew it well and yet had not lost her faith or charitable kindness of heart it was the lady whom bertha had seen him attending when she had asked him what object he had in viewthe wife of the secretary of state whose first friendly feeling for him had become a most sincere and earnest regard for which he was profoundly grateful a man to whom such a woman is kind must be grateful he had said in speaking of her to agnes sylvestre a woman who is good and generous who is keen yet merciful whose judgment is ripe and whose heart is warm who has the discernment of maturity and the gentleness of youthit is an honor to know her and be favored by her one is better every time one is thrown with her and leaves her presence with a stronger belief in all good things it had perhaps been this ladys affection for professor herrick which had at the outset directed her attention to his favorite but an acquaintance once established there had been no need of any other impetus than she received from her own feminine kindliness quickness of perception and sympathy the interest he awakened in most feminine minds he had at once awakened in her own he looks she said to herself as if he had a story and hardly knew the depth of its meaning himself but though she was dexterous enough at drawing deductions and heard much of the small talk of society she heard no story he was at once soldier and scholar he was kind brave and generous men spoke well of him and women liked him his past and present entitled him to respect and admiration but there was no story mentioned in any discussion of him he seemed to have lived a life singularly uneventful so far as emotional experiences were concerned nevertheless she used to say when she gave a few moments to sympathetic musing upon him nevertheless she observed his good behavior notwithstanding he did not enjoy himself greatly in society he was attentive to his duties without being absorbed in them and when temporarily unoccupied wore a rather weary and abstracted look it is something like the look she once remarked inwardly something like the look i have seen in the eyes of that bright and baffling little mrs amory who seems at times to be obliged to recall herself from somewhere she had not been the leader of this world of hers without seeing many things and learning many lessons and as she had stood giving her greeting to the passing multitude week after week she had gained a wonderful amount of experience and knowledge of her kind she had seen so many weary faces so many eager ones so many stamped with care and disappointment bright eyes had passed before her which one season had saddened she had heard gay voices change and soft ones grow hard she had read of ambitions frustrated and hopes denied and once or twice had seen with a pang that somewhere a heart had been broken naturally in thus looking on she had given some attention to bertha amory and had not been blind to the subtle changes through which she had passed she thought she could date the period of these changes she remembered the reception at which she had first noted that the girlish face had begun to assume a maturer look and the girlish vivacity had altered its tones this had happened the year after the marriage and then jack had been born and when society saw the young mother again the change in her seemed almost startling she looked worn and pale and showed but little interest in the whirl about her it was as if suddenly fatigue had overtaken her and she had neither the energy nor the desire to rally from it but before the end of the season she had altered again and had a touch of too brilliant color and was gayer than ever rather persistently gay said the older woman that is it i think lately there had been a greater change still and a more baffling one and there had appeared upon the scene an element so new and strange as to set all ordinary conjecture at naught the first breath of rumor which had wafted the story of planefields infatuation and the westoria schemes had been met with generous displeasure and disbelief but as time went on it had begun to be more difficult to make an effort against discussion which grew with each day and gathered material as it passed from one to another the most trivial circumstance assumed the proportions of proof when viewed in the light of the general too vivacious interest when senator planefield entered a room people instantly cast about in search of mrs amory and reposed entire confidence in the immediately popular theory that but for the presence of the one the absence of the other would have been a foregone conclusion if they met each other with any degree of vivacity the fact was commented upon in significant asides if berthas manner was cold or quiet it was supposed to form a portion of her deeplaid plan for the entire subjugation of her victim it had indeed come to this at last and tredennis friend looked on and listened bewildered to find herself shaken in her first disbelief by an aspect of affairs too serious to be regarded with indifference by the time the season drew toward its close the rumor which had at first been accepted only by rumorlovers and epicures in scandal had found its way into places where opinion had weight and decision was a more serious matter in one or two quiet establishments there was private debating of various rather troublesome questions in which debates mrs amorys name was frequently mentioned affairs as unfortunate as the one under discussion had been known to occur before and it was not impossible that they might occur again it was impossible to be blind to them it was impossible to ignore or treat them lightly and certainly something was due to society from those who held its reins in their hands for the time being it is too great leniency which makes such things possible some one remarked to a woman with a hitherto unspotted reputation and in an entirely respectable position they should be impossible it was on the very evening that this remark was made that bertha expressed a rather curious opinion to laurence arbuthnot it is dawning upon me she said that i am not quite so popular as i used to be and i am wondering why what suggested the idea laurence inquired i scarcely know she replied a little languidly and i dont care so much as i ought people dont talk to me in so animated a manner as they used toor i fancy they dont i am not very animated myself perhaps there is a great deal in that i know i am deteriorating conversationally what i say hasnt the right ring exactly and i suppose people detect the false note and dont like it i dont wonder at it oh there is no denying that i am not so much overpraised and noticed as i used to be and then she sat silent for some time and appeared to be reflecting and laurence watched her with a dawning sense of anxiety he would have been reluctant to admit the existence of even to himself chapter xxvii a few days after this she told richard that she wished to begin to make her arrangements for going away for the summer what so early he exclaimed with an air of some slight discontent it has been quite cool so far i remained too late last year she answered and i want to make up for lost time they were at dinner and he turned his wineglass about restlessly on the tablecloth are you getting tired of washington he asked you seem to be i am a little tired of everything just now she said evenwith a ghost of a laughof the westoria lands and senator planefield he turned his wineglass about again oh he said his voice going beyond the borders of petulance it is plain enough to see that you have taken an unreasonable dislike to planefield he is too large and florid and absorbs too much of ones attention she replied coldly he does not always seem to absorb a great deal of yours richard responded knitting his delicate dark brows you treated him cavalierly enough last night when he brought you the roses i am tired of his roses she exclaimed with sudden passion they are too big and red and heavy they cost too much money they fill all the air about me they weight me down and i never seem to be rid of them i wont have any more let him give them to some one else and she threw her bunch of grapes on her plate and dropped her forehead on her hands with a childish gesture of fatigue and despair richard knit his brows again he regarded her with a feeling very nearly approaching nervous dread this would not do it was plain what is the matter with you he said what has happened it isnt like you to be unreasonable bertha she made an effort to recover herself and partly succeeded she lifted her face and spoke quite gently and deprecatingly no she said i dont think it is so you will be all the readier to overlook it and allow it to me as a luxury the fact is richard i am not growing any stronger and do you know he interrupted i dont understand that you used to be strong enough one has to be very strong to be strong enough she replied and i seem to have fallen a little short of the mark but it has been going on rather a long time hasnt it he inquired didnt it begin last winter yes she answered in a low voice it began then well you see that is rather long for a thing of that sort to go on without any special reason it has seemed so to me she responded without any change of tone havent you a pretty good appetite he inquired she raised her eyes suddenly and then dropped them again he had not observed what a dozen other people had seen no she answered dont you sleep well no are you thinner well yes giving her a glance of inspection you are thinner oh come now this wont do at all i am willing to offer any form of apology you like she said you must get well he answered that is all and he rose from his seat went to the mantel for a cigarette and returned to her side patting her shoulder encouragingly you would not be tired of planefield if you were well you would like him well enough the change which settled on her face was one which had crossed it many a time without his taking note of it possibly the edge of susceptibilities so fine and keen as his is more easily dulled than that of sensitiveness less exquisite she arose herself that offers me an inducement to recover she said i will begin immediatelytodaythis moment let me light your cigarette for you after it was done they sauntered into the library together and stood for a moment looking out of the window do you know she said at length laying her hand on his sleeve i think even you are not quite yourself are you an invalid too i he said why do you think so for a very good reason she answered for the best of reasons two or three times lately you have been a trifle out of humor are you aware of it such you see is the disadvantage of being habitually amiable the slightest variation of your usually angelic demeanor lays you open to the suspicion of bodily ailment just now for instance at table when i spoke to you about going away you were a littlenot to put too fine a point upon itcross was i her touch upon his sleeve was very soft and kind and her face had a gentle playful appeal on it you really were she returned just a littleand so was i it was more a matter of voice and manner of course but we didnt appear to our greatest advantage i am afraid and we have never done things like that you know and it would be rather bad to begin now wouldnt it it certainly would he replied and it is very nice in you to care about it it would not be nice in me not to care she said just for a moment you know it actually sounded quitequite married it seemed as if we were on the verge of agreeing to differ aboutsenator planefield we wont do it again he said we will agree to make the best of him she hesitated a second i will try not to make the worst she returned there is always a best i suppose and so long as you are here to take care of me i need notneed not be uncomfortable about what he asked she hesitated again and a shade of new color touched her cheek i dont think i am overfastidious she said but he has a way i dont like he is too fulsome he admires me too much he pays me too many compliments i wish he would not do it oh come now he said gayly that is prejudice it is worse than all the rest i never heard you complain of your admirers before or of their compliments she hesitated a moment again it was not the first time she had encountered this light and graceful obstinacy and found it more difficult to cope with than words apparently more serious i have never had an admirer of exactly that quality before she said oh he said airily dont argue from the ground that it is a bad quality has it never struck you she suggested that there is something of the same quality whether it is good bad or indifferent in all the persons who are connected with the westoria lands i have felt once or twice lately when i have looked around the parlors as if i must have suddenly emigrated the atmosphere was so different they have actually rather crowded out the restthose men it was his turn to pause now and he did so looking out of the window evidently ill at ease and hesitant for the moment my dear child he said at length there may be truth in what you say buti may as well be frank with youthe thing is necessary richard she said quickly prompted to the question by a sudden vague thought what have you to do with the westoria lands why do you care so much about them i have everything to do with themand nothing he answered the legal business connected with them and likely to result from the success of the scheme will be the making of me that is all i havent been an immense success so far you know and it will make me an immense success and a man of property upon my word a nice little lobbyist you are to look frightened at the mere shadow of a plot i am not a lobbyist she exclaimed i never wanted to be one that was only a part of the nonsense i have talked all my life i have talked too much nonsense i wishi wish i had been different dont allow your repentance to be too deep he remarked dryly you wont be able to get over it its too late for repentance but i shall not be guilty of that particular kind of folly again it was follyand it was bad taste as i had not observed it you might have been content to let it rest he interrupted she checked herself in the reply she was about to make clasping her hands helplessly o richard she said we are beginning again so we are he responded coolly we seem to have a tendency in that direction and it always happens she said when i speak of senator planefield or of going away you have fallen into the habit of wanting to go away lately he answered you wanted to go to europe i want to go still she interposed very much and i wish you to remain here he returned petulantly whats the use of a mans having a wife at the other side of the globe she withdrew a pace and leaned against the side of the window letting her eyes rest upon him with a little bitter smile for the moment she had less care of herself and of him than she had ever had before ah she said then you keep me here because you love me bertha he exclaimed even his equable triviality found a disturbing element in the situation richard she said go and finish your cigarette out of doors it will be better for both of us this has gone far enough it has gone too far he answered nervously it is deucedly uncomfortable and it isnt our way to be uncomfortable cant we make it smooth again of course we can it would not be like you to be implacable i am afraid i was a trifle irritable the fact is i have had a great deal of business anxiety latelyone or two investments have turned out poorlyand it has weighed on my mind if the money were mine you know but it is yours i have never wished you to feel the difference she said no he replied nothing could have been nicer than your way about it you might have made me very uncomfortable if you had been a hard businesslike creature but instead of that you have been charming i am glad of that she said and she smiled gently as he put his arm about her and kissed her cheek you have a right to your caprices he said go to your summer haunts of vice and fashion if you wish to and i will follow you as soon as i can but we wont say any more about europe just at present will we perhaps next year and he kissed her again perhaps next year or the year after she repeated with a queer little smile andand we will take senator planefield with us no he answered we will leave him at home to invest the millions derived from the westoria lands and he went out with a laugh on his lips a week later colonel tredennis heard from richard that bertha and the children were going away when asked the colonel that seems rather sudden i saw janey two days ago and did not understand that the time was set for their departure it is rather sudden said richard the fact is they leave washington this morning i should be with them now if it were not for a business engagement chapter xxviii the next few weeks were not agreeable ones to richard amory there was too much feverish anxiety and uncertainty in them he had not yet acquired the coolness and hardihood of experience and he felt their lack in himself he had a great deal at stake more than at the outset it had seemed possible he could have under any circumstances he began to realize with no little discomfort that he had run heavier risks than he had intended to allow himself to be led into running when they rose before him in their full magnitude as they did occasionally when affairs assumed an unencouraging aspect he wished his enthusiasm had been less great it could not be said that he had reached remorse for or actual repentance of his indiscretions he had simply reached a point when discouragement led him to feel that he might be called upon to repent by misfortune up to this time it had been his habit to drive up to the capitol in his coup to appear in the galleries to saunter through the lobby and to flit in and out of committeerooms with something of the air of an amateur rather enjoying himself he had made himself popular his gayety his magnetic manner his readiness to be all things to all men had smoothed his pathway for him while his unprofessional air had given him an appearance of harmlessness hes a firstrate kind of fellow to have on the ground when a thing of this sort is going on one of the smaller satellites once remarked nobodys afraid of being seen with him theres an immense deal in that there are fellows who come here who can half ruin a man with position by recognizing him on the street regular old hands they are working around here for years making an honest living out of their native land every one knows them and what they are up to now this one is different and that wife of his what has she been doing flung in planefield who was present what has she got to do with it he said it with savage uneasiness he was full of restive jealousy and distrust in these days i was only going to say that she is known in society he remarked and she is the kind the most particular of those fellows dont object to calling on but as matters took form and a more critical point was neared as the newspapers began to express themselves on the subject of the westoria lands scheme and prophesy its failure or success as it became the subject of editorials applauding the publicspiritedness of those most prominent in it or of paragraphs denouncing the corrupt and selfseeking tendency of the times as the mental temperature of certain individuals became a matter of vital importance and the degree of cordiality of a greeting an affair of elation or despairrichard felt that his air of being an amateur was becoming a thing of the past he was too anxious to keep it up well he did not sleep at night and began to look fagged and it required an effort to appear at ease confound it he said to planefield how can one be at ease with a man when his yes or no may be success or destruction to you it makes him of too much consequence a fellow finds himself trying to please and it spoils his manner i never knew what it was to feel a human being of any particular consequence before you have been lucky commented planefield not too tolerantly i have been lucky richard answered but im not lucky now and i shall be deucedly unlucky if that bill doesnt pass the fact is there are times when i half wish i hadnt meddled with it the mistake you made said planefield with stolid illhumor was in letting mrs amory go away now is the time you need her most theres no denying that there are some things women can do better than men and when a man has a wife as clever as yours and as much of a social success hes blundering when he doesnt call on her for assistance one or two of her little dinners would be the very things just now for the final smoothing down of one or two rough ones who havent opinions unless you provide them with them shed provide them with them fast enough theyd only have one opinion when shed done with them if she was in one of the moods ive seen her in sometimes look how she carried bowman and pell off their feet the night she gave them the description of that row in the house and hargis of north carolina swears by her hes a simple domesticated fellow and was homesick the night i brought him here and she found it outheaven knows howand talked to him about his wife and children until he said he felt as if hed seen them he told me so with tears in his eyes it is that kind of thing we want now well said richard nervously it isnt at our disposal i dont mind telling you that she was rather out of humor with the aspect of affairs before she went away and i had one interview with her which showed me it would be the safest plan to let her go out of humor said planefield she has been a good deal out of humor lately it seems to me not that its any business of mine but its rather a pity considering circumstances richard colored walked a few steps put his hands in his pockets and took them out again among the chief sources of anxious trouble to him had been that of late he had found his companion rather difficult to get along with he had been irritable and even a trifle overbearing and had at times exhibited an indifference to results truly embarrassing to contemplate in view of the crisis at hand when he intrenched himself behind a certain heavy stubbornness in which he was specially strong richard felt himself helpless the big body the florid face the doggedly unresponsive eye were too much to combat against when he was illhumored richard knew that he endeavored to conciliate him but when this mood held possession he could only feel alarm and ask himself if it could be possible that after all the man might be brutal and false enough to fail him there were times when he sat and looked at him unwillingly fascinated by the likeness he found in him to the man who had sent poor westor to his doom naturally the old story had been revived of late and he heard new versions of it and more minute descriptions of the chief actors and it was not difficult for an overwrought imagination to discover in the two men some similarity of personal characteristics just at this moment there rose within him a memory of a point of resemblance between the pair which would have been extremely embarrassing to him if he had permitted it to assume the disagreeable form of an actual fact it was the resemblance between the influences which had moved them in both cases it had been a womanin this case it was his own wife and if he had not been too greatly harassed he would have appreciated the indelicacy of the situation he was not an unrefined person in theory and his sensitiveness would have caused him to revolt at the grossness of such a position if he had not had so much at stake and been so overborne by his associates his mistakes and vices were always the result of circumstance and enthusiasm and he hurried past them with averted eyes and refused to concede to them any substantiality there is nothing more certain than that he had never allowed himself to believe that he had found bertha of practical use in rendering planefield docile and attracting less important luminaries bertha had been very charming and amiable that was all she was always so it was her habit to please peopleher nature in factand she had only done what she always did as a mental statement of the case nothing could be more simple than this and he was moved to private disgust by his companions aggressive clumsiness which seemed to complicate matters and confront him with more crude suggestions i am afraid she would not enjoy your way of putting it he said planefield shut his teeth on his cigar and looked out of the window that was his sole response and was a form of bullying he enjoyed we must remember thatthat she does not realize everything continued richard uneasily and she has not regarded the matter from any serious standpoint it is my impression he added with a sudden sense of growing irritation that she wouldnt have anything to do with it if she thought it was a matter of gain or loss planefield made no movement he was convinced that this was a lie and his look out of the window was his reply to it richard put his hands into his pockets again and turned about irritated and helpless you must have seen yourself how unpractical she is he exclaimed she is a mere child in business matters any one could deceive her he stopped and flushed without any apparent reason he found himself looking out of the window too with a feeling of most unpleasant confusion he was obliged to shake it off before he spoke again and when he did so it was with an air of beginning with a fresh subject after all he said everything does not depend upon influence of that sort there are other things to be considered have you seen blundel you cant expect a man like blundel said planefield to be easy to manage blundel is the possessor of a moral character and when a man has capital like thatand blundels sharpness into the bargainhe is not going to trifle with it hes going to hang on to it until it reaches its highest market value and then decide which way he will invest it richard dropped into a seat by the table he felt his forehead growing damp but if we are not sure of blundel he exclaimed well we are not sure of blundel was the answer what we have to hope is that he isnt sure of himself the one thing you cant be sure of is a moral character impeccability is rare and it is never easy for an outsider to hit on its exact value it varies and you have to run risks with it blundels is expensive there has been a great deal of money used hesitated richard a great deal planefield resorted to the window again it had not been his money that had been used he had sufficient intellect to reap advantages where they were to be reaped and to avoid indiscreet adventures you had better go and see blundel yourself he said after a pause i have had a talk with him and made as alluring a statement of the case as i could with the proper degree of caution and he has had time to put the matter in the scales with his impeccability and see which weighs the heavier and if they cant be made to balance he will try to balance them but if he cantyou must settle what is to be done between you i have done my best by jove exclaimed richard virtuously what corruption it was an ingenuous ejaculation but he was not collected enough to appreciate the native candor of it himself at the moment he felt that he was being hardly treated and that the most sacred trusts of a great nation were in hands likely to betray them at far too high a figure the remark amounted to an outburst of patriotism have they all their price he cried planefield turned his head slowly and glanced at him over his shoulder no he said if they had youd find it easier theres your difficulty if they were all to be bought or none of them were to be sold youd see your way it did not seem to richard that his way was very clear at the present moment at every step of late he had found new obstacles in his path and new burdens on his shoulders people had so many interests and so many limitations and the limitations were always related to the interests he began to resolve that it was a very sordid and businesslike world in which human lot was cast and to realize that the tendency of humanity was to coarse prejudice in favor of itself then i had better see blundel at once he said with feverish impatience you havent any time to lose was planefields cool response and you will need all the wit you can carry with you you are not going to offer him inducements you know you are only going to prove to him that his chance to do something for his country lies before him in the direction of the westoria lands after that after that repeated richard anxiously do what you think safest and most practicable as the wellappointed equipage drew up under the archway before the lower entrance to the north wing of the capitol a group of men who stood near the doorway regarded it with interest they did so because three of them were strangers and sightseers and the fourth who was a wellseasoned washingtonian had called their attention to it there he said with an experienced air there is one of them this moment it is beginning to be regarded as a fact that he is mixed up with one of the biggest jobs the country has ever known he is up to his ears in this westoria business its believed though he professes to be nothing more than a sort of interested lookeron and a friend of the prime movers hes a gentleman you see with a position in society and a pretty wife who is a favorite and the pretty wife entertains his friends and when a man is in an uncertain frame of mind the husband invites him to dinner and the pretty wife interests herself in himshe knows how to do it they sayand he goes away a wiser and a better man and more likely to see his way to making himself agreeable nothing professional about it dont you see all quite proper and natural no lobbying about that you know but it helps a bill through wonderfully i tell you theres no knowing what goes on in these tiptop parlors about here he said it with modest pride and exultation and his companions were delighted they represented the average american with all his ingenuous eagerness for the dramatic exposure of crime in his fellowman they had existed joyously for years in the belief that washington was the seat of corruption bribery and fraud that it was populated chiefly with brilliant female lobbyists and depraved officials who carried their privileges to market and bartered and sold them with a guileless candor whose temerity was only to be equalled by its brazen cheerfulness of spirit they were probably not in the least aware of their mental attitude toward their nations government but they revelled in it none the less and would have felt a keen pang of disappointment if they had been suddenly confronted with the fact that there was actually an element of most unpicturesque honesty in the house and a flavor of shameless impeccability in the senate they had heard delightful stories of jobs and schemes and had hoped to hear more when they had been taken to the visitors gallery they had exhibited an earnest anxiety to be shown the members connected with the last investigation and had received with private rapture all anecdotes connected with the ruling political scandal they decided that the country was in a bad way and felt a glow of honest pride in its standing up at all in its present condition of rottenness their ardor had been a little dampened by an incautious statement made by their friend and guide to the effect that the subject of the investigation seemed likely to clear himself of the charges made against him and the appearance of richard amory with his personal attractions his neat equipage and his air of belonging to the great world was something of a boon to them they wished his wife had been with him they had only seen one female lobbyist as yet and she had been merely a cheap flashy woman with thin rouged cheeks and sharp eager eyes looks rather anxious doesnt he one asked the other as amory went by he certainly looked anxious as he passed them but once inside the building he made an effort to assume something of his usual air of gay good cheer it would not do to present himself with other than a fearless front so he walked with a firm and buoyant tread through the great vaulted corridors and up the marble stairways exchanging a salutation with one passerby and a word of greeting with another he found senator blundel in his committeeroom sitting at the greencovered table looking over some papers he was a short stout man with a bluntfeatured face grayish hair which had a tendency to stand on end and small shrewd eyes when he had been in the house his rising to his feet had generally been the signal for his fellowmembers to bestir themselves and turn to listen as it was his habit to display a sharp humor of a roughandready sort richard had always felt this humor coarse and having but little confidence in blundels possessing any other qualification for his position regarded it as rather trying that circumstances should have combined to render his sentiments of such importance in the present crisis looking at the thickset figure and ordinary face he felt that planefield had been right and that bertha might have done much with him principally because he presented himself as one of the obstacles whose opinions should be formed for them all the more on account of their obstinacy when once biassed in a wrong direction but there was no suggestion of these convictions in his manner when he spoke it was very graceful and ready and his strong points of goodbreeding and mental agility stood him in good stead the man before him whose early social advantages had not been great was not too dull to feel the influence of the first quality and find himself placed at a secretly acknowledged disadvantage by it after he had heard his name his small sharp eyes fixed themselves on his visitors handsome countenance with an expression not easy to read it is not necessary for me to make a new statement of our case said richard easily i wont fatigue you and occupy your time by repeating what you have already heard stated in the clearest possible manner by senator planefield blundel thrust his hands into his pockets and nodded yes he responded i saw planefield and he said a good deal about it which of course you have reflected upon said richard well yes ive thought it overalong with other things i trust favorably richard suggested blundel stretched his legs a little and pushed his hands further down into his pockets now what would you call favorably he inquired oh replied richard with a selfpossessed promptness favorably to the connecting branch it was rather a fine stroke this airy candor but he had studied it beforehand thoroughly and calculated its effect it surprised blundel into looking up at him quickly you would eh he said let us hear why because richard stated that would make it favorable to us blundel was beguiled into a somewhat uneasy laugh well he remarked youre frank enough richard fixed upon him an open appreciative glance and why not he answered there is our strong pointthat we can afford to be frank we have nothing to conceal we have something to gain of coursewho has notbut it is to be gained legitimatelyso there is no necessity for our concealing that the case is simplicity itself here are the two railroads seeand he laid two strips of paper side by side upon the table a connecting branch is needed if it runs through this way making a line with his finger it makes certain valuable lands immeasurably more valuable there is no practical objection to its taking this direction instead of thatin either case it runs through the government reservationsthe road will be built somebodys property will be benefitedwhy not that of my clients blundel looked at the strips of paper and his little eyes twinkled mysteriously by george he said that isnt the way such things are generally put what you ought to do is to prove that nobody is to be benefited and that you are working for the good of the government richard laughed oh he said i am an amateur and i should be of no use whatever to my clients if they had anything to hide or any special reason to fear failure we have opposition to contend with of course the southern line is naturally against us as it wants the connecting branch to run in the opposite direction but if it has no stronger claim than we have the struggle is equal they are open to the objection of being benefited by the subsidies too it is scarcely ground enough for refusing your vote that some one will be benefited by it the people is the government in america and the government the people and the interest of both are too indissolubly connected to admit of being easily separated on public measures as i said i am an amateur but i am a man of the world my basis is a natural human one i desire to attain an object and though the government will be benefited i am obliged so confess i am arguing for my object more than for the government this was said with more delightful airy frankness than ever but concealed beneath this genial openness was a desperate anxiety to discover what his companion was thinking of and if the effect of his stroke was what he had hoped it would be he knew that frankness so complete was a novelty and he trusted that his bearing had placed him out of the list of ordinary applicants for favor his private conviction to which he did not choose to allow himself to refer mentally with any degree of openness was that if the man was honest honesty so bold and simple must disarm him and if he was not ingenuousness so reckless must offer him inducements but it was not easy to arrive at once at any decision as to the tenor of blundels thoughts he had listened and it being his habit to see the humor of things he had grinned a little at the humor he saw in this situation which was perhaps not a bad omen though he showed no disposition to commit himself on the spot makes a good story he said pretty big scheme isnt it not a small one answered richard freely that is one of its merits the subsidies wont have to be small ones said blundel that isnt one of its merits now let us hear your inducements richard checked himself on the very verge of a start realizing instantaneously the folly of his first flashing thought the inducements you can offer to the government added blundel you havent gone into a thing of this sort without feeling you have some on hand of course there were inducements and richard had them at his fingers ends and was very fluent and eloquent in his statement of them in fact when once fairly launched upon the subject he was somewhat surprised to find how many powerful reasons there were for its being to the interest of the nation that the land grants should be made to the road which ran through the westoria lands and opened up their resources his argument became so brilliant as he proceeded that he was moved by their sincerity himself and gained impetus through his confidence in them he really felt that he was swayed by a generous desire to benefit his country and enjoyed his conviction of his own honesty with a refinement which for the moment lost sight of all less agreeable features of the proceeding all his fine points came out under the glow of his enthusiasmhis grace of speech and manner his picturesque habit of thought which gave color and vividness to all he saidhis personal attractiveness itself blundel bestirred himself to sit up and look at him with renewed interest he liked a good talker he was a good talker himself his mind was of a practical business stamp and he was good at a knockdown blow in argument or at a joke or jibe which felled a man like a meataxe but he had nothing like this and he felt something like envy of all this swiftness and readiness and polish when he finished richard felt that he must have impressed him that it was impossible that it should be otherwise even though there were no special external signs of blundel being greatly affected he had thrust his hands into his pockets as before and his hair stood on end as obstinately well he said succinctly it is a good story and its a big scheme and yousaid richard we are sure of your blundel took a hand out of his pocket and ran it over his upright hair as if in a futile attempt at sweeping it down ill tell you what ill do he said ill see you day after tomorrow butexclaimed richard secretly aghast blundel ran over his hair again and returned his hand to his pocket oh yes he answered i know all about that you dont want to lose time and you want to feel sure but you see i want to feel sure too as i said its a big business its too big a business to assume the responsibility of all at once im not going to run any risks i dont say you want me to run any but you know you are an amateur and there may be risks you dont realize ill see you again in his character of amateur it was impossible for richard to be importunate but his temptations to commit the indiscretion were strong a hundred things might happen in the course of two days delay was more dangerous than anything else the worst of it all was that he had really gained no reliable knowledge of the man himself and how it would be best to approach him he had seen him throughout the interview just as he had seen him before it whether or not his sharpness was cunning and his bluntness a defence he had not been able to decide at any rate he is cautious he thought how cautious it is for us to find out when he left him richard was in a fever of disappointment and perplexity which to his ease and pleasureloving nature was torment confound it all he said confound the thing from beginning to end it will have to pay well to pay for this he had other work before him other efforts to make and after he had made them he returned to his carriage fatigued and overwrought he had walked through the great corridors from wing to wing in pursuit of men who seemed to elude him like willothewisps he had been driven to standing among motley groups who sent in cards which did not always intercede for them he had had interviews with men who were outwardly suave and pliable with men who were illmannered and impatient with men who were obstinate and distrustful and with men who were too much occupied with their own affairs to be other than openly indifferent if he had met with a shade of encouragement at one point he had found it amply balanced by discouragement at the next he had seen himself regarded as an applicant for favor and a person to be disposed of as speedily as possible and when his work was at an end his physical condition was one of exhaustion and his mental attitude marked chiefly by disgust and weariness of spirit this being the state of affairs he made a call upon miss varien who always exhilarated and entertained him he found her in her bower and was received with the unvarying tact which characterized her manner upon all occasions he poured forth his woes as far as they could be told and was very picturesque about them as he reclined in the easiest of easychairs it is my opinion that nothing can be done without money he said which is disgraceful it is indeed acknowledged miss varien with a gleam of beautiful little teeth she had lived in washington with her exceptional father and entirely satisfactory mother from her earliest infancy and had gained from observationat which she was brilliant as at all elsea fund of valuable information she had seen many things and had not seen them in vain it may be even suspected that richard in his character of amateur was aware of this there was a suggestion of watchfulness in his glance at her things ought to be better or worse to simplify the system she said that is in effect what i heard said this morning answered richard i am sorry it is not entirely new she returned was it suggested also that since we cannot have incorruptibility we might alter our moral standards and remove corruption by making all transactions mere matters of business if there was no longer any penalty attached to the sale and barter of public privileges such sale and barter would cease to be dishonor and crime we should be better if we were infinitely worse the theory may appear bold at first blushno not at first blush for blushes are to be done away withat first sight i will say in preference it may appear bold but after much reflection i have decided that it is the only practicable one it is undoubtedly brilliant replied richard but as you say it would simplify matters wonderfully i should not be at such a loss to know what senator blundel will do for instance and my appetite for luncheon would be better it might possibly be worse suggested miss varien richard glanced at her quickly that is a remark which evidently has a foundation he said i wish you would tell me what prompted it i am not sure it was very discreet was the reply my personal knowledge of senator blundel prompted it you know him very well said richard with some eagerness i should not venture to say i knew any one very well she said in the captivating voice which gave to all her words such value and suggestiveness i know him as i know many other men like him i was born a politician and existence without my politics would be an arid desert to me i have talked to him and read his speeches and followed him in his career for some time i have even asked questions about him and consequently i know something of his methods i thinkyou see i only say i thinki know what he will do in heavens name what is it demanded richard she unfurled her fan and smiled over it with the delightful gleam of little white teeth he will take his time she answered he is slow and prides himself on being sure your bill will not be acted upon it will be set aside to lie over until the next session of congress richard felt as if he changed color but he bore himself with outward discretion you have some ulterior motive he said having invited me to remain to luncheon you seek to render me incapable of doing myself justice you saw in my eye the wolfish hunger which is the result of interviews with the savage senator and the pitiless member of congress now i see the value of your theory if it were in practice i could win blundel over with gold what is your opinion of his conscience as it stands it was said with admirable lightness and answered in a like strain but he had never been more anxiously on the alert than he was as he watched miss variens vivacious and subtly expressive face i have not reached it yet she said and consciences are of such different make and material i have not decided whether his is made of interest or honesty he is a mixture of shrewdness and crudeness which is very baffling just when you are arguing from the shrewdness the crudeness displays itself and vice vers but as i said i think your bill will not be acted upon and then they went into luncheon and as he ate his lobstersalad and made himself agreeable beyond measure richard wondered with an inward tremor if she could be right chapter xxix mrs sylvestre did not leave town early the weather was reasonably cool the house on lafayette square was comfortable and washington in spring is at its loveliest she liked the lull after the season and enjoyed it to its utmost wisely refusing all invitations to fitful afterlent gayeties she held no more receptions but saw her more intimate acquaintances in the evening when they made their informal calls with each week that passed her home gave her greater pleasure and grew prettier i never lose interest in it she said to arbuthnot it is a continued delight to me i find that i think of it a great deal and am fond of it almost as if it was a friend i had found i think i must have been intended for a housewife mrs merriams liking for laurence arbuthnot having increased as their acquaintance progressed his intimacy in the household became more and more an established fact one should always number among ones acquaintance the clever dowager remarked an agreeable wellbred and reliable manfrienda man one can ask to do things if unforeseen occasions arise he must be agreeable since one must be intimate with him and for the same reason he must be wellbred notwithstanding our large circle we are a rather lonely pair my dear gradually mrs sylvestre herself had found a slight change taking place in her manner toward arbuthnot she became conscious of liking him better and of giving him more mental attention as she saw him more familiarly the idea dawned by slow degrees upon her that the triviality of which she accused him was of an unusual order that it was accompanied by qualities and peculiarities which did not seem to belong to it she had discovered that he could deny himself pleasures he desired that he was secretly thoughtful for others that he wasalso secretlydetermined and that he had his serious moments however persistently he endeavored to conceal them perhaps the professor had given her more information concerning him than she could have gained by observation in any comparatively short space of time this frivolous fellow he said to her one night laying an affectionate hand on arbuthnots arm as they were on the point of leaving the house together after having spent the evening therethis frivolous fellow is the friend of my old age i wonder why so do i said arbuthnot i assure you that you could not find a reason professor there is a kind of reason returned the professor though it is scarcely worthy of the name this frivolous fellow is not such a trifler as he seems and it interests me to see his seriousness continually getting the better of him when he fancies he has got it under and trodden it under his feet arbuthnot laughed againthe full careless laugh which was so excellent an answer to everything he maligns me this dissector of the emotions he said he desires artfully to give you the impression that i am not serious by nature i am in fact seriousness itself it is the wicked world which gets the better of me which statement mrs sylvestre might have chosen to place some reliance in as being a plausible one if she had not seen the professor at other times when he spoke of this friendship of his it was certainly a warm one and then feeling that there must be reason for it she began to see these reasons for herself and appreciate something of their significance and value the change which finally revealed itself in her manner was so subtle in its character that arbuthnot himself could not be sure when he had first felt it sometimes he fancied it had been at one time and again at another and even now it was not easy for him to explain to himself why he knew that they were better friends but there was an incident in their acquaintance which he always remembered as a landmark this incident occurred at the close of the season one bright moonlight night having a fancy for making a call upon bertha who was not well enough to go out for several days mrs sylvestre made the visit on foot accompanied by her maid the night was so pleasant that they were walking rather slowly under the trees near lafayette park when their attention was attracted by the sound of suppressed sobbing which came from one of two figures standing in the shadow near the railings a few yards ahead of them the figures were those of a man and a young woman and the instant she saw the man who was well dressed agnes sylvestre felt her heart leap in her side for she recognized laurence arbuthnot he stood quite near the woman and seemed trying to console or control her while sheless a woman than a girl and revealing in her childish face and figure all that is most pathetic in youth and helplessnesswept and wrung her hands you must be quiet and have more confidence inagnes heard arbuthnot say and then prompted by some desperate desire to hear no more and to avoid being seen she spoke to her maid marie she said we will cross the street but when they had crossed the street some chill in the night air seemed to have struck her and she began to shiver so that marie looked at her in some affright madame is cold she said is it possible that madame has a chill i am afraid so her mistress replied turning about hurriedly i will not make the visit i will return home a few minutes later mrs merriam who had settled her small figure comfortably in a large armchair by the fire and prepared to spend the rest of the evening with a new book looked up from its first chapter in amazement as her niece entered the room agnes she exclaimed what has happened are you ill why child you are as white as a lily it was true that mrs sylvestres fair face had lost all trace of its always delicate color and that her hands trembled as she drew off her gloves i begansuddenlyto feel so cold she said that i thought it better to come back mrs merriam rose anxiously i hope it is not malaria after all she said i shall begin to think the place is as bad as rome you must have some hot wine send it upstairs if you please said agnes i am going to my room there is a large fire there and she went out as suddenly as she had appeared i really believe she does not wish me to follow her said mrs merriam to herself is this malaria and having pondered upon this question while she gave orders that the wine should be heated she returned to her book after doing it with the decision no it is not agnes drank very little of the wine when it was brought she sat by the fire in her room and did not regain her color the cold which had struck her had struck very deep she felt as if she could not soon get warm again her eyes had a stern look as they rested on the fire her delicate mouth was set into a curve of hopeless bitter scorn the quiet which settled upon her was even a little terrible in some mysterious way she heard a ring at the doorbell but did not move though she knew a caller was allowed to go to mrs merriam she was not in a mood to see callers she could see nobody she wished to be left alone but in about half an hour a servant came into her room mr arbuthnot is downstairs and mrs merriam wishes to know if mrs sylvestre is better mrs sylvestre hesitated a second before she replied say to mrs merriam that i am better and will join her she was as white as ever when she rose even a shade whiter and she felt like marble though she no longer trembled i will go down she said mechanically yes i will go down what she meant to say or do when she entered the room below perhaps she had not clearly decided herself as she came in and arbuthnot rose to receive her he felt a startled thrill of apprehension and surprise i am afraid you are not really better he said perhaps i should not have asked to be allowed to see you he had suddenly an absurd feeling that there was such distance between themthat something inexplicable had set them so far apartthat it might almost be necessary to raise his voice to make her hear him thank you she replied i was not really ill and passed the chair he offered her as if not seeing it taking another one which placed the table between them arbuthnot gave her a steady glance and sat down himself resolving in a moments time that something incomprehensible had happened he gathered himself together with another resolve which did equal credit to his intelligence and presence of mind this resolution was that he would not permit himself to be overborne by the mystery until he understood what it was and that he would understand what it was before he left the house if such a thing were possible he had the coolness and courage to refuse to be misunderstood i should not have hoped to see you he said in a quiet level tone still watching her but mrs merriam was so kind as to think you would be interested in something i came to tell her of course she will be interested said mrs merriam such a story would interest any woman tell it to her at once i wish you would do it for me said arbuthnot with a rather reluctant accession of gravity it is really out of my line you will make it touchingwomen see things so differently ill confess to you that i only see the miserable sordid forlorn side of it and dont know what to do with the pathos when that poor little wretch cried at me and wrung her hands i had not the remotest idea what i ought to say to stop herand heaven knows i wanted her to stop i could only make the mistaken remark that she must have confidence in me and i would do my best for the childish irresponsible pair of them though why they should have confidence in me i can only say heaven knows again after she had seated herself agnes had lightly rested her head upon her hand as if to shade her eyes somewhat when arbuthnot began to speak she had stirred dropping her hand a moment later and leaning forward at this juncture she rose from her chair and came forward with a swift unconsciouslooking movement she stood up before arbuthnot and spoke to him i wish to hear the story very much she said with a thrill of appeal in her sweet voice i wish you to tell it to me you will tell it asas we should hear it nothing but a prolonged and severe course of training could have enabled arbuthnot to preserve at this moment his outward composure indeed he was by no means sure that it was preserved intact he was afraid that his blond countenance flushed a little and that his eyes were not entirely steady he felt it necessary to assume a lightness of demeanor entirely out of keeping with his mental condition i appreciate your confidence in me he answered all the more because i feel my entire inadequacy to the situation the person who could tell it as you ought to hear it is the young woman who waylaid me with tears near lafayette park about half an hour ago she is a very young woman in fact an infant who is legally united in marriage to another infant who has been in the employ of the government in the building i adorn with my presence why they felt it incumbent upon themselves to marry on an income of seventyfive dollars a month they do not explain in any manner at all satisfactory to the worldly mind they did so however and lived together for several months in what is described as a state of bliss they had two small rooms and the female infant wore calico gowns and did her own ridiculous sordid inferior housework and rejoiced in the society of the male infant when a grateful nation released him from his daily labors agnes quietly slipped into the chair he had first placed for her she did it with a gentle yielding movement to which he was so little blind that he paused a second and looked at the fire and made a point of resuming his story with a lighter air than before they could not have been either happy or content under such absurd circumstances he said but they thought they were i used to see the male infant beaming over his labors in a manner to infuriate you his wife used to come down to bear him from the office to the two rooms in a sort of triumphal procession she had round eyes and dimples in her cheeks and a little round head with curls her husband whose tastes were simple regarded her as a beauty and was given to confiding his opinion of her to his fellowclerks there was no objection to him but his youth and innocence i am told he worked with undue enthusiasm in the hope of keeping his position or even getting a better one and had guileless frenzied dreams of being able in the course of the ensuing century to purchase a small house on time i dont ask you to believe me when i tell you that the pair actually had such a house in their imbecile young minds and had saved out of their starvation income a few dollars toward making their first payment on it i didnt believe the man who told me and i assure you he is a far more reliable fellow than i am he paused a second more was it possible that he found himself obliged to do so they said he added they said they wanted a home he heard a soft little sound at his sidea soft emotional little sound it came from mrs sylvestre she sat with her slender hands clasped upon her knee and as the little sound broke from her lips she clasped them more closely ah she said ah poor children arbuthnot went on ought i to blush to admit that i watched these two young candidates for saint elizabeth and the poorhouse with interest they assisted me to beguile away some weary hours in speculation i wondered when they would begin to be tired of each other when they would find out their mistake and loathe the paltriness of their surroundings when the female infant would discover that her dimples might have been better invested and that calico gowns were unworthy of her charms i do blush to confess that i scraped an acquaintance with the male infant with a view to drawing forth his views on matrimony and life as a whole he had been wont to smoke inferior cigarettes in the days of his gay and untrammelled bachelorhood but had given up the luxurious habit on engaging himself to the object of his affections he remarked to me that a man ought to have principle enough to deny himself things when he had something to deny himself for and when a man had a wife and a home he had something to deny himself for and if he was a man hed do it he was very ingenuous and very fond of enlarging confidingly upon domestic topics and virtues and joys and being encouraged could be relied upon so to enlargealways innocently and with inoffensive youthful enthusiasmuntil deftly headed off by the soulless worldling i gave him cigars and an order of attention which seemed to please him he remarked to his fellowclerks that i was a man who had principles and feelings consequently i felt grateful to him he had great confidence in principles the bold thought had presented itself to him that if we were more governed by principles as a nation we should thrive better and there would be less difficulty in steering the ship of state but he advanced the opinion hesitantly as fearing injustice to his country in the suggestion you are making him very attractive said mrs merriam there is something touching about it all he was attractive to me returned laurence and he was touching at times he was crude and by no means brilliant but there wasnt an evil spot in him and his beliefs were of a strength and magnitude to bring a blush to the cheek of the most hardened he recalled the dreams of youth and even in his most unintelligently ardent moments appealed to one taking all these things into consideration you will probably see that it was likely to be something of a blow to him to find himself suddenly thrown out upon the world without any resource whatever ah exclaimed mrs sylvestre earnestly surely you are not going to tell us that he has lost his office said laurence yes thrown out reasonplace wanted for some one else i shouldnt call it a good reason myself i find others who would not call it a good reason but what are you going to do what did he do asked agnes he came into my room one day answered laurence just as i was leaving it he was white and his lips trembled in a boyish way that struck me at the moment as being rather awful he looked as if he had been knocked down he said to me mr arbuthnot ive lost my place and then after staring at me a few seconds he added mr arbuthnot what would you do it is very cruel said agnes it is very hard it is as cruel as death said arbuthnot it is as hard as life that such a thing is possiblethat the bread and home and hopes of any honest human creature should be used as the small change of power above him and trafficked with to sustain that power and fix it in its place to make the most of itself and its greed is the burning shame and burden which is slung around our necks and will keep us from standing with heads erect until we are lightened of it he discovered that he was in earnest and recklessly allowed himself to continue in earnest until he had said his say he knew the selfindulgence was indiscreet and felt the indiscretion all the more when he ended and found himself confronted by mrs sylvestres eyes they were fixed upon him and wore an expression he had never had the pleasure of seeing in them before it was an expression full of charming emotion and the color was coming and going in her cheek go on she said rather tremulously if you please i did not go on he replied i regret to say i couldnt i was unable to tell him what i should do but you tried to comfort him said agnes i am sure you did what you could it was very little said laurence i let him talk and led him on a little towell to talking about his wife it seemed the only thing at the moment i found it possible to recall to his mind one or two things he had told me of herprobably doing it in a most inefficient mannerbut he appeared to appreciate the effort the idea presented itself to me that it would be well to brace him up and give him a less deathly look before he went home to her as she was not very well and a childish creature at best i probably encouraged him unduly but i had an absurd sense of being somehow responsible for the preservation of the two rooms and the peace of mind of the female infant and the truth is i have felt it ever since and so has she he was extremely conscious of mrs sylvestres soft and earnest eyes that was the reason she called to see me tonight and finding i had just left the house followed me tom is illhis name is tom bosworth it is nearly two months since he lost his place and he has walked himself to a shadow in making efforts to gain another he has written letters and presented letters he has stood outside doors until he was faint with hunger he has interviewed members of congress senators heads of departments officials great and small he has hoped and longed and waited and taken buffetings meekly he is not a strong fellow and it has broken him up he has had several chills and is thin and nervous and excitable kittyhis wifes name is kittyis pale and thin too she has lost her dimples and her eyes look like a sad little owls and always have tears in them which she manages to keep from falling so long as tom is within sight tonight she wanted to ask me if i knew any ladies who would give her sewing she thinks she might sew until tom gets a place again i will give her sewing exclaimed agnes i can do something for them if they will let me oh i am very glad that i can i felt sure you would be said arbuthnot i thought of you at once and wished you could see her as i saw her she answered him a little hurriedly and he wondered why her voice faltered i will see her tomorrow she said if you will give me the address i have naturally wondered if it was possible that anything could be done for the husband he said if you could use your influence in any wayyou see how inevitably we come to that it always becomes a question of influence our very charities are of the nature of schemes it is in the air we breathe i will do what i can she replied i will do anythinganything you think would be best mrs merriam checked herself on the very verge of looking up but though by an effort she confined herself to apparently giving all her attention to her knittingneedles for a few moments she lost the effect of neither words nor voice no she made mental comment it was not malaria arbuthnot had never passed such an evening in the house as this one proved to be and he had spent many agreeable evenings there tonight there was a difference some barrier had melted or suddenly broken down mrs sylvestre was more beautiful than he had ever seen her it thrilled his very soul to hear her speak to him and to look at her while still entirely ignorant of the cause of her displeasure against him he knew that it was removed that in some mysterious way she had recognized the injustice of it and was impelled by a sweet generous penitence to endeavor to make atonement there was something almost like the humility of appeal in her voice and eyes she did not leave him to mrs merriam but talked to him herself when he went away after he had left her at the parlor door she lingered a moment upon the threshold then crossed it and followed him into the hall they had been speaking of the bosworths and he fancied she was going to ask some last question but she did not she simply paused a short distance from where he stood and looked at him he had often observed it in her that she possessed the inestimable gift of being able to stand still and remain silent with perfect grace in such a manner that speech and movement seemed unnecessary but he felt that she had something to say now and scarcely knew how best to say it and it occurred to him that he might perhaps help her you are very much better than you were when i came in he said she put out her hand with a gentle almost grateful gesture yes i am much better she said i was not wellor happy i thought that i had met with a misfortune but it was a mistake i am glad it was a mistake he answered i hope such things will always prove so and a quick flush rising to his face he bent and touched with his lips the slim white fingers lying upon his palm the flush had not died away when he found himself in the street he felt its glow with a sense of anger and impatience i might have known better than to do such a thing he said i did know better i am a fool yet it seemsa fool but notwithstanding this the evening was a landmark from that time forward mrs merriam looked upon the intimacy with renewed interest she found agnes very attractive in the new attitude she assumed toward their acquaintance she indulged no longer in her old habit of depreciating him delicately when she spoke of him which was rarely her tone suggested to her relative that she was desirous of atoning to herself for her past coldness and injustice there was a delicious hint of this in her manner toward him quiet as it was once or twice mrs merriam had seen her defer to him and display a disposition to adapt herself to his opinions which caused a smile to flicker across her discreet countenance their mutual interest in their protges was a tie between them and developed a degree of intimacy which had never before existed the day after hearing their story agnes had paid the young people a visit the two rooms in the third story of a boardinghouse presented their modest household goods to her very touchingly the very bridal newness of the cheap furniture struck her as being pathetic and the unsophisticated adornments in the form of chromos and bright tidiesthe last kittys own handiworkexpressed to her mind their innocent sentiment kitty looked new herself as she sat sewing in a little rockingchair drawn near to the sofa on which tom lay flushed and brighteyed after his chill but there were premonitory signs of wear on her pretty childish face she rose evidently terribly nervous and very much frightened at the prospect of receiving her visitor when mrs sylvestre entered and though reassured somewhat by the mention of arbuthnots name glanced timorously at tom in appeal for assistance from him tom gave it his ingenuous mind knew very little fear he tried to stagger to his feet smiling but was so dizzy that he made an ignominious failure and sat down again at agnes earnest request thank you he said i will if you dont mind its one of my bad days and the fever makes my head go round dont look so downhearted kitty mrs sylvestre knows chills dont count for much you see he said to agnes with an effort at buoyancy of manner they knock a man over a little and it frightens her agnes took a seat beside the little rockingchair and there was something in the very gentleness of her movements which somewhat calmed kittys tremor it is very natural that she should feel anxious even when there is only slight cause mrs sylvestre said in her low sweet voice of course the cause is slight in your case it is only necessary that you should be a little careful thats all responded tom a man with a wife and home cant be too careful hes got others to think of besides himself but notwithstanding his cheerfulness and his bright eyes he was plainly weaker than he realized and was rather glad to lie down again though he did it apologetically mr arbuthnot came in this morning and told us you were coming he said you know him pretty well i suppose i see him rather frequently answered agnes but perhaps i do not know him very well ah said tom youve got to know him very well to find out what sort of fellow he is youve got to know him as i know himas we know him eh kitty yes responded kitty a little startled by finding herself referred to only you know him best tom you see youre a man yes said tom with innocent complacency of course its easier for men to understand each other you seeto agnes though with a fond glance at kittykitty was a little afraid of him shes shy and hasnt seen much of the world and hes such a swell in a quiet way and when she used to come to the office for me and caught a glimpse of him she thought he was always making fun of everything i thought he looked as if he was put in kitty and his voice sounded that way when he spoke to you tom i even used to think sometimes that he was laughing a little at youand i didnt like it bless you responded tom he wasnt thinking of such a thing hes got too much principle to make friends with a fellow and then laugh at him what ive always liked in him was his principle i think there are a great many things to like in him said mrs sylvestre theres everything to like in him said tom though you see i didnt find that out at first the truth is i thought he was rather too much of a swell for his means ive told him so since weve been more intimate and he said that i was not mistaken that he was too much of a swell for his means but that was the fault of his means and the government ought to attend to it as a sacred duty you see the trouble is he hasnt a family and what a fellow he would be to take care of a woman i told him that too once and he threw back his head and laughed but he didnt laugh long it seemed to me that it set him off thinking he was so still after it hed be very good to his wife said kitty timidly hes very kind to me yes tom went on rejoicing in himself he sees things that men dont see generally think of his noticing that you werent wrapped up enough that cold day we met him and going into his place to get a shawl from his landlady and making me put it on and dont you remember said kitty the day he made me so ashamed because he said my basket was too heavy and would carry it all the way home for me tom laughed triumphantly he would have carried a stovepipe just the same way he said and have looked just as cool about it youd no need to be ashamed he wasnt and its not only that see how he asks me about you and cheers me up and helps me along by talking to me about you when im knocked over and says that you mustnt be troubled and i must bear up because ive got you to take care of and that when two people are as fond of each other as we are theyve got something to hold on to that will help them to let the world go by and endure anything that dont part them he said that to me too tom said kitty the ready tears starting to her eyes he said it last night when i met him on the street and couldnt help crying because you were ill he said i must bear up for youand he was so nice that i forgot to be afraid of him at all when i began to cry it frightened me because i thought he wouldnt like it and that made it so much worse that i couldnt stop and he just put my hand on his arm and took me into lafayette park where there was a seat in a dark corner under the trees and he made me sit down and said dont be afraid to cry it will do you good and you had better do it before me than before tom cry as much as you like i will walk away a few steps until you are better and he did and i cried until i was quiet and then he came back to me and told me about mrs sylvestre hes got feelings said tom a trifle brokenlyhes got feelings andand principles it makes a man think better of the world even when hes discouraged and its dealt hard with him mrs sylvestre looked out of the nearest window there was a very feminine tremor in her throat and something seemed to be melting before her eyes she was full of the pain of regret and repentance there rose in her mind a picture of herself as she had sat before the fire in her silent room she could not endure the memory of her own bitter contempt and scorn she wished she might do something to make up for that half hour she wished that it were possible that she might drive down to the treasury and present herself at a certain door and appeal for pardon with downcast eyes and broken voice she was glad to remember the light touch upon her hand even though it had been so very light and he had left her after it so hurriedly i am glad he spoke to you of me she said ii am grateful to him i think i can help you i hope you will let me i know a great many people and i might ask for their influence i will do anythinganything mr arbuthnot thinks best tom gave her a warmly grateful glance his susceptible heart greatly moved by the sweetness and tremor of her voice she was just the woman it seemed to him to be the friend of such a man as his hero only a woman as beautiful as sympathetic and having that delicate undefinable air of belonging to the great enchanted world in which he confidingly believed arbuthnot figured with unrivalled effect could be worthy of him it was characteristic of his simple nature that he should admire immensely his friends social popularity and acquirements and dwell upon their unbounded splendor with affectionate reverence hes a society fellow he had said to kitty in his first description of him a regular society fellow always dressed just so you knowsort of quiet style but exactly up to the mark he knows everybody and gets invited everywhere though he makes believe he only gets taken in because he can dance and wait in the supperroom hes out somewhere every night bless you and spends half his salary on kid gloves and flowers he says people ought to supply them to fellows like him as they supply gloves and hatbands at english funerals he doesnt save anything you know he cant and he knows its a mistake but you see when a fellow is what he is its not easy to break off with everything these society people want such fellows and they will have them it had been this liberal description of his exalted position and elegant habits which had caused kitty to stand greatly in awe of him at the outset and to feel that her bearing would never stand the test of criticism by so proficient an expert and she had trembled before him accordingly and felt herself unworthy of his condescending notice until having on one or two occasions seen something in his manner which did not exactly coincide with her conception of him as a luxurious and haughty worldling she had gained a little courage she had been greatly alarmed at the sight of mrs sylvestre feeling vaguely that she also was a part of these mysterious splendors but after she heard the soft break in the tone in which she said with such gentle simplicity i will do anythinganythingmr arbuthnot thinks best she felt timorous no more and allowed herself to be led into telling her little story with a girlish pathos which would have melted agnes sylvestres heart if it had not been melted already it might perhaps better have been called toms story than her own as it was all about tomtoms struggles toms disappointments toms hopes which all seemed prostrated the little house tom had been thinking of buying and making nice for her the member of congress who had snubbed tom the senator who had been rough with him the cold he had taken the chills and fevers which had resulted the pain in his side we have used all our money she ended with a touching little catch of her breathif it had not been for mr arbuthnotmr arbuthnot yes said tom wofully hell have to go without a pair or so of gloves this month and smoke fewer cigars and i couldnt have believed that there was a man living i could have borne to take money from but somehow he made it seem almost as if he owed it to me when mrs sylvestre went away she left hope and comfort behind her kitty followed her into the passage with new light in her eyes if i have the sewing she said clasping her hands it will be such a load off toms mind to know that we have a little money that he will get better and he knows i like sewing so perhaps he will not mind it so much i am so thankful to you if tom will only get well she exclaimed in a broken whisperif tom will only get well and suddenly in response to some look on agnes face and a quick caressing gesture she leaned forward and was folded in her arms it is very natural to most women to resort to the simple feminine device of tears but it was not often mrs sylvestre so indulged herself and there were tears in her eyes and in her voice too as she held the gentle childish creature to her breast she had felt a great deal during the last twentyfour hours and the momentary display of emotion was a relief to her he will get better she said with almost maternal tenderness and you must help him by taking care of yourself and giving him no cause for anxiety you must let me help to take care of you we will do all we canand there was something akin to fresh relief to her in the mere use of the little word we chapter xxx mrs merriam saw faint traces of tears in mrs sylvestres eyes when she returned from her call on the bosworths and speculated with some wonder as to what her exact mental condition was but asked very few questions feeling that upon the whole she would prefer to hear the version of the story given to mr arbuthnot when he called he did so the following evening and having seen the bosworths in the interval had comments of his own to make it was very good in you to call so soon he said to agnes i wished very much to call she replied i could not have waited longer you left a transcendent impression said arbuthnot tom was very enthusiastic and kitty feels that all their troubles are things of the past they talked to me a great deal of you said agnes i felt after hearing them that i had not known you very welland wished that i had known you better she said it with a sweet gravity which he found strangely disturbing but his reply did not commit him to any special feeling they will prove fatal to me i see he said dont allow them to prejudice you against me in that manner i wish she said that my friends might be prejudiced against me in the same way then he revealed a touch of earnestness in spite of himself they had both been standing upon the hearth and he took a step toward her for pitys sake he said dont overrate me women are always too generous dont you see you will find me out and then it will be worse for me than before she stood in one of her perfect motionless attitudes and looked down at the rug i wish to find you out she said slowly i have done you injustice and then she turned away and walked across the room to a table where there were some books and when she returned she brought one of them with her and began to speak of it he always felt afterward that the memory of this injustice as she called it was constantly before her and he would have been more than human if he had not frequently wondered what it was he could not help feeling that it had taken a definite form and that she had been betrayed into it on the evening he had first spoken to her of the bosworths and that somehow his story had saved him in her eyes but he naturally forbore to ask questions or even touch upon the subject and thanked the gods for the good which befell him as a result of the evil he had escaped and yet as the time passed by and he went oftener to the house and found keener pleasure in each visit he had his seasons of fearing that it was not all going to be gain for him when he faced the truth indeed he knew that it was not all gain and yet he was not stoic enough to turn his back and fly it will cost he said to himself it will cost but and then he would set his lips together and be silent for an hour or so and those of his acquaintance who demanded constant vivacity from him began to wonder among themselves if he was quite the fellow he had been if the friendship was pleasant during the season it was pleasanter when the gayeties ceased and the spring set in with warmer air and sunshine and leaves and blossoms in the parks there was a softness in the atmosphere not conducive to sternness of purpose and selfdenial as he walked to and from his office he found his thoughts wandering in paths he felt were dangerous and once unexpectedly meeting mrs sylvestre when so indulging himself he started and gained such sudden color that she flushed also and having stopped to speak to him forgot what she had intended to say and was a little angry both with herself and him when a confusing pause followed their greeting their interest in the bosworths was a tie between them which gave them much in common agnes went to see them often and took charge of kitty watching over and caring for her in a tender halfmaternal fashion arbuthnot took private pleasure in contemplating he liked to hear kitty talk about her and indeed had on more than one occasion led her with some dexterity into doing so it was through kitty at last that his mystery was solved for him this happened in the spring there had been several warm days one so unusually warm at last that in the evening mrs sylvestre accepted his invitation to spend an hour or so on the river with him on their way there they stopped to leave a basket of fruit for tom whose condition was far from being what they had hoped for and while making their call kitty made a remark which caused arbuthnots pulse to accelerate its pace somewhat when you saw me crying on the street that night she began addressing agnes arbuthnot turned upon her quickly what night he asked the night you took me into lafayette square said kitty mrs sylvestre saw me though i did not know it until yesterday she was going to call on mrs amory and arbuthnot looked at agnes he could not have forborne whatever the look had cost him the color came into her cheek and died out did you he demanded yes she answered and rose and walked to the window and stood there perfectly still arbuthnot did not hear the remainder of kittys remarks he replied to them blindly and as soon as possible left his chair and went to the window himself if you are ready perhaps we had better go he said they went out of the room and down the stairs in silence he wanted to give himself time to collect his thoughts and get the upper hand of a frantic feeling of passionate anger which had taken possession of him if he had spoken he might have said something savage which he would have repented afterward in sackcloth and ashes his sense of the injustice he had suffered however momentary at the hands of this woman whose opinion he cared for was natural masculine and fierce he saw everything in a flash and for a moment or so forgot all else in his bitterness of spirit but his usual coolness came to the rescue when this moment was past and he began to treat himself scornfully as was his custom there was no reason why she should not think ill of him circumstances evidently having been against him he said to himself she knew nothing specially good of him she had all grounds for regarding him as a creature with neither soul nor purpose nor particularly fixed principles and with no other object in life than the gratification of his fancies why should she believe in him against a rather black array in the form of facts it was not agreeable but why blame her he would not blame her or indulge in any such personal folly then he glanced at her and saw that the color had not come back to her face when he roused himself to utter a civil commonplace remark or so there was the sound of fatigue in her voice when she answered him and it was very low she did not seem inclined to talk and he had the consideration to leave her to herself as much as possible until they reached the boathouse he arranged her cushions and wraps in the boat with care and dexterity and when he took the oars felt that he had himself pretty well in hand the river was very quiet and the last glow of sunset red was slowly changing to twilight purple on the water a sickleshaped moon hung in the sky and somewhere farther up the shore a night bird was uttering brief plaintive cries agnes sat at the end of the boat with her face a little turned away as if she were listening to the sound arbuthnot wondered if she was and thought again that she looked tired and a little pathetic if he had known all her thoughts he would have felt the pathos in her eyes a thousand times more keenly she had a white hyacinth in her hand whose odor seemed to reach him more powerfully at each stroke of the oars and at last she turned and spoke looking down at the flower the saddest things that are left to one of a bitter experience she said in a low voice are the knowledge and distrust that come of it they are very natural results he replied briefly oh they are very hard she exclaimed they are very hard they leave a stain on all ones life andand it can never be wiped away sometimes i think it is impossible to be generousto be kindto trust at all her voice broke she put her hands up before her face and he saw her tremble one may have been innocent she said and have believedand thought no evilbut after one has been so stained he stopped rowing there is no stain he said dont call it one it must be one she said when one sees evil and is suspicious and on the alert to discover wrong but it brings suffering as if it were a punishment i have suffered he paused a second and answered looking backward over his shoulder so did ifor a moment he said but it is over now dont think of me i must think of you she said how could i help it she turned a little more toward him and leaned forward the most exquisite appeal in her delicate face the most exquisite pathos in her unsteady voice if i ask you to forgive me she said you will only say that i was forgiven before i asked i know that i wish i could say something else i wishi wish i knew what to do he looked up the river and down and then suddenly at her the set miserable expression of his face startled her and caused her to make an involuntary movement dont do anythingdont say anything he said i can bear it better and he bent himself to his oars and rowed furiously she drew back and turned her face aside abrupt as the words were there was no rebuff in them but there was something else which silenced her effectually she was glad of the faint light and her heart quickened which last demonstration did not please her she had been calm too long to enjoy any new feeling of excitement she had liked the calmness and had desired beyond all things that it should remain undisturbed there is one prayer i pray every morning she had once said to bertha earnestly it is that the day may bring nothing to change the tone of my life she had felt a little ripple in the current ever since the eventful night and had regretted it sorely and now just for the moment it was something stronger so she was very still as she sat with averted face and the hour spent upon the water was a singularly silent one when they returned home they found colonel tredennis with mrs merriam but just on the point of leaving her i am going to see amory he said i have heard some news he will consider bad the westoria affair has been laid aside and will not be acted upon this session if at all it is said that blundel heard something he did not like and interfered and you think mr amory will be very much disappointed said agnes i am afraid so answered tredennis and yet said agnes it isnt easy to see why it should be of so much importance to him he has become interested in it said mrs merriam that is the expression isnt it it is my opinion that it would be better for him if he were less so i have seen that kind of thing before it is like being bitten by a tarantula she was not favorably inclined toward richard his sparkling moods did not exhilarate her and she had her private theories concerning his character tredennis she was very fond of few of his moods escaped her bright eyes few of the changes in him were lost upon her when he went away this evening she spoke of him to agnes and arbuthnot if that splendid fellow does not improve she said he will begin to grow old in his prime he is lean and gaunt his eyes are dreary he is beginning to have lines on his forehead and about his mouth he is enduring something i should be glad to be told what it is whatever he endured said agnes he would not tell people but i think enduring is a very good word how long have you known him mrs merriam asked of arbuthnot since the evening after his arrival in washington on his return from the west was the reply was he like this then rather sharply arbuthnot reflected i met him at a reception he said and he was not washingtonian in his manner my impression was that he would not enjoy our society and that he would finally despise us but he looked less fagged then than he does now perhaps he begins to long for his daily piute there are chasms which an effete civilization does not fill you guess more than you choose to tell was mrs merriams inward thought aloud she said he is the finest human being it has been my pleasure to meet he is the natural man if i were a girl again i think i should make a hero of him and be unhappy for his sake it would be easy to make a hero of him said agnes very responded arbuthnot unavoidable in fact and he laid upon the table the bit of hyacinth he had picked up in the boat and brought home with him if i carry it away was his private thought i shall fall into the habit of sitting and weakening my mind over it it is weak enough already but he knew at the same time that colonel tredennis had done something toward assisting him to form the resolution a trivial masculine vanity he thought not unfrequently strengthens ones position in the meantime tredennis went to amory he found him in the room which was in its every part so strong a reminder of bertha it wore a desolate look and amory had evidently been walking up and down it pushing chairs and footstools aside carelessly when he found them in his way he had thrown himself at last into berthas own special easychair and leaned back in it with his hands thrown out over its padded arms he had plainly not slept well the night before and his dress had a careless and dishevelled look very marked in its contrast with the customary artistic finish of his attire he sprang up when he saw tredennis and began to speak at once i say he exclaimed this is terrible you have been disappointed said tredennis i have been ruihe checked himself disappointed isnt the word he ended the whole thing has been laid asidelaid asidethink of it as if it were a mere nothing an application for a twopenny halfpenny pension great god what do the fellows think they are dealing with who do you think is to blame said the colonel stolidly blundel by joveblundel that fool and clown and he flung himself about the room mumbling his rage and irritation it is not the first time such a thing has happened said tredennis and it wont be the last if you continue to interest yourself in such matters you will find that out as others have done before you take my advice and give it up from this hour amory wheeled round upon him give it up he cried i cant give it up man it is only laid aside for the time being heaven and earth shall be moved next yearheaven and earth the thing wont failit cant faila thing like that a thing i have risked my very soul on he dashed his hand through his tumbled hair and threw himself into the chair again quite out of breath ah confound it he exclaimed i am too excitable i am losing my hold on myself tredennis rose from his seat feeling some movement necessary he stood and looked down at the floor as he gazed up at him amory entered a fretful mental protest against his size and his air of being able to control himself he was plainly deep in thought even when he spoke for his eyes did not leave the floor i suppose he said this is really no business of mine i wish it was what do you mean said amory tredennis looked up if it were my business i would know more about it he saidi would know what you mean and how deep you have gone into thisthis accursed scheme the last two words had a sudden ring of intensity in their sound which affected amory tremendously he sprang up again and began to pace the floor nothing ever promised so well he said and it will turn out all right in the endit must it is the delay that drives one wild it will be all right next seasonwhen bertha is here what has she to do with it demanded tredennis nothing very much said amory restively but she is effective do you mean that you are going to set her to lobbying why should you call it that i am not going to set her at anything she has a good effect that is all planefield swears that if she had stayed at home and taken blundel in hand he would not have failed us tredennis looked at him stupefied he could get no grasp upon him he wondered if a heavy mental blow would affect him he tried it in despair do you know he said slowly what people are beginning to say about planefield they are always saying something of planefield he is the kind of man who is always spoken of then said tredennis there is all the more reason why his name should not be connected with that of an innocent woman what woman has been mentioned in connection with him it has been said more than once that he is in love withyour wife and that his infatuation is used to advance your interests richard stopped on his walk then it is a confoundedly stupid business he said angrily if she hears it she will never speak to him again perhaps she has heard it perhaps that was why she insisted on going away i thought there was something wrong at the time may i ask said tredennis how it strikes you me exclaimed richard as the most awkward piece of business in the world and as likely to do me more harm than anything else could he made a graceful rapid gesture of impatience everything goes against me he said she never liked him from the first and if she has heard this she will never be civil to him again or to any of the rest of them and of course she is an influence in a measure what clever woman is not and why should she not use her influence in one way as well as another if she were a clergymans wife she would work hard enough to gain favors it is only a trifle that she should make an effort to be agreeable to men who will be pleased by her civility she would do it if there were nothing to be gained where are you going what is the matter for tredennis had walked to the table and taken his hat i am going into the air he answered i am afraid i cannot be of any use to you tonight my mind is not very clear just now i must have time to think you look pale said amory staring at him you look ghastly you have not been up to the mark for months i have seen that washington does not agree with you that is it was tredennis response washington does not agree with me and he carried his hat and his pale and haggard countenance out into the night and left richard gazing after him feverish fretted thwarted in his desire to pour forth his grievances and defend himself and also filled with baffled amazement at his sudden departure chapter xxxi mrs amory did not receive on new years day the season had well set in before she arrived in washington one morning in january mrs sylvestre sitting alone reading caught sight of the little coup as it drew up before the carriagestep and laying aside her book reached the parlor door in time to meet bertha as she entered it she took both her hands and drew her toward the fire still holding them why did i not know you had returned she said when did you arrive last night bertha answered you see i come to you early it was a cold day and she was muffled in velvet and furs she sat down loosened her wrap and let it slip backward and as its sumptuous fulness left her figure it revealed it slender to fragility and showed that the outline of her cheek had lost all its roundness she smiled faintly meeting agnes anxious eyes dont look at me she said i am not pretty i have been ill you heard i was not well in newport it was a sort of low fever and i am not entirely well yet malaria you know is always troublesome but you are very well yes i am well agnes replied and you begin to like washington again i began last winter how did you enjoy the spring you were here until the end of june it was lovely and now you are here once more and how pretty everything about you is bertha said glancing around the room and you are ready to be happy all winter until june again do you know you look happy not excitably happy but gently calmly happy as if the present were enough for you it is said agnes i dont think i want any future it would be as well to abolish it if one could bertha answered but it comesit comes she sat and looked at the fire a few seconds under the soft shadow of her lashes and then spoke again as for me she said i am going to give dinnerparties to senator planefields friends bertha exclaimed agnes yes said bertha nodding gently it appears somehow that richard belongs to senator planefield and as i belong to richard why you see she ended with a dramatic little gesture and looked at agnes once more it took me some time to understand it she said i am not quite sure that i understand it quite thoroughly even now it is a little puzzling or perhaps i am dull of comprehension at all events richard has talked to me a great deal it is plainly my duty to be agreeable and hospitable to the people he wishes to please and bring in contact with each other and those people asked agnes they are political men they are members of committees members of the house members of the senate and their only claim to existence in our eyes is that they are either in favor of or opposed to a certain bill not indirectly connected with the welfare of the owners of westoria lands bertha said agnes quickly you are not yourself thank you was the response that is always satisfactory but the compliment would be more definite if you told me who i happened to be but i can tell you that i am that glittering being the female lobbyist i used to wonder last winter if i was not on the verge of it but now i know i wonder if they all begin as innocently as i did and find the descentisnt it a descentas easy and natural i feel queer but not exactly disreputable it is merely a matter of being a dutiful wife and smiling upon one set of men instead of another still i am slightly uncertain as to just how disreputable i am i was beginning to be quite reconciled to my atmosphere until i saw colonel tredennis and i confess he unsettled my mind and embarrassed me a little in my decision you have seen him already accidentally yes he did not know i had returned and came to see richard he is quite intimate with richard now he entered the parlor and found me there i do not think he was glad to see me i left him very soon she drew off her glove and smoothed it out upon her knee with a thin and fragile little hand upon which the rings hung loosely agnes bent forward and involuntarily laid her own hand upon it dear she said bertha hurriedly lifted her eyes what i wish to say she said was that the week after next we give a little dinner to senator blundel and i wanted to be sure i might count on you if you are thereand colonel tredennisyou will give it an unprofessional aspect which is what we want but perhaps you will refuse to come bertha said mrs sylvestre i will be with you at any timeat all timesyou wish for or need me yes said bertha reflecting upon her a moment i think you would she got up and kissed her lightly and without effusion and then agnes rose too and they stood together you were always good bertha said i think life has made you better instead of worse it is not so always things are so differenteverything seems to depend upon circumstances what is good in me would be far enough from your standards to be called wickedness she paused abruptly and agnes felt that she did so to place a check upon herself she had seen her do it before when she spoke again it was in an entirely different tone and the remaining halfhour of her visit was spent in the discussion of everyday subjects agnes listened and replied to her with a sense of actual anguish she could have borne better to have seen her less selfcontrolled or she fancied so at least the summer had made an alteration in her which it was almost impossible to describe every moment revealed some new sad change in her and yet she sat and talked commonplaces and was bright and witty and epigrammatic until the last when we get our bill through she said with a little smile just before her departure i am to go abroad for a yearfor two for three if i wish i think that is the bribe which has been offered me one must always be bribed you know as she stood at the window watching the carriage drive away agnes was conscious of a depression which was very hard to bear the brightness of her own atmosphere seemed to have become heavythe sun hid itself behind the drifting wintry cloudsshe glanced around her room with a sense of dreariness something carried her back to the memories which were the one burden of her present life such grief cannot enter a room and not leave its shadow behind it she said and she put her hand against the windowside and leaned her brow upon it sadly it was curious she thought the moment after that the mere sight of a familiar figure should bring such a sense of comfort with it as did the sight of the one she saw approaching it was that of laurence arbuthnot who came with a business communication for mrs merriam having been enabled by chance to leave his work for an hour he held a roll of music in one hand and a bunch of violets in the other and when he entered the room was accompanied by the fresh fragrance of the latter offering agnes made a swift involuntary movement toward him ah she said i could scarcely believe that it was you he detected the emotion in her manner and tone at once something has disturbed you he said what is it i have seen bertha she answered and the words had a sound of appeal in them which she herself no more realized or understood than she comprehended the impulse which impelled her to speak she has been here she looks so illso worn everything is so sad i she stopped and stood looking at him must i go away he said quietly perhaps you would prefer to be alone i understand what you mean i think oh no she said impulsively putting out her hand dont go i am unhappy it wasit was a relief to see you and when she sank on the sofa he took a seat near her and laid the violets on her lap and there was a faint flush on his face the little dinner which was the first occasion of senator blundels introduction to the amory establishment was a decided success we will make it a success bertha had said it must be one and there was a ring in her voice which was a great relief to her husband it will be one he said there is no fear of your failing when you begin in this way and his spirits rose to such an extent that he became genial and fascinating once more and almost forgot his late trials and uncertainties he had always felt great confidence in bertha on the afternoon of the eventful day bertha did not go out she spent the hours between luncheon and the time for dressing with her children once as he passed the open door of the nursery richard saw her sitting upon the carpet building a house of cards while jack and janey and meg sat about her enchanted a braid of her hair had become loosened and hung over her shoulder her cheeks were flushed by the fire she looked almost like a child herself with her air of serious absorbed interest in the frail structure growing beneath her hands wont that tire you richard asked she glanced up with a smile no she said it will rest me he heard her singing to them afterward and later when she went to her dressingroom he heard the pretty lullaby die away gradually as she moved through the corridor when she appeared again she was dressed for dinner and came in buttoning her glove and at the sight of her he uttered an exclamation of pleasure what a perfect dress he said what is the idea there must be one she paused and turned slowly round so that he might obtain the full effect you should detect it she replied it is meant to convey one it has a kind of dovelike look he said she faced him again that is it she said serenely in the true artist spirit i have attired myself with a view to expressing the perfect candor and simplicity of my nature should you find it possible to fear or suspect me of ulterior motivesif you were a senator for instance ah come now said richard not quite so easily that is nonsense you have no ulterior motives she opened her plumy dovecolored fan and came nearer him there is nothing meretricious about me she said i am softly clad in dove color a few clusters of pansies adorn me i am covered from throat to wrists i have not a jewel about me could the effect be better no it could not he replied but suddenly he felt a trifle uncomfortable again and wondered what was hidden behind the inscrutable little gaze she afterwards fixed upon the fire but when blundel appeared which he did rather early he felt relieved again nothing could have been prettier than her greeting of him or more perfect in its attainment of the object of setting him at his ease it must be confessed that he was not entirely at his ease when he entered his experience not having been of a nature to develop in him any latent love for general society he had fought too hard a fight to leave him much time to know women well and his superficial knowledge of them made him a trifle awkward as it occasionally renders other men astonishingly bold in a party of men all his gifts displayed themselves in the presence of women he was afraid that less substantial fellows had the advantage of himmen who could not tell half so good a story or make half so exhilarating a joke as to this special dinner he had not been particularly anxious to count himself among the guests and was not very certain as to how planefield had beguiled him into accepting the invitation but ten minutes after he had entered the room he began to feel mollified outside the night was wet and unpleasant and not calculated to improve a mans temper the parlors glowing with firelight and twinkling wax candles were a vivid and agreeable contrast to the sloppy rawness the slender dovecolored figure with its soft trailing draperies assumed more definitely pleasant proportions and in his vague inexperienced middleaged fashion he felt the effect of it she had a nice way this little woman he decided no nonsense or airs and graces about her an easy manner a gay little laugh he did not remember exactly afterward what it was she said which first wakened him up but he found himself laughing and greatly amused and when he made a witticism he felt he had reason to be proud of the gay little peal of laughter which broke forth in response had the most amazingly exhilarating effect upon him and set him upon his feet for the evening women seldom got all the flavor of his jokes he had an idea that some of them were a little afraid of them and of him too the genuine mirth in berthas unstudied laughter was like wine to him and was better than the guffaws of a dozen men because it had a finer and a novel flavor after the joke and the laugh the ice was melted and he knew that he was in the humor to distinguish himself planefield discovered this the moment he saw him and glanced at richard who was brilliant with good spirits shes begun well he said when he had an opportunity to speak to him i never saw him in a better humor shes pleased him somehow women dont touch him usually she will end better said richard he pleases her he did not displease her at all events she saw the force and humor of his stalwart jokes and was impressed by the shrewd businesslike goodnature which betrayed nothing when he began to enjoy himself she liked the genuineness of his enjoyment all the more because it was a personal matter with him and he seemed to revel in it he enjoys himself was her mental comment really himself not exactly the rest of us except as we stimulate him and make him say good things among the chief of her gifts had always been counted the power of stimulating people and making them say their best things and she made the most of this power now she listened with her brightest look she uttered her little exclamations of pleasure and interest at exactly the right moment and the gay ring of her spontaneous sounding laugh was perfection miss varien who was one of her guests sat and regarded her with untempered admiration your wife she said to amory in an undertone is simply incomparable it is not necessary to tell you that of course but it strikes me with fresh force this evening she really seems to enjoy things that air of gay candid delight is irresistible it makes her seem to that man like a charming little girla harmless bright sympathetic little girl how he likes her when she went in to dinner with him and he sat by her side he liked her still more he had never been in better spirits in his life he had never said so many things worth remembering he had never heard such sparkling and vivacious talk as went on round this particular table it never paused or lagged there was amory all alight and stirred by every conversational ripple which passed him there was miss varien scintillating and casting off showers of sparks in the prettiest and most careless fashion there was laurence arbuthnot doing his share without any apparent effort and appreciating his neighbors to the full there was mrs sylvestre her beautiful eyes making speech almost superfluous and mrs merriam occasionally casting into the pool some neatly weighted pebble which sent its circles to the shore and in the midst of the coruscations blundel found himself somehow doing quite his portion of the illumination really these people and their dinnerparty pleased him wonderfully well and he was far from sorry that he had come and far from sure that he should not come again if he were asked he was shrewd enough too to see how much the success of everything depended upon his own little companion at the head of the table and respecting success beyond all things after the manner of his kind he liked her all the better for it there was something about her which as miss varien had said made him feel that she was like a bright sympathetic little girl and engendered a feeling of fatherly patronage which was entirely comfortable but though she rather led others to talk than talked herself he noticed that she said a sharp thing now and then and he liked that too and was greatly amused by it he liked women to be sharp if they were not keen enough to interfere with masculine prerogatives there was only one person in the company he did not find exhilarating and that was a large brownfaced fellow who sat next to mrs merriam and said less than might have been expected of him though when he spoke his remarks were well enough in their way blundel mentioned him afterward to bertha when they returned to the parlor that colonel who is he he asked her i didnt catch his name exactly handsome fellow but hed be handsomer if it is the part of wisdom to stop you said bertha and tell you that he is a sort of cousin of mine and his perfections are such as i regard with awe his name is colonel tredennis and you have read of him in the newspapers what he exclaimed turning his sharp little eyes upon tredennisthe indian man im glad you told me that i want to talk to him and an opportunity being given him he proceeded to do so with much animation ruffling his stiff hair up at intervals in his interest his little eyes twinkling like those of some alert animal he left the house late and in the best of humors he had forgotten for the time being all questions of bills and subsidies nothing had occurred to remind him of such subjects their very existence seemed a trifle problematical or rather perhaps it seemed desirable that it should be so i feel he said to planefield as he was shrugging himself into his overcoat as if i had rather missed it by not coming here before you were asked answered planefield so i was he replied attacking the top button of the overcoat well the next time i am asked i suppose i shall come then he gave his attention to the rest of the buttons a man in public life ought to see all sides of his public he said having disposed of the last one said some good things didnt they the little woman isnt without a mind of her own either when is it she receives thursdays said planefield ah thursdays and they went out in company her guests having all departed bertha remained for a few minutes in the parlor arbuthnot and tredennis went out last and as the door closed upon them she looked at richard well she said well exclaimed richard it could not have been better couldnt it she said looking down a little meditatively no he responded with excellent good cheer and you see how simple it was andand how unnecessary it is to exaggerate it and call it by unpleasant names what we want is merely to come in contact with these people and show them how perfectly harmless we are and that when the time comes they may favor us without injury to themselves or any one else thats it in a nutshell we always say us dont we said berthaas if we were partproprietors of the westoria lands ourselves it is a little confusing dont you think so she paused and looked up with one of her sudden smiles still i dont feel exactly sure that i have beenbut no i am not to call it lobbying am i what must i call it it really ought to have a name dont call it anything said richard faintly conscious of his dubiousness again why what a good idea she answered what a good way of getting round a difficultynot to give it a name it almost obliterates it doesnt it it is an actual inspiration we wont call it anything there is so much in a nametoo much on the whole really butwithout giving it a namei have behaved pretty well and advanced ouryourwhose interests everybodys he replied with an effort at lightness mine particularly i own that my view of the matter is a purely selfish one there is a career before me you know if all goes well he detected at once the expression of gentleness which softened her eyes as she watched him you always wanted a career didnt you she said it isnt pleasant he said for a man to know that he is not a success if i can give you your career she said you shall have it richard it is a simpler thing than i thought after all and she went upstairs to her room stopping on the way to spend a few minutes in the nursery chapter xxxii the professor sat in his favorite chair by his library fire an open volume on his knee and his afterdinner glass of wine still unfinished on the table near him he had dined a couple of hours ago with mr arbuthnot who had entertained him very agreeably and had not long since left him to present himself upon some social scene it was of his departed guest that he was thinking as he pondered and of certain plans he had on hand for his ultimate welfare and his thoughts so deeply occupied him that he did not hear the sound of the doorbell which rang as he sat nor notice any other sound until the door of the room opened and some one entered he raised his head and looked around then uttering a slight ejaculation of surprise why bertha he said my dear this is unexpected he paused and gave her one of his gently curious looks she had thrown her cloak off as she came near him and something in her appearance attracted his attention my dear he said slowly you look tonight as you did years ago i am reminded of the time when philip first came to us i wonder why there was a low seat near his side and she came and took it it is the dress she said i was looking over some things i had laid aside and found it i put it on for old acquaintance sake i have never worn it since then perhaps i hoped it would make me feel like a girl again her tone was very quiet her whole manner was quiet the dress was simplicity itself a little lace kerchief was knotted about her throat that is a very feminine idea remarked the professor seeming to give it careful attention peculiarly feminine i should say anddoes it my dear not quite she answered a little when i first put it on and stood before the glass i forgot a good many things for a few moments and then suddenly i heard the childrens voices in the nursery and richard came in and bertha herrick was gone you know i was bertha herrick when i wore thisbertha herrick thinking of her first party yes my dear he responded ii remember there were a few moments of silence in which he looked abstractedly thoughtful but presently he bestirred himself by the by he said that reminds me didnt i understand that there was a great party somewhere tonight mr arbuthnot left me to go to it i think i thought there was a reason for my surprise at seeing you that was it surely you should have been at the great party instead of here well she replied i suppose i should but for some curious accident or otheri dont know what the accident is or how it happenedi should have had an invitationof course if it had chanced to reach me but something has occurred to prevent it doing so i suppose such things happen you know to all intents and purposes i have not been invited so i could not go and i am very glad i would rather be here i would rather have you here he returned if such seclusion pleases you but i can hardly imagine my dear how the party she put her hand on his caressingly it cannot be an entire success she said it wont in my absence but misfortunes befall even the magnificent and prosperous and the party must console itself i like to be herei like very much to be here he glanced at her gray dress again bertha herrick would have preferred the party he remarked bertha amory is wiser she said we will be quiet togetherand happy they were very quiet the thought occurred to the professor several times during the evening she kept her seat near him and talked to him speaking he noticed principally of her children and of the past the time she had spent at home before her marriage seemed to be present in her mind i wonder she said once thoughtfully what sort of girl i was i can only remember that i was such a happy girl do you remember that i was a specially selfindulgent or frivolous one but i am afraid you would not tell me if you did my dear he said in response you were a natural simple joyous creature and a great pleasure to us she gave his hand a little pressure i can remember that you were always good to me she said i used to think you were a little curious about me and wondered what i would do in the future now it is my turn to wonder if i am at all what you thought i would be he did not reply at once and then spoke slowly there seemed so many possibilities he said yes i thought it possible that you might bewhat you are it was as he said this that there returned to his mind the thought which had occupied it before her entrance he had been thinking then of something he wished to tell her before she heard it from other quarters and which he felt he could tell her at no more fitting time than when they were alone it was something relating to laurence arbuthnot and curiously enough she paved the way for it by mentioning him herself did you say laurence was here tonight she asked yes he replied he was so good as to dine with me he would say that you were so good as to invite him she said he is very fond of coming here i should miss him very much he returned if he should go away she looked up quickly attracted by his manner but there is no likelihood of his going away she said i think he answered that there may be and i wished to speak to you about it he refrained from looking at her he even delicately withdrew his hand so that if hers should lose its steadiness he might be unconscious of it go away she exclaimedfrom washington laurence why should you think so i cannot imagine such a thing he does not imagine it himself yet he replied i am going to suggest it to him her hand was still upon his knee and he felt her start you are she said why and how do you think he will go i do not believe he will i am not sure that he will he answered but i hope so and what i mean is that i think it may be possible to send him abroad she withdrew her hand from his knee he wont go she said i am sure of it he went on to explain himself still not looking at her he is wasting his abilities he said he is wasting his youth the position he is in is absurdly insignificant it occurred to me that if i used with right effect the little influence i possess there might finally be obtained for him some position abroad which would be at least something better and might possibly open a way for him in the future i spoke to the secretary of state about it and he was very kind and appeared interested it seems very possible even probable that my hopes will be realized for a few seconds she sat still then she said abstractedly it would be very strange to be obliged to live our lives without laurence they would not be the same lives at all still i suppose it would be best for him but it would be hard to live without laurence i dont like to think of it in spite of his intention not to do so he found himself turning to look at her there had been surprise in her voice and now there was sadness but there was no agitation no uncontrollable emotion can it be he thought that she is getting over it what does it mean she turned and met his eyes but whether it is for the best or not she said i dont believe he will go my dear he said you speak as if there was a reason i think there is a reason she answered and it is a strong one what is it he asked there is some one he is beginning to be fond of she replied that is the reason he kept his eyes fixed upon her some one he is beginning to be fond of he repeated i dont know how it will end she said i am sometimes afraid it can only end sadly but there is some one he would find it hard to leave i am sure the professor gradually rose in his chair until he was sitting upright i wish he said that you would tell me who it is i do not think he would mind your knowing she answered it seems strange you have not seen it is agnes sylvestre the professor sank back in his chair and looked at the bed of coals in the grate agnes sylvestre he exclaimed agnes sylvestre yes she said and in one sense it is very hard on him that it should be agnes sylvestre after all these years when he has steadily kept himself free from all love affairs and been so sure that nothing could tempt him it cannot be easy for him to know that he loves some one who has everything he has notall the things he feels he never will have he is very proud and very unrelenting in his statement of his own circumstances and he wont try to glaze them over when he compares them with hers he is too poor she is too richeven if she loved him even said the professor is it your opinion that she does not i do not know she answered it has seemed to me more probable thatthat she liked colonel tredennis i thought so said the professor i must confess that i thought so though perhaps that may have been because my feeling for him is so strong and i have seen that he that he was fond of her bertha put in as he paused to reflect i thought so he said again i thought i was sure of it he sees her often he thinks of her frequently it is plain he speaks of her to me he sees every charm and grace in her i have never heard him speak of any other woman so it would be a very suitable marriage said bertha i have felt that from the first there is no one more beautiful than agnesno one sweeterno one more fit she pushed her seat back from the hearth and rose from it the fire is too warm she said i have been sitting before it too long there was some icewater upon a side table and she went to it and poured out a glass and drank it slowly then she took a seat by the centretable and spoke again as she idly turned over the leaves of a magazine without looking at it when first agnes came here she said i thought of it i remember that when i presented philip to her i watched to see if she impressed him as she does most people she did said the professor i remember his speaking of it afterward and saying what a charm hers was and that her beauty must touch a mans best nature that was very good said bertha faintly smiling and it was very like him and since then she added you say he has spoken of her often in the same way and as he speaks of no one else again and again answered the professor the truth is my dear i am fond of speaking of her myself and have occasionally led him in that direction i have wished for him what you have wished and we have both of us she said half sadly been unkind to poor laurence she closed the magazine perhaps he will go after all she said he may see that it is best he may be glad to go before the year is ended she left her book and her chair i think i must go now she said i am a little tired he thought that she looked so and the shadow which for a moment had half lifted itself fell again no he thought she has not outlived it and this is more bitter for her than the rest it is only natural that it should be more bitter when he got up to bid her goodnight she put a hand upon either of his shoulders and kissed him i am glad i was not invited to the grand party dear she said i have liked this better it has been far better for me there were only a few yards of space between her fathers house and her own and in a few seconds she had ascended the steps and entered the door as she did so she heard richard in the parlor speaking rapidly and vehemently and entering found that he was talking to colonel tredennis the colonel was standing at one end of the room as if he had turned around with an abrupt movement richard was lying full length upon a sofa looking uneasy and excited his cushions tumbled about him they ceased speaking the moment they saw her and there was an odd pause noticing which she came forward and spoke with an effort at appearing at ease do you know that this seems like contention she said are you quarrelling with richard colonel tredennis or is he quarrelling with you and why are you not at the reception we are quarrelling with each other violently said richard with a half laugh you arrived barely in time to prevent our coming to blows and why are you not at the reception bertha turned to tredennis who for a moment seemed to have been struck dumb by the sight of her the memories the slender gray figure had brought to the professor rushed back upon him with a force that staggered him it was as if the ghost of something dead had suddenly appeared before him and he was compelled to hold himself as if he did not see it the little gray gown the carelessly knotted kerchiefit seemed so terrible to see them and to be forced to realize through them how changed she was he had never seen her look so ill and fragile as she did when she turned to him and spoke in her quiet unemotional voice this is the result of political machination she said he has forgotten that we were not invited being absorbed in affairs of state he no longer keeps an account of the doings of the giddy throng then he recovered himself you were not invited he said isnt there some mistake about that i thought your impression naturally was that we were the foundationstone of all social occasions she responded but this time they have dispensed with us we were not invited say that you did not receive your invitation put in richard restlessly the other way of stating it is nonsense she paused an instant as if his manner suggested a new thought to her i wonder she said slowly if there could be a reason but no i think that is impossible it must have been an accident but you she added to tredennis have not told me why you are not with the rest of the world i came away early he answered i was there for an hour he was glad that she did not sit down he wished that she would go away it would be better if she would go away and leave them to themselves again it was very gay i suppose she said and you saw agnes i have just left her he replied you ought to have stayed she said turning away with a smile it would have been better than quarrelling with richard and she went out of the room and left them together as he had told himself it would be best she should he did not look at her as she ascended the staircase he stood with his back to the open door and did not speak until he heard her go into the room above them then he addressed richard do you understand me now he said sternly this is the beginning the beginning exclaimed richard with a half frantic gesture if this is the beginningand things go wrongimagine what the end will be the room bertha had entered was the nursery in the room opening out of it jack and janey slept in their small beds upon the hearthrug lay a broken toy she bent to pick it up and afterward stood a moment holding it in her hand without seeing it she still held it as she sank into a chair which was near her i will stay here a while she said this is the best place for me for a few minutes she sat quite still something like a stupor had settled upon her she was thinking in a blind disconnected way of agnes sylvestre everything would be right at last agnes would be happy this was what she had wishedwhat she had intended from the firstwhen she had brought them together it was she who had brought them together and this was the plan she had had in her mind when she had done it and she had known what it would cost her even then and then there came back to her the memory of the moment when she had turned away from them to pour out laurences coffee with hands she could not hold still and whose tremor he saw and understood poor laurence he must suffer too poor laurence she looked down suddenly at the broken toy in her hand i will stay here more she said it is better here there is nothing else and if i were a good woman i should want nothing else if i had only not spoken to agnesthat was the mistake if she will only forget it some one should be happysome one it will be agnes she got up and went into the childrens room and knelt down by janeys bed laying the toy on the coverlet she put her arms around the child and spoke her name janey she said janey the child stirred opened her eyes and put an arm sleepily about her neck i said my prayers she murmured god bless mamma and papaand everybody god bless uncle philip bertha laid her face near her upon the pillow yes she said brokenly you belong to me and i belong to you i will stay here janeywith you chapter xxxiii sometimes during the winter when she glanced around her parlor on the evenings of her receptions bertha felt as if she was in a waking dreamso many people of whom she seemed to know nothing were gathered about her she saw strange faces on every side a new element had appeared which was gradually crowding out the old and she herself felt that she was almost a stranger in it day by day and by almost imperceptible degrees at first various mysterious duties had devolved upon her she had found herself calling at one house because the head of it was a member of a committee at another because its mistress was a person whose influence over her husband it would be well to consider she had issued an invitation here because the recipients must be pleased another there because somebody was to be biassed in the right direction the persons thus to be pleased and biassed were by no means invariably interesting there was a stalwart westerner or so who made themselves almost too readily at home an occasional rigid new englander who suspected a lack of purpose in the atmosphere and a stray southerner who exhibited a tendency towards a large and rather exhaustive gallantry as a rule too bertha was obliged to admit that she found the men more easily entertained than the women who were most of them new to their surroundings and privately determined to do themselves credit and not be imposed upon by appearances and when this was not the case were either timorously overpowered by a sense of their inadequacy to the situation or calmly intrenched behind a shield of impassive composure more discouraging than all else it was not always easy to enliven such material to be always ready with the right thing to say and do to understand as by inspiration the intricacies of every occasion and the requirements of every mental condition and while bertha spared no effort and used her every gift to the best of her ability the result even when comparatively successful was rather productive of exhaustion mental and physical they dont care about me she said to arbuthnot one night with a rueful laugh as she looked around her and i am always afraid of their privately suspecting that i dont care about them sometimes when i look at them i cannot help being overpowered by a sense of there being a kind of ludicrousness in it all do you know nearly every one of them has a reason for being here and it is never by any chance connected with my reason for inviting them i could give you some of the reasons shall i some of them are feminine reasons and some of them are masculine that woman at the end of the sofathe thin eagerlooking onecomes because she wishes to accustom herself to society her husband is a rising man and she is in love with him and has a hungry desire to keep pace with him the woman she is talking to has a husband who wants something senator planefield may be induced to give himand senator planefield is on his native heath here that showy little southern widow has a large claim against the government and comes because she sees people she thinks it best to know she is wanted because she has a favorite cousin who is given patriotically to opposing all measures not designed to benefit the south it is rather fantastic when you reflect upon it isnt it you know what i think about it without asking answered arbuthnot yes you have told me was her response but it will be all over before long and thenah there is senator blundel do you know it is always a relief to me when he comes and she went toward him with a brighter look than arbuthnot had seen her wear at any time during the entire evening it had taken her some time herself to decide why it was that she liked blundel and felt at ease with him in fact up to the present period she had scarcely done more than decide that she did like him she had not found his manner become more polished as their acquaintance progressed he was neither gallant nor accomplished he was always rather full of himself in a genuine masculine way he was blunt and by no means tactful but she had never objected to him from the first and after a while she had become conscious of feeling relief as she had put it to arbuthnot when his strong rather aggressive personality presented itself upon the scene he was not difficult to entertain at least finding in her the best of listeners he entertained himself by talking to her and by making sharp jokes at which they both laughed with equal appreciation he knew what to talk about too and what subjects to joke on and however apparently communicative his mood might be his opinions were always kept thriftily in hand he seems to talk a good deal richard said testily but after all you dont find out much of what he really thinks bertha had discovered this early in their acquaintance if the object in making the house attractive to him was that he might be led to commit himself in any way during his visits that object was scarcely attained when at last it appeared feasible to discuss the westoria lands project in his presence he showed no unwillingness to listen or to ask questions but the discussion being at an end if notes had been compared no one could have said that he had taken either side of the question hes balancing things planefield said i told you he would do it you may trust him not to speak until he has made up his mind which side of the scale the weight is on when these discussions were being carried on bertha had a fancy that he was more interested than he appeared outwardly several times she had observed that he asked her questions afterward which proved that no word had dropped on his ear unheeded and that he had for some reason best known to himself reflected upon all he had heard but their acquaintance had a side entirely untouched by worldly machinations and it was this aspect of it which bertha liked there was something homely and genuine about it he paid her no compliments he even occasionally found fault with her habits and what he regarded as the unnecessary conventionality of some of her surroundings but his goodnatured egotism never offended her a widower without family and immersed in political business he knew little of the comforts of home life he lived in two or three rooms full of papers books and pigeonholes and took his meals at a hotel he found this convenient if not luxurious and more than convenience it had never yet occurred to him to expect or demand but he was not too dull to appreciate the good which fell in his way and after spending an hour with the amorys on two or three occasions when he had left the scene of his political labors fagged and out of humor he began to find pleasure and relief in his unceremonious visits and looked forward to them there came an evening when bertha in looking over some music came upon a primitive ballad which proved to be among the recollections of his youth and she aroused him to enthusiasm by singing it his musical taste was not remarkable for its cultivation he was strongly in favor of pronounced melody and was disposed to regard a song as incomplete without a chorus but he enjoyed himself when his prejudices were pandered to and bertha rather respected his courageous if benighted frankness and his obstinate faith in his obsolete favorites so she sang ben bolt to him and the harp that once through taras halls and others far less classical and more florid and while she sang he sat ungracefully but comfortably by the fire his eyes twinkling less watchfully the rugged lines of his bluntfeatured face almost settling into repose and sometimes when she ended he roused himself with something like a sigh do you like it she would say does it make you forget the gentleman from indiana and the senator from connecticut i dont want to forget them he would reply with dogged goodhumor they are not the kind of fellows it is safe to forget but it makes my recollections of them more agreeable but after a while there were times when he was not in the best of humors and when bertha had a fancy that he was not entirely at ease or pleased with herself at such times his visits were brief and unsatisfactory and she frequently discovered that he regarded her with a restless and perturbed expression as if he was not quite certain of his own opinions of her he looks at me she said to richard as if he had moments of suspecting me of something nonsense said richard what could he suspect you of of nothing she answered i think that was what we agreed to call it but she never failed to shrink when the twinkling eyes rested upon her with the disturbed questioning in their glance and the consciousness of this shrinking was very bitter to her in secret when her guest approached her on the evening before referred to she detected at once that he was not in a condition of mind altogether unruffled the glances he cast on those about him were not encouraging and the few nods of recognition he bestowed were far from cordial his hair stood on end a trifle more aggressively than usual and his short stout body expressed a degree of general dissatisfaction which it was next to impossible to ignore bertha did not attempt to ignore it i will tell you something before you speak to me she said something has put you out of humor he gave her a sharp glance and then looked away over the heads of the crowd there is always enough to put a man out of humor he said what a lot of people you have here tonight what do they come for i have just been telling mr arbuthnot some of the reasons she answered they are very few of them good ones you came hoping to recover your spirits i came to look at you he said he was frequently blunt but there was a bluntness about this speech which surprised her she answered him with a laugh however i am always worth looking at she said and now you have seen me he was looking at her by this time and even more sharply than before it seemed as if he was bent upon reading in her face the answer to the question he had asked of it before but he evidently did not find it theres something wrong with you he said i dont know what it is i dont know what to make of you if you could make anything of me but bertha amory she replied you might do a service to society but that is out of the question and as to there being something wrong with me there is something wrong with all of us there is something wrong with mr arbuthnot he is not enjoying himself there is something wrong with senator planefield who has been gloomy all the evening planefield he said ah yes there he is here pretty often isnt he he is a great friend of richards she replied with discretion so i have heard he returned and then he gave his attention to planefield for a few minutes as if he found him also an object of deep interest after this inspection he turned to bertha again well he said i suppose you enjoy all this or you wouldnt do it you are not enjoying it she replied it does not exhilarate you as i hoped it would i am out of humor was his answer i told you so i have just heard something i dont like i dropped in here to stay five minutes and take a look at you and see if he checked himself and rubbed his upright hair impatiently almost angrily i am not sure that you mightnt be enjoying yourself better he said and i should like to know something more of you than i do if any information i can give youshe began come he said with a sudden effort at better humor that is the way you talk to planefield we are too good friends for that his shrewd eyes fixed themselves on her as if asking the unanswered question again come he said im a blunt oldfashioned fogy but we are good honest friendsand always have been she glanced across the room at richard who was talking to a stubborn opposer of the great measure and making himself delightful beyond description she wished for the moment that he was not quite so picturesque and animated then she gathered herself together i think we have been she said i hope you will believe so well he answered i shouldnt like to believe anything else she thought that perhaps he had said more than he originally intended he changed the subject abruptly made a few comments upon people near them asked a few questions and finally went away having scarcely spoken to any one but herself why did he not remain longer richard asked afterward when the guests were gone and they were talking the evening over he was not in the mood to meet people bertha replied he said he had heard something he did not like and it had put him out of humor i think it was something about me about you richard exclaimed why in heavens name about you his manner made me think so she answered coldly and it would not be at all unnatural i think we may begin to expect such things upon my word said richard starting up i think that is going rather far dont you seewith righteous indignationwhat an imputation you are casting on me do you suppose i would allow you to do anything thatthat she raised her eyes and met his with an unwavering glance certainly not she said quickly and his sentence remained unfinished not because he felt that his point had been admitted but because for some mysterious reason it suddenly became impossible for him to say more more than some of late when he had launched into one of his spasmodic defences of himself he had found himself checked by this intangible power in her uplifted eyes and he certainly did not feel his grievances the less for the experiences until during the last few months he had always counted it as one of his wifes chief charms that there was nothing complicated about her that her methods were as simple and direct as a childs it had never seemed necessary to explain her but he had not found this so of late he had even begun to feel that though there was no outward breach in the tenor of their lives an almost impalpable barrier had risen between them he expressed no wish she did not endeavor to gratify her manner toward himself with the exception of the fleeting moments when he had felt the check was entirely unchanged the spirit of her gayety ruled the house as it had always done and yet he was not always sure of the exact significance of her jests and laughter the jests were clever the laugh had a light ring but there was a difference which puzzled him and which because he recognized in it some vague connection with himself he tried in his moments of leisure to explain he had even spoken of it to colonel tredennis on occasions when his mood was confidential she used to be as frank as a child he said and have the lightest way in the world and i liked it i am a rather featherheaded fellow myself perhaps and it suited me but it is all gone now when she laughs i dont feel sure of her and when she is silent i begin to wonder what she is thinking of the thing she thought the words she said to herself oftenest were it will not last very long she said them over to herself at moments she could not have sustained herself under but for the consolation she found in them beyond this time when what she faced from day to day would be over she had not yet looked it is a curious thing she said to arbuthnot but i seem to have ceased even to think of the future i wonder sometimes if very old people do not feel soas if there was nothing more to happen there was another person who found the events of the present sufficient to exclude for the time being almost all thought of the future this person was colonel tredennis who had found his responsibilities increase upon him alsonot the least of these responsibilities being it must be confessed that intimacy with mr richard amory of which bertha had spoken he is very intimate with richard she had said and she had every reason for making the comment at first it had been the colonel who had made the advances for reasons of his own but later it had not been necessary for him to make advances having found relief in making his first reluctant halfconfidences richard had gradually fallen into making others when he had been overpowered by secret anxiety and nervous distrust of everything finding himself alone with the colonel and admiring and respecting above all things the selfcontrol he saw in hima selfcontrol which meant safety and silence under all temptations to betray the faintest shadow of a trust reposed in himit had been impossible for him to resist the impulse to speak of the trials which beset him and having once spoken of them it was again impossible not to go a little farther and say more than he had at first intended so he had gone on from one step to another until there had come a day when the colonel himself had checked him for an instant feeling it only the part of honor in the man who was the cooler of the two and who had nothing to risk or repent wait a moment he said remember that though i have not asked questions so far i am ready to hear anything you choose to say but dont tell me what you might wish you had kept back tomorrow the devil take it all cried richard dashing his fist on the table i must tell some one or i shall go mad but the misery which impelled him notwithstanding he always told his story in his own way and gave it a complexion more delicate than a less graceful historian might have been generous enough to bestow he had been too sanguine and enthusiastic he had made mistakes he had been led by the duplicity of a wily world into follies he had been unfortunate those more experienced than himself had betrayed the confidence it had been only natural he should repose in them and throughout the labyrinth of the relation he wound his waya graceful agile supple figure lightly avoiding an obstacle here dexterously overstepping a barrier there and untouched by any shadow but that of misfortune at first he spoke chiefly of the complications which bore heavily upon him and these complications arising entirely from the actions of others committed him to so little that the colonel listened with apprehension more grave than the open confession of greater blunders would have awakened in him he would tell more he thought if there were less to tell the grim fancy came to him sometimes as he listened that it was as if he watched a man circling about the edge of a volcano drawing nearer and nearer until at last in spite of himself and impelled by some dread necessity he must plunge headlong in and so richard circled about his crater sometimes drawn nearer by the emotion and excitement of the moment sometimes withdrawing a trifle through a caution as momentary but in each of his circlings revealing a little more of the truth the revelations were principally connected with the westoria lands scheme and were such in many instances as the colonel was not wholly unprepared to hear he had not looked on during the last year for nothing and often when richard had been in gay good spirits and had imagined himself telling nothing his silent companion had heard his pleasantries with forebodings which he could not control he was not deceived by any appearance of entire frankness and knew that he had not been told all until one dark and stormy night as he sat in his room richard was announced and came in pallid haggard beaten by the rain and at the lowest ebb of depression he had had a hard and bitter day of it and it had followed several others quite as hard and bitter he had been fagging about the capitol going the old rounds using the old arguments trying new ones overcoming one obstacle only to find himself confronted with another feeling that he was losing ground where it was a matter of life and death that he should gain it spirits and courage deserting him just when he needed them most and all this being over he dropped into his office to find awaiting him there letters containing news which gave the final blow he sat down by the table and began his outpourings graceful attractive injured the colonel thought him so as he watched him and listened recognizing meanwhile the incompleteness of his recital and making up his mind that the time had come when it was safer that the whole truth should be told in the hours in which he had pondered upon the subject he gradually decided that such an occasion would arrive and here it was so at a certain fitting juncture just as richard was lightly skirting a delicate point tredennis leaned forward and laid his open hand on the table with a curious simplicity of gesture i think he said you had better tell me the whole story you have never done it yet what do you say the boarder on the floor below who had heard him walking to and fro on the first new years night he had spent in washington and on many a night since heard his firm regular tread again during the half hour in which richard told in fitful outbursts what he had not found himself equal to telling before it was not easy to tell it in a very clear and connected manner it was necessary to interlard it with many explanations and extenuations and even when these were supplied there was a baldness about the facts as they gradually grouped themselves together which it was not agreeable to contemplate and richard felt this himself gallingly i know how it appears to you he said i know how it sounds that is the maddening side of itit looks so much worse than it really is there is not a man living who would accuse me of intentional wrong confound it i seem to have been forced into doing the very things it was least natural to me to do bertha herself would say itshe would understand it she is always just and generous yes said the colonel i should say she had been generous you mean that i have betrayed her generosity cried richard that of course i expected it you will find said the colonel that others will say the same thing he had heard even more than his worst misgivings had suggested to him and the shock of it had destroyed something of his selfcontrol for the time being he was in no lenient mood i know what people will say richard exclaimed do you suppose i have not thought of it a thousand times i know what i should say if i did not know the circumstances it is the circumstances that make the difference the fact that they are your circumstances and not another mans began tredennis but there he checked himself i beg your pardon he said coldly i have no right to meet your confidence with blame it will do no good if i can give you no help i might better be silent there were circumstances which appeared extenuating to you i suppose he was angered by his own anger as he had often been before he told himself that he was making the matter a personal cause as usual but how could he hear that her very generosity and simplicity had been used against her by the man who should have guarded her interests as his first duty without burning with sharp and fierce indignation if i understand you he said your only hope of recovering what you have lost lies in the success of the westoria scheme yes answered amory with his forehead on his hands that is the diabolical truth and you have lost once i was driven into saying to you that if the thing should fail it would mean ruin to me that was the truth too the colonel stood still ruin to you he said ruin to your wiferuin to your childrenserious loss to the old man who who trusted me richard finished gnawing his white lips i see it in exactly the same light myself and it does not make it easier to bear that is the way a thing looks when it fails suppose it had succeeded it may succeed yet they trusted me and i tell you i trusted myself it was easy to see just what despair would seize him if the worst came to the worst and how powerless he would be in its clutches he was like a reed beaten by the wind even now a sudden paroxysm of fear fell upon him great god he cried it cant fail what could i say to themhow could i explain it a thousand wild thoughts surged through tredennis brain as he heard him the old sense of helplessness was strong upon him to his upright strength there seemed no way of judging fairly of or dealing practically with such dishonor and weakness what standard could be applied to a man who lied agreeably in his very thoughts of himself and his actions he had scarcely made a statement during the last hour which had not contained some airy falsehood of whom was it he thought in his momentary anguish not of berthanot of her childrennot of the gentle old scholar who had always been lenient with his faults it was of himself he was thinkingof richard amory robbed of his refined picturesqueness by mere circumstance and placed by bad luck at a baleful disadvantage for a few minutes there was a silence richard sat with his brow upon his hands his elbows on the table before him tredennis paced to and fro looking downward at length richard raised his head he did so because tredennis had stopped his walk what is it he asked tredennis walked over to him and sat down he was pale and wore a set and rigid look the chief characteristic of which was that it expressed absolutely nothing his voice was just as hard and expressed as little when he spoke i have a proposition to make to you he said and i will preface it by the statement that as a business man i am perfectly well aware that it is almost madness to make it i say almost let it rest there i will assume the risks you have run in the westoria scheme invest the money you have charge of in something safer you say there are chances of success i will take those chances what cried richard what he sat upright staring he did not believe the evidence of his senses but tredennis went on without the quiver of a muscle speaking steadily almost monotonously i have money he said more than you know perhaps i have had recently a legacy which would of itself make me a comparatively rich man that i was not dependent upon my pay you knew before i have no family i shall not marry i am fond of your children of janey particularly i should have provided for her future in any case you have made a bad investment in these lands transfer them to me and invest in something safer and if the bill fails to pass exclaimed richard if it fails to pass i shall have the land on my hands if it passes i shall have made something by a venture and janey will be the richer but as it stands the venture had better be mine than yours you have lost enough richard gave his hair an excited toss backward and stared at him as he had done before a slight cold moisture broke out on his forehead you meanhe began breathlessly do you remember said tredennis what i told you of the comments people were beginning to make they have assumed the form i told you they would it is best forfor your children that they should be put an end to if i assume these risks there will be no farther need for you to useto exert yourself he began to look white about the mouth and through his iron stolidity there was something revealed before which richard felt himself quail the night that blundel came in to your wifes reception and remained so short a time he had heard a remark upon the influence she was exerting over him and it had had a bad effect the remark was made publicly at one of the hotels he turned a little whiter and the something all the strength in him had held down at the outset leaped to the surface i have no wife toto use he said if i had by heavens i would have spared her he had held himself in hand and been silent a long time but he could not do it now she is the mother of your children he cried clenching his great hand and women are beginning to avoid her and men to bandy her name to and fro you have deceived her you have thrown away her fortune you have used her as an instrument in your schemes i who am only an outsider with no right to defend heri defend her for her fathers sake for her childs for her own you are on the verge of ruin and disgrace i offer you the chance to retrieve yourselfto retrieve her take it if you are a man richard had fallen back in his chair breathless and ashen in all his imaginings of what the future might hold he had never thought of such a possibility as thisthat it should be this man who would turn upon him and place an interpretation so fiercely unsparing upon what he had done under all his admiration and respect for the colonel there had been hidden it must be admitted an almost unconscious touch of contempt for him as a rather heavy and unsophisticated personage scarcely versatile or agile enough and formed in a mould somewhat obsolete and quixotica safe person to confide in and one to invite confidence passively by his belief in what was presented to him a man to make a good listener and to encourage one to believe in ones own statements certainly not a man to embarrass and discourage a historian by asking difficult questions or translating too literally what was said he had not asked questions until tonight and his face had said very little for him on any occasion among other things richard had secretlythough lenientlyfelt him to be a trifle stolid and had amiably forgiven him for it it was this very thing which made the sudden change appear so keen an injustice and injury it amounted to a breach of confidence that he should have formed a deliberate and obstinate opinion of his own entirely unbiassed by the presentation of the case offered to him he had spoken more than once it was true in a manner which had suggested prejudice but it had been the prejudice of the primeval mind unable to adjust itself to modern conditions and easily disregarded by more experienced but nowhe was stolid no longer his first words had startled richard beyond expression his face said more for him than his words it burned white with the fire it had hidden so long his great frame quivered with the passion of the moment when he had clenched his hand it had been in the vain effort to hold it still and yet the man who saw it recognized in it only the wrath and scorn which had reference to himself perhaps it was best that it should have been sobest that his triviality was so complete that he could see nothing which was not in some way connected with his own personality tredennis he gasped out you are terribly harsh i did not think you even if i could lie and palter to you said tredennis his clenched hand still on the table this is not the time for it i have tried before to make you face the truth but you have refused to do it perhaps you had made yourself believe what you told methat no harm was meant or done i know what harm has been done i have heard the talk of the hotel corridors and clubs his hand clenched itself harder and he drew in a sharp breath it is time that you should give this thing up he continued with deadly determination and i am willing to shoulder it who else would do the same thing no one else said richard bitterly and it is not for my sake you do it either it is for the sake of some of your ideal fancies that are too fine for us worldlings to understand i swear and he felt it specially hard that it was so yes replied the colonel i suppose you might call it that it is not for your sake as you say it has been one of my fancies that a man might even deny himself for the sake of anan idea and i am not denying myself i am only giving to your child in one way what i meant to give to her in another she would be willing to share it with her mother i think and then somehow richard began to feel that this offer was a demand and that even if his sanguine mood should come upon him again he would not find it exactly easy to avoid it it seemed actually as if there was something in this mansome principle of strength of feeling of convictionwhich almost constituted a right by which he might contend for what he asked and before it in his temporary abasement and anguish of mind richard amory faltered he said a great deal it is true and argued his case as he had argued it before being betrayed in the course of the argument by the exigencies of the case to add facts as well as fancies he endeavored to adorn his position as much as possible and naturally his failure was not entire there were hopes of the passage of the bill sometimes strong hopes it seemed if the money he had invested had been his own if it had not been for the failure of his speculations in other quarters if so much had not depended upon failure and successhe would have run all risks willingly there were indeed moments when it almost appeared that his companion was on the point of making a capital investment and being much favored thereby it is really not half so bad as it seems he said gaining cheerfulness as he talked but after such a day as i have had a man loses courage and cannot look at things collectedly i have been up and down in the scale a score of times in the last eight hours that is where the wear and tear comes in a great deal depends on blundel and i had a talk with him which carried us farther than we have ever been before farther said tredennis in what direction richard flushed slightly i think i sounded him pretty well he said there is no use mincing matters it has to be done we have never been able to get at his views of things exactly and i wont say he went very far this afternoon but i was in a desperate mood andwell i think i reached bottom he half promised to call at the house this evening i dare say he is with bertha now something in his flush which had a slightly excited and triumphant air something in his look and tone caused tredennis to start in his chair what is he there for he said what do you mean richard thrust his hands in his pockets for a moment he seemed to have lost all his grace and refinement of charmfor the moment he was a distinctly coarse and undraped human being he has gone to make an evening call he said and if she manages him as well as she has managed him beforeas well as she can manage any man she chooses to take in hand and yet not give him more than a smile or soyour investment if you make it may not turn out such a bad one chapter xxxiv bertha had spent the greater part of the day with her children as she had spent part of many days lately she had gone up to the nursery after breakfast to see jack and janey at their lessons and had remained with them and given herself up to their entertainment she was not well the weather was bad she might give herself a holiday and she would spend it in her own way in the one refuge which never failed her it is always quiet here she said to herself if i could give up all the restall of itand spend all my days here and think of nothing else i might be better there are women who live so i think they must be better in every way than i amand happier i am sure i should have been happier if i had begun so long ago and as she sat with janey at her side in the large chair which held them both her arm thrown round the childs waist there came to her a vague thought of what the unknown future might form itself into when she began again it would be beginning again when the sea was between the new life and the old everything would be left behindbut the children she would live as she had lived in virginia always with the childrenalways with the children it is the only safe thing she thought clasping janey closer nothing else is safe for a woman who is unhappy if one is happy one may be gay and look on at the world with the rest but there are some who must not look onwho dare not mamma said janey you are holding me a little too close and your face looksit looksas if you were thinking bertha laughed to reassure her they were used to this gay soft laugh of hers as the rest of the world was if she was silent if the room was not bright with the merriment she had always filled it with they felt themselves a trifle injured and demanded their natural rights with juvenile imperiousness mamma always laughs jack had once announced to a roomful of company she plays new games with us and laughs and we laugh too maria and susan are not funny mamma is funny and like a little girl grown up we always have fun when she comes into the nursery it is something the same way in the parlor planefield had said showing his teeth amiably and bertha who was standing near colonel tredennis had laughed in a manner to support her reputation but had said nothing so she laughed now not very vivaciously perhaps that was very improper janey she said to look as if i was thinking it is bad enough to be thinking it must not occur again but if you were thinking of a story to tell us suggested jack graciously it wouldnt matter you see you might go on thinking but the story was not a new one she answered it was sad i did not like it myself we should like it said janey if its a story remarked jack twisting the string round his top its all right there was a story uncle philip told us suppose you tell it to me said bertha it was about a knight said janey who went to a great battle it was very sorrowful he was strong and happy and bold and the king gave him a sword and armor that glittered and was beautiful and his hair waved in the breeze and he was young and brave and his horse arched its neck and the knight longed to go and fight in the battle and was glad and not afraid and the people looked on and praised him because they thought he would fight so well but just as the battle began before he had even drawn his sword a stray shot came and he fell and while the battle went on he lay there dying with his hand on his breast and at night when the battle was over and the stars came out he lay and looked up at them and at the darkblue sky and wondered why he had been given his sword and armor and why he had been allowed to feel so strong and glad and eageronly for that but he did not know there was no one to tell him and he died and the stars shone down on his bright armor and his dead face i didnt like it myself commented jack it wasnt much of a story i told him so he was sorry he told it said janey because i cried i dont think he meant to tell such a sad story he wasnt funny that day observed jack sometimes he isnt funny at all and he sits and thinks about things and then if we make him tell us a story he doesnt tell a good one he used to be nicer than he is now i love him said janey faithfully i think he is nice all the time it wasnt much of a story that is true said bertha there was not enough of it he died too soon said jack yes said bertha he died too soon that was ittoo soon and the laugh she ended with had a sound which made her shudder she got up from her rockingchair quickly we wont tell stories she said we will play we will play ball and blindmans bluffand run about and get warm that will be better and she took out her handkerchief and tied it over her eyes with unsteady hands laughing againlaughing while the children laughed too they played until the room rang with their merriment they had not been so gay together for many a day and when the game was at an end they tried another and another until they were tired and ready for their nursery dinner bertha did not leave them even then she did not expect richard home until their own dinnerhour in the evening so she sat at the childrens table and helped them herself in the nurses place and they were in high spirits and loquacious and confidential when the meal was over they sat by the nursery fire and meg fell asleep in her mothers arms and after she had laid her on her bed bertha came back to jack and janey and read and talked to them until dusk began to close in about them it was as they sat so together that a sealed package was brought to her by a servant who said it had been left at the door by a messenger it contained two lettersone addressed to senator blundel and one to herselfand both were in richards hand i suppose something has detained him and i am not to wait dinner she thought as she opened the envelope bearing her own name the same thing had occurred once or twice before so it made but little impression upon her there were the usual perfectly natural excuses he had been very hard at work and would be obliged to remain out until some time past their dinnerhour he had an engagement at one of the hotels and could dine there he was not quite sure that he should be home until late then he added just before closing blundel said something about calling this evening he had been having a hard day of it and said he wanted a change i had a very satisfactory talk with him and i think he begins to see the rights of our case entertain him as charmingly as possible and if he is not too tired and is in a good humor hand him the enclosed letter it contains testimony which ought to be a strong argument and i think it will be bertha looked at the letter it was not at all imposing and seemed to contain nothing more than a slip of paper she put it down on the mantel and sighed faintly if he knew what a service he would do me by seeing the rights of the case she said to herself i think he would listen to their arguments i think he likes me well enough to do it i believe he would enjoy being kind to me if this should be the end of it all it would be worth the trouble of being amusing and amiable one evening but she did not look forward with any great pleasure to the prospect of what was before her perhaps her day in the nursery had been a little too much for her she was tired and would have been glad to be left alone but this was not to be she must attire herself in all her bravery and sing and laugh and be gay a little longer how often had she done the same thing before how often would she do it again there are some people who are born to play comedy she said afterward as she stood before her mirror dressing they can do nothing else i am one of them very little is expected of me only that i shall always laugh and make jokes if i were to try tragedy that would be a better jest than all the rest if i were to be serious what a joke that would be she thought as she had done a thousand times of a portrait of herself which had been painted three years before it had been her christmas gift to richard and had been considered a great success it was a wonderfully spirited likeness and the artist had been fortunate in catching her brightest look it is the expression that is so marvellous richard had often said when i look at it i always expect to hear you laugh are they never tired of it she said never tired of hearing me laugh if i were to stop some day and say see i am tired of it myself i have tears as well as the rest of you let meshe checked herself her hands had begun to trembleher voice she knew too well what was coming upon her she looked at herself in the glass i must dress myself carefully she said if i am to look vivacious ones attire is called upon to do a great deal for one when one has a face like that outwardly her attire had done a great deal for her when after she had dined alone she sat awaiting her guest the fire burned brightly the old songs lay upon the piano a low stand with a pretty coffee service upon it was drawn near her a gay little workbasket containing some trifle of graceful work was on her knee outside the night was decidedly unpleasant so unpleasant she said to herself that it will surprise me if he comes but though by eight oclock the rain was coming down steadily at halfpast eight she heard the familiar heavy tread upon the doorstep and her visitor presented himself what sort of humor he was in when he made his entry bertha felt that it was not easy to decide but it struck her that it was not a usual humor and that the fatigues of the day had left their mark upon him he looked by no means fresh and by the time he had seated himself felt that something had disturbed him and that it was true that he needed distraction it had always been very simple distraction she offered him he had never demanded subtleties from her or any very great intellectual effort his ideas upon the subject of the feminine mind were perhaps not so advanced as they might have been and belonged rather to the days and surroundings of his excellent hardworked mother and practical unimaginative sisters than to a more brilliant world given a comfortable seat in the pretty room the society of this pretty and smiling little person who poured out his coffee for him enjoyed his jokes and prattled gayly of things pleasant and amusing he was perfectly satisfied what he felt the need of was rest and light recreation cheerfulness and appreciation a sense of relief from the turmoil and complications of the struggling manoeuvring overreaching ambitious world he lived in knowing this bertha had given him what he enjoyed and she offered him no other entertainment this evening she gave him his cup of coffee and talked to him as he drank it telling him an amusing story or so of the children or of people he knew i have been in the nursery all day she said i have been playing blindmans buff and telling stories you have never been in the nursery have you you are not like colonel tredennis who thinks the society there is better than that we have in the parlor perhaps hes not so far wrong said her guest bluntly though i have never been in the nursery myself i have a nursery of my own up at the capitol and i dont always find it easy to manage the children fight i have heard said bertha and sometimes call each other names and it is even reported that they snatch at each others toys and break those they cannot appropriate i am afraid the discipline is not good it isnt he answered or there isnt enough of it he set his coffeecup down and watched her as she leaned back in her chair and occupied herself with the contents of her workbasket do you go into the nursery often he asked or is it out of the fashion it is out of the fashion she answered butshe stopped and let her work rest on her knee as she held it will you tell me why you ask me that she said and her face changed as she spoke i asked you because i didnt know he answered it seemed to me you couldnt have much time for things of that sort you generally seem to be pretty busy with one thing and another i dont know much about fashionable life and fashionable women the women i knew when i was a boymy own mother and her sistersspent the most of their time with their children and it wasnt such a bad way either they were pretty good women perhaps it was the best way said bertha and i dare say they were better for it i dare say we compare very unfavorably with them you dont compare at all he returned i should not compare you i dont know how it would work with you they got old pretty soon and lost their good looks but they were safe kindhearted creatures who tried to do their duty and make the best of things i dont say they were altogether right in their views of life they were narrow i suppose and ran into extremes but they had ways a man likes to think of and did very little mischief i could scarcely estimate the amount of mischief i do said bertha applying herself to her work cheerfully but i do not think my children are neglected colonel tredennis would probably give a certificate to that effect they are clothed quite warmly and are occasionally allowed a meal and i make a practice of recognizing them when i meet them on the street she was wondering if it would not be better to reserve the letter until some more auspicious occasion it struck her that in the course of his days fatigues he had encountered some problem of which he found it difficult to rid himself there were signs of it in his manner he wore a perturbed preoccupied expression and looked graver than she had ever seen him he sat with his hands in his pockets his hair on end his bluff countenance a rather deeper color than usual and his eyes resting upon her this isnt an easy world he said and i suppose it is no easier for women than for men i shouldnt like to be a woman myself and have to follow my leader and live in one groove from beginning to end it is natural that some should feel the temptation to try to get out of it and use their power as men use theirs but it does not payit cant women were meant to be goodto be good and honest and true andand innocent it was an amazingly ingenuous creed and he presented it with a rough simplicity and awkwardness which might have been laughable but for their heavy sincerity bertha felt this seriousness instantaneously and looking up saw in his sharp little eyes a suggestion of feeling which startled her wondering what im thinking of he said well i am thinking of you ive thought of you pretty often lately and tonight ive a reason for having you in my mind what is the reason she asked more startled than before he thrust his hands deeper into his pockets there was no mistaking the evidences of strong emotion in his face i am a friend of yours he said you know that youve known it some time my opinion of you is that you are a good little womanthe right sort of a little womanand i have a great deal of confidence in you i hope so said bertha she felt that as he gained warmth and color she lost them she thought of the letter which lay on the mantelpiece within a few feet of him and wished that it was not so near there had been evil spoken of her and he had heard it she realized that and knew that she was upon her defence even while she had no knowledge of what she was to defend herself against i hope so she said again tremulously i hope so indeed and her eyes met his with a helplessness more touching than any appeal she could have made it so moved him that he could remain quiet no longer but sprang to his feet and drew his hand from his pocket and rubbed it excitedly over his upright hair damn it he broke forth let them say what they willlet what will happen ill believe in you dont look at me like that you are a good little woman but you are in the wrong place there are lies and intrigues going on about you and you are tootoo bright and pretty to be judged fairly by outsiders you dont know what you are mixed up in how should you who is to tell you these fellows who dangle about and make fine speeches are too smoothtongued even when they know enough ill tell you i never paid you compliments or made love to you did i im no good at that but ill tell you the truth and give you a bit of good advice people are beginning to talk you see and tell lies they have brought their lies to me i dont believe them but others will there are men and women who come to your house who will do you no good and are more than likely to do you harm they are a lot of intriguers and lobbyists you dont want that set here you want honest friends and an innocent respectable home for your children and a name they wont be ashamed of send the whole set packing and cut yourself loose from them bertha stood up also she had forgotten the little workbasket and still held it in her hands suspended before her will you tell me she said what the lies werethe lies you heard perhaps she thought with a hopeless pang they were not lies at all perhaps he had only heard what was the truth that she had been told to try to please him that his goodwill might be gained to serve an end looked at from richards standpoint that had been a very innocent thing looked at from his standpoint it might seem just what it had seemed to herself even in the reckless desperate moment when she had given way he paused a moment barely a moment and then answered her yes he said i will tell you if you want to know there has been a big scheme on hand for some timethere are men who must be influenced i am one of them and people say that the greater part of the work is carried on in your parlors here and that you were set on me because you were a clever little manoeuvrer and knew your business better than i should be likely to suspect that is what they say and that is what i must believe because he stopped short he had drawn nearer the mantelpiece and as he spoke some object lying upon it caught his eye it was the letter directed to himself lying with the address upward and he took it in his hand what is this he demanded who left it here bertha stood perfectly motionless richards words came back to her give it to him if he is in a good humor it contains arguments which i think will convince him then she looked at blundels face if there could be any moment more unfit than another for the presentation of arguments it was this particular one and never before had she liked him so well or valued his good opinion so highly as she did now when he turned his common angry honest face upon her what is it he said again tell me she thought of richard once more and then of the children sleeping upstairs and of the quiet innocent day she had spent with them they did not know that she was an intriguing woman whom people talked of she had never realized it herself to the full until this moment they had delicately forborne giving any name to the thing she had done but this man who judged matters in a straightforward fashion would find a name for it but there was only one answer for her to make it is a letter i was to give you she said and it is from your husband i have not read it she replied he stopped short a moment and looked at herwith a sudden suggestion of doubt and bewilderment that was as bad as a blow look here he said you were going to give it to meyou intended to do it yes he gave her another lookamazement anger disbelief struggling with each other in itand then thrust his obstinate fists into his pockets again and planted himself before her like a rock by the lord he said i wont believe it the hard commonsense which had been his stronghold and the standby of his constituents for many a year came to his rescue he might not know much of women but he had seen intrigue and trickery and detected guilt and it struck him if these things were here they were before him in a new form now he said tell me who gave it to you you will know that she answered when you read it tell me he demanded if you know what is in it i know something she replied of what is in it by jove he exclaimed id give a great deal to know how much only richard could have told him how much or how little and he was not there come he said as she made no reply they might easily deceive you tell me what you know and i will believe youand there are very few women in your place i would say as much to i do not think she answered that they have deceived me then he returned his face hardening you have deceived me yes she answered turning white i suppose i have there was a moment of dead silence in which his shrewd eyes did their work as well as they had done it at any time during his fifty years of life then he spoke to her again they wanted me here because they wanted to make use of me he said you knew that they did not put it in that way she answered i dare say you know that you were to befool me as far as you could and make the place agreeable to meyou knew that she turned paler ii have liked you very sincerely she broke forth piteously i have liked you out of all the rest that one thing was true dontah dont think it was not his expression for a moment was a curiously undecided one he was obliged to rally himself with a sharp rub at his hair ill tell you what i think of that when you have answered me another question he said there is a person who has done a great deal of work in this matter and has been very anxious about it probably because he has invested in it more money than he can sparebuying lands and doing one thing and another that person is your husband mr richard amory tell me if you knew that the blood rushed to her face and then left it again richard she exclaimed richard and she caught at the mantel and held to it his eyes did not leave her for an instant he nodded his head with a significance whose meaning was best known to himself sit down he said i see you did not know that she did as he told her it was as if such a flash of light had struck across her mental vision as half blinded her not richard she cried out and even as she said it a thousand proofs rushed back upon her and spoke the whole shameful truth for themselves blundel came nearer to her his homely angry face in spite of its anger expressing honest good feeling as strongly as any much handsomer one might have done i knew there had been deep work somewhere he said i saw it from the first as for you you have been treated pretty badly i supposed they persuaded you that you might as well amuse one man as anotherand i was the man i dare say there is more behind than i can see you had nothing to gain as far as you knew thats plain enough to me no she exclaimed it was not i who was to gain they did not think ofof me no he went on they lost sight of you rather often when they had a use for you its apt to be the way its time some one should think of you and i mean to do it i am not going to say anything more against those whomade the mistake with a resentful shuffle of his shoulders as he put it thus mildly than i can help but i am going to tell you the truth i have heard ugly stories for some time and ive had my suspicions of the truth of them but i meant to wait for proof and it was given me this afternoon more was said to me than it was safe to say to an honest man and i let the person who talked go as far as he would and he was too desperate to be cautious i knew a bold move was to be made and i guessed it would be made tonight he took the envelope from his pocket where he had tucked it unopened his face grew redder and hotter if it were not for you he said if i didnt have faith in your being the honest little woman i took you for if i didnt believe you spoke the truth when you said you liked me as honestly as i liked youthough the lord knows there is no proof except that i do believe you in spite of everythingid have the thing spread the length and breadth of the land by tomorrow morning and there would be such an uproar as the country has not seen for a year or so wait said bertha halfstarting from her seat i did not understand before this is too much shame i thought it wasonly a letter i did not know he went to the fire i believe that too he said grimly but it is not a little thing im doing im denying myself a great deal id give five years of my lifehe straightened out his short stout arm and closed hand with a robust gesture and then checked himself you dont know what is in it i dont know i have not looked at it there it goes and he tossed it into the fire the biggest fool of all he said is the fool who takes every man for a knave do they think a country like this has been run for a century by liars and thieves there have been liars and thieves enough but not enough to bring it to a standstill and that seems to argue that there has been an honest man or so to keep a hand on their throats when there are none leftwell it wont be as safe to belong to the nation as it is today in spite of all thats bad in it the envelope had flamed up and then died down into tindery blackness he pointed to it you can say it is there he said and that i didnt open it and they may thank you for it now i am going bertha rose she put her hand on the mantel again if i do not thank you as i ought she said brokenly you must forgive me i see all that you have spared me buti have had a heavy blow he paused to look at her rubbing his upright hair for the last time his little eyes twinkling with a suspicious brightness which had its softness too he came back and took her hand and held it in an awkward kindly clasp you are a good little woman he said ill say it to you again you were not cut out to be made anything else of you wont be anything else you are young to be disappointed and unhappy i know all that and there doesnt seem much to say advice wouldnt amount to much and i dont know that there is any to give they moved slowly toward the door together when they stood upon the threshold he dropped her hand as awkwardly as he had taken it and made a gesture toward the stairway the suspicious brightness of his eyes more manifest than ever your children are up there asleep he said unsteadily go to them and turning away shrugged himself into his overcoat at the hatstand opened the door for himself and went out of the house without another word chapter xxxv the last words of his halfreluctant halfexultant confession had scarcely left richard amorys lips when tredennis rose from his chair if you can he said tell me the literal truth blundel is at your house with your wife there is something she is to do what is it she is to hand him an envelope containing a slip of paper said richard doggedly that is what she is to do tredennis crossed the room and took his hat from its place will you come with me he said or shall i go alone where asked richard tredennis glanced at his watch he would not call until late perhaps he said and she would not give it to him at once it is ten now we may reach there in time to spare her that at least richard bit his lip there seems to be a good deal of talk of sparing her he said nobody spares me every folly i have been guilty of is exaggerated into a crime do you suppose that fellow isnt used to that sort of thing do you suppose i should have run the risk if he had not shown his hand this afternoon she knows nothing of what she is to give him there is no harm done to her how is he to know she is not in the plot said tredennis how is he to guess that she is notwhat she has been made to seem to be what insult is he not at liberty to offer her if he chooses she will take care of herself said richard let her alone for that by heaven said tredennis she has been let alone long enough has she ever been anything else but alone has there been one human creature among all she knew to help or defend or guide her who has given her a thought so long as she amused them and laughed with the rest who richard got up a dawning curiosity in his face what is the matter with you he said have you been the words died away the colonels gleaming eye stopped him we will go at once if you please said tredennis and strode out of the room before him when they reached the house bertha was still standing where her guest had left her a few moments before and but one glance at her face was needed to show both of them that something unusual had occurred you have had blundel here richard asked with an attempt at his usual manner which illcovered his excitement we thought we saw him crossing the street yes she answered he has just left me she turned suddenly and walked back to the hearth he left a message for you she said that is itand she pointed to the last bit of tinder flickering on the coals theletter exclaimed richard yes she answered do you want colonel tredennis to hear about the letter richard or does he know already he knows everything answered richard as every one else will tomorrow or the day after for a moment his despair made him so reckless that he did not make an effort at defence he flung himself into a chair and gave up to the misery of the hour you knew said bertha looking toward tredennis and did not tell me yes i forgotwith a bitter little smilethere was something you warned me of once and i would not listen and perhaps you thought i would not listen now if you know will you tell me what was in the letter i do not know yet and i want to hear it put into words it was moneyor an offer of money tell me if you please it was money said richard defiantly and there are others who have taken the same thing peacefully enough and i was to give it to him becausebecause he was a little more difficult and seemed to be my friend do all female lobbyists do such things richard or was i honored with a special service it is not the first time it has been done he answered and it wont be the last it is the first time i have done it she returned and it will be the last therisk is too great her voice shook a little but it was perfectly cold and though her eyes were dilated such fire as might have been in them was quenched by some light to which it would have been hard to give a name i do not mean the risk to myself she said to richard that i do not count i meant risk to you when he burned the letter he said tell them i did it for your sake and that it is safer for them that i did it what else did he say asked richard desperately he has evidently changed his mind since this afternoon he told me you had a reason for your interest in the scheme which was not the one you gave me he told me you had invested largely in it and could not afford to lose richard started up and turned helplessly toward tredennis he had not expected this just yet at least iihe faltered the colonel spoke without lifting his eyes from the floor will you let me explain that he asked i think it would be better there was a moments silence in which bertha looked from one to the other you she said richards lids fell he took a paperknife from the table he leaned against and began to play with it nervously he had become a haggard coarsened weakened copy of himself his hair hung in damp elflocks over his forehead his lips were pale and dry he bit them to moisten them the money said tredennis was mine it was a foolish investment perhaps but the moneywas mine yours said bertha you invested in the westoria lands she put her hand in its old place on the mantel and a strange laugh fell from her lips then i have been lobbying for you too she said iwish i had been more successful richard put his hand up and pushed back the damp falling locks of hair from his forehead restlessly i made the investment he said and i am the person to blame as usual but you would have believed in it yourself yes she answered i should have believed in it i dare say it has been easy to make me believe but i think i should also have believed in a few other thingsin the possibility of their being honor and good faith she paused an instant and then began again you told me once that you had never regarded me seriously i think that has been the difficultyand perhaps it was my fault it will not be necessary to use me any more and i dare say you will let me go away for a while after a week or so i think it would be better she left her place to cross the room to the door on her way there she paused before colonel tredennis i beg your pardon she said and went on at the door she stopped again one moment fronting them both her head held erect her eyes large and bright when senator blundel left me she said he told me to go to my children if you will excuse me i will go and she made a stately little bow and left them chapter xxxvi the great social event of the following week was to be the ball given yearly for the benefit of a certain popular and fashionable charity there was no charity so fashionable and consequently no ball so well attended everybody was more or less interested everybody of importance appeared at it showing themselves for a few moments at least even mrs merriam who counted among the privileges earned by a long and unswervingly faithful social career the one of immunity from all ordinary society duties found herself drawn into the maelstrom and enrolled on the list of patronesses you may do all the work my dear she said to mrs sylvestre and i will appropriate the credit but she was not so entirely idle as she professed to be and indeed spent several mornings briskly driving from place to place in her comfortable carriage and distinguished herself by exhibiting an executive ability a promptness and decision in difficulty which were regarded with secret awe and admiration by her younger and less experienced colleagues she had been out doing such work on the afternoon of the day before the ball and returned home at her usual hour but not in her usual equable frame of mind this was evident when she entered the room where mrs sylvestre sat talking to colonel tredennis who had called there were indeed such signs of mental disturbance in her manner that mrs sylvestre rising to greet her observed them at once i am afraid you have had an exciting morning she said and have done too much work my dear was the reply nothing could be more true than that i have had an exciting morning i am sorry for that said agnes i am sorry for it said mrs merriam more sorry than i can say then turning to tredennis i am glad to find you here i have been hearing some most extraordinary stories perhaps you can tell me what they mean whom do they concern asked agnes we are entertained by many stories they will disturb you as much as they have disturbed me mrs merriam answered they have disturbed me very much they concern our little friend mrs amory bertha exclaimed agnes her tender heart beat quickly and a faint flush showed itself on her cheek she looked up at colonel tredennis with quick questioning eyes perhaps she was not as unprepared for the statement as she might have been she had seen much during the last few weeks which had startled and alarmed her mrs merriam looked at tredennis also you may be able to guess something of what the rumors form themselves upon she said heaven knows there has been enough foundation for anything in that miserable westoria land scheme you have heard something of it this morning said tredennis i have heard nothing else was the answer the westoria land scheme has come to an untimely end with a flavor of scandal about it which may yet terminate in an investigation the whole city is full of it and stories of mrs amory and her husband are the entertainment offered you on all sides i say mrs amory and her husband because it is mrs amory who is the favorite topic she has been making the most desperate efforts to influence people her parlors have been filled with politicians and lobbyists all the season the husband was deeply involved in the matter bribes have been offered and taken there are endless anecdotes of senator planefield and his infatuation and the way in which it has been used she would have accomplished wonders if it had not been for senator blundel who suspected her and led her into betraying herself it is senator blundel who is credited with having been the means of exploding the whole affair he has been privately investigating the matter for months and had an interview with mrs amory the other night in which he accused her of the most terrible things and threatened her with exposure that is the way the stories run oh this is very cruel said agnes we must do something we must try we cannot let such things be said without making an effort against them whatever is done must be done at once replied mrs merriam the conclusion of the matter is that there seems actually to be a sort of cabal formed against her you meanbegan agnes anxiously i mean said mrs merriam that my impression is that if she appears at the ball there are those who will be so rude to her that she will be unable to remain aunt mildred exclaimed agnes in deep agitation surely such a thing is impossible it is not only not impossible returned mrs merriam but it is extremely probable i heard remarks which assured me of that she must not go said agnes we must manage to keep her at home colonel tredennis the remedy must go deeper than that he answered the fact that she did not appear would only postpone the end the slights she avoided one night would be stored up for the future we may be sure he endeavored to speak calmly but it was not easy and he knew too well that such a change had come upon his face as the two women could not but see though he had feared this climax so long though he had even seen day by day the signs of its approach it fell upon him as a blow at last and seemed even worse than in his most anxious hour he had thought it might be she has friends he said her friends have friends i think there are thosebesides ourselveswho will defend her they must be strong remarked mrs merriam there are some of them he answered who are strong i think i know a lady whose opinion will not go for nothing who is generous enough to use her influence in the right direction and that direction said mrs merriam if the opposing party finds itself met by a party more powerful than itself he said its tone will change and as for the story of senator blundel i think i can arrange that he will attend to that himself mere denial would not go very far i am afraid said mrs merriam he cannot deny it to two or three score of people he can deny it to the entire community he answered by showing that their intimacy remains unbroken ah cried agnes if he would only go to the ball and let people see him talking to her as he used to but i am sure he never went to a ball in his life my dear said mrs merriam that is really a very clever idea if he could be induced to go he is an honest man said tredennis flushing and he is her friend i believe that sincerely and i believe he would prove it by going anywhere to serve her if that is true said mrs merriam a great deal will be accomplished though it is a little difficult to figure to ones self how he would enjoy a ball i think we shall have the pleasure of seeing replied the colonel i myselfhe paused a moment and then added i chance to have a rather intimate acquaintance with him he has interested himself in some work of mine lately and has shown himself very friendly to me it would perhaps be easier for me to speak to him than for any other friend of mrs amory i think you would do it better than any other friend mrs merriam said with a kindly look at him the truth was that since his first introduction to colonel tredennis blundel had taken care that the acquaintance should not drop he had found the modest warrior at once useful and entertaining he had been able to gather from him information which it was his interest to count among his stores and having obtained it was not ungrateful and indeed was led by his appreciation of certain good qualities he recognized in him into something bordering on an attachment for his new friend i like that fellow he used to say energetically and realizing something of this friendliness and more of the honor and worth of his acquaintance the colonel felt that he might hope to reach his heart by telling his story simply and with dignity leaving the rest to him as for the lady of whom he had spoken he had but little doubt that that kind and generous heart might be reached he had seen evidences of its truth and charity too often to distrust them it was of course the wife of the secretary of state he was thinking ofthat good and graceful gentlewoman whose just and clear judgment he knew he could rely upon and whose friendship would grant him any favor she is very generous and sympathetic he said and i have heard her speak most kindly of mrs amory her action in the matter must have weight and i have confidence that she will show her feeling in a manner which will make a deep impression she has always been fond of professor herrick that is as clever an idea as the other said mrs merriam she has drawn her lines so delicately heretofore that she has an influence even greater than was wielded by most of those who have occupied her position and she is a decided and dignified person capable of social subtleties oh exclaimed mrs sylvestre it seems very hard that it should be bertha who should need such defence it is miserable said mrs merriam impatiently it is disgraceful when one considers who is the person to blame it is very delicate of us not to use names i suppose but there has been enough delicacyand indelicacyand i should like to use them as freely as other people do i think you remember that i have not been very fond of mr richard amory when colonel tredennis left them he turned his steps at once toward the house of the woman who was his friend and upon whose assistance so much depended to gain her sympathy seemed the first thing to be done and one thought repeated itself again and again in his mind how shall i say it best but fortune favored him and helped him to speak as he had not anticipated that it would the lady sat alone in her favorite chair in her favorite room when he was ushered into her presence as he had frequently happened to be before somewhere about the same hour a book lay open upon her lap but she was not reading it and he fancied had not been doing so for some time he also fancied that when she saw him her greeting glance had a shade of relief in it and her first words seemed to certify that he was not mistaken i am more than usually glad to see you she said i think that if you had not appeared so opportunely i should have decided in about half an hour that i must send for you i am very fortunate to have come he answered and he held her kind hand a moment and there came into his face a look so anxious that being in the habit of observing him she saw it are you very well she asked gently i am afraid not you are rather pale sit down by my chair and let me look at you am i pale said the colonel you are very good to notice it though i am not ill i am onlyonly she looked at him with grave interest have you she saidhave you heard ill news of some friend is that it i am afraid it is yes he answered that is it and i am afraid you have heard of it too i am afraid i have she returned such things travel quickly i have heard something which has distressed me very much it is something i have heard faint rumors of before but now it has taken on a definite form this morning i was out and this afternoon i have had some callers who were not averse to speaking plainly i have heard a great many things said which have given me pain and which embarrass me seriously that was the reason i was wishing to see you i felt that you would at least tell me a story without prejudice there is a great deal of prejudice shown of course we need expect nothing else i am sure professor herrick can know nothing of this will you tell me what you yourself know that is what i came to do said the colonel still paler perhaps there is a great deal to tellmore than the world will ever know it is only to such as you that it could be told there was more emotion in his voice and face than he had meant to reveal perhaps something in the kind anxiousness of his companions eyes moved him he found that he could not sit still and speak as if his interest was only the common one of an outsider so he rose and stood before her i cannot even tell you how it is that i know what i do to be true he said i have only my word but i know you will believe me you may be sure of that she answered i am sure of it he returned or i should not be here for i have no other proof to offer i came to make an appeal to you in behalf of a person who has been wronged in behalf of mrs amory she said yes he replied though she does not know i am here and will never know it it scarcely seems my business perhaps she should have others to defend her but there are no others who having the interest of relationship might not be accused of selfinterest too there is a slight tie of kinship between us but it is only a slight one and we have not always been very good friends perhaps though it must have been my own fault i think i never pleased her very well even when i saw her oftenest she was used to brighter companionship but her father liked me we were friends warm and close i have felt almost as if i was his son and have tried to spare him the knowledge of what would have hurt him during the last few weeks i think he has had suspicions which have disturbed him but they have not been suspicions of trouble to his child i felt sure of that the lady remarked she has no suspicions of the true aspect of affairs he continued though she has lately gained knowledge of the wrong done her it has been a great wrong she has not been spared her inexperience made her a child in the hands of those who used her as their tool she understands now that it is too lateand it is very bitter to her you knew her when she was a girl his companion said with her kind eyes on his sad stern face yes he answered when she was a girl and happy and with all of life before her andshe did not fear it i knew her too she replied she has greatly changed since then i saw that when i returned here he said and he turned his head aside and began to take up and set down a trifle on the mantel at first i did not understand it he added now i do she has not changed without reason if she has seemed light there are women i suppose who hide many a pain in that way she has loved her children and made them happyi know that at leastandand she has been a kind wife and an innocent woman it is her friends who must defend her she needs their defence said his hearer i felt that when i was out this morning and when my callers were with me an hour ago she held out her hand with sympathetic frankness i am her friend she said and her fathersand yours i think you have some plan there is something you wish me to do tell me what it is yes he answered there is something i wish you to do no one else can do it so well there are people who intend to testify to their belief in the stories they have heard by offering her open slights it is likely that the attempt will be made tomorrow night at the ball if you testify to your disbelief and disapproval by giving her your protection the popular theory will be shaken and there will be a reaction in her favor it is not to be denied she said that it is only women who can aid her it is women who say these things as a rule and who can unsay them the actions of men in such matters are of less weight than they should be though it is true there is one man who might do her a service you are thinking of senator blundel he said iwe have thought of that we thinkhope that he will come to the ball if he does and shows himself friendly toward her she returned nothing more can be said which could be of much importance he is the hero of the story as i dare say you have heard if he remains her friend that proves that he did not accuse her of plotting against him and that he has no cause for offence if the story of the grand scene between them is untrue the foundationstone is taken away and having the countenance of a few people who show their confidence with tact and discretion she is safe i will go to the ball my friend and i will use what influence i possess to insure that she is not badly treated i knew you would be kind to her tredennis said with kindling eyes i have seen you kind before to those who needed kindness even to those who did not deserve itand she does yes yes i am sure she does she answered poor child poor child and she gave him her hand again and as he wrung it in his her eyes were fuller of sympathy than ever he reached senator blundels rooms an hour later and found him in the midst of his papers and pigeonholesletters and pamphlets to right of him to left of him before and behind him well he said by way of greeting our westoria friends are out of humor this morning so i have heard tredennis answered and they may well bethey may well be he said nodding sharply and there are some fine stories told of course i have come to tell you one myself sir said tredennis what cried blundel turning on his chairyou have a story yes returned the colonel not a pleasant one and as it concerns you i will waste as few words as possible he wasted no words at all the story was a brief one but as forcible as simple words could make it there was no effort to give it effectiveness and yet there were touches here and there which appealed to the man who heard it as he had been rarely appealed to before they brought before him things which had found a lodging in corners of his practical political mind and had haunted him rather pathetically since the night he had shrugged himself into his overcoat and left the slight desolatelooking figure behind him he had enjoyed his friendship too much not to regret it now that he felt it was a thing of the past he had felt the loss more than once of the new element it had introduced into his life and had cast about in his mind in vain for a place where he could spend a spare hour or so as pleasantly as he had often spent such hours in a bright parlor he knew of before tredennis had half finished his relation he was moving restlessly in his chair and uttering occasional gruff ejaculations and when it came to an end he sprang up looking not a trifle heated thats it is it he exclaimed they have been inventing something new about her have they and dragged me into it into the bargain and they are making up plots against herpoor little womanas if she hadnt been treated badly enough a lot of gossips ill wager some of them are good enough said the colonel they only mean to signify their disapproval of what they would have the right to condemn if it were a truth instead of a lie well they shall not do it at my expense thats all was the answer it is a lie from beginning to end and i will do something toward proving it to them i dont disapprove of herthey shall see that shes a genuine good little thing shes a lady any fool can see that she won me over by george when everything was against her and she accused nobody when she might have said some pretty hard true things and nine women out of ten would have raised the very deuce shes got courage andyes and dignity and a spirit of her own that has helped her to bear many a bitter thing without losing her hold on herself id be willing to swear look here he added turning suddenly and facing tredennis how much do you know of her troubles something i know or you wouldnt be here yes answered the colonel i know something well he continued in an outburst of feeling i dont ask how much its enough i dare say to make it safe for me to speak my mindi mean safe for her not for myself theres a fellow within a hundred miles of here i should like to thrash within an inch of his life and an elegant charming amiable fellow he is too who possibly persuaded himself that he was doing her very little injury the injury has been done nevertheless said tredennis gravely and it is her friends who must right it im willing to do my share said blundel and let that fellow keep out of my way as to this balli never went to a ball in my life but i will appear at this one and show my colors wait a minute as if an idea had suddenly struck him go to the ballill take her there myself the spirit of combat was aroused within him the idea presented itself to him with such force that he quite enjoyed it here arraigned on one side were these society scandalmongers and fine ladies here on the other was himself samuel blundel rough and blunt but determined enough to scatter them and their lies to the four winds he rather revelled in the thought of the struggle if struggle there was to be he had taken active part in many a row in the house in which the odds had been against him and where his obstinate strength had outlived the subtle readiness of a dozen apparently better equipped men and his heart was in this deed of valor too it glowed within him as he thought how much really depended upon him now this pretty bright creature must turn to him for protection and support he almost felt as if he held her gloved hand resting upon his burly arm already with a clinging touch ill take her myself he repeated ill go and see her myself and explain the necessity of itif she does not know all she does not know all yet said tredennis and i think she was scarcely inclined to go to the ball but i am sure it will be better that she should go she will go said blundel abruptly ill make her she knows me she will go if i tell her she must that is what comes of being an old fellow you see and not a ladys man he had not any doubt of his success with her and to tell the truth neither had colonel tredennis he saw that his blunt honesty and unceremonious halfpaternal domineering would prove to her that he was in the right even if she were at first reluctant and this being settled and the matter left in blundels hands the colonel went away only before going he said a few words rather awkwardly there would be nothing to be gained by mentioning my name he said it is mere accident thatthat i chance to know what i have spoken of she does not know that i know it i should prefer that she should not what said blundelshe is not to know how you have been standing by her she knows that i would stand by her if she needed me she does not need me she needs you i have nothing to do with the matter i dont wish to be mentioned when he was gone blundel rubbed his hair backward and then forward by way of variety queer fellow he said meditatively not quite sure ive exactly got at him yet brave as a lion and shy as a boy absolutely afraid of women chapter xxxvii in less than an hour his card was brought to bertha as she sat with her children she read it with a beating heart and having done so put down meg and her picturebook i will go down at once she said to the servant in two minutes she was standing in the middle of the parlor and her guest was holding her hand in his and looking at her earnestly and curiously you didnt expect to see me here did you he said no she answered but you are kind to come i didnt expect to be here myself he said where is your husband somebody told me he had gone away he is in new york she replied he gave her one of his sharp glances and drew her toward a chair sit down by me he said you are in no condition to be kept standing i want to talk to you you mustnt look like that he said it wont do you are worn out but you mustnt give up i have come to order you to do something i will do anything you tell me she answered you will well thats good i thought you would too i want you to take me to this ball that is to be given tomorrow night she started in amazement to the ball she exclaimed surprises you doesnt it i supposed it would it surprises me a little but i want to go nevertheless and i have a reason i am sure it is a good one she said it is he answered none but the best would take me there i never went to a ball in my life you are the reason i am going to take care of you a faint sad smile touched her lips some one has said something more against me she said and you want to defend me dont take the trouble it is not worth while the place is full of lies about you he answered suddenly and fiercely and i am going to defend you no one else can they are lies that concern me as well as you will you tell me what they are she asked he saw there was no room for hesitation and told her what the facts were as he spoke he felt that they did not improve in the relation and he saw the blood rise to her cheeks and a light grow in her eyes when he had finished the light was a brilliant spark of fire it is a charming story she said we will show them what sort of a story it is he answered tomorrow night you are very good to me she said suddenly she put her hand to her side ah she exclaimed it seems very strange that they should be saying these things of bertha amory she looked at him with a hopeless appeal in her eyes do they all believe them she said ah how can they they know i was notlike that i have not done anything i have been unhappy butbut i she stopped a momentor was stopped by her breaking voice this has been too much for you he said you are ill child i have been ill for some time she answered and the last few days have been very hard she made an effort to recover herself i will go to the ball she said if you think it best it is best he replied and you need not be afraid i am not afraid she interposed quickly and the spark of fire showed itself in her eyes again i might allow myself to be beaten if it were not for my children but as it is you will see that i will not be beaten i will be well for tomorrow night at least i will not look like a victim they will see that i am not afraid it is they who will be beaten said blundel if anything depends on me confound it i shall like to do it chapter xxxviii he went home quite eager for the fray and his eagerness was not allowed to flag the favorite story came to his ears again and again men met him in the streets and stopped to speak of it others dropped into his rooms to hear the truth from himself when he went to his hotel to dine talkers standing in groups in the lobbies turned to look at him and when he had passed them returned to their conversation with renewed interest to the first man who referred to the matter he listened until he had said his say then he answered him you want to hear the truth about that he said dont you that of course was the reply and you want to be able to tell the truth about it when you are asked questions most certainly well then the truth is that there isnt a word of truth in it from beginning to end and if you want to tell the truth say its a lie and add that i said so and i am prepared to say so to every man who wants to interview me and what is more every man who tells another that it is a lie does me a favor that gives him a claim on me he repeated the same thing in effect each time an opportunity presented itself and as these opportunities were frequent and each time he gained something of heat and lost something of temper and patience he was somewhat tired and by no means in the best of humors when he sat down to his dinner in the big glaring crowded hotel diningroom amid the rattle of knives forks and crockery the rushing to and fro of excited waiters and the incoming and outgoing of hungry people his calmness was not added to by observing that the diners at the tables near him discovered him as with one accord almost as soon as he entered and cast glances of interest at him between the courses perfectly dreadful scene they say he heard one lady remark with an unconscious candor born of her confidence that the clatter of dishes would drown all sound went down on her knees to him and wrung her hands imploring him to have mercy on her husband disappeared next day quite society people too she has been a great deal admired what further particulars the speaker might have entered into there is no knowing as she was a communicative person and plainly enjoyed her subject but just at this juncture the lady to whom she was confiding her knowledge of the topics of the hour uttered an uneasy exclamation gracious maria she said he has heard you i am sure he has he has turned quite redredder than he wasand he is looking at us o maria in accents sepulchral with fright he is getting up he is coming to speak to us omari he was upon them at that very moment he was accustomed to public speaking and his experience led him to the point at once he held his newspaper half folded in his hand and as had been said he was a trifle redder than usual but his manner was too direct to be entirely devoid of dignity i beg your pardon he said but my name is blundel the most hopelessly terrified of the ladies found herself saying that he was very kind and the one who had told the story gasped faintly but with an evident desire to propitiate that she had heard so i take the liberty of mentioning it he added because i have been sitting quite near to you and chanced to overhear what you were saying and as you are evidently laboring under an impression i am interested in correcting i felt obliged to intrude on you with a view to correcting it i have been denying that story all day it isnt true not a word of it i never said an unkind word to the lady you mention and i never had an unkind thought of her no one has any right to speak ill of her i am her friend you will excuse my interrupting you here is my card and he laid the card on the table made a bow not so remarkable for grace perhaps as for perfect respectfulness and marched back to his table there were few people in the room who did not turn to look at him as he sat down again and nine out of ten began to indulge in highly colored speculations as to why he had addressed the women and who they were there had never been a more popular scandal than the westoria land scheme the magnitude of it the element of romance connecting itself with it the social position of the principal schemers all endeared it to the public heart blundel himself had become a hero and had the rumors regarding his irreproachable and dramatic conduct only been rife at a time of election they would have assured him an overwhelming majority perhaps as he approached the strangers table there had been a fond flickering hope cherished that these two apparently harmless women were lobbyists themselves and that their disguise was to be rent from them and their iniquities to be proclaimed upon the spot but the brief episode ended with apparent tameness and the general temperature was much lowered the two ladies sinking greatly in public opinion and the interest in blundel himself flagging a little there was one person however who did not lose interest in him this was a little eager birdlike woman who sat at some distance from him at a small table alone she had seen his every movement since his entrance and her bright dark eyes followed him with an almost wistful interest it was miss jessup and miss jessup was full to the brim and pressed down and running over with anecdotes of the great scandal and her delicate little frame almost trembled with anxious excitement as she gazed upon him and thought of what might be done in an interview he had nearly finished his dinner before he caught sight of her but as he was taking his coffee he glanced down the room saw and recognized her the very woman he exclaimed under his breath why didnt i think of that before and in five minutes miss jessups heart was thrilled within her for he had approached her greeted her and taken the seat she offered him i have come he said to ask a favor of you of me said miss jessup that does not sound exactly natural i have generally asked favors of you i have just been looking at you and making up my mind to ask one wanted to interview me he askeddidnt you she nodded her head and her bright eyes brightened well sturdily i want you to interview me go ahead and do it you want to be interviewed she exclaimed positively radiant with innocent joy no really i am here for that purpose he answered she left her seat instantly come into the parlor she said it is quiet there at this time we can sit where we shall not be disturbed at all they went into the parlor and found at the far end of it the quiet corner they needed and two chairs miss jessup took one and blundel the other which enabled him to present his broad back to all who entered almost before he was seated miss jessup had produced her neat notebook and a pencil now she said i am ready for anything but i must say i dont see how i am favoring you you are going to favor me by saving me the trouble of contradicting a certain story every halfhour he said ah ejaculated miss jessup her countenance falling a little it is not true not a word of it humane little creature as she was as she glanced down at her notebook miss jessup felt that some one had been a trifle defrauded and there was no scene no and you did not threaten to expose her no and you wish me to tell people that yes as pointedly as possible in as few words as possible and without mentioning names if possible oh it would not be necessary to mention names everybody would understand the slightest reference well when you have done that said blundel you have granted me my favor and you want it to be brief said miss jessup see here said blundel you are a woman i want you to speak the truth for another woman as plainly andas delicately as a woman can a man would say too much or too little that is why i come to you she touched her book with her pencil and evidently warmed at once i always liked her she said with genuine good feeling and i could not help hoping that the story was not true after all as it was public property it was my business to find out all about it if i could but i couldnt help being sorry i believe i can say the right thing and i will do my best at any rate it will be altogether different from the other versions there wont be any other versions if i can prevent it returned blundel i shall have some interviews with newspaper men tonight which will accomplish that end i hope ah exclaimed miss jessup then mine will be the only statement i hope so he answered it will be if i have any influence oh then she said you have done me a favor after all it wont balance the favor you will have done me he replied if you do your best in this matter you see i know what your best is and i depend on it well she said it is very kind of you to say so and i will try to prove myself worth depending on butand she scribbled a little in her notebook i dont mind telling you that the reason that is strongest in my mind is quite an unprofessional one it is the one you spoke of just now it is because i am a woman too then she is safe he returned nothing could make her safer and i am grateful to you beforehand and i hope you will let me say so and they shook hands and parted the best of friends notwithstanding that the interview had dwindled down into proportions quite likely to be regarded by the public as entirely insignificant chapter xxxix it had certainly been expected by the public that the morning papers would contain some interesting reading matter and in some respects these expectations were realized the ignominious failure of the westoria land scheme was discussed with freedom and vigor light being cast upon it from all sides but upon the subject which had promised most there was a marked silence only in one paper there appeared a paragraphscarcely morewritten with much clearness and with a combined reserve and directness which could not fail to carry weight it was very well done and said so much in little and with such unmistakable faith in its own statements and such suggestions of a foundation for that faith that it was something of a shock to those who had delighted in the most elaborate ornamentation of the original story in effect it was a denial not only of the ornamentation but of the story itself and left the liberal commentator not a fact to stand upon so that he became temporarily the prey of discouragement and spiritual gloom which was not a little added to by the events of the day there was however no sense of discouragement in the mind of senator blundel as he attired himself for the fray when night arrived his mood was a fine combination of aggressiveness generous kindliness hot temper and chivalric good feeling he thought all day of the prospect before him and in the afternoon went to the length of calling at a florists and ordering a bouquet to be sent to mrs amory choosing it himself and feeling some pride in the good taste of his selection he was so eager indeed that the day seemed quite long to him and he dressed so early after dinner that he had two or three hours to wait before his carriage arrived but it did arrive at last and he went down to it drawing on with some difficulty an exceedingly tight pair of gloves the obduracy of whose objections to being buttoned gave him something to combat with and suited his frame of mind to a nicety he was not called upon to wait very long after his entrance into the parlor a few moments after his arrival bertha came down she was superbly dressed in white she carried his roses and violets and there burned upon her cheeks a color at once so delicate and brilliant that he was surprised by it he had indeed rather expected to see her paler upon my soul he said you dont look much frightened i am not frightened at all she answered that is a good thing he returned we shall get on all the better for it i never saw you with a brighter color she touched her cheek with her gloved finger it is not rouge she said i have been thinking of other parties i have attendedand of how these ladies will look at me tonightand of what they possibly said of me yesterdayand it has been good for me it was not so good for them however he suggested regarding her with new interest her spirit pleased him he liked it that she was not ready to allow herself to be beaten down that she held her head erect and confronted her enemies with resolute eyes he had a suspicion that there were women enough who would have been timorous and pathetic i could not hurt them she replied it would matter very little what i thought or said of them it is only they who can harm me they shall none of them harm you he said stoutly i will see to that but im glad you are looking your best but she could not help seeing that he was a trifle anxious about her his concern manifested itself in occasional touches of halfpaternal kindliness which were not lost upon her he assisted her to put on her wrap asked her if it was warm enough ordered her to draw it closely about her and tucked her under his arm as he led her out to the carriage with an air of determined protection not to be mistaken perhaps his own views as to what form of oppression and opposition they were to encounter were rather vague he was sufficiently accustomed to the opposition of men but not to that of women but whatever aspect it assumed upon this occasion he was valiantly determined not to be moved by it i cant dance with you he said thats truei wish i could but i will see that you have plenty of partners i dont think the difficulty will be in the partners bertha replied with a faint smile the men will not be unkind to me you will see they wont believe it eh said blundel her eyes met his and the faint smile had a touch of bitterness some of them will not believe it she answered and some will not care there was not the slightest shade of any distrust of herself or her surroundings either in her face or manner when on reaching their destination she made her way into the cloakroom the place was already crowdedso crowded that a newcomer was scarcely noticeable but though she seemed to see nothing glancing to neither right nor left and occupying herself with the removal of her wraps and with a few calm last touches bestowed upon her toilet before a mirror scarcely a trifle escaped her she heard greetings laughter gay comments on the brilliancy and promise of the ball she knew where stood a woman who would be likely to appear as an enemy where stood another who might be neutral and another who it was even possible might be a friend but she meant to run no risks and her long training in selfcontrol stood her in good stead there was neither consciousness nor too much unconsciousness in her face when the woman whom she had fancied might lean toward friendliness saw and bowed to her she returned the greeting with her pretty inscrutable smile the entire composure of which so impressed the matron who was disposed to neutrality that she bowed also and so did some one near her but there were others who did not bow and there were those who discovering the familiar graceful figure drew together in groups and made an amiable comment or so but she did not seem to see them when taking up her flowers and her white ostrichfeather fan she passed down the little lane they expressed their disapproval by making way for her as she turned toward the door she was looking at two ladies who were entering and general attention being directed toward them they were discovered to be mrs sylvestre and mrs merriam now it was asked what will they do what they did was very simple in itself but very remarkable in the eyes of the lookerson they paused and spoke to the delinquent in quite their usual manner we would ask you to wait for us mrs merriam was heard to say finally but there are so many people here to be attended to and we saw senator blundel waiting for you at the door may i tell you how pretty your dress is and how brilliant you are looking senator blundel was repeated by the nearest groups it could not be senator blundel who is with her but those who were near enough to the door were subjected to the mental shock of seeing that it was senator blundel himself he appeared in festal array rubicund and obstinately elate and stepping forward took his charges hand and drew it within his portly arm what he said you are not pale yetand yet there were plenty of them in there what did they do three of them were good enough to bow to me she answered and the rest drew away and discussed me in undertones the general impression was i think that i was impudent i did not feel impudent and i dont think i looked so poor little woman he said poor little woman no no she exclaimed looking straight before her with dangerously bright eyes dont say that to me dont pity me pleasejust yetit isnt good for me i needi need there was a second or so of dead silence she did not tell him what she needed when they entered the ballroom a waltz was being played and the floor was thronged with dancers the ladies who formed the committee of reception stood near the door a party of guests had just received the usual greetings and retired the commandressinchief turned to meet the newcomers she was a stately and severe dowager with no intention of flinching from her duty but her sudden recognition of the approaching senatorial figure was productive of a bewilderment almost too great for her experience to cope with she looked caught her breath lost it and her composure at one and the same time cast a despairing glance at her aides and fell a victim to circumstances here was the subject under ban calmly making the most graceful and selfpossessed obeisance before her and her escort was the man of whom it had been said that a few days ago he had exposed her infamous plotting this was more than even the most experienced matron could be prepared for it must be admitted that her presence of mind deserted her and that her greetings were not marked by the ready tact which usually characterized them my first ball madam remarked the senator scenting difficulty in the breeze and confronting it boldly but for my friend mrs amory i am afraid i should not be here i begin to feel indebted to her already it promises very well said bertha i never saw the room gayer how pretty the decorations are they passed on to make room for others leaving the estimable ladies behind them pale with excitement and more demoralized than they would have been willing to admit what does it mean they asked one another they appear to be the best of friends what are we to understand there was one kindly matron at the end of the line who looked after the pair with an expression of sympathy which was rather at variance with the severity of the rle she had been called upon to enact it appears she said as if the whole story might be a fabrication and the senator determined to prove it so i hope with all my heart he will by the time they reached their seats the news of their arrival had made the circle of the room bertha herself while she had listened with a smile to her escorts remarks had seen amazement and recognition flash out upon a score of faces but she had preserved her smile intact and still wore it when she took her chair she spoke to blundel waving her fan with a soft even motion we have run the gauntlet she said and we have chosen a good position almost everybody in the room has seen us almost every one in the room is looking at us let them look he answered i have no objection to it ah they will look she returned and we came to beto be looked at and it is very good of you to have no objections do i seem perfectly at ease i hope sothough i am entirely well aware that at least a hundred people are discussing me is the expression of my eyes goodcareless enough yes child yes he answered a little uneasily there was an undertone in her voice which troubled him much as he admired her spirit and selfcontrol thank you she said here is a bold man coming to ask me to dance i told you the men would not be afraid of me i think if you approve of it i will dance with him go and dance he answered when her partner bore her away he took charge of her flowers and wrap in the most valiant manner and carried them with him when he went to pay his respects to the matrons of his acquaintance who sat against the wall discussing with each other the most exciting topic of the hour and who when he addressed them questioned him as closely as goodbreeding would permit upon all subjects likely to cast light upon this topic never was at a ball in my life before he admitted asked mrs amory to bring me wanted to see how i should like it with mrs amory remarked matron no she is dancing i believe yes he said goodnaturedly she will be dancing all night i suppose and i shall be carrying her flowers but i dont mind itin fact i rather like it i dare say there are two or three young fellows who would be glad enough to be in my place i have no doubt was the reply she has been very popularand very gay she is very popular with me said the senator though i am an old fogy and dont count we are great friends and i am very proud to be her escort tonight i feel i am making my dbut under favorable circumstances there could be no doubt of his sentiments after that he was her friend he admired her he even made a point of saying so what became of the story of the scandal it seemed to have ended in nothing and worse than nothing there was something a little ridiculous about such a tame termination to such an excitement one or two of the ladies who had found it most absorbing looked aimlessly into space and an embarrassed silence fell upon them bertha ended her dance and returned to her seat her color was even brighter than before and her smile was more brilliant for a few moments a little group surrounded her and her programme was half full blundel came back to his post like a sentinel if she had been looked at before she was regarded now with a double eagerness those who were not dancing watched her every movement even those who danced asked each other questions the group about her chair was added to and became gayer but there were no women numbered in the circle the general wonder was as to what would be done in the end so far round dances only had been danced the next dance was a quadrille the music struck up and the dancers began to take their places as they did so a party entered the room and made its way toward the end where the group stood about the chair bertha did not see it she was just rising to take her station in the set nearest to her the matron of the party who was a figure so familiar in social circles as to be recognized at once by all who saw her was accompanied by her daughter and an escort it was the wife of the secretary of state and her cavalier was colonel tredennis there is mrs amory she said to him as they approached she is taking her place in the quadrille one moment if you please experience had taught her all that might be feared and a quick eye showed her that something was wrong bertha advanced to her place laughing a little at some jest of her partners she had not seen who the dancers were the jest and the laugh ended and she looked up at her visvis the lady at his side was not smiling she was gazing steadily at bertha herself it seemed as if she had been waiting to catch her eye it was the great lady and having carried the figurative pebble until this fitting moment she threw it she spoke two or three words to her partner took his arm turned her back and walked away bertha turned rather pale she felt the blood ebb out of her face there was no mistaking the significance of the action and it had not escaped an eye this was more than she had thought of she made a movement with what intention she herself was too much shaken to know and in making it her eyes fell upon a face whose expression brought to her an actual shock of relief it was the face of the kind and generous gentlewoman who had just entered and who at this moment spoke to her daughter my dear she said i think you promised colonel tredennis the first quadrille go and take that vacant place and when you speak to mrs amory ask her to come and talk to me a little as soon as the dance is over there was a tone of gentle decision in her voice and a light in her eye which were not lost upon the bystanders she gave bertha a bow and smile and sat down the most fastidious woman in washingtonthe woman who drew her lines so delicately that she had even been called almost too rigorous the woman whose wellknown good taste and good feeling had given her a power mere social position was powerless to bestowhad taken the subject of the hours scandal under her protection and plainly believed nothing to her discredit in five minutes the whole room was aware of it she had greeted mrs amory cordially she had openly checkmated an antagonist she had sent her own daughter to fill the place left vacant in the dance she would not have done that if she had not had the best of reasons it was said and senator blundel would scarcely be here if the story had been true he has told several of his friends that he is here to prove that it is not true he denied it again and again yesterday it was denied in one of the morning papers and they say he kept it out of the rest because he was determined she should not be more publicly discussed she is not one of the women who have been in the habit of giving rise to discussion she is a pretty femininelooking little creature poor girl it must have been bitter enough for her rather fine of old blundel to stand by her in this way he would not do it if there was not something rather fine in her he is not a ladies man old sam blundel look at him how he looms up behind his bouquet the tide of public opinion had taken a turn before the dance had ended two or three practical matrons who were intimately known to colonel tredennis friendly supporter had made their way to her and asked her opinion and intentions frankly and had received information calculated to set every doubt at rest it is scarcely necessary for me to speak of my opinion of the matter the lady said when we have the evidence of senator blundels presence here with mrs amory tonight i should feel myself unpardonably in the wrong if i did not take the most open measures in the defence of the daughter of my old friend who has been treated most unjustly and i cannot help hoping that she will have other defenders than myself several of the matrons so addressed were seated within speaking range when bertha came to her friend at the close of the dance and she recognized at once on approaching them that she need fear them no longer but she could not say much in response to their greetings she answered them briefly bowed slightly and sat down in the chair near the woman who had protected her she could even say but little to her the color had died out of her face at last the strain she had borne so long had reached its highest tension tonight and the shock of the moment received through an envious womans trivial spite slight as it might have been in itself represented too much to her as he had passed her in the dance and touched her hand tredennis had felt it as cold as ice and the look of her quiet white face had been almost more than he could bear to see bertha he had said to her once for gods sake take courage but she had not answered him a few months ago she would have given him a light flippant reply if her very soul had been wrung within her but now she was past that as she sat afterwards by the wife of the secretary of state her hand shook as she held her fan you were very kind to me just now she said in a low voice i cannot express my thanks as i wish my dear was the reply do not speak of it i came to take care of you i think you will have no more trouble but i am afraid this has been too much for you you are shivering a little i am cold bertha answered ifeel as ifsomething strange had happened to me it was not so before i seemto have lost courage but you must not lose courage yet she said with a manner at once soft and firm a great many people are looking at you they will be very curious to know how you feel it is best that you should not let them see she spoke rather rapidly but in a low voice no one near could hear she was smiling as if the subject of the conversation was the least important in the world listen to me she said in the same manner and try to look as if we were speaking of ordinary topics i dare say you feel as if you would prefer to go away but i think you must remain everybody here must understand that you have friends who entirely disbelieve all that has been said against you and also that they wish to make their confidence in you public i should advise you to appear to enjoy yourself moderately well i think i wish you to dance several times again i think there will be no difficulty in arranging the next square dance when the presidential party arrives the president will i have no doubt be pleased to talk to you a little it would be republican to say that it is absurd to consider that such a thing can be of consequence but there are people with whom it will have weight as soon as possible i shall send you down to the supperroom with senator blundel a glass of wine will do you good here is senator blundel now do you think you can talk to him in your usual manner i will try said bertha and if i do not i think he will understand he did understand the little incident had been no more lost upon him than upon others he was glowing with repressed wrath and sympathy and the desire to do something which should express his feeling he saw at once the change which had come upon her and realized to the full all that it denoted when he bore her off to the supperroom he fairly bristled with defiance of the lookerson who made way for them confound the woman he said if it had only been a man he found her the most desirable corner in the supperroom and devoted himself to her service with an assiduity which touched her to the heart you have lost your color he said that wont do we must bring it back i am afraid it will not come back she answered and it did not even though the tide had turned and that it had done so became more manifest every moment they were joined shortly by colonel tredennis and his party and by mrs merriam and hers it was plain that mrs amory was to be alone no more people who had been unconscious of her existence in the ballroom suddenly recognized it as she sat surrounded by her friends the revulsion of feeling which had taken place in her favor expressed itself in a hundred trifles but her color was gone and returned no more though she bore herself with outward calmness it was colonel tredennis who was her first partner when they returned to the ballroom he had taken a seat near her at the suppertable and spoken a few words to her will you give me a place on your card bertha he had said and she had handed it to him in silence he was not fond of dancing and they had rarely danced together but he wished to be near her until she had had time to recover herself better he than another man who might not understand so well he knew how to be silent at least so they went through their dance together exchanging but few words and interested spectators looked on and one or two remarked to each other that upon the whole it appeared that mrs amory was rather well supported and that there had evidently been a mistake somewhere and then the colonel took her back to her seat and there were new partners and between the dances one matron after another found the way to her and influenced by the general revulsion of feeling exhibited a cordiality and interest in marked contrast with the general bearing at the outset of the evening perhaps there were those who were rather glad to be relieved of the responsibility laid upon them when the presidential party arrived it was observed that the president himself was very cordial when he joined the group at the end of the room the centre figure of which was the wife of his friend and favorite cabinet officer it was evident that he at least had not been affected by the gossip of the hour his greeting of mrs amory was marked in its kindness and before he went away it was whispered about that he also had felt an interest in the matter when it had reached his ears and was not sorry to have an opportunity of indirectly expressing his opinion the great lady took her departure in bitterness of spirit the dances went on bertha went through one after another and between her waltzes held her small court and was glanced at askance no more any slight opposition which might have remained would have been overpowered by the mere force of changed circumstances before the evening was at an end it had become plain that the attempt to repress and overwhelm little mrs amory had been a complete failure and had left her better defended than it had found her but she has lost something senator blundel said to himself as he watched her dancing confound iti can see itshe is not what she was three months ago she is not what she was when she came into the room tredennis also recognized the change which had come upon her and before long knew also that she had seen his recognition of it and that she made no effort to conceal it from him he felt that he could almost have better borne to see her old careless gayety which he had been wont to resent in secret bitterness of heart once when they chanced to stand alone together for a moment she spoke to him quickly is it late she asked we seem to have been here so long i have danced so much will it not soon be time to go home do you want to go home he asked yes she answered almost breathlessly the music seems so loud it bewilders me a little how gay it is how the people dance the sound and motion make me blind and dizzy philip the tone in which she uttered his name was so low and tense that he was startled by it what is it he asked if there are many more dances i am afraidi cannot go through themi thinki am breaking down and i must noti must not tell me what to do he made a movement so that he stood directly before her and shielded her from the observation of those near them he realized the danger of the moment look up at me he said try to fix your eyes on me steadily this feeling will pass away directly you will go soon and you must not break down do not let yourself be afraid that you will she obeyed him like a child trying to look at him steadily tell me one more dance will be enough she said and say you will dance it with me if you can i will he answered and you need not speak a word when the senator found himself alone in the carriage with her his sense of the triumph achieved found its expression in words well he said i think we have put an end to that story yes bertha answered they will not say anything more about me you have saved me from that she leaned forward and looked out of the window carriages blocked the street and were driving up and driving away policemen were opening and shutting doors and calling names loudly a few streetarabs stood on the pavement and looked with envious eyes at the bright dresses and luxurious wraps of the party passing under the awning the glare of gaslight fell upon a pretty face upturned to its companions and a girls laugh rang out on the night air bertha turned away she looked at senator blundel her own face had no color i think she saidi think i have been to my last ball nono he answered thats nonsense you will dance at many a one i think she saidi think this is the last senator blundel did not accompany her into the house when they reached it he left her at the door almost wringing her small cold hand in his stout warm one come he said you are tired now and no wonder but tomorrow you will be better you want sleep and you must have it go in child and go to bed goodnight god bless you you willbe better tomorrow she went through the hall slowly intending to go to her room but when she reached the parlor she saw that it was lighted she had given orders that the servants should not sit up for her and the house was silent with the stillness of sleep she turned at the parlor door and looked in a fire still burned in the grate her own chair was drawn up before it and in the chair sat a figure the sight of which caused her to start forward with an exclamationa tall slender old figure his gray head bowed upon his hand papa she cried can it be you papa what has happened he rose rather slowly and looked at her it was evident that he had been plunged in deep thought his eyes were heavy and he looked aged and worn he put out his hand took hers and drew her to him my dear he said my dear child she stood quite still for a moment looking up at him you have come to tell me something she said at length in a low almost monotonous voice and it is something about richard it is somethingsomething wretched a slight flush mounted to his cheeka flush of shame yes he answered it is something wretched she began to shake like a leaf but it was not from fear then do not be afraid she said there is no need richardhas not spared me it was the first time through all she had borne and hidden through all the years holding for her suffering and bitterness and disenchantment which had blighted all her youthit was the first time she had permitted her husbands name to escape her lips when she could not compel herself to utter it gently and that at last he himself had forced such speech from her was the bitterest indignity of all and if she felt this the professor felt it keenly too he had marked her silence and selfcontrol at many a time when he had felt that the fire that burned in her must make her speak but she had never spoken and the dignity of her reserve had touched him often what is it that richard has done now papa she said he put a tremulous hand into his pocket and drew forth a letter richard he saidrichard has gone abroad she had felt that she was to receive some blow but she had scarcely been prepared for this she repeated his words in bewilderment richard has gone abroad the professor put his hand on her shoulder sit down my dear he said you must sit down there was a chair near her it stood by the table on which the professor had been wont to take his cup of tea she turned and sat down in this chair and resting her elbows on the table dropped her forehead upon her hands the professor drew near to her side his gentle refined old face flushed and paled alternately his hands were tremulous he spoke in a low agitated voice my dear he said i find it very hard to tell you allall i have discovered it is very bitter to stand here upon your husbands hearth and tell youmy child and his wifethat the shadow of dishonor and disgrace rests upon him he has not been truthful we havebeen deceived she did not utter a word for some time i have been anxious he went on but i blame myself that i was not anxious sooner i am not a business man i have not been practical in my methods of dealing with him the fault was in a great measure mine his nature was not a strong oneit was almost impossible for him to resist temptation i knew that and should have remembered it i have been very blind i did not realize what was going on before my eyes i thought his interest in the westoria scheme was only one of his many whims i was greatly to blame no said bertha it was not you who were to blame i was more blind than youi knew him better thanthan any one else a short time ago said the professor i received a letter from an old friend who knows a great deal of my business affairs he is a business man and i have been glad to entrust him with the management of various investments in this manner he knew something of the investment of the money which was yours he knew more of richards methods than richard was aware of he had heard rumors of the westoria land scheme and had accidentally in the transaction of his business made some discoveries he asked me if i knew the extent to which your fortune had been speculated with knowing a few facts he was able to guess at others bertha lifted her face from her hands my money she exclaimed my fortune he had speculated with it at various times sometimes gaining sometimes losing the westoria affair seems to have dazzled himand he invested largely bertha rose from her chair it was philip tredennis money he invested she said philip tredennis it was not philips money the professor answered that i have discovered but it was philips generosity which would have made it appear so in this letterwritten just before he sailedrichard has admitted the truth to mefinding what proof i had against him bertha lifted her hands and let them fall at her sides papa she said i do not understand thisi do not understand philip tredennis he gave money to richard richard accepted money from himto shield himself tothis is too much for me philip had intended the money for janey said the professor and when he understood how richard had involved himself and how his difficulties would affect you and your future he made a most remarkable offer he offered to assume the responsibility of richards losses he did not intend that you should know what he had done such a thing would only have been possible for philip tredennis and it was because i knew him so well that when i heard that it was his money that had been risked in the westoria lands i felt that something was wrong he was very reticent and that added to my suspicions then i made the discoveries through my friend and my accusations of richard forced him to admit the truth the truth said berthathat i was to live upon philip tredennis money that having been ruined by my husband i was to be supported by philip tredennis bounty richard was in despair said the professor and in his extremity he forgot he forgot me said bertha yes he forgota great many things it has seemed always to be philip who has remembered said the professor sadly philip has been generous and thoughtful for us from first to last berthas hand closed itself yes she cried always philipalways philip what could have been finer and more delicate than his care and planning for you in this trouble of the last few days to which i have been so blind said the professor his care and planning echoed bertha turning slowly toward him his did you not hear that senator blundel it was he who went to senator blundel the professor answered it was he who spoke to the wife of the secretary of state i learned it from mrs merriam out of all the pain we have borne or may have to bear the memory of philips faithful affection for us he did not finish his sentence bertha stopped him her clenched hand had risen to her side and was pressed against it it was philip who came to me in my trouble in virginia she said it was philip who saw my danger and warned me of it when i would not hear him but i could not know that i owed him such a debt as this we should never have known it from him the professor replied he would have kept silent to the end bertha looked at the clock upon the mantel it is too late to send for him now she said it is too late and a whole night must pass before before you say to himwhat asked the professor before i tell him that richard made a mistake she answered with white and trembling lips that he must take his money backthat i will not have it she caught her fathers arm and clung to it looking into his troubled face papa she said will you take me home again i think you must if you will there seems to be no place for me if you will let me stay with you until i have time to think the professor laid his hand upon hers and held it closely my dear he said my home is yours it has never seemed so much mine since you left it but this may not be so bad as you think i do not know how much we may rely upon richards hopesthey are not always to be relied uponbut it appears that he has hopes of retrieving some of his losses through a certain speculation he seems to have regarded as a failure but which suddenly promises to prove a success i have never thought of being poor said bertha i do not think i should know how to be poor but somehow it is not the money i am thinking of that will come later i suppose i scarcely seem to realize yet her voice and her hand shook and she clung to him more closely everything has gone wrong she said wildly everything must be altered no one is left to care for me but you no one must do it but you now that richard has gone it is not philip who must be kind to menot philipphilip last of all not philip he echoed not philip and as he said it they both heard feet ascending the steps at the front door my child said the professor that is philip now he spoke of calling in on me on his way home perhaps he has been anxious at finding me out so late i do not understand youbut must i go and send him away no she answered shuddering a little as if with cold it is for me to send him away but i must tell him first about the money i am glad he has come i am glad another night will not pass without his knowing i think i want to speak to him aloneif you will send him here and wait for a little while in the library she did not see her fathers face as he went away from her he did not see hers she turned and stood upon the hearth with her back toward the door she stood so when a few minutes afterward philip tredennis came in she stood so until he was within a few feet of her then she moved a little and looked up what she saw in him arrested for the moment her power to speak and for that moment both were silent often as she had recognized the change which had taken place in him often as the realization of it had wrung her heart and wrung it all the more that she had understood so little she had never before seen it as she saw it then all the weariness the anxious pain the hopeless sadness of his past seemed to have come to the surface he could endure no more he had borne the strain too long and he knew too well that the end had come no need for words to tell him that he must lose even the poor and bitter comfort he had clung to he had made up his mind to that when he had defended her against the man who himself should have been her defence so he stood silent and his deep eyes looked out from his strong worn haggard face holding no reproach full only of pity for her there was enough to pity in her if she saw anguish in his eyes what he saw in hers as she uplifted them he could scarcely have expressed in any words he knew surely there were no words into which he could have put the pang their look gave him telling him as it did that she had reached the point where she could stand on guard no more richard she said at length has gone away that i knew he answered when she asked i had a letter from him this morning he said you did not wish to tell me she returned i thought he began that perhapsand stopped you thought that he would write to me too she said hedid not he did not speak and she went on when i returned tonight she said papa was waiting for me he had received a letter too and it told himsomething he suspected beforesomething i had not suspectedsomething i could not know her voice broke and when she began again there was a ring of desperate appeal to it when i was a girl she said when you knew me long ago what was there of good in me that you should have remembered it through all that you have known of me since thenthere must have been somethingsomething good or touchingsomething more than the goodness in yourselfthat made you pitiful of me and generous to me and anxious for my sake tell me what it was it was he said and his own voice was low and broken too and his deep and sad eyes wore a look she had never seen beforethe look that in the eyes of a woman would have spoken of welling tearsit wasyourself myself she cried oh if it was myself and there were goodness and truth and what was worth remembering in me why did it not save me from what i have beenand from what i am today i do not think i meant to live my life so badly then i was only careless and happy in a girlish way i had so much faith and hope and believed so much in all good things and yet my life has all been wrong and i seem to believe no more and everything is lost to me and since the days when i looked forward there is a gulf that i can never never pass again she came nearer to him and a sob broke from her what am i to say to you she said now that i know all that you have done for me while iwhile iwhy should you have cared to protect me i was not kind to youi was not careful of your feelings no he answered youwere not i used to think that you despised me she went on once i told you so i even tried to give you the reason i showed my worst self to you i was unjust and bitter i hurt you many a time he seemed to labor for his words and yet he labored rather to control and check than to utter them i am going away he said when i made the arrangement with richard of which you know i meant to go away i gathered from what your father said that you mean to render useless my poor effort to be of use to you i cannot she began but she could go no farther when i leave youas i must he said let me at least carry away with me the memory that you were generous to me at the last at the last she repeated after him the last she uttered a strange little inarticulate cry he saw her lift up one of her arms look blindly at the bracelet on her wrist drop it at her side and then stand looking up at him there was a moment of dead silence janey shall take the money she said i cannot what the change was that he saw come over her white face and swaying figure he only felt as he might have felt a blow in the dark from an unknown hand what the great shock was that came upon him he only felt in the same way she sank upon the sofa clinging to the cushion with one shaking hand suddenly she broke into helpless sobbing like a childs tears streaming down her cheeks as she lifted her face in appeal you have been good to me she said you have been kind be good to mebe kind to meonce more you must go awayand i cannot take from you what you want to give me but i am not so bad as i have seemedor so hard what you have wished me to be i will try to be i will live for my children i will beas goodas i can i will do anything you tell me to dobefore you leave me i will live all my life afterwardas bertha herrick might have lived it only do not ask me to take the money for a few seconds all the room was still when he answered her she could barely hear his voice i will ask of you nothing he said he lifted her hand and bowed his head over it then he laid it back upon the cushion it lay there as if it had been carved from stone goodby he said goodby he saw her lips part but no sound came from them so he went away he scarcely felt the floor beneath his feet he saw nothing of the room about him it seemed as if there was an endless journey between himself and the door through which he was to pass the extremity of his mortal agony was like drunkenness when he was gone she fell with a shudder and lay still with her cheek against the crimson cushion the professor was sitting at her bedside when she opened her eyes again her first recognition was of his figure sitting the head bowed upon the hand as she had seen it when she came first into the house papa she said you are with me yes my dear he answered andthere is no one else no my dear she put out her hand and laid it upon his arm he thought with a bitter pang that she did it as she had often done it in her girlhood and that in spite of the change in her she wore a look which seemed to belong to those days too you will stay with me she said i have come back to you chapter xl miss jessup was very eloquent in the paragraph which she devoted to the announcement of the departure of colonel tredennis the wellknown hero of the plains whose fine bronzed face and soldierly figure have become so familiar to us during the past three seasons she could scarcely express the regret felt by the many friends he had made on losing him and indeed there ran throughout the flowers of speech a suggestion of kindly admiring sympathy and womanly goodfeeling which quite went to the colonels heart and made him wonder at his own good fortune when he read the paragraph in question he was far away from washington when the paper reached him he had become tired of life at the capital it was said and had been glad to exchange with a man who found its gayeties better suited to him it is true he said to himself when he heard of this report that they were not suited to me nor i to them how he lived through the weeks performing the ordinary routine of his duty and bearing with him hour by hour night and day the load of grief and wellnigh intolerable anguish which he knew was never to be lighter he did not know the days came and went it was morning noon or night and he did not feel the hours either long or short there were nights when his work being done he returned to his quarters and staggered to his seat falling upon it blind and sick with the heavy horror of the day this he would say again and again this is unnatural to bear such torture and live through it seems scarcely human sometimes he was so wrought upon by it physically that he thought he should not live through it but he bore so much that at last he gained a hopeless faith in his own endurance he was not alone it was as he had told her it would be from the hour that he looked his last upon her it seemed that her face had never faded from before his aching eyes he had all the past to live over again all its bitter mysteries to read in a new light and to learn to understand there was time enough now for him to think it all over slowly to recall to his mind every look and change and tone her caprices her coldness the wounds she had given him he bore them all again and each time he came back with a pang more terrible to that last momentto that last look to her last broken words o god he cried does she bear this too he knew nothing of her save what he gained at rare intervals from miss jessups society column which he read deliberately from beginning to end as each paper reached him the friends of mrs amory miss jessups first statement announced would regret to learn that the health of that charming young wife and mother was so far from being what was to be desired that it necessitated a temporary absence from those social circles of which she was so bright and graceful an ornament for a while her name was missing from the lists of those who appeared at the various entertainments and then he began occasionally to see it again and found a little sad comfort in the thought that she must be stronger his kind brown face changed greatly in these days it grew lean and haggard and hopeless and here and there a gray thread showed itself in his close soldiercropped hair he planned out heavy work for himself and kept close in his quarters and those of his friends who had known him before his stay in washington began to ask each other what had so broken philip tredennis the first time that mrs amory appeared in society after her indisposition was at the house of her friend mrs sylvestre during her temporary seclusion she had seen mrs sylvestre frequently there had been few days when agnes had not spent some hours with her when she had been denied to every one else agnes was admitted it is only fatigue this bertha had said but other people tire me so you never tire me she was not confined to her bed she had changed her room taking possession of the pretty pink and blue chamber and lay upon the sofa through the days sometimes looking at the fire often with her eyes closed the two conversed but little frequently there was silence between them for some time but agnes knew that she was doing as bertha wished when she came and sat with her at the end of a week mrs sylvestre came in one morning and found bertha dressed and sitting in a chair i am going downstairs she said do you think you are strong enough agnes asked she did not look so i must begin to try to do something was the indirect reply one must always begin i want to lie still and not speak or move but i must not do that i will go downstairs and i think i should like to see laurence as she went down the staircase she moved very slowly and agnes saw that she clung to the balustrade for support when she reached the parlor door she paused for a moment then crossed the threshold a little hurriedly and went to the sofa and sat down she was tremulous and tears had risen to her eyes from very weakness i thought i was stronger she said but she said nothing more until a few moments later she began to speak of tom and kitty in whom she had been much interested it had been at her suggestion that after divers fruitless efforts the struggle to obtain tom a place had been abandoned and finally there had been procured for him a position likely to prove permanent in a house of business where principles might be of value toms lungs were still a trifle delicate but he was rapturously happy in the small home to purchase which mrs sylvestre had advanced the means and his simple bliss was greatly added to by the advent of kittys baby so they talked of tom and kitty and the baby and of arbuthnot and his friendship for them and the oddities of it and his way of making his efforts and kindness seem more than half a jest no one can be kinder than laurence bertha said no one could be a truer friend i think so now agnes answered quietly he is not so light after all said bertha perhaps few of us are quite as light as we seem i did him injustice at first agnes replied i understand him better now if he should go away you would miss him a little said bertha he is a person one misses when he is absent does heagnes began i have not heard him speak of going away there is just a likelihood of it bertha returned papa has been making an effort for him with the secretary of state he might be sent abroad i have not heard him refer to the possibility said agnes her manner was still quiet but she had made a slight involuntary movement which closed the book she held i do not think papa has spoken to him for some time bertha replied and when he first referred to his plan laurence thought it out of the question and did not appear to regard it seriously for a few moments mrs sylvestre did not speak then she said certainly it would be much better for him than to remain here if he should go said bertha no one will miss him as i shall we used to be so gay together and now she did not end her sentence and for a while neither of them spoke again and she lay quite still agnes remained to dine with her and in the evening arbuthnot came in when he entered the bright familiar room he found himself glancing round it trying to understand exactly what mysterious change had come upon it there was no change in its belongingsthe touches of color the scattered trifles the pictures and draperies wore their oldtime look of having been arranged by one deft hand but it did not seem to be the room he had known so longthe room he had been so fond of and had counted the prettiest and most inspiring place he knew bertha had not left the sofa she was talking to agnes who stood near her she had a brilliant flush on her cheeks her eyes were bright when she raised them to greet him and her hand as he took it was hot and tremulous naturally she said you will begin to vaunt yourself you told me i should break down if i did not take care of myself and i have broken downa little i am reduced to lying on sofas dont you know how i always derided women who lie on sofas this is retribution but dont meet it with too haughty and vainglorious a spirit before lent i shall be as gay as ever i dont doubt it he answered but in the meantime allow me to congratulate you on the fact that the sofa is not entirely unbecoming thank you she said will you sit down now and tell metell me what people are saying ofhe began she smiled of me she answered they were saying a great deal of me a week ago tell me what they say now you must hear in going your giddy rounds you are very well treated he replied there is a certain great lady who is most uncomfortably commented upon i can scarcely imagine that she enjoys it her smile ended in a fatigued sigh the tide turned very quickly she said it is well for me that it did i should not have had much mercy if i had stood alone ah it was a good thing for me that you were all so brave you might have deserted me tooit would have been very simpleand thenthen the gates of paradise would have been shut against me that figure of speech meaning suggested arbuthnot that i should have been invited to no more dinnerparties and receptions that nobody would have come up to my thursday evenings that miss jessup would never again have mentioned me in the wabash gazette that would have been very bitter he answered yes she returned it would have been bitter indeed do you know he said next that i have come tonight partly for the reason that i have something to tell you i rather suspected it she replied though i could scarcely explain why am i to hear it too inquired agnes if you are kind enough to be interested he answered it will seem a slight enough affair to the world at large but it seems rather tremendous to me i feel a trifle overpowered and nervous through the kind efforts of professor herrick i have been honored with the offer of a place abroad bertha held out her hand minister to the court of st james she said how they will congratulate themselves in london they would he replied if an illadjusted and singularly unappreciative government had not particularized a modest corner of germany as standing in greater need of my special abilities but he took her offered hand when he glanced at mrs sylvestretruth to say he had taken some precautions against seeing her at all as he made his announcementhe found her bestowing upon him one of the calmest of her soft reflective looks i used to like some of those quiet places in germany she said but you will find it a change from washington i think he answered that i should like a change from washington and as soon as he had spoken he detected the touch of acrid feeling in his words i should fancy myself she said her soft look entirely undisturbed that it might be agreeable after one had been here some time he had always admired beyond expression that touch of halfforgetful pensive calmness in her voice and eyes but he did not enjoy it just now it is a matter of temperament i suppose was his thought but after all we have been friends neither could it be said that he enjoyed the pretty and picturesque stories of german life she told afterward they were told so well that they brought very near the life he might expect to lead and he was not exactly in the mood to care to stand face to face with it but he controlled himself sufficiently to make an excellent audience and never had been outwardly in better spirits than he was after the stories were told he was cool and vivacious he told a story or two himself he was in good voice when he went to the piano and sang they were all laughing when agnes left the room to put on her wraps to return home when she was gone the laugh died down with odd suddenness larry said bertha do you really want to go no he answered turning sharply i dont want to go i loathe and abhor the thought of it you want she said to stay here yes i do was his reply and that decides me to go she asked watching his pale disturbed face yes to go there is nothing to stay here for i need the change i have been here long enoughtoo long yes she returned i think you have been here too long you had better go awayif you think there is nothing to stay for when a man has nothing to offerhe broke off and flushed up hotly if i had a shadow of a right to a reason for staying he exclaimed do you suppose i should not hold on to it and fight for it and demand what belonged to me there might be a strugglethere would be but no other man should have one jot or tittle that persistence and effort might win in time for me a man who gives up is a fool i have nothing to give up i havent even the right to surrender i hadnt the right to enter the field and take my wounds like a man it is pleasant to reflect that it is my ownfault i trifled with my life now i want it and i cant get it back ah she said that is an old story and then agnes returned and he took her home on their way there they talked principally of tom and kitty they will miss you greatly agnes said they will be very kind to do it was his reply we shall all miss you she added that will be kinder still he answered might i be permitted to quote the ancient anecdote of the colored warrior who on running away in battle was reproached and told that a single life counted as nothing on such great occasions and that if he had fallen he would not have been missedhis reply to this heroic statement of the case being that he should have been likely to miss himself i shall miss myself and already a gentle melancholy begins to steal over me i am not the gleesome creature i was before good luck befell me but despite this lightness of tone their walk was not a very cheerful one indeed after this speech they were rather quiet and they parted with few words at the door arbuthnot declining to go into the house when agnes entered alone mrs merriam looked up from her novel in some surprise i thought i heard mr arbuthnot she said he left me at the door mrs sylvestre answered what said mrs merriam without coming to say goodnight to me i wanted to tell him what a dissipated evening i have been spending with my new book he has been telling us good news said agnes standing before the fire and loosening her furs he has been offered a consulship mrs merriam closed her book and laid it on the table will he accept it she asked he could scarcely refuse it agnes replied it is a decided advance he likes the life abroad and it might even lead to something better in the future at least one rather fancies such things are an opening it is true reflected mrs merriam that he seems to have no particular ties to hold him in one place rather than another none said agnes i dont know whether that is his fortune or his misfortune his fortune said mrs merriam he is of the nature to know how to value them perhaps after all he may form them if he goes abroad it is not too late perhaps so said agnes that would be another reason why it would be better for him to go still remarked mrs merriam for my own part i dont call it good news that he is going i meant said agnes good news for him it is bad news for us mrs merriam replied he will leave a gap i have grown inconveniently fond of him myself but agnes made no response and soon afterward went to her room in silence she was rather silent the next day when she made her visit to bertha mrs merriam observed that she was rather silent at home but having seen her retire within herself before she was too just to assign a definite reason for her quiet mood still she watched her with great interest which had a fashion of deepening when laurence arbuthnot appeared upon the scene but there was no change in her manner toward arbuthnot she was glad to see him she was interested in his plans her gentle pleasure in his society seemed neither greater nor less than usual her gentle regret at his approaching absence from their circle said absolutely nothing in the gayeties of the closing season they saw even more of each other than usual it will be generous of you to allow me a few additional privileges arbuthnot said an extra dance or so for instance on occasion a few more calls that i am entitled to will you kindly if you please regard me in the light of a condemned criminal and be lenient with me in my last moments she did not refuse to be lenient with him much as he had been in the habit of enjoying the evenings spent in her parlor he had never spent evenings such as fell to him in these last days somehow it happened that he found her alone more frequently mrs merriam had letters to write or was otherwise occupied so it chanced that he saw her as it had not been his fortune to see her very often but it was decided that he was to spend no more winters in washington for some time at least and though he spent his evenings thus agreeably he was making daily preparation for his departure and it cannot be said that he enjoyed the task there had been a time it is true when he would have greeted with pleasure the prospect of the change before him but that time was past i am having my bad quarter of an hour he said and it serves me right but as the days slipped by he found it even a worse quarter of an hour than he had fancied it would be it cost him an effort to bear himself as it was only discretion that he should his one resource lay in allowing himself no leisure when he was not otherwise occupied he spent his time with his friends he was oftenest with the professor and bertha he had some quiet hours in the professors study and in the parlor where bertha sat or lay upon the sofa before the fire she did not allow herself to lie upon the sofa often and refused to be regarded as an invalid but arbuthnot never found himself alone with her without an overpowering realization of the change which had taken place in her but she rarely spoke of herself there is nothing more she said once to say about me she was willing enough to speak of him however and of his future and her gentleness often moved him deeply we have been such good friends she would saysuch good friends it is not often that a man is as true a friend to a woman as you have been to me i wishoh i wish you might be happy it is too late he would reply but i shall not waste time in complaining i will even try not to waste it in regretting but he knew that he did waste it so and that each passing day left a sharper pang behind it and marked a greater struggle there is a great deal of trouble in this world the professor said to him simply after watching him a few minutes one day i should like to know what you are carrying with you to germany i am carrying nothing arbuthnot answered that is my share they were smoking their cigars together and through the blue haze floating about him the professor looked out with a sad face do you he saiddo you leave anything behind you everything said arbuthnot the professor made a disturbed movement perhaps he said this was a mistake perhaps it would be better if you remained it is not yet too late yes it is arbuthnot interposed with a faint laugh and nothing would induce me to remain it was on the occasion of a reception given by mrs sylvestre that he was to make his last appearance in the social world before his departure he had laid his plans in such a manner that having made his adieus at the end of the evening half an hour after retiring from the parlors he would be speeding away from washington on his way to new york it will be a good exit he said and the eye of the unfeeling world being upon me i shall be obliged to conceal my emotions and you will be spared the spectacle of my anguish there were no particular traces of anguish upon his countenance when he presented himself the evening in question having arrived he appeared in fact to be in reasonably good spirits nothing could have been more perfect than the evening was from first to last the picturesque and charming home was at its best mrs sylvestre the most lovely central figure in its picturesqueness mrs merriam even more gracious and amusing than usual the gay world was represented by its gayest and brightest the majority of those who had appeared on the night of the ball appeared again rather late in the evening blundel came in fresh from an exciting debate in the senate and somewhat flushed and elated by it he made his way almost immediately to bertha those who stood about her made way for him as he came she was not sitting alone tonight there seemed no likelihood of her being called upon to sit alone again she had not only regained her old place but something more the professor had accompanied her and at no time was far away from her he hovered gently about in her neighborhood and rarely lost sight of her he had never left her for any great length of time since the night tredennis had gone away he had asked her no questions but they had grown very near to each other and any mystery he might feel that he confronted only made him more tender of her when senator blundel found himself standing before her he gave her a sharp glance of scrutiny well he said you are rested and better and all the rest of it your pink gown is very nice and it gives you a color and brightens you up i chose the shade carefully she answered smiling if it had been deeper it might have taken some color away from me i am glad you like it but you are well he said a little persistently he was not so sure of her after all he was shrewd enough to wish she had not found it necessary to choose her shade with such discretion she smiled up at him again yes i am well she said and i am very glad to see you again but for several seconds he did not answer her standing he looked at her in silence as she remembered his doing in the days when she had felt as if he was asking himself and her a question but she knew it was not the same question he was asking himself now but another one and after he had asked it he did not seem to discover the answer to it and looked baffled and uncertain and even disturbed and anxious and yet her pretty smile did not change in the least at any moment while he regarded her it only deserted her entirely once during the evening this was when she said her last words to arbuthnot he had spent the previous evening with her in her own parlor now before she went awaywhich she did rather earlythey had a few minutes together in the deserted musicroom where he took her while supper was in progress neither of them had any smiles when they went in together and took their seats in a far corner bertha caught no reflected color from her carefully chosen pink suddenly she looked cold and worn laurence she said in a few hoursand stopped he ended for her in a few hours i shall be on my way to new york she looked down at her flowers and then up at him oh she said a great deal will go with you there is no one now who could take from me what you will but that is not what i wanted to say to you will you let me say to you what i have been thinking of for several days and wanting to say you may say anything he answered perhaps she went on hurriedly it will not make any difference when it is said i dont know she put out her hand and touched his arm with it her eyes looked large and bright in their earnest appeal dont be angry with me larry she said we have been such good friendsthe best best friends i am going home soon i shall not stay until the evening is over you must i think until every one is gone away you mightyou might have a few last words to say to agnes there is nothing he replied that i could say to her there might be she said tremulously there might bea few last words agnes might wish to say to you he put his head down upon his hand and answered in a low tone it is impossible that there should be larry she said only you can find out whether that is true or not anddont go away before you are quite sure oh do you remember what i told you oncethere is only one thing in all the world when all the rest are tried and done with so many miss it and then everything is wrong dont be too proud larry dont reason too much if people are true to each other and content what does the rest matter i want to know that some one is happy like that i wish it might be you if i have said too much forgive me but you may be angry with me i will let youif you will not run the risk of throwing anything away there was a silence promise me she said promise me i cannot promise you he answered he left his seat i will tell you he said i am driven tonightdriven i never thought it could be so but it iseven though i fancied i had taught myself better i am bearing a good deal i dont know how far i may trust myself i have not an idea about it it is scarcely safe for me to go near her i have not been near her often tonight i am driven i dont know that i shall get out of the house safely i dont know how far i can go if i do get out of it without coming back and making some kind of an outcry to her one cant bear everything indefinitely it seems to me now that the only decent end to this would be for me to go as quickly as possible and not look back but there never was a more impotent creature than i know i am tonight the sight of her is too much for me she looks like a tall white flower she is a little pale tonightand the look in her eyesi wish she were pale for sorrowfor me i wish she was suffering but she is not she could not tell you if she were said bertha that is very true he answered dont go away she said until you have said goodby to her alone dont you see he replied desperately that i am in the condition to be unable to go until i am actually forced oh he added bitterly rest assured i shall hang about long enough but when he returned to the supperroom and gave his attention to his usual duties he was entirely himself again so far as his outward bearing went he bore about ices and salads and endeared himself beyond measure to dowagers with appetites who lay in wait he received their expressions of grief at his approaching departure with decorum not too grave and sufficiently grateful he made himself as useful and agreeable as usual he is always ready and amiable that mr arbuthnot remarked a wellseasoned elderly matron who recognized useful material when she saw it and agnes who had chanced to see him just as his civilities won him this encomium reflected upon him for a moment with a soft gaze and then turned away with a secret thought her face did not betray at last the rooms began to thin out one party after another took its departure disappearing up the stairs and reappearing afterward descending and passing through the hall to the carriages which rolled up one after another as they were called agnes stood near the doorway with mrs merriam speaking the last words to her guests as they left her she was still a little pale but the fatigues of the evening might easily have left her more so arbuthnot found himself lingering with an agonizing sense of disgust at his folly several times he thought he would go with the rest and then discovered that the step would cost him a struggle to which he was not equal agnes did not look at him mrs merriam did you must not leave us just yet she said we want your last moments it would be absurd to bid you goodnight as if we were to see you tomorrow talk to me until agnes has done with these people he could have embraced her he was perfectly aware that mentally he had lost all his dignity but he could do nothing more than recognize the fact with unsparing clearness and gird at himself for his weakness if i were a boy of sixteen he said inwardly i should comport myself in something the same manner i could grovel at this kind old creatures feet because she has taken a little notice of me but at length the last guest had departed the last carriage had been called and had rolled away agnes turned from the doorway and walked slowly to the fireplace how empty the rooms look she said you should have a glass of wine mrs merriam suggested you are certainly more tired than you should be you are not as strong as i was at your age arbuthnot went for the glass of wine into the adjoining room he was glad to absent himself for a moment in ten minutes i shall be out of the house he said perhaps in five when he returned to the parlor mrs merriam had disappeared agnes stood upon the hearth looking down she lifted her eyes with a gentle smile aunt mildred is going to ask you to execute a little commission for her she said she will be down soon i think for the moment he was sufficiently abandoned and ungrateful to have lost all interest in mrs merriam it seemed incredible that he had only ten minutes before him and yet could retain composure enough to reply with perfect steadiness perhaps he thought desperately i am not going to do it so villanously after all he kept his eyes fixed very steadily upon her the soft calm of her manner seemed to give him a sort of strength nothing could have been sweeter or more unmoved than her voice i was a little afraid you would go away early she said and that we could not bid you goodby quietly dont bid me goodby too quietly he answered you will excuse my emotion i am sure you have been in washington she said long enough to feel sorry to leave it he glanced at the clock i have spent ten years here he said one grows fond of a place naturally yes she replied then she added your steamer sails on wednesday was his answer it was true that he was driven he was so hard driven at this moment that he glanced furtively at the mirror half fearing to find his face ashen my train leaves in an hour he said i will bid you he held out his hand without ending his sentence she gave him her slender cold fingers passively goodby she said mrs merriam was not mentioned she was forgotten arbuthnot had not thought once of the possibility of her return he dropped agnes hand and simply turned round and went out of the room his ten minutes were over it was all over this was his thought as he went up the staircase he went into the deserted upper room where he had left his overcoat it was quite empty the servant in charge having congratulated himself that his duties for the night were over and joined his fellows downstairs one overcoat he had probably fancied might take care of itself especially an overcoat sufficiently familiar with the establishment to outstay all the rest the garment in question hung over the back of a chair arbuthnot took it up and put it on with unnecessary haste then he took his hat then he stopped he sank into the chair and dropped his brow upon his hand he was actually breathless he passed through a desperate moment as he sat there when it was over he rose deliberately freed himself from his coat again and went downstairs when he rentered the parlor agnes rose hurriedly from the sofa leaving her handkerchief on the sidecushion on which there was a little indented spot she made a rapid step toward him her head held erect her eyes at once telling their own story and commanding him to disbelieve it her face so inexpressibly sweet in its sadness that his heart leaped in his side you have left something she said yes he answered i leftyou she sat down upon the sofa without a word he saw the large tears well up into her eyes and they helped him to go on as nothing else would have done i couldnt go away he said there was no use trying i could not leave you in that cold way as if our parting were only an ordinary conventional one there is nothing conventional about my side of it i am helpless with misery i have lost my last shred of selfrespect i had to come back and ask you to be a little kinder to me i dont think you know how cold you were it was like death to drop your hand and turn away like that such a thing must be unendurable to a man who loves a woman he came nearer beggars should be humble he said i am humble enough i only ask you to say goodby a little more kindly her eyes were full and more beautiful than ever she put out her hand and touched the sofa at her side will you sit here she said what he criedi yes she answered scarcely above her breath no one else he took the place and her slender hand i have no right to this he said no one knows that so well as i i am doing a terrible daring thing it is a daring thing for us both she said i have always been afraid but it cost me too much when you went out of the door did it he said and folded her hand close against his breast oh he whispered i will be very tender to you she lifted her soft eyes i think she said that is what i need chapter xli the next six months laurence arbuthnot spent in his quiet corner of germany devoting all his leisure moments to the study of certain legal terms to which he had given some attention at a previous time when partly as a whim partly as the result of a spasm of prudence he had woven himself a strand of thread to cling to in the vague future by taking a course of law his plan now was to strengthen this thread until it might be depended upon and he spared no determined and persistent effort which might assist him to the attainment of this object i find myself an astonishingly resolute person he wrote to agnes i am also industrious resolution and industry never before struck me as being qualities i might lay claim to with any degree of justice dr watts himself with his entirely objectionable bee could not improve each shining hour with more vigor than i do buti have an object and the hours are shining once there seemed no reason for them it is not so now i will confess that i used to hate these things do you repose sufficient confidence in me yet to believe me when i tell you that i actually feel a dawning interest in blackstone and do not shudder at the thought of the lectures i shall attend in paris perhaps i do not reflect upon them with due deliberation and coolnessi cannot help remembering that you will be with me when he resigned his position and went to paris she was with him he had made a brief visit to washington and taken her away leaving mrs merriam to adorn the house in lafayette square and keep its hearth warm until such time as they should return it was when they were in paris that they had the pleasure of meeting mr richard amory who was very well known and exceedingly popular in the american colony he was in the most delightful buoyant spirits he had been very fortunate a certain investment of his had just turned out very well and brought him large returns he was quite willing to talk about it and himself and was enraptured at seeing his friends the news of their marriage delighted him he was enchanting in his warm interest in their happiness he seemed however to have only pleasantly vague views on the subject of the time of his probable return to america there is no actual necessity for it he said and i find the life here delightful bertha and the children will probably join me in the spring and we may ramble about for a year or so and he evidently felt he had no reason to doubt the truth of this latter statement bertha had been present at her friends marriage she had been with her almost constantly during the last days preceding it she found great pleasure in agnes happiness there had been no change in her own mode of life janey and jack went out with her often and when she was at home spent the greater part of the time with her she helped them with their lessons played with them and made a hundred plans for them they found her more entertaining than ever others found her no less entertaining the old bright circle closed about her as before and was even added to mr amory had been called abroad by business and might return at any moment the professor was rarely absent from his daughters parlors when she had her guests about her the people who had been interested in the westoria scheme disappeared or became interested in something else senator planefield had made one call after richards departure and then had called no more bertha had seen him alone for a short time and before he took his leave looking a trifle more florid than usual he had thrown into the grate a bouquet of hothouse roses damn all this he cried savagely what a failure it has been yes said bertha it has been a great failure senator blundel did not disappear he began to like the house again and to miss his occasional evening there if anything deprived him of it he used to come and talk politics with the professor and hear bertha sing his favorite ballads of sentiment during the excitement preceding the presidential election the professor found him absorbingly interesting the contest was a close and heated one and the usual national disasters were prophesied as the inevitable results of the final election of either candidate bertha read her way industriously through the campaign and joined in their arguments with a spirit which gave blundel keen delight she read a great deal to her father and made herself his companion finding that she was able to help him with his work i find great comfort in you my child he said gently to her once when she had been reading do you dearest she answered and she went to him and standing near him touched his gray hair with her cheek i find great comfort in you she said in a low voice we seem to belong to each other as ifa little as if we had been left together on a desert island when she went away for the summer with her children the professor went with her he had never wondered at and pondered over her as he did in these days her incomings and outgoings were as they had always been she shared the summer gayeties and went her way with her world but it was but a short time before the kind old eyes looking on detected in her the lack of all that had made her what she had been in the past they returned to washington the day after the election of the new president their first evening at home was spent in reading the newspapers and discussing the termination of the campaign when bertha rose to go to her room she stood a moment looking at the fire and there was something in her face which attracted the professors attention my dear he said tell me what you are thinking of she lifted her eyes and made an effort to smile but the smile died out and left her face blank and cold i am thinking of the last inaugural ball she said and of larryand richardand of how i danced and laughedand laughedand that i shall never laugh so again bertha he said my child no she said never neverand i did not mean to speak of itonly just for a moment it all came back and she went quickly away without finishing after the election there came the usual temporary lull and the country settled itself down to the peaceful avocation of reading stories of the new presidents childhood and accounts of his daily receptions of interested friends and advisers the only reports of excitement came from the indian country where little disturbances were occurring which caused anxiety among agents and frontiersmen certain tribes were dissatisfied with the arrangements made for them by the government quarrels had taken place and it had become necessary to keep a strict watch upon the movements of turbulent tribes this state of affairs continued throughout the winter the threatened outbreak was an inestimable boon to the newspapers but in spite of the continued threatenings the winter was tided over without any actual catastrophies but we shall have it colonel tredennis said to his fellowofficers i think we cannot escape it he had been anxious for some time and his anxiety increased as the weeks went by it was two days before the inaugural ceremonies that the blow fell the colonel had gone to his quarters rather early a batch of newspapers had come in with the eastern mail and he intended to spend his evening in reading them among these there were washington papers which contained descriptions of the preparations made for the ceremoniesof the triumphal arches and processions of the stands erected on the avenue of the seats before the public buildings of the arrangements for the ball he remembered the belated flags and pennants of four years before the strollers in the streets his own feelings as he had driven past the decorations and at last his words i came in with the administration i wonder if i shall go out with it and what will have happened between now and then he laid his paper down with a heavy sigh even though he had caught a glimpse of miss jessups letter on the first sheet he could not read any more he had had enough the bitter loneliness of the moment overpowered him and he bowed his face upon his arms leaning upon the pile of papers and letters on the table he had made even mentally no complaint in the last month his hair had grown grizzled and his youth had left him only happiness could have brought it back and happiness was not for him every hour of his life was filled with yearning sadness for the suffering another than himself might be bearing sometimes it became intolerable anguish it was so tonight i have no part to play he thought every one is used to my grim face but shepoor childpoor childthey will not let her rest she has worn her smile too well once during the first winter of his stay in washington he had found among a number of others a little picture of herself and had asked her for it it was a poor little thing evidently lightly valued but he had often recalled her look and words as she gave it to him nobody ever wanted it before she had said they say it is too sad to be like me i do not mind that so much i think i had rather a fancy for it yes you may have it if you wish i have been gay so longlet me be sad for a little while if it is only in a picture he had carried it with him ever since he had no other relic of her he took it from his breastpocket now and looked at it with aching eyes so long he said so long and then again poor child poor child the next instant he sprang to his feet there was a sound of hurried feet a loud knocking at his door which was thrown open violently one of his fellowofficers stood before him pale with excitement tredennis he said the indians have attacked the next settlement the devils have gone mad you are wanted tredennis did not speak he gave one glance round the room with its blazing fire and lonely soldierly look then he put the little picture into his pocket and went out into the night chapter xlii in all her honest hardworked little life miss jessup had never done more honest hard work than she was called upon to do on the day of the inauguration she had written into the small hours the night before she had described bunting and arches evergreens and grand stands the visiting regiments club uniforms bands banners torchlights and speeches and on the eventful day she was up with the dawn arranging in the most practicable manner her plans for the day with letters containing a full and dramatic description of the ceremonies to be written to four western papers and with extra work upon the washington weekly and daily there was no time to be lost miss jessup lost none each hour of the day was portioned offeach minute almost now she was to take a glance at the procession from the steps of the treasury now she was to spend a few moments in a balcony overlooking another point she was to see the oath administered hear the presidents address and form an estimate of his appreciation of the solemnity of the moment she was to take his temperature during the afternoon and be ready to greet him at the ball and describe dresses uniforms decorations flags and evergreens again even as she took her hasty breakfast she was jotting down appropriate items and had already begun an article opening with the sentence rarely has washington witnessed a more brilliant spectacle etc it could scarcely be said that she missed anything when she went her rounds later no familiar face escaped her she recognized people at windows in carriages on platforms among others she caught a glimpse of mrs amory who drove by on her way to the capitol with her father and jack and janey she looks a little tired about the eyes thought miss jessup she has looked a little that way all the season though she keeps going steadily enough they work as hard as the rest of us in their way these society women she will be at the ball tonight i dare say bertha herself had wondered if she would find herself there even as she drove past miss jessup she was thinking that it seemed almost impossible but she had thought things impossible often during the winter which had gone by and had found them come to pass and leave her almost as before gradually however people had begun to miss something in her there was no denying they said that she had lost some of her vivacity and spirit some tone had gone from her voice something of color from her manner perhaps she would get over it amory had not behaved well in the westoria land affair and she naturally felt his absence and the shadow under which he rested very gradually she said to the professor once i think i am retiring from the world i never was really very clever or pretty i dont hide it so well as i used to and people are finding me out often i am a little dull and it is not likely they will forgive me that but she was not dull at home or the professor never thought so she was not dull now as she pointed out objects of interest to jack and janey i wish uncle philip were here cried jack he would have his sword on and be in uniform and he would look taller than all the resttaller than the president the day was very brilliant to the children they were as indefatigable as miss jessup and missed as little as if they had been in search of items the blare of brazen instruments the tramp of soldiers the rattle of arms the rushing crowds the noise and color and excitement filled them with rapture when they finally reached home they were worn out with their delights bertha was not less fatigued but after the nursery was quiet and the children were asleep she came down to dine with the professor and we will go to the ball for an hour she said we cannot submit to having it described to us for the next two weeks by people who were there the truth was that she could not sit at home and listen to the carriages rolling by and watch the dragging hours with such memories as must fill them so at halfpast ten she stood in her room putting the last touches to her toilet and shortly afterward she was driving with the professor toward the scene of the nights gayeties she had seen the same scene on each like occasion since her eighteenth year there was nothing new about it tonight there was some change in dances and music but the same types of people crowded against each other looking on at the dancing pointing out the president asking the old questions and making the old comments young people whirled together in the centre of the ballroom and older ones watched them with some slight wonder at the interest they evinced in the exercise bertha danced only a few quadrilles as she went through them she felt again what she had felt on each such occasion since the night of the ball of the last yearthe music seemed too loud the people too vivacious the gayety about her too tumultuous though judged by ordinary standards there could have been no complaint against it but notwithstanding this feeling she lingered longer than she had intended trying to hide from herself her dread of returning home no one but herself kneweven the professor did not suspecthow empty the house seemed to her and how its loneliness grew and grew until sometimes it overpowered her and became a sort of deadly presence richards empty rooms were a terror to her she never passed their closed doors without a shock at halfpast twelve however she decided to go home she had just ended a dance with a young attach of one of the legations he was a brilliantly hued and graceful young butterfly and danced and talked well there had been a time when she had liked to hear his sharp slightly satirical nonsense and had enjoyed a dance with him she had listened tonight and had used her pretty smile at opportune moments but she was glad to sit down again now she said to him will you be so good as to find my father for me and tell him i will go home i will if i must he answered but otherwise you will if you are amiable she said i blush to own that i am tired i have assisted in the inaugural ceremonies without flinching from their first step until their last and i begin to feel that his excellency is safe and i may retire he found her a quiet corner and went to do her bidding she was partly shielded by some tall plants and was glad of the retreat they afforded her she sat and let her eyes rest upon the moving crowd promenading the room between the dances the music had ceased and she could catch snatches of conversation as people passed her among the rest were a pretty sparklingeyed girl and a young army officer who attracted her she watched them on their way round the circle twice and they were just nearing her for the second time when her attention was drawn from them by the sound of voices near her indian outbreak she heard tredennis news just came in she rose from her seat the speakers were on the other side of the plants one of them was little miss jessup the other a stranger and miss jessup was pale with agitation and professional interest and her notebook trembled in her little birdlike hand colonel tredennis she said oh i knew him i liked himevery one didevery one what are the particulars are they really authenticated oh what a terrible thing we know very few particulars was the answer but those we know are only too well authenticated we shall hear more later the indians attacked a small settlement and a party went from the fort to the rescue colonel tredennis commanded it the indians were apparently beaten off but returned a little child had been left in the house through some misunderstanding and tredennis heard it crying as the indians made their second attack and went after it he was shot as he brought it out in his arms little miss jessup burst into tears and dropped her notebook oh she cried he was a good brave man he was a good man the band struck up a waltz the promenading stopped a score or two of couples took their place upon the floor and began to whirl swiftly past the spot where bertha stood the music seemed to grow faster and faster and louder and still more loud bertha stood still she had not moved when the professor came to her he himself wore a sad griefstricken face he had heard the news too it had not taken it long to travel around the room take me home she said to him philip is dead philip has been killed he took her away as quickly as he could through the whirling crowd of dancers past the people who crowded and laughed and listened to the music of the band keep close to me she said do not let them see my face when they were shut up in the carriage together she sat shuddering for a moment he shuddering also at the sight of the face he had hidden then she trembled into his arms clung to his shoulder cowered down and hid herself upon his knee slipped down kneeling upon the floor of the carriage and clung to him with both her arms i never told you that i was a wicked woman she said i will tell you now alwaysalways i have tried to hide that it was philipphilip poor child he said poor unhappymost unhappy child all the strength of her body seemed to have gone into the wild clasp of her slender arms i have suffered she said i have been broken i have been crushed i knew that i should never see him again but he was alive do you think that i shall some day have been punished enough he clasped her close to his breast and laid his gray head upon her brown one shedding bitter tears we do not know that this is punishment he said no she answered we do not know take me home to my little children let me stay with them i will try to be a good motheri will try she lay in his arms until the carriage stopped then they got out and went into the house when they closed the door behind them and stood in the hall together the deadly silence smote them both they did not speak to each other the professor supported her with his arm as they went slowly up the stairs he had extinguished the light below before they came up all the house seemed dark but for a glow of firelight coming through an open door on the first landing it was the door philip tredennis had seen open the first night when he had looked in and had seen bertha sitting in her nurserychair with her child on her breast there they both stopped before the professors eyes there rose with strange and terrible clearness the vision of a girls bright face looking backward at him from the night the light streaming upon it as it smiled above a cluster of white roses and it was this that remained before him when a moment afterward bertha went into the room and closed the door the end the novels and stories of frances hodgson burnett charles scribners sons publishers we have no hesitation in saying that there is no living writer man or woman who has mrs burnetts

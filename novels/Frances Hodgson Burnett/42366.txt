illustrations by harrison cady the century co new york copyright by the century co published october printed in u s a i am very fond of this story of the cozy lion because i consider it a great credit to me i reformed that lion and taught him how to behave himself the grownup person who reads this story aloud to children must know how to roar the cozy lion i shall never forget the scolding i gave him to begin with one of the advantages of being a fairy even quite a common one is that lions cant bite you a fairy is too little and too light if they snap at you its easy to fly through their mouths and even if they catch you if you just get behind their teeth you can make them so uncomfortable that they will beg you to get out and leave them in peace of course it was all the lions fault that i scolded him lions ought to live far away from people nobody likes lions roaming aboutparticularly where there are children but this lion said he wanted to get into society and that he was very fond of children little fat ones between three and four so instead of living on a desert or in a deep forest or a jungle he took the large cave on the huge green hill only a few miles from a village full of the fattest rosiest little children you ever saw he had only been living in the cave a few days but even in that short time the mothers and fathers had found out he was there and everybody who could afford it had bought a gun and snatched it up even if they saw a donkey coming down the road because they were afraid it might turn out to be a lion as for the mothers they were nearly crazy with fright and dare not let their children go out to play and had to shut them up in top rooms and cupboards and cellars they were so afraid the lion might be hiding behind trees to jump out at them so everything was beginning to be quite spoiled because nobody could have any fun of course if they had had any sense and believed in fairies and had just gone out some moonlight night and all joined hands and danced slowly around in a circle and sung fairies pink and fairies rose fairies dancing on pearly toes we want you oh we want you fairy queens and fairy slaves who are not afraid of lions caves please to come to help us then it would have been all right because we should have come in millions especially if they finished with this verse our troubles we can never tell but if you would come it would all be well particularly silverbell but they hadnt sense enough for thatof course they hadntof course they hadnt which shows what loonies people are but you see i am much nicer than unfairy persons even if i have lost my nice little pink little sweet little temper and if i am cross so when i saw the children fretting and growing pale because they had to be shut up and the mothers crying into their washtubs when they were washing until the water slopped over i made up my mind i would go and talk to that lion myself in a way he wouldnt soon forget it was a beautiful morning and the huge green hill looked lovely a shepherd who saw me thought i was a gold and purple butterfly and threw his hat at methe idiot of course he fell down on his nose and very right and proper too when i got to the cave the lion was sitting outside his door and he was crying he was one of these nastytempered discontented lions who are always thinking themselves injured large round tears were rolling down his nose and he was sniffling but i must say he was handsome he was big and smooth and had the most splendid mane and tail i ever saw he would have been like a king if he had had a nicer expression but there he sat sniffling im so lonely he said nobody calls nobody pays me any attention and i came here for the society no one is fonder of society than i am i sat down on a flowering branch near him and shouted at him whats the use of society when you eat it up i said he jumped up and lashed his tail and growled but at first he could not see me whats it for but to be eaten up he roared first i want it to entertain me and then i want it for dessert where are you who are you im queen crosspatchqueen silverbell as was i said i suppose you have heard of me ive heard nothing good he growled a good chewing is what you want he had heard something about me but not enough the truth was he didnt really believe in fairieswhich was what brought him into trouble by this time he had seen me and he was ignorant enough to think that he could catch me so he laid down flat in the thick green grass and stretched his big paws out and rested his nose on them thinking i would be taken in and imagine he was going to sleep i burst out laughing at him and swung to and fro on my flowery branch do you want to eat me i said youd need two or three quarts of me with sugar and creamlike strawberries that made him so angry that he sprang roaring at my tree and snapped and shook it and tore it with his claws but i flew up into the air and buzzed all about him and he got furiousjust furious he jumped up in the air and lashed his tail and thrashed his tail and crashed his tail and he turned round and round and tore up the grass dont be a silly i said its a nice big tufty sort of tail and you will only wear it out so then he opened his mouth and roared and roared and what do you suppose i did i flew right into his mouth first i flew into his throat and buzzed about like a bee and made him cough and cough and coughbut he couldnt cough me up he coughed and he houghed and he woughed he tried to catch me with his tongue and he tried to catch me with his teeth but i simply made myself tinier and tinier and got between two big fierce white double ones and took one of my fairy workers hammers out of my pocket and hammered and hammered and hammered until he began to have such a jumping toothache that he ran leaping and roaring down the huge green hill and leaping and roaring down the village street to the dentists to get some toothache drops you can just imagine how all the people rushed into their houses and how the mothers screamed and clutched their children and hid under beds and tables and in coalbins and how the fathers fumbled about for guns as for the dentist he locked his door and bolted it and barred it and when he found his gun he poked it out of the window and fired it off as fast as ever he could until he had fired fifty times only he was too frightened to hit anything but the village street was so full of flashes and smoke and bullets that mr lion turned with ten big roars and galloped down the street with guns fired out of every window where the family could afford to keep a gun when he got to his home in the huge green hill he just laid down and cried aloud and screamed and kicked his hind legs until he scratched a hole in the floor of his cave just because im a lion he sobbed just because im a poor sensitive helpless orphan lion nobody has one particle of manners they wont even sell me a bottle of toothache drops and i wasnt going to touch that dentistuntil he had cured me and wrapped up the bottle nicely in paper not a touch was i going to touch him until he had done that he opened his mouth so wide to roar with grief that i flew out of it i had meant to give him a lesson and id given him one when i flew out of his mouth of course his beautiful double teeth stopped aching it was such a relief to him that it made quite a change in his nature and he sat up and began to smile it was a slow smile which spread into a grin even while the teardrops hung on his whiskers my word how nice he said its stopped i had flown to the top of his ear and i shouted down it i stopped it i said and i began it and if you dont behave yourself ill give you earache and that will be worse before i had given him his lesson he would have jumped at me but now he knew better he tried to touch my feelings and make me sorry for him he put one paw before his eyes and began to sniff again i am a poor sensitive lonely orphan lion he said you are nothing of the sort i answered very sharply you are not poor and heaven knows you are not sensitive and you neednt be lonely i dont know whether you are an orphan or notand i dont care you are a nasty illtempered selfish biting chewing thing theres a prejudice against lions he wept people dont like them they never invite them to childrens partiesnice little fat tender childrens partieswhere they would enjoy themselves so muchand the refreshments would be just what they like best they dont even invite them to grownup parties what i want to ask you is this has one of those villagers called on me since i came hereeven a tough one nice stupids they would be if they did i answered he lifted up his right paw and shook his head from side to side in the most mournful way there he said you are just as selfish as the rest everybody is selfish there is no brotherly love or consideration in the world sometimes i can scarcely bear it i am going to ask you another question and it is almost like a riddle who did you ever see try to give pleasure to a lion i got into his ear then and shouted down it as loud as ever i could who did you ever see a lion try to give pleasure to i said you just think over that and when you find the answer tell it to me i dont know whether it was the newness of the idea or the suddenness of it but he turned pale did you ever see a lion turn pale i never did before and it was funny you know peoples skins turn pale but a lions skin is covered with hair and you cant see it so his hair has to turn pale or else you would never know he was turning pale at all this lions hair was a beautiful tawny golden color to begin with and first his whiskers turned white and then his big mane and then his paws and then his body and last his long splendid tail with the huge fluffy tuft on the end of it then he stood up and his tail hung down and he said weakly i do not know the answer to that riddle i will go and lie down in my cave i do not believe i have one friend in this world and he walked into his cave and laid down and sobbed bitterly he forgot i was inside his ear and that he carried me with him but i can tell you i had given him something to think of and that was what he needed this way of feeling that nothing in the world but a lion has a right to be comfortablejust because you happen to be a lion yourselfis too silly for anything i flew outside his ear and boxed it a little come i said crying wont do you any good are you really lonelyreallyreallyreally so that it gives you a hollow feeling he sat up and shook his tears away so that they splashed all about something like rain yes he answered to tell the truth i ami do like society i want friends and neighborsand i dont only want them for dessert i am a sociable lion and am affectionate in my natureand clinging and people run as fast as they can the moment they hear my voice and he quite choked with the lump in his throat well i snapped what else do you expect that overcame him and he broke into another sob i expect kindness he said and invitations to afternoon teasand ggarden parties well you wont get them i interrupted if you dont change your ways if you eat afternoon teas and garden parties as though they were lettuce sandwiches you cant expect to be invited to them so you may as well go back to the desert or the jungle and live with lions and give up society altogether but ever since i was a little tiny liona tiny tiny onei have wanted to get into society i will changei will just tell me what to do and do sit on my ear and talk down it and stroke it it feels so comfortable and friendly you see he had forgotten that he had meant to chew me up so i began to give him advice the first things you will have to do will be to change your temper and your heart and your diet and stop growling and roaring when you are not pleased ill do that ill do that he said ever so quickly you dont want me to cut my mane and tail off do you no you are a handsome lion and beauty is much admired then i snuggled quite close up to his ear and said down it did you ever think how nice a lion would be ifif he were much nicer nno he faltered did you ever think how like a great big cozy lovely dog you are and how nice your big fluffy mane would be for little girls and boys to cuddle in and how they could play with you and pat you and hug you and go to sleep with their heads on your shoulder and love you and adore youif you only lived on breakfast foods and things and had a really sweet disposition he must have been rather a nice lion because that minute he began to look kind of smiley round the mouth and teary round the lasheswhich is part of a piece of poetry i once read oh aunt maria he exclaimed a little slangily i never thought of that it would be nice a lion could be the coziest thing in the worldif he would i went on he jumped up in the air and danced and kicked his hind legs for joy could he could he could he he shouted out oh let me be a cozy lion let me be a cozy lion hooray hooray hooray i would like it better than being invited to buckingham palace little children would just flock to see you and play with you i said and then if they came their mothers and fathers couldnt be kept away they would flock too the smile of joy that spread over his face actually reached his ears and almost shook me off that would be society he grinned the very best i answered children who are real darlings and not imitations come first and then mothers and fathersthe rest just straggle along anywhere when could it begin when could it begin he panted out not i said very firmly until you have tried some breakfast food where shall i get it oh where oh where i will get it of course was my answer then i stood up on the very tip of his ear and put my tiny golden trumpet to my lips and oh how that lion did roll up his eyes to try to catch a glimpse of me and i played this tune to call my fairy workers im calling from the huge green hill tiraliralira the lions cave is cool and still tiraliralira the lion wishes to improve and show hes filled with tender love and not with next door neighbor the lion wishes to be good to fill him full of breakfast food will aid him in his labor bring breakfast food from far and near hell eat a dreadful lot i fear oh tiraliralirala and tiraliraladi a lion learning to be good needs everybodys breakfast food you workers bring ittirala and tiraliraladi then the fairy workers came flying in clouds in three minutes and three quarters they were swarming all over the huge green hill and into the lions cave every one of them with a little sack on his green back they swarmed here and they swarmed there some were cooks and brought tiny pots and kettles and stoves and they began to cook breakfast foods as fast as lightning the lion sat up i forgot to say that he had turned unpale long before this and was the right color again and his mouth fell wide open just with surprise and amazement what amazed him most was that one out of all those thousands of little workers in their green caps and smocks was the least bit afraid of him why what do you think my little skip just jumped up and stood on the end of the lions nose while he asked me a question you never saw anything as funny as that lion looking down the bridge of his nose at him until he squinted awfully he was so interested in him does he take it with sugar and cream your royal silvercrossbellness skip asked me taking off his green cap and bowing low try him with it in both ways i said when the workers had made a whole lot of all the kinds together they poured it into a hollow stone and covered it with sugar and cream ready your highnesses they all called out in chorus is that it said the lion it looks very nice how does one eat it must i bite it dear me no i answered lap it so he began if youll believe me he simply reveled in it he ate and ate and ate and lapped and lapped and lapped and he did not stop until the hollow stone was quite clean and empty and his sides were quite swelled and puffed out and he looked as pleased as punch i never ate anything nicer in my life he said there was a sunday school picnic i once went to a sunday school picnic i shouted so fiercely that he blushed all over the very tuft on his tail was deep rose color who invited you he hung his head and stammered i was not exactly invited he said and didnt go with the school to the picnic groundsbut i should have come back with it at least some of itbut for some men with guns i stamped on his ear as hard as ever i could never let me hear you mention such a subject again i said nobody in society would speak to you if they knew of it he quite shook in his shoesonly he hadnt any shoes ill never even think of it again he said i see my mistake i apologize i do indeed now what do you suppose happened at that very minute if i hadnt been a fairy i should have been frightened to death at that very minute i heard little childrens voices singing like skylarks farther down on the huge green hillactually little children a whole lot of them itit sounds like the sunday school pic the lion began to sayand then he remembered he must not mention the subject and stopped short has your heart changed i said to him are you sure it has i think it has he said meekly but even if it hadnt maam im so full of breakfast food i couldnt eat a strawberry it happened that i had my heart glass with mei can examine hearts with it and see if they have properly changed or not roll over on your back i said i will examine your heart now and the little children on the huge green hill side were coming nearer and nearer and laughing and singing and twittering more like skylarks than ever he rolled over on his back and i jumped off his ear on to his big chest i thumped and listened and looked about until i could see his great heart and watch it beatingthubthubthubthub it actually had changed almost all over except one little corner and as the childrens voices came nearer and nearer and sounded like whole nests full of skylarks let loose even the corner was changing as fast as it could instead of a big ugly dark red fiery heart it was a soft ivory white one with delicate pink spots on it it has changed i cried out you are going to be a great big nice soft cozy thing and you couldnt eat a picnic if you tried and you will never try he was all in a flutter with relief when he got up and stood on his feet and the laughing little voices came nearer and nearer and i flew to the cave door to see what was happening it was really a picnic and goodness how dangerous it would have been if it had not been for me thats the way i am always saving people you notice the little children in the village had grown so tired of being shut up indoors that about fifty of them who were too little to know any better had climbed out of windows and slipped out of doors and crawled under things and hopped over them and had all run away together to gather flowers and wild peachstrawberines and lovely big yellow plumricots which grew thick on the bushes and in the grass on the huge green hill the delicious sweet pink and purple icecreamgrapejuice melons hung in clusters on trees too high for them to reach but they thought they would just sit down under their branches and look at them and sniff and hope one would fall and there they camelittle plump girls and boys in white frocks and with curly headsnot the least bit afraid of anything tumbling down and laughing and picking themselves up and laughing and when they got near the cave one of my working fairies just for fun flew down and lighted on one little girls fat hand she jumped for joy when she saw him and called to the others and they came running and tumbling to see what she had found oh looklook she called out what is he what is he he isnt a birdand he isnt a bee and he isnt a butterfly hes a little teeny weenyweenyweenyweeny wee and he has little green shoes on and little green stockings and a little green smock and a little green hat and hes laughing and laughing and then a boy saw another in the grassand another under a leaf and he shouted out too oh heres anotherheres another and then the workers all began to creep out of the grass and from under the leaves and fly up in swarms and light on the childrens arms and hands and hats and play with them and tickle them and laugh until every child was dancing with fun because they had never seen such things before in their lives i flew back to the lion he was quite nervous it is a picnic i said and now is your chance can you purr yes i can and he began to make a beautiful purring which sounded like an immense velvet cat over a saucer of cream come out then i ordered him smile as sweetly as you can and dont stop purring try to look like a wriggling coaxing dogi will go first and prevent the children from getting frightened so out we went i was riding in his ear and peeping out over the top of it i did not let the children see me because i wanted them to look at the lion and at nothing else what i did was to make them remember in a minute all the nicest lions they had ever seen in pictures or in the circus many of them had never seen a lion at all and the few who had been to a circus had only seen them in big cages behind iron bars and with notices written up dont go near the lions when my lion came out he was smiling the biggest sleepiest curliest sweetest smile you ever beheld and he was purring and he was softly waving his tail he stood still on the grass a moment and then lay down with his big head on his paws just like a huge affectionate coaxing dog waiting and begging somebody to come and pet him and after staring at him for two minutes all the children began to laugh and then one little little girl who had a great mastiff for a friend at home suddenly gave a tiny shout and running to him tumbled over his paws and fell against his mane and hid her face in it chuckling and chuckling that was the beginning of the most splendid fun a picnic ever had every one of them ran laughing and shouting to the lion it was such a treat to them to actually have a lion to play with they patted him they buried their hands and faces in his big mane they stroked him they scrambled up on his back and sat astride there little boys called out hello lion hello lion and little girls kissed his nice tawny back and said liony liony sweet old liony the little little girl who had run to him first settled down right between his huge front paws resting her back comfortably against his chest and sucked her thumb her blue eyes looking very round and big she was comfy i kept whispering down his ear to tell him what to do you see he had never been in society at all and he had to learn everything at once now dont move suddenly i whispered and be sure not to make any loud lion noises they dont understand lion language yet but oh i am so happy he whispered back i want to jump up and roar for joy mercy on us i said that would spoil everything theyd be frightened to death and run away screaming and crying and never come back but this little one with her head on my chest is such a sweetie he said maynt i just give her a little lickjust a little one your tongue is too rough wait a minute i answered my fairy workers were swarming all about they were sitting in bunches on the bushes and hanging in bunches from branches and hopping about and giggling and laughing and nudging each other in the ribs as they looked on at the lion and children they were as amused as they had been when they watched winnie sitting on the eggs in the rooks nest i called nip to come to me jump on to the lions tongue i said to him and smooth it off with your plane until it is like satin velvetnot silk velvet but satin velvet the lion politely put out his tongue nip leaped up on it and began to work with his plane he worked until he was quite hot and he made the tongue so smooth that it was quite like satin velvet now you can kiss the baby i said the little little girl had gone to sleep by this time and she had slipped down and lay curled up on the lions front leg as if it was an arm and the lion bent down and delicately licked her soft cheek and her fat arm and her fat leg and purred and purred when the other children saw him they crowded round and were more delighted than ever hes kissing her as if he was a mother cat and she was his kitten one called out and she held out her hand kiss me too kiss me liony she said he lifted his head and licked her little hand as she asked and then all the rest wanted him to kiss them and they laughed so that the little little girl woke up and laughed with them and scrambled to her feet and hugged and hugged as much of the lion as she could put her short arms round she felt as if he was her lion i loveoo i love oo she said tome and play wiv us he smiled and smiled and got up so carefully that he did not upset three or four little boys and girls who were sitting on his back you can imagine how they shouted with glee when he began to trot gently about with them and give them a ride of course everybody wanted to ride so he trotted softly over the grass first with one load of them and then with another when each ride was over he lay down very carefully for the children to scramble down from his back and then other ones scrambled up the things he did that afternoon really made me admire him a cozy lion is nicer to play with than anything else in the world he shook icecreamgrapejuice melons down from the trees for them he carried on his back to a clear little running brook he knew every one who wanted a drink he jumped for them he played tag with them and when he caught them he rolled them over and over on the grass as if they were kittens he showed them how his big claws would go in and out of his velvet paws like a pussy cats whatever game they played he would always be it if they wanted him to when the tiniest ones got sleepy he made grass beds under the shade of trees and picked them up daintily by their frocks or little trousers and carried them to their nests just as kittens or puppies are carried by their mothers and when the others wanted to be carried too he carried them as well the children enjoyed themselves so much that they forgot about going home altogether and as they had laughed and run about every minute and had had such fun by the time the sun began to go down they were all as sleepy as could be but even then one little fellow in a white sailor suit asked for something else he went and stood by the lion with one arm around his neck and the other under his chin can you roar old lion he asked him i am sure you can roar the lion nodded slowly three times he says yesyes shouted everybody oh do roar for us as loud as ever you can we wont be frightened the least bit the lion nodded again and smiled then he lifted up his head and opened his mouth and roared and roared and roared they were not the least bit frightened they just shrieked and laughed and jumped up and down and made him do it over and over again now i will tell you what had happened in the village at first when the children ran away the mothers and fathers were all at their work and did not miss them for several hours it was at lunch time that the grownups began to find out the little folks were gone and then one mother ran out into the village street and then another and then another until all the mothers were there and all of them were talking at once and wringing their hands and crying they went and looked under beds and tables and in cupboards and in back gardens and in front gardens and they rushed to the village pond to see if there were any little hats or bonnets floating on the top of the water but all was quiet and serene and nothing was floating anywhereand there was not one sign of the children when the fathers came the mothers all flew at them you see it isnt any joke to lose fifty children all at once the fathers thought of the lion the first thing but the mothers had tried not to think of him because they couldnt bear it but at last the fathers got all the guns and all the pistols and all the iron spikes and clubs and scythes and carving knives and old swords and they armed themselves with them and began to march all together toward the huge green hill the mothers would go too and they took scissors and big needles and long hat pins and one took a big pepperpot full of red pepper to throw into the lions eyes they had so much to do before they were ready that when they reached the huge green hill the sun was going down and what do you think they heard they heard this rooaaarh rooaarh rooaaarrh almost as loud as thunder and at the same time they heard the shouts and shrieks of the entire picnic but they did not know that the picnic was shouting and screaming for joy so they ran and ran and ranand stumbled and scrambled and hurried and scurried and flurried faster and faster till they had scrambled up the huge green hill to where the lions cave was and then they gathered behind a big clump of bushes and the fathers began to cock their guns and the mothers to sharpen their scissors and hat pins but the mother with the pepperpot had nothing to sharpen so she peeped from behind the bushes and suddenly she cried out oh oh oh oh look look and dont fire a single gun on any account and they all struggled to the front to peep and thisthanks to mewas what they saw on the green places before the lions cave on several soft heaps of grass the tiniest children were sitting chuckling or sucking their thumbs on the grass around them a lot of others were sitting or standing or rolling about with laughter and kicking up their heels and right in front of the cave there stood the lion looking absolutely angelic his tail had a beautiful blue sash on it tied just below the tuft in a lovely bow he had a sash round his waist and four children on his back the little little girl was sitting on his mane which was stuck full of flowers and she was trying to put a wreath on the top of his head and couldnt get it straight which made him look rather rakish on one side of him stood the little boy in the sailor suit and on the other stood a little girl and each one held him by the end of a rope of pink and white wild roses which they were going to lead him with the mother of the little little girl could not wait one minute longer she ran out towards her calling out oh betsypetsy oh betsypetsy mammys lammygirl and then the other mothers threw away their scissors and hat pins and ran after her in a crowd what that clever lion did was to carefully lie down without upsetting anybody and stretch out his head on his paws as if he was a pet poodle and purr and purr like a velvet cat the picnic simply shouted with glee it was the kind of picnic which is always shouting with glee oh mother mother father father it called out look at our lion look at our lion we found him ourselves hes ours and the sailor boy shouted hell roar for me mother and the rest cried out one after another hell sit up and beg for me hell carry me by my trousers he can play tag hell show you his claws go in and out mother ask him to take you on his back to get a drink may he go home and sleep with me mother it was like a bedlam of skylarks let loose this time and the lion had to do so many tricks that only determination to show how cozy he was kept up his strength he was determined to prove to the fathers and mothers that he was cozy and he did it from that time he was the lion of the village he was invited everywhere there never was a party without him birthday parties garden parties tea parties wedding partieshe went to them all his life was one round of gaiety he became most accomplished he could do all the things lions do in hippodromesand a great many more the little little girl gave him a flute for a present and he learned to play on it beautifully when he had an evening at home he used to sit at his cave door and play and sing first he played and then he sang this my goodness gracious me this is sociertee my goodness gracious mercy me this is socieriertee it is sociertee he had composed it himself the next story i shall tell you is about my spring cleaning that will show you how i have to work when the winter is over and how if it were not for me things would never be swept up and made tidy for the summer the primroses and violets would never be wakened or the dormice called up or anything it is a busy time i can tell you

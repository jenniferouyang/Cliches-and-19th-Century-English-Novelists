xxvi jack a fair barbarian chapter i miss octavia bassett slowbridge had been shaken to its foundations it may as well be explained however at the outset that it would not take much of a sensation to give slowbridge a great shock in the first place slowbridge was not used to sensations and was used to going on the even and respectable tenor of its way regarding the outside world with private distrust if not with open disfavor the new mills had been a trial to slowbridgea sore trial on being told of the owners plan of building them old lady theobald who was the cornerstone of the social edifice of slowbridge was said by a spectator to have turned deathly pale with rage and on the first day of their being opened in working order she had taken to her bed and remained shut up in her darkened room for a week refusing to see anybody and even going so far as to send a scathing message to the curate of st james who called in fear and trembling because he was afraid to stay away with mills and millhands her ladyship announced to mr laurence the millowner when chance first threw them together with mills and millhands come murder massacre and mob law and she said it so loud and with so stern an air of conviction that the two misses briarton who were of a timorous and fearful nature dropped their buttered muffins it was at one of the teaparties which were slowbridges only dissipation and shuddered hysterically feeling that their fate was sealed and that they might any night find three masculine millhands secreted under their beds with bludgeons but as no massacres took place and the millhands were pretty regular in their habits and even went so far as to send their children to lady theobalds free school and accepted the tracts left weekly at their doors whether they could read or not slowbridge gradually recovered from the shock of finding itself forced to exist in close proximity to mills and was just settling itself to sleepthe sleep of the justagain when as i have said it was shaken to its foundations it was miss belinda bassett who received the first shock miss belinda bassett was a decorous little maiden lady who lived in a decorous little house on high street which was considered a very genteel street in slowbridge she had lived in the same house all her life her father had lived in it and so also had her grandfather she had gone out to take tea from its doors two or three times a week ever since she had been twenty and she had had her little teaparties in its front parlor as often as any other genteel slowbridge entertainer she had risen at seven breakfasted at eight dined at two taken tea at five and gone to bed at ten with such regularity for fifty years that to rise at eight breakfast at nine dine at three and take tea at six and go to bed at eleven would she was firmly convinced be but to fly in the face of providence as she put it and sign her own deathwarrant consequently it is easy to imagine what a tremor and excitement seized her when one afternoon as she sat waiting for her tea a coach from the blue lion dashedor at least almost dashedup to the front door a young lady got out and the next minute the handmaiden mary anne threw open the door of the parlor announcing without the least preface your niece mum from meriker miss belinda got up feeling that her knees really trembled beneath her in slowbridge america was not approved ofin fact was almost entirely ignored as a country where to quote lady theobald the laws were loose and the prevailing sentiments revolutionary it was not considered good taste to know americanswhich was not unfortunate as there were none to know and miss belinda bassett had always felt a delicacy in mentioning her only brother who had emigrated to the united states in his youth having first disgraced himself by the utterance of the blasphemous remark that he wanted to get to a place where a fellow could stretch himself and not be bullied by a lot of old tabbies from the day of his departure when he had left miss belinda bathed in tears of anguish she had heard nothing of him and here upon the threshold stood mary anne with delighted eagerness in her countenance repeating your niece mum from meriker and with the words her niece entered miss belinda put her hand to her heart the young lady thus announced was the prettiest and at the same time the most extraordinarylooking young lady she had ever seen in her life slowbridge contained nothing approaching this niece her dress was so very stylish that it was quite startling in its effect her forehead was covered down to her large pretty eyes themselves with curls of yellowbrown hair and her slender throat was swathed round and round with a grand scarf of black lace she made a step forward and then stopped looking at miss belinda her eyes suddenly to miss belindas amazement filled with tears didnt you she saidoh dear didnt you get the letter thethe letter faltered miss belinda what letter mymy dear pas was the answer oh i see you didnt and she sank into the nearest chair putting her hands up to her face and beginning to cry outright iam octavia bbassett she said we were coming to surpprise you and travel in europe but the mines went wrong and ppa was obliged to go back to nevada the mines gasped miss belinda ssilvermines wept octavia and we had scarcely landed when piper cabled and pa had to turn back it was something about shares and he may have lost his last dollar miss belinda sank into a chair herself mary anne she said faintly bring me a glass of water her tone was such that octavia removed her handkerchief from her eyes and sat up to examine her are you frightened she asked in some alarm miss belinda took a sip of the water brought by her handmaiden replaced the glass upon the salver and shook her head deprecatingly not exactly frightened my dear she said but so amazed that i find it difficult toto collect myself octavia put up her handkerchief again to wipe away a sudden new gush of tears if shares intended to go down she said i dont see why they couldnt go down before we started instead of waiting until we got over here and then spoiling every thing providence my dearbegan miss belinda but she was interrupted by the reentrance of mary anne the man from the lion mum wants to know whats to be done with the trunks theres six of em an theyre all that eavy as he says he wouldnt lift one alone for ten shilling six exclaimed miss belinda whose are they mine replied octavia wait a minute ill go out to him miss belinda was astounded afresh by the alacrity with which her niece seemed to forget her troubles and rise to the occasion the girl ran to the front door as if she was quite used to directing her own affairs and began to issue her orders you will have to get another man she said you might have known that go and get one somewhere and when the man went off grumbling a little and evidently rather at a loss before such peremptory coolness she turned to miss belinda where must he put them she asked it did not seem to have occurred to her once that her identity might be doubted and some slight obstacles arise before her i am afraid faltered miss belinda that five of them will have to be put in the attic and in fifteen minutes five of them were put into the attic and the sixththe biggest of allstood in the trim little spare chamber and pretty miss octavia had sunk into a puffy little chintzcovered easychair while her newly found relative stood before her making the most laudable efforts to recover her equilibrium and not to feel as if her head were spinning round and round chapter ii an investment anyway the natural result of these efforts was that miss belinda was moved to shed a few tears i hope you will excuse my being too startled to say i was glad to see you she said i have not seen my brother for thirty years and i was very fond of him he said you were answered octavia and he was very fond of you too he didnt write to you because he made up his mind not to let you hear from him until he was a rich man and then he thought he would wait until he could come home and surprise you he was awfully disappointed when he had to go back without seeing you poor dear martin wept miss belinda gently such a journey octavia opened her charming eyes in surprise oh hell come back again she said and he doesnt mind the journey the journey is nothing you know nothing echoed miss belinda a voyage across the atlantic nothing when one thinks of the danger my dear octavias eyes opened a shade wider we have made the trip to the states across the isthmus twelve times and that takes a month she remarked so we dont think ten days much twelve times said miss belinda quite appalled dear dear dear and for some moments she could do nothing but look at her young relative in doubtful wonder shaking her head with actual sadness but she finally recovered herself with a little start what am i thinking of she exclaimed remorsefully to let you sit here in this way pray excuse me my dear you see i am so upset she left her chair in a great hurry and proceeded to embrace her young guest tenderly though with a little timorousness the young lady submitted to the caress with much composure did i upset you she inquired calmly the fact was that she could not see why the simple advent of a relative from nevada should seem to have the effect of an earthquake and result in tremor confusion and tears it was true she herself had shed a tear or so but then her troubles had been accumulating for several days and she had not felt confused yet when miss belinda went downstairs to superintend mary anne in the teamaking and left her guest alone that young person glanced about her with a rather dubious expression it is a queer nice little place she said but i dont wonder that pa emigrated if they always get into such a flurry about little things i might have been a ghost then she proceeded to unlock the big trunk and attire herself downstairs miss belinda was wavering between the kitchen and the parlor in a kindly flutter toast some muffins mary anne and bring in the cold roast fowl she said and i will put out some strawberryjam and some of the preserved ginger dear me just to think how fond of preserved ginger poor martin was and how little of it he was allowed to eat there really seems a special providence in my having such a nice stock of it in the house when his daughter comes home in the course of half an hour every thing was in readiness and then mary anne who had been sent upstairs to announce the fact came down in a most remarkable state of delighted agitation suppressed ecstasy and amazement exclaiming aloud in every feature shes dressed mum she announced an ll be down immediate and retired to a shadowy corner of the kitchen passage that she might lie in wait unobserved miss belinda sitting behind the teaservice heard a soft flowing silken rustle sweeping down the staircase and across the hall and then her niece entered dont you think ive dressed pretty quick she said and swept across the little parlor and sat down in her place with the calmest and most unconscious air in the world there was in slowbridge but one dressmaking establishment the head of the establishmentmiss letitia chickiedesigned the costumes of every woman in slowbridge from lady theobald down there were legends that she received her patterns from london and modified them to suit the slowbridge taste possibly this was true but in that case her labors as modifier must have been severe indeed since they were so far modified as to be altogether unrecognizable when they left miss chickies establishment and were borne home in triumph to the houses of her patrons the taste of slowbridge was quietupon this slowbridge prided itself especiallyand at the same time tended toward economy when gores came into fashion slowbridge clung firmly and with some pride to substantial breadths which did not cut good silk into useless strips which could not be utilized in aftertime and it was only when after a visit to london lady theobald walked into st jamess one sunday with two gores on each side that miss chickie regretfully put scissors into her first breadth each matronly member of good society possessed a substantial silk gown of some sober color which gown having done duty at two years teaparties descended to the grade of secondbest and so descended year by year until it disappeared into the dim distance of the past the young ladies had their white muslins and natural flowers which latter decorations invariably collapsed in the course of the evening and were worn during the latter half of any festive occasion in a flabby and hopeless condition miss chickie made the muslins festooning and adorning them after designs emanating from her fertile imagination if they were a little short in the body and not very generously proportioned in the matter of train there was no rival establishment to sneer and miss chickie had it all her own way and at least it could never be said that slowbridge was vulgar or overdressed judge then of miss belinda bassetts condition of mind when her fair relative took her seat before her what the material of her nieces dress was miss belinda could not have told it was a silken and soft fabric of a pale blue color it clung to the slender lissome young figure like a glove a fanlike train of great length almost covered the hearthrug there were plaitings and frillings all over it and yards of delicate satin ribbon cut into loops in the most recklessly extravagant manner miss belinda saw all this at the first glance as mary anne had seen it and like mary anne lost her breath but on her second glance she saw something more on the pretty slight hands were three wonderful sparkling rings composed of diamonds set in clusters there were great solitaires in the neat little ears and the thicklyplaited lace at the throat was fastened by a diamond clasp my dear said miss belinda clutching helplessly at the teapot are yousurely it is aa little dangerous to wear suchsuch priceless ornaments on ordinary occasions octavia stared at her for a moment uncomprehendingly your jewels i mean my love fluttered miss belinda surely you dont wear them often i declare it quite frightens me to think of having such things in the house does it said octavia thats queer and she looked puzzled for a moment again then she glanced down at her rings i nearly always wear these she remarked father gave them to me he gave me one each birthday for three years he says diamonds are an investment anyway and i might as well have them these touching the earrings and clasp were given to my mother when she was on the stage a lot of people clubbed together and bought them for her she was a great favorite miss belinda made another clutch at the handle of the teapot your mother she exclaimed faintly on thedid you say on the stage answered octavia san francisco father married her there she was awfully pretty i dont remember her she died when i was born she was only nineteen the utter calmness and freedom from embarrassment with which these announcements were made almost shook miss belindas faith in her own identity strange to say until this moment she had scarcely given a thought to her brothers wife and to find herself sitting in her own genteel little parlor behind her own teaservice with her hand upon her own teapot hearing that this wife had been a young person who had been a great favorite upon the stage in a region peopled as she had been led to suppose by golddiggers and escaped convicts was almost too much for her to support herself under but she did support herself bravely when she had time to rally help yourself to some fowl my dear she said hospitably even though very faintly indeed and take a muffin octavia did so her oversplendid hands flashing in the light as she moved them american girls always have more things than english girls she observed with admirable coolness they dress more i have been told so by girls who have been in europe and i have more things than most american girls father had more money than most people that was one reason and he spoiled me i suppose he had no one else to give things to and he said i should have every thing i took a fancy to he often laughed at me for buying things but he never said i shouldnt buy them he was always generous sighed miss belinda poor dear martin octavia scarcely entered into the spirit of this mournful sympathy she was fond of her father but her recollections of him were not pathetic or sentimental he took me with him wherever he went she proceeded and we had a teacher from the states who travelled with us sometimes he never sent me away from him i wouldnt have gone if he had wanted to send meand he didnt want to she added with a satisfied little laugh chapter iii largentville miss belinda sat looking at her niece with a sense of being at once stunned and fascinated to see a creature so young so pretty so luxuriously splendid and at the same time so simply and completely at ease with herself and her surroundings was a revelation quite beyond her comprehension the bestbred and nicest girls slowbridge could produce were apt to look a trifle conscious and timid when they found themselves attired in the white muslin and floral decorations but this slender creature sat in her gorgeous attire her train flowing over the modest carpet her rings flashing her earpendants twinkling apparently entirely oblivious of or indifferent to the fact that all her belongings were sufficiently out of place to be startling beyond measure her chief characteristic however seemed to be her excessive frankness she did not hesitate at all to make the most remarkable statements concerning her own and her fathers past career she made them too as if there was nothing unusual about them twice in her childhood a luckless speculation had left her father penniless and once he had taken her to a californian golddiggers camp where she had been the only female member of the somewhat reckless community but they were pretty goodnatured and made a pet of me she said and we did not stay very long father had a stroke of luck and we went away i was sorry when we had to go and so were the men they made me a present of a set of jewelry made out of the gold they had got themselves there is a breastpin like a breastplate and a necklace like a dogcollar the bracelets tire my arms and the earrings pull my ears but i wear them sometimesgold girdle and all did i inquired miss belinda timidly did i understand you to say my dear that your fathers business was in some way connected with silvermining it is silvermining was the response he owns some mines you know owns said miss belinda much fluttered owns some silvermines he must be a very rich mana very rich man i declare it quite takes my breath away oh he is rich said octavia awfully rich sometimes and then again he isnt shares go up you know and then they go down and you dont seem to have any thing but father generally comes out right because he is lucky and knows how to manage butbut how uncertain gasped miss belinda i should be perfectly miserable poor dear mar oh no you wouldnt said octavia youd get used to it and wouldnt mind much particularly if you were lucky as father is there is every thing in being lucky and knowing how to manage when we first went to bloody gulch my dear cried miss belinda aghast ii beg of you octavia stopped short she gazed at miss belinda in bewilderment as she had done several times before is any thing the matter she inquired placidly my dear love explained miss belinda innocently determined at least to do her duty it is not customary inin slowbridgein fact i think i may say in englandto use suchsuch exceedinglyi dont want to wound your feelings my dearbut such exceedingly strong expressions i refer my dear to the one which began with a b it is really considered profane as well as dreadful beyond measure the one which began with a b repeated octavia still staring at her that is the name of a place but i didnt name it you know it was called that in the first place because a party of men were surprised and murdered there while they were asleep in their camp at night it isnt a very nice name of course but im not responsible for it and besides now the place is growing they are going to call it athens or magnolia vale they tried largentville for a while but people would call it lodginville and nobody liked it i trust you never lived there said miss belinda i beg your pardon for being so horrified but i really could not refrain from starting when you spoke and i cannot help hoping you never lived there i live there now when i am at home octavia replied the mines are there and father has built a house and had the furniture brought on from new york miss belinda tried not to shudder but almost failed wont you take another muffin my love she said with a sigh do take another muffin no thank you answered octavia and it must be confessed that she looked a little bored as she leaned back in her chair and glanced down at the train of her dress it seemed to her that her simplest statement or remark created a sensation having at last risen from the teatable she wandered to the window and stood there looking out at miss belindas flowergarden it was quite a pretty flowergarden and a goodsized one considering the dimensions of the house there were an oval grassplot divers gravel paths heart and diamond shaped beds aglow with brilliant annuals a great many rosebushes several laburnums and lilacs and a trim hedge of holly surrounding it i think i should like to go out and walk around there remarked octavia smothering a little yawn behind her hand suppose we goif you dont care certainly my dear assented miss belinda but perhaps with a delicately dubious glance at her attire you would like to make some little alteration in your dressto put something a littledark over it octavia glanced down also oh no she replied it will do well enough i will throw a scarf over my head though not because i need it unblushingly but because i have a lace one that is very becoming she went up to her room for the article in question and in three minutes was down again when she first caught sight of her miss belinda found herself obliged to clear her throat quite suddenly what slowbridge would think of seeing such a toilet in her front garden upon an ordinary occasion she could not imagine the scarf truly was becoming it was a long affair of rich white lace and was thrown over the girls head wound around her throat and the ends tossed over her shoulders with the most picturesque air of carelessness in the world you look quite like a bride my dear octavia said miss belinda we are scarcely used to such things in slowbridge but octavia only laughed a little i am going to get some pink roses and fasten the ends with them when we get into the garden she said she stopped for this purpose at the first rosebush they reached she gathered half a dozen slenderstemmed heavyheaded buds and having fastened the lace with some was carelessly placing the rest at her waist when miss belinda started violently chapter iv lady theobald oh dear she exclaimed nervously there is lady theobald lady theobald having been making calls of state was returning home rather later than usual when in driving up high street her eye fell upon miss bassetts garden she put up her eyeglasses and gazed through them severely then she issued a mandate to her coachman dobson she said drive more slowly she could not believe the evidence of her own eyeglasses in miss bassetts garden she saw a tall girl dressed as she put it like an actress her delicate dress trailing upon the grass a white lace scarf about her head and shoulders roses in that scarf roses at her waist good heavens she exclaimed is belinda bassett giving a party without so much as mentioning it to me then she issued another mandate dobson she said drive faster and drive me to miss bassetts miss belinda came out to the gate to meet her quaking inwardly octavia simply turned slightly where she stood and looked at her ladyship without any pretence of concealing her curiosity lady theobald bent forward in her landau belinda she said how do you do i did not know you intended to introduce gardenparties into slowbridge dear lady theobaldbegan miss belinda who is that young person demanded her ladyship she is poor dear martins daughter answered miss belinda she arrived todayfrom nevada wherewhere it appears martin has been very fortunate and owns a great many silvermines a great many silvermines cried lady theobald are you mad belinda bassett i am ashamed of you at your time of life too miss belinda almost shed tears she said some silvermines i am sure she faltered for i remember how astonished and bewildered i was the fact is that she is such a very singular girl and has told me so many wonderful things in the strangest cool way that i am quite uncertain of myself murderers and golddiggers and silvermines and camps full of men without women making presents of gold girdles and dogcollars and earrings that drag your ears down it is enough to upset any one i should think so responded her ladyship open the carriagedoor belinda and let me get out she felt that this matter must be inquired into at once and not allowed to go too far she had ruled slowbridge too long to allow such innovations to remain uninvestigated she would not be likely to be upset at least she descended from her landau with her most rigorous air her stout rich black moireantique gown rustled severely the yellow ostrich feather in her bonnet waved majestically being a brunette and lady theobald she wore yellow as she tramped up the gravel walk she held up her dress with both hands as an example to vulgar and reckless young people who wore trains and left them to take care of themselves octavia was arranging afresh the bunch of longstemmed swaying buds at her waist and she was giving all her attention to her task when her visitor first addressed her how do you do remarked her ladyship in a fine deep voice miss belinda followed her meekly octavia she explained this is lady theobald whom you will be very glad to know she knew your father yes returned my lady years ago he has had time to improve since then how do you do octavias limpid eyes rested serenely upon her how do you do she said rather indifferently you are from nevada asked lady theobald yes it is not long since you left there octavia smiled faintly do i look like that she inquired like what said my lady as if i had not long lived in a civilized place i dare say i do because it is true that i havent you dont look like an english girl remarked her ladyship octavia smiled again she looked at the yellow feather and stout moire antique dress but quite as if by accident and without any mental deduction then she glanced at the rosebuds in her hand i suppose i ought to be sorry for that she observed i dare say i shall be in timewhen i have been longer away from nevada i must confess admitted her ladyship and evidently without the least regret or embarrassment i must confess that i dont know where nevada is it isnt in europe replied octavia with a soft light laugh you know that dont you the words themselves sounded to lady theobald like the most outrageous impudence but when she looked at the pretty lovelockshaded face she was staggered the look it wore was such a very innocent and undisturbed one at the moment the only solution to be reached seemed to be that this was the style of young people in nevada and that it was ignorance and not insolence she had to do battle withwhich indeed was partially true i have not had any occasion to inquire where it is situated so far she responded firmly it is not so necessary for english people to know america as it is for americans to know england isnt it said octavia without any great show of interest why not forfor a great many reasons it would be fatiguing to explain she answered courageously how is your father he is very seasick now was the smiling answerdeadly seasick he has been out just twentyfour hours out what does that mean out on the atlantic he was called back suddenly and obliged to leave me that is why i came here alone pray do come into the parlor and sit down dear lady theobald ventured miss belinda octavia dont you think it is nicer out here said octavia my dear answered miss belinda lady theobaldshe was really quite shocked ah interposed octavia i only thought it was cooler she preceded them without seeming to be at all conscious that she was taking the lead you had better pick up your dress miss octavia said lady theobald rather acidly the girl glanced over her shoulder at the length of train sweeping the path but she made no movement toward picking it up it is too much trouble and one has to duck down so she said it is bad enough to have to keep doing it when one is on the street besides they would never wear out if one took too much care of them when they went into the parlor and sat down lady theobald made excellent use of her time and managed to hear again all that had tried and bewildered miss belinda she had no hesitation in asking questions boldly she considered it her privilege to do so she had catechised slowbridge for forty years and meant to maintain her rights until time played her the knaves trick of disabling her in half an hour she had heard about the silvermines the golddiggers and largentville she knew that martin bassett was a millionnaire if the news he had heard had not left him penniless that he would return to england and visit slowbridge as soon as his affairs were settled the precarious condition of his finances did not seem to cause octavia much concern she had asked no questions when he went away and seemed quite at ease regarding the future people will always lend him money and then he is lucky with it she said she bore the catechising very well her replies were frequently rather trying to her interlocutor but she never seemed troubled or ashamed of any thing she had to say and she wore from first to last that inscrutably innocent and indifferent little air she did not even show confusion when lady theobald on going away made her farewell comment you are a very fortunate girl to own such jewels she said glancing critically at the diamonds in her ears but if you take my advice my dear you will put them away and save them until you are a married woman it is not customary on this side of the water for young girls to wear such thingsparticularly on ordinary occasions people will think you are odd it is not exactly customary in america replied octavia with her undisturbed smile there are not many girls who have such things perhaps they would wear them if they had them i dont care a very great deal about them but i mean to wear them lady theobald went away in a dudgeon you will have to exercise your authority belinda and make her put them away she said to miss bassett it is absurdbesides being atrocious make her faltered miss bassett yes make herthough i see you will have your hands full i never heard such romancing stories in my life it is just what one might expect from your brother martin when miss bassett returned octavia was standing before the window watching the carriage drive away and playing absently with one of her earrings as she did so what an old fright she is was her first guileless remark miss belinda quite bridled my dear she said with dignity no one in slowbridge would think of applying such a phrase to lady theobald octavia turned around and looked at her but dont you think she is one she exclaimed perhaps i oughtnt to have said it but you know we havent any thing as bad as that even out in nevadareally my dear said miss belinda different countries contain different people and in slowbridge we have our standardsher best cap trembling a little with her repressed excitement but octavia did not appear overwhelmed by the existence of the standards in question she turned to the window again well anyway she said i think it was pretty cool in her to order me to take off my diamonds and save them until i was married how does she know whether i mean to be married or not i dont know that i care about it chapter v lucia in this manner slowbridge received the shock which shook it to its foundations and it was a shock from which it did not recover for some time before ten oclock the next morning everybody knew of the arrival of martin bassetts daughter the very boardingschool miss pilchers select seminary for young ladies combining the comforts of a home as the circular said with all the advantages of genteel education was on fire with it highly colored versions of the stories told being circulated from the first class downward even taking the form of an indian princess tattooed blue and with difficulty restrained from indulging in warwhoopswhich last feature so alarmed little miss bigbee aged seven that she retired in fear and trembling and shed tears under the bedclothes her terror and anguish being much increased by the stirring recitals of scalpingstories by pretty miss phipps of the first classa young person who possessed a vivid imagination and delighted in romances of a tragic turn i have not the slightest doubt said miss phipps that when she is at home she lives in a wampum what is a wampum inquired one of her admiring audience a tent replied miss phipps with some impatience i should think any goose would know that it is a kind of tent hung with scalps andandmoccasins andlariatsand things of that sort i dont believe that is the right name for it put in miss smith who was a pert member of the third class ah commented miss phipps that was miss smith who spoke of course we may always expect information from miss smith i trust that i may be allowed to say that i think i have a brother he doesnt know much about it if he calls a wigwam a wampum interposed miss smith with still greater pertness i have a brother who knows better than that if i am only in the third class for a moment miss phipps appeared to be meditating perhaps she was a trifle discomfited but she recovered herself after a brief pause and returned to the charge well she remarked perhaps it is a wigwam who cares if it is and at any rate whatever it is i havent the slightest doubt that she lives in one this comparatively tame version was however entirely discarded when the diamonds and silvermines began to figure more largely in the reports certainly pretty overdressed jewelbedecked octavia gave slowbridge abundant cause for excitement after leaving her lady theobald drove home to oldclough hall rather out of humor she had been rather out of humor for some time having never quite recovered from her anger at the daring of that cheerful builder of mills mr john burmistone mr burmistone had been one innovation and octavia bassett was another she had not been able to manage mr burmistone and she was not at all sure that she had managed octavia bassett she entered the diningroom with an ominous frown on her forehead at the end of the table opposite her own seat was a vacant chair and her frown deepened when she saw it where is miss gaston she demanded of the servant before the man had time to reply the door opened and a girl came in hurriedly with a somewhat frightened air i beg pardon grandmamma dear she said going to her seat quickly i did not know you had come home we have a dinnerhour announced her ladyship and i do not disregard it i am very sorry faltered the culprit that is enough lucia interrupted lady theobald and lucia dropped her eyes and began to eat her soup with nervous haste in fact she was glad to escape so easily she was a very pretty creature with brown eyes a soft white skin and a slight figure with a reedlike grace a great quantity of brown hair was twisted into an ugly coil on the top of her delicate little head and she wore an ugly muslin gown of miss chickies make for some time the meal progressed in dead silence but at length lucia ventured to raise her eyes i have been walking in slowbridge grandmamma she said and i met mr burmistone who told me that miss bassett has a visitora young lady from america lady theobald laid her knife and fork down deliberately mr burmistone she said did i understand you to say that you stopped on the roadside to converse with mr burmistone lucia colored up to her delicate eyebrows and above them i was trying to reach a flower growing on the bank she said and he was so kind as to stop to get it for me i did not know he was near at first and then he inquired how you wereand told me he had just heard about the young lady naturally remarked her ladyship sardonically it is as i anticipated it would be we shall find mr burmistone at our elbows upon all occasions and he will not allow himself to be easily driven away he is as determined as persons of his class usually are o grandmamma protested lucia with innocent fervor i really do not think he islike that at all i could not help thinking he was very gentlemanly and kind he is so much interested in your school and so anxious that it should prosper may i ask inquired lady theobald how long a time this generous expression of his sentiments occupied was this the reason of your forgetting the dinnerhour we did notsaid lucia guiltily it did not take many minutes ii do not think that made me late lady theobald dismissed this paltry excuse with one remarka remark made in the deep tones referred to once before i should scarcely have expected she observed that a granddaughter of mine would have spent half an hour conversing on the public road with the proprietor of slowbridge mills o grandmamma exclaimed lucia the tears rising in her eyes it was not half an hour i should scarcely have expected replied her ladyship that a granddaughter of mine would have spent five minutes conversing on the public road with the proprietor of slowbridge mills to this assault there seemed to be no reply to make lady theobald had her granddaughter under excellent control under her rigorous rule the girlwhose mother had died at her birthhad been brought up at nineteen she was simple sensitive shy she had been permitted to have no companions and the greatest excitements of her life had been the slowbridge teaparties of the late sir gilbert theobald the less said the better he had spent very little of his married life at oldclough hall and upon his death his widow had found herself possessed of a substantial gloomy mansion an exalted position in slowbridge society and a small marriagesettlement upon which she might make all the efforts she chose to sustain her state so lucia wore her dresses a much longer time than any other slowbridge young lady she was obliged to mend her little gloves again and again and her hats were retrimmed so often that even slowbridge thought them oldfashioned but she was too simple and sweetnatured to be much troubled and indeed thought very little about the matter she was only troubled when lady theobald scolded her which was by no means infrequently perhaps the straits to which at times her ladyship was put to maintain her dignity imbittered her somewhat lucia is neither a theobald nor a barold she had been heard to say once and she had said it with much rigor a subject of much conversation in private circles had been lucias future it had been discussed in whispers since her seventeenth year but no one had seemed to approach any solution of the difficulty upon the subject of her plans for her granddaughter lady theobald had preserved stern silence once and once only she had allowed herself to be betrayed into the expression of a sentiment connected with the matter if miss lucia marriesa matron of reckless proclivities had remarked lady theobald turned upon her slowly and majestically if miss gaston marries she repeated does it seem likely that miss gaston will not marry this settled the matter finally lucia was to be married when lady theobald thought fit so far however she had not thought fit indeed there had been nobody for lucia to marrynobody whom her grandmother would have allowed her to marry at least there were very few young men in slowbridge and the very few were scarcely eligible according to lady theobalds standard andif such a thing should be mentionedto lucias if she had known she had one which she certainly did not chapter vi accidental when dinner was over lady theobald rose and proceeded to the drawingroom lucia following in her wake from her very babyhood lucia had disliked the drawingroom which was an imposing apartment of great length and height containing much massive furniture upholstered in faded blue satin all the girls evenings since her fifth year had been spent sitting opposite her grandmother in one of the straightest of the blue chairs all the most scathing reproofs she had received had been administered to her at such times she had a secret theory indeed that all unpleasant things occurred in the drawingroom after dinner just as they had seated themselves and lady theobald was on the point of drawing toward her the little basket containing the gray woollen mittens she made a duty of employing herself by knitting each evening dobson the coachman in his character of footman threw open the door and announced a visitor capt barold lady theobald dropped her gray mitten the steel needles falling upon the table with a clink she rose to her feet at once and met halfway the young man who had entered my dear francis she remarked i am exceedingly glad to see you at last with a slight emphasis upon the at last thaanks said capt barold rather languidly youre very good im sure then he glanced at lucia and lady theobald addressed her lucia she said this is francis barold who is your cousin capt barold shook hands feebly i have been trying to find out whether it is third or fourth he said it is third said my lady lucia had never seen her display such cordiality to anybody but capt francis barold did not seem much impressed by it it struck lucia that he would not be likely to be impressed by any thing he seated himself near her grandmothers chair and proceeded to explain his presence on the spot without exhibiting much interest even in his own relation of facts i promised the rathburns that i would spend a week at their place and slowbridge was on the way so it occurred to me i would drop off in passing the rathburns place broadoaks is about ten miles farther on not far you see then said lady theobald i am to understand that your visit is accidental capt barold was not embarrassed he did not attempt to avoid her ladyships rather stern eye as he made his cool reply well yes he said i beg pardon but it is accidental rather lucia gave him a pretty frightened look as if she felt that after such an audacious confession something very serious must happen but nothing serious happened at all singularly enough it was lady theobald herself who looked ill at ease and as though she had not been prepared for such a contingency during the whole of the evening in fact it was always lady theobald who was placed at a disadvantage lucia discovered she could hardly realize the fact at first but before an hour had passed its truth was forced upon her capt barold was a very strikinglooking man upon the whole he was large gracefully built and fair his eyes were gray and noticeable for the coldness of their expression his features regular and aquiline his movements leisurely as he conversed with her grandmother lucia wondered at him privately it seemed to her innocent mind that he had been everywhere and seen every thing and everybody without caring for or enjoying his privileges the truth was that he had seen and experienced a great deal too much as an only child the heir to a large property and heir prospective to one of the oldest titles in the country he had exhausted life early he saw in lady theobald not the imposing head and social front of slowbridge social life the power who rewarded with approval and punished with a frown but a tiresome pretentious old woman whom his mother had asked him for some feminine reason to visit she feels she has a claim upon us francis she had said appealingly well he had remarked that is rather deuced cool isnt it we have people enough on our hands without cultivating slowbridge you know his mother sighed faintly it is true we have a great many people to consider but i wish you would do it my dear she did not say any thing at all about lucia above all she did not mention that a year ago she herself had spent two or three days at slowbridge and had been charmed beyond measure by the girls innocent freshness and that she had said rather absently to lady theobald what a charming wife lucia would make for a man to whom gentleness and a yielding disposition were necessary we do not find such girls in society nowadays my dear lady theobald it is very difficult of late years to find a girl who is not spoken of as fast and who is not disposed to take the reins in her own hands our young men are flattered and courted until they become a little dictatorial and our girls are spoiled at home and the result is a great deal of domestic unhappiness afterwardand even a great deal of scandal which is dreadful to contemplate i cannot help feeling the greatest anxiety in secret concerning francis young men so seldom consider these matters until it is too late girls are not trained as they were in my young days or even in yours said lady theobald they are allowed too much liberty lucia has been brought up immediately under my own eye i feel that it is fortunate remarked mrs barold quite incidentally that francis need not make a point of money for a few moments lady theobald did not respond but afterward in the course of the conversation which followed she made an observation which was of course purely incidental if lucia makes a marriage which pleases her greatuncle old mr dugald binnie of glasgow she will be a very fortunate girl he has intimated in his eccentric fashion that his immense fortune will either be hers or will be spent in building charitable asylums of various kinds he is a remarkable and singular man when capt barold had entered his distinguished relatives drawingroom he had not regarded his third cousin with a very great deal of interest he had seen too many beauties in his thirty years to be greatly moved by the sight of one and here was only a girl who had soft eyes and looked young for her age and who wore an ugly muslin gown that most girls could not have carried off at all you have spent the greater part of your life in slowbridge he condescended to say in the course of the evening i have lived here always lucia answered i have never been away more than a week at a time ah interrogatively i hope you have not found it dull no smiling a little not very you see i have known nothing gayer there is society enough of a harmless kind here spoke up lady theobald virtuously i do not approve of a round of gayeties for young people it unfits them for the duties of life but capt barold was not as favorably impressed by these remarks as might have been anticipated what an old fool she is was his polite inward comment and he resolved at once to make his visit as brief as possible and not to be induced to run down again during his stay at broadoaks he did not even take the trouble to appear to enjoy his evening from his earliest infancy he had always found it easier to please himself than to please other people in fact the world had devoted itself to endeavoring to please him and win histoleration we may say instead of admiration since it could not hope for the latter at home he had been adored rapturously by a large circle of affectionate male and female relatives at school his tutors had been singularly indulgent of his faults and admiring of his talents even among his fellowpupils he had been a sort of autocrat why not indeed with such birthrights and such prospects when he had entered society he had met with even more amiable treatment from affectionate mothers from innocent daughters from cordial paternal parents who voted him an exceedingly fine fellow why should he bore himself by taking the trouble to seem pleased by a stupid evening with an old grenadier in petticoats and a badly dressed country girl lucia was very glad when in answer to a timidly appealing glance lady theobald said it is halfpast ten you may wish us goodnight lucia lucia obeyed as if she had been halfpast ten herself instead of nearly twenty and barold was not long in following her example dobson led him to a stately chamber at the top of the staircase and left him there the captain chose the largest and most luxurious chair sat down in it and lighted a cigar at his leisure confoundedly stupid hole he said with a refined vigor one would scarcely have expected from an individual of his birth and breeding i shall leave tomorrow of course what was my mother thinking of stupid business from first to last chapter vii i should like to see more of slowbridge when he announced at breakfast his intention of taking his departure on the midday train lucia wondered again what would happen and again to her relief lady theobald was astonishingly lenient as your friends expect you of course we cannot overrule them she said we will however hope to see something of you during your stay at broadoaks it will be very easy for you to run down and give us a few hours now and then thaanks said capt barold he was decently civil if not enthusiastic during the few remaining hours of his stay he sauntered through the grounds with lucia who took charge of him in obedience to her grandmothers wish he did not find her particularly troublesome when she was away from her ladyships side when she came out to him in her simple cotton gown and straw hat it occurred to him that she was much prettier than he had thought her at first for economical reasons she had made the little morningdress herself without the slightest regard for the designs of miss chickie and as it was not trimmed at all and had only a blackvelvet ribbon at the waist there was nothing to place her charming figure at a disadvantage it could not be said that her shyness and simplicity delighted capt barold but at least they did not displease him and this was really as much as could be expected she does not expect a fellow to exert himself at all events was his inward comment and he did not exert himself but when on the point of taking his departure he went so far as to make a very gracious remark to her i hope we shall have the pleasure of seeing you in london for a season before very long he said my mother will have great pleasure in taking charge of you if lady theobald cannot be induced to leave slowbridge lucia never goes from home alone said lady theobald but i should certainly be obliged to call upon your mother for her good offices in the case of our spending a season in london i am too old a woman to alter my mode of life altogether in obedience to her ladyships orders the venerable landau was brought to the door and the two ladies drove to the station with him it was during this drive that a very curious incident occurredan incident to which perhaps this story owes its existence since if it had not taken place there might very possibly have been no events of a stirring nature to chronicle just as dobson drove rather slowly up the part of high street distinguished by the presence of miss belinda bassetts house capt barold suddenly appeared to be attracted by some figure he discovered in the garden appertaining to that modest structure by jove he exclaimed in an undertone there is miss octavia for the moment he was almost roused to a display of interest a faint smile lighted his face and his cold handsome eyes slightly brightened lady theobald sat bolt upright that is miss bassetts niece from america she said do i understand you know her capt barold turned to confront her evidently annoyed at having allowed a surprise to get the better of him all expression died out of his face i travelled with her from framwich to stamford he said i suppose we should have reached slowbridge together but that i dropped off at stamford to get a newspaper and the train left me behind o grandmamma exclaimed lucia who had turned to look how very pretty she is miss octavia certainly was amazingly so this morning she was standing by a rosebush again and was dressed in a cashmere morningrobe of the finest texture and the faintest pink it had a watteau plait down the back jabot of lace down the front and the close high frills of lace around the throat which seemed to be a weakness with her her hair was dressed high upon her head and showed to advantage her little ears and as much of her slim white neck as the frills did not conceal but lady theobald did not share lucias enthusiasm she looks like an actress she said if the trees were painted canvas and the roses artificial one might have some patience with her that kind of thing is scarcely what we expect in slowbridge then she turned to barold i had the pleasure of meeting her yesterday not long after she arrived she said she had diamonds in her ears as big as peas and rings to match her manner is just what one might expect from a young woman brought up among golddiggers and silverminers it struck me as being a very unique and interesting manner said capt barold it is chiefly noticeable for a sangfroid which might be regarded as rather enviable she was good enough to tell me all about her papa and the silvermines and i really found the conversation entertaining it is scarcely customary for english young women to confide in their masculine travelling companions to such an extent remarked my lady grimly she did not confide in me at all said barold therein lay her attraction one cannot submit to being confided in by a strange young woman however charming this young ladys remarks were flavored solely with an adorably cool candor she evidently did not desire to appeal to any emotion whatever and as he leaned back in his seat he still looked at the picturesque figure which they had passed as if he would not have been sorry to see it turn its head toward him in fact it seemed that notwithstanding his usual good fortune capt barold was doomed this morning to make remarks of a nature objectionable to his revered relation on their way they passed mr burmistones mill which was at work in all its vigor with a whir and buzz of machinery and a slight odor of oil in its surrounding atmosphere ah said mr barold putting his single eyeglass into his eye and scanning it after the manner of experts i did not think you had any thing of that sort here who put it up the mans name replied lady theobald severely is burmistone pretty good idea isnt it remarked barold good for the placeand all that sort of thing to my mind answered my lady it is the worst possible thing which could have happened mr francis barold dropped his eyeglass dexterously and at once lapsed into his normal conditionwhich was a condition by no means favorable to argument think so he said slowly pity isnt it under the circumstances and really there was nothing at all for her ladyship to do but preserve a lofty silence she had scarcely recovered herself when they reached the station and it was necessary to say farewell as complacently as possible we will hope to see you again before many days she said with dignity if not with warmth mr francis barold was silent for a second and a slightly reflective expression flitted across his face thanks yes he said at last certainly it is easy to come down and i should like to see more of slowbridge when the train had puffed in and out of the station and dobson was driving down high street again her ladyships feelings rather got the better of her if belinda bassett is a wise woman she remarked she will take my advice and get rid of this young lady as soon as possible it appears to me she continued with exalted piety that every welltrained english girl has reason to thank her maker that she was born in a civilized land perhaps suggested lucia softly miss octavia bassett has had no one to train her at all and it may be thatthat she even feels it deeply the feathers in her ladyships bonnet trembled she does not feel it at all she announced she is an impertinentminx chapter viii shares looking up there were others who echoed her ladyships words afterward though they echoed them privately and with more caution than my lady felt necessary it is certain that miss octavia bassett did not improve as time progressed and she had enlarged opportunities for studying the noble example set before her by slowbridge on his arrival in new york martin bassett telegraphed to his daughter and sister per atlantic cable informing them that he might be detained a couple of months and bidding them to be of good cheer the arrival of the message in its official envelope so alarmed miss belinda that she was supported by mary anne while it was read to her by octavia who received it without any surprise whatever for some time after its completion slowbridge had privately disbelieved in the atlantic cable and until this occasion had certainly disbelieved in the existence of people who received messages through it in fact on first finding that she was the recipient of such a message miss belinda had made immediate preparations for fainting quietly away being fully convinced that a shipwreck had occurred which had resulted in her brothers death and that his executors had chosen this delicate method of breaking the news a message by atlantic cable she had gasped dontdont read it my love llet some one else do that poorpoor child trust in providence my love andand bear up ah how i wish i had a stronger mind and could be of more service to you its a message from father said octavia nothing is the matter hes all right he got in on saturday ah panted miss belinda are you quite sure my dearare you quite sure thats what he says listen got in saturday piper met me shares looking up may be kept here two months will write keep up your spirits martin bassett thank heaven sighed miss belinda thank heaven why said octavia why echoed miss belinda ah my dear if you knew how terrified i was i felt sure that something had happened a cable message my dear i never received a telegram in my life before and to receive a cable message was really a shock well i dont see why said octavia it seems to me it is pretty much like any other message miss belinda regarded her timidly does your papa often send them she inquired surely it must be expensive i dont suppose its cheap octavia replied but it saves time and worry i should have had to wait twelve days for a letter very true said miss belinda but she broke off with rather a distressed shake of the head her simple ideas of economy and quiet living were frequently upset in these times she had begun to regard her niece with a slight feeling of awe and yet octavia had not been doing any thing at all remarkable in her own eyes and considered her life pretty dull if the elder miss bassett her parents and grandparents had not been so thoroughly well known and so universally respected if their social position had not been so firmly established and their quiet lives not quite so highly respectablethere is an awful possibility that slowbridge might even have gone so far as not to ask octavia out to tea at all but even lady theobald felt that it would not do to slight belinda bassetts niece and guest to omit the customary state teas would have been to crush innocent miss belinda at a blow and place herthrough the medium of this young lady who alone deserved condemnationbeyond the pale of all social law it is only to be regretted said her ladyship that belinda bassett has not arranged things better relatives of such an order are certainly to be deplored in secret lucia felt much softhearted sympathy for both miss bassett and her guest she could not help wondering how miss belinda became responsible for the calamity which had fallen upon her it really did not seem probable that she had been previously consulted as to the kind of niece she desired or that she had in a distinct manner evinced a preference for a niece of this description perhaps dear grandmamma the girl ventured it is because miss octavia bassett is so young that may i ask inquired lady theobald in fell tones how old you are i was nineteen inin december miss octavia bassett said her ladyship was nineteen last october and it is now june i have not yet found it necessary to apologize for you on the score of youth but it was her ladyship who took the initiative and set an evening for entertaining miss belinda and her niece in company with several other ladies with the best bohea thin bread and butter plumcake and various other delicacies what do they do at such places asked octavia halfpast five is pretty early we spend some time at the teatable my dear explained miss belinda and afterward wewe converse a few of us play whist i do not i feel as if i were not clever enough and i get flurried too easily byby differences of opinion i should think it wasnt very exciting said octavia i dont fancy i ever went to an entertainment where they did nothing but drink tea and talk it is not our intention or desire to be exciting my dear miss belinda replied with mild dignity and an improving conversation is frequently most beneficial to the parties engaged in it im afraid octavia observed that i never heard much improving conversation she was really no fonder of masculine society than the generality of girls but she could not help wondering if there would be any young men present and if indeed there were any young men in slowbridge who might possibly be produced upon festive occasions even though ordinarily kept in the background she had not heard miss belinda mention any masculine name so far but that of the curate of st jamess and when she had seen him pass the house she had not found his slim black figure and faint ecclesiastic whiskers especially interesting it must be confessed that miss belinda suffered many pangs of anxiety in looking forward to her young kinswomans first appearance in society a tea at lady theobalds house constituted formal presentation to the slowbridge world each young lady within the pale of genteel society having arrived at years of discretion on returning home from boardingschool was invited to tea at oldclough hall during an entire evening she was the subject of watchful criticism her deportment was remarked her accomplishments displayed she performed her last new pieces upon the piano she was drawn into conversation by her hostess and upon the timid modesty of her replies and the reverence of her listening attitudes depended her future social status so it was very natural indeed that miss belinda should be anxious i would wear something rather quiet andand simple my dear octavia she said a white muslin perhaps with blue ribbons would you answered octavia then after appearing to reflect upon the matter a few seconds ive got one that would do if its warm enough to wear it i bought it in new york but it came from paris ive never worn it yet it would be nicer than any thing else my love said miss belinda delighted to find her difficulty so easily disposed of nothing is so charming in the dress of a young girl as pure simplicity our slowbridge young ladies rarely wear any thing but white for evening miss chickie assured me a few weeks ago that she had made fifteen whitemuslin dresses all after one simple design of her own i shouldnt think that was particularly nice myself remarked octavia impartially i should be glad one of the fifteen didnt belong to me i should feel as if people might say when i came into a room good gracious theres another the first was made for miss lucia gaston who is lady theobalds niece replied miss belinda mildly and there are few young ladies in slowbridge who would not emulate her example oh said octavia i dare say she is very nice and all that but i dont believe i should care to copy her dresses i think i should draw the line there but she said it without any illnature and sensitive as miss belinda was upon the subject of her cherished ideals she could not take offence when the eventful evening arrived there was excitement in more than one establishment upon high street and the streets in its vicinity the stories of the diamonds the golddiggers and the silvermines had been added to and embellished in the most ornate and startling manner it was well known that only lady theobalds fine appreciation of miss belinda bassetts feelings had induced her to extend her hospitalities to that ladys niece i would prefer my dear said more than one discreet matron to her daughter as they attired themselvesi would much prefer that you would remain near me during the earlier part of the evening before we know how this young lady may turn out let your manner toward her be kind but not familiar it is well to be upon the safe side what precise line of conduct it was generally anticipated that this golddigging and silvermining young person would adopt it would be difficult to say it is sufficient that the general sentiments regarding her were of a distrustful if not timorous nature to miss bassett who felt all this in the very air she breathed the girls innocence of the condition of affairs was even a little touching with all her splendor she was not at all hard to please and had quite awakened to an interest in the impending social event she seemed in good spirits and talked more than was her custom giving miss belinda graphic descriptions of various festal gatherings she had attended in new york when she seemed to have been very gay indeed and to have worn very beautiful dresses and also to have had rather more than her share of partners the phrases she used and the dances she described were all strange to miss belinda and tended to reducing her to a bewildered condition in which she felt much timid amazement at the intrepidity of the newyork young ladies and no slight suspicion of the germanas a theatrical kind of dance involving extraordinary figures and an extraordinary amount of attention from partners of the stronger sex it must be admitted however that by this time notwithstanding the various shocks she had received miss belinda had begun to discover in her young guest divers good qualities which appealed to her affectionate and susceptible old heart in the first place the girl had no small affectations indeed if she had been less unaffected she might have been less subject to severe comment she was goodnatured and generous to extravagance her manner toward mary anne never ceased to arouse miss belinda to interest there was not any condescension whatever in it and yet it could not be called a vulgarly familiar manner it was rather an astonishingly simple manner somehow suggestive of a subtile recognition of mary annes youth and illluck in not having before her more lively prospects she gave mary anne presents in the shape of articles of clothing at which slowbridge would have exclaimed in horror if the recipient had dared to wear them but when miss belinda expressed her regret at these indiscretions octavia was quite willing to rectify her mistakes ah well she said i can give her some money and she can buy some things for herself which she proceeded to do and when under her mistresss direction mary anne purchased a stout brown merino she took quite an interest in her struggles at making it i wouldnt make it so short in the waist and so full in the skirt if i were you she said theres no reason why it shouldnt fit you know thereby winning the housemaidens undying adoration and adding much to the shapeliness of the garment i am sure she has a good heart miss belinda said to herself as the days went by she is like martin in that i dare say she finds me very ignorant and silly i often see in her face that she is unable to understand my feeling about things but she never seems to laugh at me nor think of me unkindly and she is very very pretty though perhaps i ought not to think of that at all chapter ix white muslin as the good little spinster was arraying herself on this particular evening having laid upon the bed the greater portion of her modest splendor she went to her wardrobe and took therefrom the scored bandbox containing her best cap all the ladies of slowbridge wore caps and all being respectfully plagiarized from lady theobald without any reference to age size complexion or demeanor the result was sometimes a little trying lady theobalds headdresses were of a severe and bristling order the lace of which they were composed was induced by some ingenious device to form itself into aggressive quillings the bows seemed lined with buckram the strings neither floated nor fluttered to a majestic person the style is very appropriate miss belinda had said to octavia that very day but to one who is not so it is rather trying sometimes indeed i have almost wished that miss chickie would vary a little more in her designs perhaps the sight of the various articles contained in two of the five trunks had inspired these doubts in the dear old ladys breast it is certain at least that as she took the best cap up a faint sigh fluttered upon her lips it is very large for a small person she said and i am not at all sure that amber is becoming to me and just at that moment there came a tap at the door which she knew was from octavia she laid the cap back in some confusion at being surprised in a moment of weakness come in my love she said octavia pushed the door open and came in she had not dressed yet and had on her wrapper and slippers which were both of quilted gray silk gayly embroidered with carnations but miss belinda had seen both wrapper and slippers before and had become used to their sumptuousness what she had not seen was the trifle the girl held in her hand see here she said see what i have been making for you she looked quite elated and laughed triumphantly i did not know i could do it until i tried she said i had seen some in new york and i had the lace by me and i have enough left to make ruffles for your neck and wrists its mechlin my dear exclaimed miss belinda my dear octavia laughed again dont you know what it is she said it isnt like a slowbridge cap but its a cap nevertheless they wear them like this in new york and i think they are ever so much prettier it was true that it was not like a slowbridge cap and was also true that it was prettier it was a delicate affair of softly quilled lace adorned here and there with loops of pale satin ribbon let me try it on said octavia advancing and in a minute she had done so and turned miss bassett about to face herself in the glass there she said isnt that better thanwell than emulating lady theobald it was so pretty and so becoming and miss belinda was so touched by the girls innocent enjoyment that the tears came into her eyes mymy love she faltered it is so beautiful and so expensive thatthough indeed i dont know how to thank youi am afraid i should not dare to wear it oh answered octavia thats nonsense you know im sure theres no reason why people shouldnt wear becoming things besides i should be awfully disappointed i didnt think i could make it and im real proud of it you dont know how becoming it is miss belinda looked at her reflection and faltered it was becoming my love she protested faintly real mechlin there is really no such lace in slowbridge all the better said octavia cheerfully im glad to hear that it isnt one bit too nice for you to miss belindas astonishment she drew a step nearer to her and gave one of the satin loops a queer caressing little touch which actually seemed to mean something and then suddenly the girl stooped with a little laugh and gave her aunt a light kiss on her cheek there she said you must take it from me for a present ill go and make the ruffles this minute and you must wear those too and let people see how stylish you can be and without giving miss bassett time to speak she ran out of the room and left the dear old lady warmed to the heart tearful delighted frightened a coach from the blue lion had been ordered to present itself at a quarter past five promptly and at the time specified it rattled up to the door with much spiritwith so much spirit indeed that miss belinda was a little alarmed dear dear she said i hope the driver will be able to control the horse and will not allow him to go too fast one hears of such terrible accidents then mary anne was sent to announce the arrival of the equipage to miss octavia and having performed the errand came back beaming with smiles oh mum she exclaimed you never see nothin like her her gownd is evingly an lor how you do look yourself to be sure indeed the lace ruffles on her best black silk and the little cap on her smooth hair had done a great deal for miss bassett and she had only just been reproaching herself for her vanity in recognizing this fact but mary annes words awakened a new train of thought isis miss octavias dress a showy one mary anne she inquired dear me i do hope it is not a showy dress i never see nothin no eleganter mum said mary anne she wants nothin but a veil to make a bride out of heran a becominer thing she never has wore they heard the soft sweep of skirts at that moment and octavia came in there she said stopping when she had reached the middle of the room is that simple enough miss belinda could only look at her helplessly the white muslin was composed almost entirely of valenciennes lace the blue ribbons were embroidered with fielddaisies the air of delicate elaborateness about the whole was something which her innocent mind could not have believed possible in orthodox white and blue i dont think i should call it exactly simple she said my love what a quantity of lace octavia glanced down at her jabots and frills complacently there is a good deal of it she remarked but then it is nice and one can stand a good deal of nice valenciennes on white they said worth made the dress i hope he did it cost enough the ribbon was embroidered by hand i suppose and there is plenty of it cut up into these bows there was no more to be said miss belinda led the way to the coach which they entered under the admiring or critical eyes of several most respectable families who had been lying in wait behind their windowcurtains since they had been summoned there by the sound of the wheels as the vehicle rattled past the boardingschool all the young ladies in the first class rushed to the window they were rewarded for their zeal by a glimpse of a cloud of muslin and lace a charmingly dressed yellowbrown head and a pretty face whose eyes favored them with a frank stare of interest she had diamonds in her ears cried miss phipps wildly excited i saw them flash ah how i should like to see her without her wraps i have no doubt she is a perfect blaze chapter x announcing mr barold lady theobalds invited guests sat in the faded blue drawingroom waiting everybody had been unusually prompt perhaps because everybody wished to be on the ground in time to see miss octavia bassett make her entrance i should think it would be rather a trial even to such a girl as she is said to be remarked one matron it is but natural that she should feel that lady theobald will regard her rather critically and that she should know that american manners will hardly be the thing for a genteel and conservative english country town we saw her a few days ago said lucia who chanced to hear this speech and she is very pretty i think i never saw any one so very pretty before but in quite a theatrical way i think my dear the matron replied in a tone of gentle correction i have seen so very few theatrical people lucia answered sweetly that i scarcely know what the theatrical way is dear mrs burnham her dress was very beautiful and not like what we wear in slowbridge but she seemed to me to be very bright and pretty in a way quite new to me and so just a little odd i have heard that her dress is most extravagant and wasteful put in miss pilcher whose educational position entitled her to the condescending respect of her patronesses she has lace on her morning gowns which miss bassett and miss octavia bassett announced dobson throwing open the door lady theobald rose from her seat a slight rustle made itself heard through the company as the ladies all turned toward the entrance and after they had so turned there were evidences of a positive thrill before the eyes of all belinda bassett advanced with rich ruffles of mechlin at her neck and wrists with a delicate and distinctly novel cap upon her head her niece following her with an unabashed face twenty pounds worth of lace on her dress and unmistakable diamonds in her little ears there is not a shadow of timidity about her cried mrs burnham under her breath this is actual boldness but this was a very severe term to use notwithstanding that it was born of righteous indignation it was not boldness at all it was only the serenity of a young person who was quite unconscious that there was any thing to fear in the rather unimposing party before her octavia was accustomed to entering rooms full of strangers she had spent several years of her life in hotels where she had been stared out of countenance by a few score new people every day she was even used to being in some sort a young person of note it was nothing unusual for her to know that she was being pointed out that pretty blonde she often heard it said is martin bassetts daughter sharp fellow bassettand lucky fellow too more money than he can count so she was not at all frightened when she walked in behind miss belinda she glanced about her cheerfully and catching sight of lucia smiled at her as she advanced up the room the call of state lady theobald had made with her granddaughter had been a very brief one but octavia had taken a decided fancy to lucia and was glad to see her again i am glad to see you belinda said her ladyship shaking hands and you also miss octavia thank you responded octavia you are very kind miss belinda murmured gratefully i hope you are both well said lady theobald with majestic condescension and in tones to be heard all over the room quite well thank you murmured miss belinda again very well indeed rather as if this fortunate state of affairs was the result of her ladyships kind intervention with the fates she felt terribly conscious of being the centre of observation and rather overpowered by the novelty of her attire which was plainly creating a sensation octavia however who was far more looked at was entirely oblivious of the painful prominence of her position she remained standing in the middle of the room talking to lucia who had approached to greet her she was so much taller than lucia that she looked very tall indeed by contrast and also very wonderfully dressed lucias white muslin was one of miss chickies fifteen and was in a genteel way very suggestive of slowbridge suspended from octavias waist by a long loop of the embroidered ribbon was a little round fan of downy paleblue feathers and with this she played as she talked but lucia having nothing to play with could only stand with her little hands hanging at her sides i have never been to an afternoon tea like this before octavia said it is nothing like a kettledrum i am not sure that i know what a kettledrum is lucia answered they have them in london i think but i have never been to london they have them in new york said octavia and they are a crowded sort of afternoon parties where ladies go in carriagetoilet not evening dress people are rushing in and out all the time lucia glanced around the room and smiled that is very unlike this she remarked well said octavia i should think that after all this might be nicer which was very civil lucia glanced around againthis time rather stealthilyat lady theobald then she glanced back at octavia but it isnt she said in an undertone octavia began to laugh they were on a new and familiar footing from that moment i said it might she answered she was not afraid any longer of finding the evening stupid if there were no young men there was at least a young woman who was in sympathy with her she said i hope that i shall behave myself pretty well and do the things i am expected to do oh said lucia with a rather alarmed expression i hope so ii am afraid you would not be comfortable if you didnt octavia opened her eyes as she often did at miss belindas remarks and then suddenly she began to laugh again what would they do she said disrespectfully would they turn me out without giving me any tea lucia looked still more frightened dont let them see you laughing she said theythey will say you are giddy giddy replied octavia i dont think there is any thing to make me giddy here if they say you are giddy said lucia your fate will be sealed and if you are to stay here it really will be better to try to please them a little octavia reflected a moment i dont mean to displease them she said unless they are very easily displeased i suppose i dont think very much about what people are saying of me i dont seem to notice will you come now and let me introduce miss egerton and her sister suggested lucia hurriedly grandmamma is looking at us in the innocence of her heart octavia glanced at lady theobald and saw that she was looking at them and with a disapproving air i wonder what thats for she said to herself but she followed lucia across the room she made the acquaintance of the misses egerton who seemed rather fluttered and after the first exchange of civilities subsided into monosyllables and attentive stares they were indeed very anxious to hear octavia converse but had not the courage to attempt to draw her out unless a sudden query of miss lydias could be considered such an attempt do you like england she asked is this england inquired octavia it is a part of england of course replied the young lady with calm literalness then of course i like it very much said octavia slightly waving her fan and smiling miss lydia egerton and miss violet egerton each regarded her in dubious silence for a moment they did not think she looked as if she were clever but the speech sounded to both as if she were and as if she meant to be clever a little at their expense naturally after that they felt slightly uncomfortable and said less than before and conversation lagged to such an extent that octavia was not sorry when tea was announced and it so happened that tea was not the only thing announced the ladies had all just risen from their seats with a gentle rustle and lady theobald was moving forward to marshal her procession into the diningroom when dobson appeared at the door again mr barold my lady he said and mr burmistone everybody glanced first at the door and then at lady theobald mr francis barold crossed the threshold followed by the tall squareshouldered builder of mills who was a strong handsome man and bore himself very well not seeming to mind at all the numerous eyes fixed upon him i did not know said barold that we should find you had guests beg pardon im sure and so does burmistone whom i had the pleasure of meeting at broadoaks and who was good enough to invite me to return with him lady theobald extended her hand to the gentleman specified i am glad she said rigidly to see mr burmistone then she turned to barold this is very fortunate she announced we are just going in to take tea in which i hope you will join us lucia mr francis barold naturally turned as her ladyship uttered her granddaughters name in a tone of command it may be supposed that his first intention in turning was to look at lucia but he had scarcely done so when his attention was attracted by the figure nearest to herthe figure of a young lady who was playing with a little blue fan and smiling at him brilliantly and unmistakably the next moment he was standing at octavia bassetts side looking rather pleased and the blood of slowbridge was congealing as the significance of the situation was realized one instant of breathlessof awfulsuspense and her ladyship recovered herself we will go in to tea she said may i ask you mr burmistone to accompany miss pilcher chapter xi a slight indiscretion during the remainder of the evening miss belinda was a prey to wretchedness and despair when she raised her eyes to her hostess she met with a glance full of icy significance when she looked across the teatable she saw octavia seated next to mr francis barold monopolizing his attention and apparently in the very best possible spirits it only made matters worse that mr francis barold seemed to find her remarks worthy of his attention he drank very little tea and now and then appeared much interested and amused in fact he found miss octavia even more entertaining than he had found her during their journey she did not hesitate at all to tell him that she was delighted to see him again at this particular juncture you dont know how glad i was to see you come in she said she met his rather startled glance with the most open candor as she spoke it is very civil of you to say so he said but you can hardly expect me to believe it you know it is too good to be true i thought it was too good to be true when the door opened she answered cheerfully i should have been glad to see anybody almost well that he interposed isnt quite so civil it is not quite so civil to but there she checked herself and asked him a question with the most naive seriousness are you a great friend of lady theobalds she said no he answered i am a relative thats worse she remarked it is he replied very much worse i asked you she proceeded with an entrancing little smile of irreverent approval because i was going to say that my last speech was not quite so civil to lady theobald that is perfectly true he responded it wasnt civil to her at all he was passing his time very comfortably and was really surprised to feel that he was more interested in these simple audacities than he had been in any conversation for some time perhaps it was because his companion was so wonderfully pretty but it is not unlikely that there were also other reasons she looked him straight in the eyes she comported herself after the manner of a young lady who was enjoying herself and yet he felt vaguely that she might have enjoyed herself quite as much with burmistone and that it was probable that she would not think a second time of him or of what she said to him after tea when they returned to the drawingroom the opportunities afforded for conversation were not numerous the piano was opened and one after another of the young ladies were invited to exhibit their prowess upon its musical education slowbridge prided itself few towns miss pilcher frequently remarked could be congratulated upon the possession of such talent and such cultivation the misses egerton played a duet the misses loftus sang miss abercrombie executed a sonata with such effect as to melt miss pilcher to tears and still octavia had not been called upon there might have been a reason for this or there might not but the moment arrived at length when lady theobald moved toward miss belinda with evidently fell intent perhaps she said perhaps your niece miss octavia will favor us miss belinda replied in a deprecatory and uncertain murmur iam not sure i really dont know perhapsoctavia my dear octavia raised a smiling face i dont play she said i never learned you do not play exclaimed lady theobald you do not play at all no answered octavia not a note and i think i am rather glad of it because if i tried i should be sure to do it worse than other people i would rather with unimpaired cheerfulness let some one else do it there were a few seconds of dead silence a dozen people seated around her had heard miss pilcher shuddered miss belinda looked down mr francis barold preserved an entirely unmoved countenance the general impression being that he was very much shocked and concealed his disgust with an effort my dear said lady theobald with an air of much condescension and some grave pity i should advise you to try to learn i can assure you that you would find it a great source of pleasure if you could assure me that my friends would find it a great source of pleasure i might begin answered the mistaken young person still cheerfully but i am afraid they wouldnt it seemed that fate had marked her for disgrace in half an hour from that time she capped the climax of her indiscretions the evening being warm the french windows had been left open and in passing one of them she stopped a moment to look out at the brightly moonlit grounds barold who was with her paused too looks rather nice doesnt it he said yes she replied suppose we go out on the terrace he laughed in an amused fashion she did not understand suppose we do he said by jove thats a good idea he laughed as he followed her what amuses you so she inquired oh he replied i am merely thinking of lady theobald well she commented i think its rather disrespectful in you to laugh isnt it a lovely night i didnt think you had such moonlight nights in england what a night for a drive is that one of the things you do in americadrive by moonlight yes do you mean to say you dont do it in england not often is it young ladies who drive by moonlight in america well you dont suppose they go alone do you quite ironically of course they have some one with them ah their papas no their mammas no their governesses their uncles their aunts no with a little smile he smiled also that is another good idea he said you have a great many nice ideas in america she was silent a moment or so swinging her fan slowly to and fro by its ribbon and appearing to reflect does that mean she said at length that it wouldnt be considered proper in england i hope you wont hold me responsible for english fallacies was his sole answer i dont hold anybody responsible for them she returned with some spirit i dont care one thing about them that is fortunate he commented i am happy to say i dont either i take the liberty of pleasing myself i find it pays best perhaps she said returning to the charge perhaps lady theobald will think this is improper he put his hand up and stroked his mustache lightly without replying but it is not she added emphatically it is not no he admitted with a touch of irony it is not are you any the worse for it she demanded well really i think notas yet he replied then we wont go in she said the smile returning to her lips again chapter xii an invitation in the mean time mr burmistone was improving his opportunities within doors he had listened to the music with the most serious attention and on its conclusion he had turned to mrs burnham and made himself very agreeable indeed at length however he arose and sauntered across the room to a table at which lucia gaston chanced to be standing alone having just been deserted by a young lady whose mamma had summoned her she wore mr burmistone regretted to see as he advanced a troubled and anxious expression the truth being that she had a moment before remarked the exit of miss belindas niece and her companion it happened oddly that mr burmistones first words touched upon the subject of her thought he began quite abruptly with it it seems to me he said that miss octavia bassett lucia stopped him with a courage which surprised herself oh if you please she implored dont say any thing unkind about her mr burmistone looked down into her soft eyes with a good deal of feeling i was not going to say any thing unkind he answered why should i everybody seems to find a reason for speaking severely of her lucia faltered i have heard so many unkind things tonight that i am quite unhappy i am surei am sure she is very candid and simple yes answered mr burmistone i am sure she is very candid and simple why should we expect her to be exactly like ourselves lucia went on how can we be sure that our way is better than any other why should they be angry because her dress is so expensive and pretty indeed i only wish i had such a dress it is a thousand times prettier than any we ever wear look around the room and see if it is not and as to her not having learned to play on the piano or to speak frenchwhy should she be obliged to do things she feels she would not be clever at i am not clever and have been a sort of slave all my life and have been scolded and blamed for what i could not help at all until i have felt as if i must be a criminal how happy she must have been to be let alone she had clasped her little hands and though she spoke in a low voice was quite impassioned in an unconscious way her brief girlish life had not been a very happy one as may be easily imagined and a glimpse of the liberty for which she had suffered roused her to a sense of her own wrongs we are all cut out after the same pattern she said we learn the same things and wear the same dresses one might say what lydia egerton has been taught i have been taught yet what two creatures could be more unlike each other by nature than we are mr burmistone glanced across the room at miss egerton she was a fine robust young woman with a high nose and a stolid expression of countenance that is true he remarked we are afraid of every thing said lucia bitterly lydia egerton is afraidthough you might not think so and as for me nobody knows what a coward i am but myself yes i am a coward when grandmamma looks at me i tremble i dare not speak my mind and differ with her when i know she is unjust and in the wrong no one could say that of miss octavia bassett that is perfectly true said mr burmistone and he even went so far as to laugh as he thought of miss octavia trembling in the august presence of lady theobald the laugh checked lucia at once in her little outburst of eloquence she began to blush the color mounting to her forehead oh she began i did not mean toto say so much i there was something so innocent and touching in her sudden timidity and confusion that mr burmistone forgot altogether that they were not very old friends and that lady theobald might be looking he bent slightly forward and looked into her upraised alarmed eyes dont be afraid of me he said dont for pitys sake he could not have hit upon a luckier speech and also he could not have uttered it more feelingly than he did it helped her to recover herself and gave her courage there she said with a slight catch of the breath does not that prove what i said to be true i was afraid the very moment i ceased to forget myself i was afraid of you and of myself i have no courage at all you will gain it in time he said i shall try to gain it she answered i am nearly twenty and it is time that i should learn to respect myself i think it must be because i have no selfrespect that i am such a coward it seemed that her resolution was to be tried immediately for at that very moment lady theobald turned and on recognizing the full significance of lucias position was apparently struck temporarily dumb and motionless when she recovered from the shock she made a majestic gesture of command mr burmistone glanced at the girls face and saw that it changed color a little lady theobald appears to wish to speak to you he said lucia left her seat and walked across the room with a steady air lady theobald did not remove her eye from her until she stopped within three feet of her then she asked a rather unnecessary question with whom have you been conversing with mr burmistone upon what subject we were speaking of miss octavia bassett her ladyship glanced around the room as if a new idea had occurred to her and said where is miss octavia bassett here it must be confessed that lucia faltered she is on the terrace with mr barold she is on her ladyship stopped short in the middle of her sentence this was too much for her she left lucia and crossed the room to miss belinda belinda she said in an awful undertone your niece is out upon the terrace with mr barold perhaps it would be as well for you to intimate to her that in england it is not customarythatbelinda go and bring her in miss belinda arose actually looking pale she had been making such strenuous efforts to converse with miss pilcher and mrs burnham that she had been betrayed into forgetting her charge she could scarcely believe her ears she went to the open window and looked out and then turned paler than before octavia my dear she said faintly francis said lady theobald over her shoulder mr francis barold turned a rather bored countenance toward them but it was evidently not octavia who had bored him octavia said miss belinda how imprudent in that thin dressthe night air how could you my dear how could you oh i shall not catch cold octavia answered i am used to it i have been out hours and hours on moonlight nights at home but she moved toward them you must remember said lady theobald that there are many things which may be done in america which would not be safe in england and she made the remark in an almost sepulchral tone of warning how miss belinda would have supported herself if the coach had not been announced at this juncture it would be difficult to say the coach was announced and they took their departure mr barold happening to make his adieus at the same time they were escorted by him down to the vehicle from the blue lion when he had assisted them in and closed the door octavia bent forward so that the moonlight fell full on her pretty lacecovered head and the sparkling drops in her ears oh she exclaimed if you stay here at all you must come and see usaunt belinda ask him to come and see us miss belinda could scarcely speak i shall be mostmost happy she fluttered anyfriend of dear lady theobalds of course dont forget said octavia waving her hand the coach moved off and miss belinda sank back into a dark corner my dear she gasped what will he think octavia was winding her lace scarf around her throat hell think i want him to call she said serenely and i do chapter xiii intentions the position in which lady theobald found herself placed after these occurrences was certainly a difficult and unpleasant one it was mr francis barolds caprice for the time being to develop an intimacy with mr burmistone he had it seemed chosen to become interested in him during their sojourn at broadoaks he had discovered him to be a desirable companion and a clever amiable fellow this much he condescended to explain incidentally to her ladyships self i cant say i expected to meet a nice fellow or a companionable fellow he remarked and i was agreeably surprised to find him both never says too much or too little never bores a man to this lady theobald could make no reply singularly enough she had discovered early in their acquaintance that her wonted weapons were likely to dull their edges upon the steely coldness of mr francis barolds impassibility in the presence of this fortunate young man before whom his world had bowed the knee from his tenderest infancy she lost the majesty of her demeanor he refused to be affected by it he was even implacable enough to show openly that it bored him and to insinuate by his manner that he did not intend to submit to it he entirely ignored the claim of relationship and acted according to the promptings of his own moods he did not feel it at all incumbent upon him to remain at oldclough hall and subject himself to the timehonored customs there in vogue he preferred to accept mr burmistones invitation to become his guest at the handsome house he had just completed in which he lived in bachelor splendor accordingly he installed himself there and thereby complicated matters greatly slowbridge found itself in a position as difficult as and far more delicate than lady theobalds the teadrinkings in honor of that troublesome young person miss octavia bassett having been inaugurated by her ladyship must go the social rounds according to ancient custom but what in discretions name was to be done concerning mr francis barold there was no doubt whatever that he must not be ignored and in that case what difficulties presented themselves the mamma of the two misses egerton who was a nervous and easily subjugated person was so excited and overwrought by the prospect before her that in contemplating it when she wrote her invitations she was affected to tears i can assure you lydia she said that i have not slept for three nights i have been so harassed here on one hand is mr francis barold who must be invited and on the other is mr burmistone whom we cannot pass over and here is lady theobald who will turn to stone the moment she sees himthough goodness knows i am sure he seems a very quiet respectable man and said some of the most complimentary things about your playing and here is that dreadful girl who is enough to give one cold chills and who may do all sorts of dreadful things and is certainly a living example to all respectable welleducated girls and the blindest of the blind could see that nothing would offend lady theobald more fatally than to let her be thrown with francis barold and how one is to invite them into the same room and keep them apart im sure i dont know how lady theobald herself could not do it and how can we be expected to and the refreshments on my mind too and forbes failing on her teacakes and bringing up sally lunns like lead that these misgivings were equally shared by each entertainer in prospective might be adduced from the fact that the same afternoon mrs burnham and miss pilcher appeared upon the scene to consult with mrs egerton upon the subject miss lydia and miss violet being dismissed upstairs to their practising the three ladies sat in the darkened parlor and talked the matter over in solemn conclave i have consulted miss pilcher and mentioned the affair to mrs gibson announced mrs burnham and really we have not yet been able to arrive at any conclusion mrs egerton shook her head tearfully pray dont come to me my dears she saiddont i beg of you i have thought about it until my circulation has all gone wrong and lydia has been applying hotwater bottles to my feet all the morning i gave it up at halfpast two and set violet to writing invitations to one and all let the consequences be what they may miss pilcher glanced at mrs burnham and mrs burnham glanced at miss pilcher perhaps miss pilcher suggested to her companion it would be as well for you to mention your impressions mrs burnhams manner became additionally cautious she bent forward slightly my dear she said has it struck you that lady theobald has anyintentions so to speak intentions repeated mrs egerton yes with deep significanceso to speak with regard to lucia mrs egerton looked utterly helpless dear me she ejaculated plaintively i have never had time to think of it dear me with regard to lucia mrs burnham became more significant still and she added mr francis barold mrs egerton turned to miss pilcher and saw confirmation of the fact in her countenance dear dear she said that makes it worse than ever it is certain put in miss pilcher that the union would be a desirable one and we have reason to remark that a deep interest in mr francis barold has been shown by lady theobald he has been invited to make her house his home during his stay in slowbridge and though he has not done so the fact that he has not is due only to some inexplicable reluctance upon his own part and we all remember that lady theobald once plainly intimated that she anticipated lucia forming in the future a matrimonial alliance oh commented mrs egerton with some slight impatience it is all very well for lady theobald to have intentions for lucia but if the young man has none i really dont see that her intentions will be likely to result in any thing particular and i am sure mr francis barold is not in the mood to be influenced in that way now he is more likely to entertain himself with miss octavia bassett who will take him out in the moonlight and make herself agreeable to him in her american style miss pilcher and mrs burnham exchanged glances again my dear said mrs burnham he has called upon her twice since lady theobalds tea they say she invites him herself and flirts with him openly in the garden her conduct is such said miss pilcher with a shudder that the blinds upon the side of the seminary which faces miss bassetts garden are kept closed by my orders i have young ladies under my care whose characters are in process of formation and whose parents repose confidence in me nothing but my friendship for belinda bassett remarked mrs burnham would induce me to invite the girl to my house then she turned to mrs egerton butahemhave you included them all in your invitations she observed mrs egerton became plaintive again i dont see how i could be expected to do any thing else she said lady theobald herself could not invite mr francis barold from mr burmistones house and leave mr burmistone at home and after all i must say it is my opinion nobody would have objected to mr burmistone in the first place if lady theobald had not insisted upon it mrs burnham reflected perhaps that is true she admitted cautiously at length and it must be confessed that a man in his position is not entirely without his advantagesparticularly in a place where there are but few gentlemen and those scarcely desirable as she paused there discreetly but mrs egerton was not so discreet there are a great many young ladies in slowbridge she said shaking her heada great many and with five in a family all old enough to be out of school i am sure it is flying in the face of providence to neglect ones opportunities when the two ladies took their departure mrs burnham seemed reflective finally she saidpoor mrs egertons mind is not what it was and it never was remarkably strong it must be admitted too that there is a lack ofof delicacy those great plain girls of hers must be a trial to her as she spoke they were passing the privet hedge which surrounded miss bassetts house and garden and a sound caused both to glance around the front door had just been opened and a gentleman was descending the stepsa young gentleman in neat clerical garb his guileless ecclesiastical countenance suffused with mantling blushes of confusion and delight he stopped on the gravel path to receive the last words of miss octavia bassett who stood on the threshold smiling down upon him in the prettiest way in the world tuesday afternoon she said now dont forget because i shall ask mr barold and miss gaston on purpose to play against us even st james cant object to croquet iindeed i shall be most happy andand delighted stammered her departing guest if you will be so kind as toto instruct me and forgive my awkwardness oh ill instruct you said octavia i have instructed people before and i know how mrs burnham clutched miss pilchers arm do you see who that is she demanded would you have believed it miss pilcher preserved a stony demeanor i would believe any thing of miss octavia bassett she replied there would be nothing at all remarkable to my mind in her flirting with the bishop himself why should she hesitate to endeavor to entangle the curate of st james chapter xiv a clerical visit it was indeed true that the rev arthur poppleton had spent the greater part of his afternoon in miss belinda bassetts front parlor and that octavia had entertained him in such a manner that he had been beguiled into forgetting the clerical visits he had intended to make and had finally committed himself by a promise to return a day or two later to play croquet his object in calling had been to request miss belindas assistance in a parochial matter his natural timorousness of nature had indeed led him to put off making the visit for as long a time as possible the reports he had heard of miss octavia bassett had inspired him with great dread consequently he had presented himself at miss belindas front door with secret anguish will you say he had faltered to mary anne that it is mr poppleton to see miss bassettmiss belinda bassett and then he had been handed into the parlor the door had been closed behind him and he had found himself shut up entirely alone in the room with miss octavia bassett herself his first impulse was to turn and flee precipitately indeed he even went so far as to turn and clutch the handle of the door but somehow a second thought arrived in time to lead him to control himself this second thought came with his second glance at octavia she was not at all what he had pictured her singularly enough no one had told him that she was pretty and he had thought of her as a gaunt young person with a determined and manly air she struck him on the contrary as being extremely girlish and charming to look upon she wore the pale pink gown and as he entered he saw her give a furtive little dab to her eyes with a lace handkerchief and hurriedly crush an open letter into her pocket then seeming to dismiss her emotion with enviable facility she rose to greet him if you want to see aunt belinda she said perhaps you had better sit down she will be here directly he plucked up spirit to take a seat suddenly feeling his terror take wing he was amazed at his own courage ththank you he said i have the pleasure ofthere it is true he stopped looked at her blushed and finished somewhat disjointedly miss octavia bassett i believe yes she answered and sat down near him when miss belinda descended the stairs a short time afterward her ears were greeted by the sound of brisk conversation in which the rev arthur poppleton appeared to be taking part with beforeunheardof spirit when he arose at her entrance there was in his manner an air of mild buoyancy which astonished her beyond measure when he reseated himself he seemed quite to forget the object of his visit for some minutes and was thus placed in the embarrassing position of having to refer to his notebook having done so and found that he had called to ask assistance for the family of one of his parishioners he recovered himself somewhat as he explained the exigencies of the case octavia listened well she said i should think it would make you quite uncomfortable if you see things like that often i regret to say i do see such things only too frequently he answered gracious she said but that was all he was conscious of being slightly disappointed at her apathy and perhaps it is to be deplored that he forgot it afterward when miss belinda had bestowed her mite and the case was dismissed for the time being he really did forget it and was beguiled into making a very long call and enjoying himself as he had never enjoyed himself before when at length he was recalled to a sense of duty by a glance at the clock he had already before his eyes an opening vista of delights taking the form of future calls and games of croquet played upon miss belindas neatlyshaven grassplat he had bidden the ladies adieu in the parlor and having stepped into the hall was fumbling rather excitedly in the umbrellastand for his own especially slender clerical umbrella when he was awakened to new rapture by hearing miss octavias tone again he turned and saw her standing quite near him looking at him with rather an odd expression and holding something in her hand oh she said see herethose people ibeg pardon he hesitated i dont quite understand oh yes she answered those desperately poor wretches you know with fever and leaks in their house and all sorts of disagreeable things the matter with them give them this wont you this was a pretty silk purse through whose meshes he saw the gleam of gold coin that he said you dont meanisnt there a good deali beg pardonbut really well if they are as poor as you say they are it wont be too much she replied i dont suppose theyll object to it do you she extended it to him as if she rather wished to get it out of her hands youd better take it she said i shall spend it on something i dont need if you dont im always spending money on things i dont care for afterward he was filled with remorse remembering that he had thought her apathetic ii really thought you were not interested at all he burst forth pray forgive me this is generous indeed she looked down at some particularly brilliant rings on her hand instead of looking at him oh well she said i think it must be simply horrid to have to do without things i cant see how people live besides i havent denied myself any thing it would be worth talking about if i had i suppose oh by the by never mind telling any one will you then without giving him time to reply she raised her eyes to his face and plunged into the subject of the croquet again pursuing it until the final moment of his exit and departure which was when mrs burnham and miss pilcher had been scandalized at the easy freedom of her adieus chapter xv superior advantages when mr francis barold called to pay his respects to lady theobald after partaking of her hospitality mr burmistone accompanied him and upon almost every other occasion of his presenting himself to her ladyship mr burmistone was his companion it may as well be explained at the outset that the millowner of burmistone mills was a man of decided determination of character and that upon the evening of lady theobalds tea he had arrived at the conclusion that he would spare no effort to gain a certain end he felt it would add to his happiness to accomplish i stand rather in awe of lady theobald as any ordinary man would he had said dryly to barold on their return to his house but my awe of her is not so great yet that i shall allow it to interfere with any of my plans have you any especial plan inquired barold carelessly after a pause yes answered mr burmistoneseveral i should like to go to oldclough rather often i feel it the civil thing to go to oldclough oftener than i like go with me i should like to be included in all the invitations to tea for the next six months i shall be included in all the invitations so long as i remain here and it is not likely you will be left out in the cold after you have gone the rounds once you wont be dropped upon the whole it appears so said mr burmistone thanks so at each of the teaparties following lady theobalds the two men appeared together the small end of the wedge being inserted into the social stratum the rest was not so difficult mrs burnham was at once surprised and overjoyed by her discoveries of the many excellences of the man they had so hastily determined to ignore mrs abercrombie found mr burmistones manner all that could be desired miss pilcher expressed the highest appreciation of his views upon feminine education and our duty to the young in our charge indeed after mrs egertons evening the tide of public opinion turned suddenly in his favor public opinion did not change however as far as octavia was concerned having had her anxiety set at rest by several encouraging paternal letters from nevada she began to make up her mind to enjoy herself and was it is to be regretted betrayed by her youthful high spirits into the committing of numerous indiscretions upon each festal occasion she appeared in a new and elaborate costume she accepted the attentions of mr francis barold as if it were the most natural thing in the world that they should be offered she jokedin what mrs burnham designated her nevada waywith the rev arthur poppleton who appeared more frequently than had been his habit at the high teas she played croquet with that gentleman and mr barold day after day upon the grassplat before all the eyes gazing down upon her from the neighboring windows she managed to coerce mr burmistone into joining these innocent orgies and in fact to quote miss pilcher there was no limit to the shamelessness of her unfeminine conduct several times much comment had been aroused by the fact that lucia gaston had been observed to form one of the party of players she had indeed played with barold against octavia and mr poppleton on the memorable day upon which that gentleman had taken his first lesson barold had availed himself of the invitation extended to him by octavia upon several occasions greatly to miss belindas embarrassment he had dropped in the evening after the curates first call is lady theobald very fond of you octavia had asked in the course of this visit it is very kind of her if she is he replied with languid irony isnt she fond enough of you to do any thing you ask her octavia inquired really i think not he replied imagine the degree of affection it requires i am not fond enough of any one to do any thing they ask me octavia bestowed a long look upon him well she remarked after a pause i believe you are not i shouldnt think so barold colored very faintly i say he said is that an imputation or something of that character it sounds like it you know octavia did not reply directly she laughed a little i want you to ask lady theobald to do something she said i am afraid i am not in such favor as you imagine he said looking slightly annoyed well i think she wont refuse you this thing she went on if she didnt loathe me so i would ask her myself he deigned to smile does she loathe you he inquired yes nodding she would not speak to me if it werent for aunt belinda she thinks i am fast and loud do you think i am fast and loud he was taken aback and not for the first time either she had startled and discomposed him several times in the course of their brief acquaintance and he always resented it priding himself in private as he did upon his coolness and immobility he could not think of the right thing to say just now so he was silent for a second tell me the truth she persisted i shall not caremuch i do not think you would care at all well perhaps i shouldnt go on do you think i am fast i am happy to say i do not find you slow she fixed her eyes on him smiling faintly that means i am fast she said well no matter will you ask lady theobald what i want you to ask her i should not say you were fast at all he said rather stiffly you have not been educated asas lady theobald has educated miss gaston for instance i should rather think not she replied then she added very deliberately she has had what you might call very superior advantages i suppose her expression was totally incomprehensible to him she spoke with the utmost seriousness and looked down at the table that is derision i suppose he remarked restively she glanced up again at all events she said there is nothing to laugh at in lucia gaston will you ask lady theobald i want you to ask her to let lucia gaston come and play croquet with us on tuesday she is to play with you against mr poppleton and me who is mr poppleton he asked with some reserve he did not exactly fancy sharing his entertainment with any ordinary outsider after all there was no knowing what this little american might do he is the curate of the church she replied undisturbed he is very nice and little and neat and blushes all over to the toes of his boots he came to see aunt belinda and i asked him to come and be taught to play who is to teach him i am i have taught at least twenty men in new york and san francisco i hope he appreciates your kindness i mean to try if i can make him forget to be frightened she said with a gay laugh it was certainly nettling to find his air of reserve and displeasure met with such inconsequent lightness she never seemed to recognize the subtle changes of temperature expressed in his manner only his sense of what was due to himself prevented his being very chilly indeed but as she went on with her gay chat in utter ignorance of his mood and indulged in some very pretty airy nonsense he soon recovered himself and almost forgot his private grievance before going away he promised to ask lady theobalds indulgence in the matter of lucias joining them in their game one speech of octavias connected with the subject he had thought very pretty as well as kind i like miss gaston she said i think we might be friends if lady theobald would let us her superior advantages might do me good they might improve me she went on with a little laugh and i suppose i need improving very much all my advantages have been of one kind when he had left her she startled miss belinda by saying i have been asking mr barold if he thought i was fast and i believe he doesin fact i am sure he does ah my dear my dear ejaculated miss belinda what a terrible thing to say to a gentleman what will he think octavia smiled one of her calmest smiles isnt it queer how often you say that she remarked i think i should perish if i had to pull myself up that way as you do i just go right on and never worry i dont mean to do any thing queer and i dont see why any one should think i do chapter xvi croquet lucia was permitted to form one of the players in the game of croquet being escorted to and from the scene by francis barold perhaps it occurred to lady theobald that the contrast of english reserve and maidenliness with the freeandeasy manners of young women from nevada might lead to some good result i trust your conduct will be such as to show that you at least have resided in a civilized land she said the men of the present day may permit themselves to be amused by young persons whose demeanor might bring a blush to the cheek of a woman of forty but it is not their habit to regard them with serious intentions lucia reddened she did not speak though she wished very much for the courage to utter the words which rose to her lips lately she had found that now and then at times when she was roused to anger speeches of quite a clever and sarcastic nature presented themselves to her mind she was never equal to uttering them aloud but she felt that in time she might because of course it was quite an advance in spirit to think them and face even in imagination the probability of astounding and striking lady theobald dumb with their audacity it ought to make me behave very well she was saying now to herself to have before me the alternative of not being regarded with serious intentions i wonder if it is mr poppleton or francis barold who might not regard me seriously and i wonder if they are any coarser in america than we can be in england when we try she enjoyed the afternoon very much particularly the latter part of it when mr burmistone who was passing came in being invited by octavia across the privet hedge having paid his respects to miss belinda who sat playing propriety under a laburnumtree mr burmistone crossed the grassplat to lucia herself she was awaiting her turn and laughing at the ardent enthusiasm of mr poppleton who under octavias direction was devoting all his energies to the game her eyes were bright and she had lost for the time being her timid air of feeling herself somehow in the wrong i am glad to see you here said mr burmistone i am glad to be here she answered it has been such a happy afternoon every thing has seemed so bright andand different different is a very good word he said laughing it isnt a very bad one she returned and it expresses a good deal it does indeed he commented look at mr poppleton and octavia she began have you got to octavia he inquired she looked down and blushed i shall not say octavia to grandmamma then suddenly she glanced up at him that is sly isnt it she said sometimes i think i am very sly though i am sure it is not my nature to be so i would rather be open and candid it would be better he remarked you think so she asked eagerly he could not help smiling do you ever tell untruths to lady theobald he inquired if you do i shall begin to be alarmed i act them she said blushing more deeply i really dopaltry sorts of untruths you know pretending to agree with her when i dont pretending to like things a little when i hate them i have been trying to improve myself lately and once or twice it has made her very angry she says i am disobedient and disrespectful she asked me one day if it was my intention to emulate miss octavia bassett that was when i said i could not help feeling that i had wasted time in practising she sighed softly as she ended in the mean time octavia had mr poppleton and mr francis barold upon her hands and was endeavoring to do her duty as hostess by both of them if it had been her intention to captivate these gentlemen she could not have complained that mr poppleton was wary or difficult game his first fears allayed his downward path was smooth and rapid in proportion when he had taken his departure with the little silk purse in his keeping he had carried under his clerical vest a warmed and thrilled heart it was a heart which it must be confessed was of the most inexperienced and susceptible nature a little man of affectionate and gentle disposition he had been given from his earliest youth to indulging in timid dreams of mild future blissof bliss represented by some lovely being whose ideals were similar to his own and who preferred the wealth of a true affection to the glitter of the giddy throng upon one or two occasions he had even worshipped from afar but as on each of these occasions his hopes had been nipped in the bud by the union of their object with some hollow worldling his dream had so far never attained very serious proportions since he had taken up his abode in slowbridge he had felt himself a little overpowered by circumstances it had been a source of painful embarrassment to him to find his innocent presence capable of producing confusion in the breasts of young ladies who were certainly not more guileless than himself he had been conscious that the misses egerton did not continue their conversation with freedom when he chanced to approach the group they graced and he had observed the same thing in their companionsan additional circumspection of demeanor so to speak a touch of new decorum whose object seemed to be to protect them from any appearance of imprudence it is almost as if they were afraid of me he had said to himself once or twice dear me i hope there is nothing in my appearance to lead them to he was so much alarmed by this dreadful thought that he had ever afterward approached any of these young ladies with a fear and trembling which had not added either to his comfort or their own consequently his path had not been a very smooth one i respect the young ladies of slowbridge he remarked to octavia that very afternoon there are some very remarkable young ladies herevery remarkable indeed they are interested in the church and the poor and the schools and indeed in every thing which is most unselfish and amiable young ladies have usually so much to distract their attention from such matters if i stay long enough in slowbridge said octavia i shall be interested in the church and the poor and the schools it seemed to the curate that there had never been any thing so delightful in the world as her laugh and her unusual remarks she seemed to him so beautiful and so exhilarating that he forgot all else but his admiration for her he enjoyed himself so much this afternoon that he was almost brilliant and excited the sarcastic comment of mr francis barold who was not enjoying himself at all confound it said that gentleman to himself as he looked on what did i come here for this style of thing is just what i might have expected she is amusing herself with that poor little cad now and i am left in the cold i suppose that is her habit with the young men in nevada he had no intention of entering the lists with the rev arthur poppleton or of concealing the fact that he felt that this little nevada flirt was making a blunder the sooner she knew it the better for herself so he played his game as badly as possible and with much dignity but octavia was so deeply interested in mr poppletons ardent efforts to do credit to her teaching that she was apparently unconscious of all else she played with great cleverness and carried her partner to the terminus with an eager enjoyment of her skill quite pleasant to behold she made little darts here and there advised directed and controlled his movements and was quite dramatic in a small way when he made a failure mrs burnham who was superintending the proceeding seated in her own easychair behind her windowcurtains was roused to virtuous indignation by her energy there is no repose whatever in her manner she said no dignity is a game of croquet a matter of deep moment it seems to me that it is almost impious to devote ones mind so wholly to a mere means of recreation she seems to be enjoying it mamma said miss laura burnham with a faint sigh miss laura had been looking on over her parents shoulder they all seem to be enjoying it see how lucia gaston and mr burmistone are laughing i never saw lucia look like that before the only one who seems a little dull is mr barold he is probably disgusted by a freedom of manner to which he is not accustomed replied mrs burnham the only wonder is that he has not been disgusted by it before chapter xvii advantages the game over octavia deserted her partner she walked lightly and with the air of a victor to where barold was standing she was smiling and slightly flushed and for a moment or so stood fanning herself with a gay japanese fan dont you think i am a good teacher she asked at length i should say so replied barold without enthusiasm i am afraid i am not a judge she waved her fan airily i had a good pupil she said then she held her fan still for a moment and turned fully toward him i have done something you dont like she said i knew i had mr francis barold retired within himself at once in his present mood it really appeared that she was assuming that he was very much interested indeed i should scarcely take the liberty upon a limited acquaintance he began she looked at him steadily fanning herself with slow regular movements yes she remarked youre mad i knew you were he was so evidently disgusted by this observation that she caught at the meaning of his look and laughed a little ah she said thats an american word aint it it sounds queer to you you say vexed instead of mad well then you are vexed if i have been so clumsy as to appear illhumored he said i beg pardon certainly i have no right to exhibit such unusual interest in your conduct he felt that this was rather decidedly to the point but she did not seem overpowered at all she smiled anew anybody has a right to be madi mean vexed she observed i should like to know how people would live if they hadnt i am madi mean vexedtwenty times a day indeed was his sole reply well she said i think its real mean in you to be so cool about it when you remember what i told you the other day i regret to say i dont remember just now i hope it was nothing very serious to his astonishment she looked down at her fan and spoke in a slightly lowered voice i told you that i wanted to be improved it must be confessed that he was mollified there was a softness in her manner which amazed him he was at once embarrassed and delighted but at the same time it would not do to commit himself to too great a seriousness oh he answered that was a rather good joke i thought no it wasnt she said perhaps even half a tone lower i was in earnest then she raised her eyes if you told me when i did any thing wrong i think it might be a good thing she said he felt that this was quite possible and was also struck with the idea that he might find the task of mentorso long as he remained entirely noncommittalrather interesting still he could not afford to descend at once from the elevated stand he had taken i am afraid you would find it rather tiresome he remarked i am afraid you would she answered you would have to tell me of things so often do you mean seriously to tell me that you would take my advice he inquired i mightnt take all of it was her reply but i should take someperhaps a great deal thanks he remarked i scarcely think i should give you a great deal she simply smiled i have never had any advice at all she said i dont know that i should have taken it if i hadjust as likely as not i shouldnt but i have never had any father spoiled me he gave me all my own way he said he didnt care so long as i had a good time and i must say i have generally had a good time i dont see how i could help itwith all my own way and no one to worry i wasnt sick and i could buy any thing i liked and all that so i had a good time ive read of girls in books wishing they had mothers to take care of them i dont know that i ever wished for one particularly i can take care of myself i must say too that i dont think some mothers are much of an institution i know girls who have them and they are always worrying he laughed in spite of himself and though she had been speaking with the utmost seriousness and naivete she joined him when they ceased she returned suddenly to the charge now tell me what i have done this afternoon that isnt right she saidthat lucia gaston wouldnt have done for instance i say that because i shouldnt mind being a little like lucia gastonin some things lucia ought to feel gratified he commented she does she answered we had a little talk about it and she was as pleased as could be i didnt think of it in that way until i saw her begin to blush guess what she said i am afraid i cant she said she saw so many things to envy in me that she could scarcely believe i wanted to be at all like her it was a very civil speech said barold ironically i scarcely thought lady theobald had trained her so well she meant it said octavia you maynt believe it but she did i know when people mean things and when they dont i wish i did said barold octavia turned her attention to her fan well i am waiting she said waiting he repeated to be told of my faults but i scarcely see of what importance my opinion can be it is of some importance to mejust now the last two words rendered him really impatient and it may be spurred him up if we are to take lucia gaston as a model he said lucia gaston would possibly not have been so complaisant in her demeanor toward our clerical friend complaisant she exclaimed opening her lovely eyes when i was actually plunging about the garden trying to teach him to play well i shouldnt call that being complaisant lucia gaston he replied would not say that she had been plunging about the garden she gave herself a moment for reflection thats true she remarked when it was over she wouldnt when i compare myself with the slowbridge girls i begin to think i must say some pretty awful things barold made no reply which caused her to laugh a little again you darent tell me she said now do i well i dont think i want to know very particularly what lady theobald thinks will last quite a good while complaisant i am sorry you object to the word he said oh i dont she answered i like it it sounds so much more polite than to say i was flirting and being fast were you flirting he inquired coldly he objected to her ready serenity very much she looked a little puzzled you are very like aunt belinda she said he drew himself up he did not think there was any point of resemblance at all between miss belinda and himself she went on without observing his movement you think every thing means something or is of some importance you said that just as aunt belinda says what will they think it never occurs to me that theyll think at all gracious why should they you will find they do he said well she said glancing at the group gathered under the laburnumtree just now aunt belinda thinks we had better go over to her so suppose we do it at any rate i found out that i was too complaisant to mr poppleton when the party separated for the afternoon barold took lucia home and mr burmistone and the curate walked down the street together mr poppleton was indeed most agreeably exhilarated his expressive little countenance beamed with delight what a very charming person miss bassett is he exclaimed after they had left the gate what a very charming person indeed very charming said mr burmistone with much seriousness a prettier young person i certainly have never seen and those wonderful gowns of hers oh interrupted mr poppleton with natural confusion ireferred to miss belinda bassett though really what you say is very true miss octavia bassettindeedi thinkin fact miss octavia bassett is quite one might almost say even more charming than her aunt yes admitted mr burmistone perhaps one might she is less ripe it is true but that is an objection time will remove there is such a delightful gayety in her manner said mr poppleton such an ingenuous frankness such aasuch spirit it quite carries me away with itquite he walked a few steps thinking over this delightful gayety and ingenuous frankness and then burst out afresh and what a remarkable life she has had too she actually told me that once in her childhood she lived for months in a golddiggers campthe only woman there she says the men were kind to her and made a pet of her she has known the most extraordinary people in the mean time francis barold returned lucia to lady theobalds safe keeping having done so he made his adieus and left the two to themselves her ladyship was it must be confessed a little at a loss to explain to herself what she saw or fancied she saw in the manner and appearance of her young relative she was persuaded that she had never seen lucia look as she looked this afternoon she had a brighter color in her cheeks than usual her pretty figure seemed more erect her eyes had a spirit in them which was quite new she had chatted and laughed gayly with francis barold as she approached the house and after his departure she moved to and fro with a freedom not habitual to her he has been making himself agreeable to her said my lady with grim pleasure he can do it if he chooses and he is just the man to please a girlgoodlooking and with a fine domineering air how did you enjoy yourself she asked very much said lucia never more thank you oh ejaculated my lady and which of her smart new york gowns did miss octavia bassett wear they were at the dinnertable and instead of looking down at her soup lucia looked quietly and steadily across the table at her grandmother she wore a very pretty one she said it was pale fawncolor and fitted her like a glove she made me feel very oldfashioned and badly dressed lady theobald laid down her spoon she made you feel oldfashioned and badly dressedyou yes responded lucia she always does i wonder what she thinks of the things we wear in slowbridge and she even went to the length of smiling a little what she thinks of what is worn in slowbridge lady theobald ejaculated she may i ask what weight the opinion of a young woman from americafrom nevadais supposed to have in slowbridge lucia took a spoonful of soup in a leisurely manner i dont think it is supposed to have any butbut i dont think she minds that i feel as if i shouldnt if i were in her place i have always thought her very lucky you have thought her lucky cried my lady you have envied a nevada young woman who dresses like an actress and loads herself with jewels like a barbarian a girl whose conduct toward men is of a character toto chill ones blood they admire her said lucia simply more than they admire lydia egerton and more than they admire me do you admire her demanded my lady yes grandmamma replied lucia courageously i think i do never had my lady been so astounded in her life for a moment she could scarcely speak when she recovered herself she pointed to the door go to your room she commanded this is american freedom of speech i suppose go to your room lucia rose obediently she could not help wondering what her ladyships course would be if she had the hardihood to disregard her order she really looked quite capable of carrying it out forcibly herself when the girl stood at her bedroom window a few minutes later her cheeks were burning and her hands trembling i am afraid it was very badly done she said to herself i am sure it was butbut it will be a kind of practice i was in such a hurry to try if i were equal to it that i didnt seem to balance things quite rightly i ought to have waited until i had more reason to speak out perhaps there wasnt enough reason then and i was more aggressive than i ought to have been octavia is never aggressive i wonder if i was at all pert i dont think octavia ever means to be pert i felt a little as if i meant to be pert i must learn to balance myself and only be cool and frank then she looked out of the window and reflected a little i was not so very brave after all she said rather reluctantly i didnt tell her mr burmistone was there i darent have done that i am afraid i am slythat sounds sly i am sure chapter xviii contrast lady theobald will put a stop to it was the general remark it will certainly not occur again this was said upon the evening of the first gathering upon miss belindas grassplat and at the same time it was prophesied that mr francis barold would soon go away but neither of the prophecies proved true mr francis barold did not return to london and strange to say lucia was seen again and again playing croquet with octavia bassett and was even known to spend evenings with her perhaps it might be that an appeal made by miss belinda to her ladyship had caused her to allow of these things miss belinda had in fact made a private call upon my lady to lay her case before her i feel so very timid about every thing she said almost with tears and so fearful of trusting myself that i really find it quite a trial the dear child has such a kind hearti assure you she has a kind heart dear lady theobaldand is so innocent of any intention to do wrongi am sure she is innocentthat it seems cruel to judge her severely if she had had the benefit of such training as dear lucias i am convinced that her conduct would have been most exemplary she sees herself that she has faults i am sure she does she said to me only last night in that odd way of hersshe had been sitting evidently thinking deeply for some minutesand she said i wonder if i shouldnt be nicer if i were more like lucia gaston you see what turn her mind must have taken she admires lucia so much yesterday evening at dinner said lady theobald severely lucia informed me that she admired your niece the feeling seems to be mutual miss belinda colored and brightened visibly did she indeed she exclaimed how pleased octavia will be to hear it did she indeed then warned by a chilliness and lack of response in her ladyships manner she modified her delight and became apologetic again these young people are moreare less critical than we are she sighed octavias great prettiness i think lady theobald interposed that lucia has been taught to feel that the body is corruptible and subject to decay and that mere beauty is of small moment miss belinda sighed again that is very true she admitted deprecatingly very true indeed it is to be hoped that octavias stay in slowbridge will prove beneficial to her said her ladyship in her most judicial manner the atmosphere is wholly unlike that which has surrounded her during her previous life i am sure it will prove beneficial to her said miss belinda eagerly the companionship of welltrained and refined young people cannot fail to be of use to her such a companion as lucia would be if you would kindly permit her to spend an evening with us now and then would certainly improve and modify her greatly mr francis barold isis i think of the same opinion at least i fancied i gathered as much from a few words he let fall francis barold repeated lady theobald and what did francis barold say of course it was but very little hesitated miss belinda butbut i could not help seeing that he was drawing comparisons as it were octavia was teaching mr poppleton to play croquet and she was rather exhilarated and perhaps exhibited morefreedom of manner in an innocent wayquite in an innocent thoughtless waythan is exactly customary and i saw mr barold glance from her to lucia who stood near and when i said you are thinking of the contrast between them he answered yes they differ very greatly it is true and of course i knew that my poor octavia could not have the advantage in his eyes she feels this herself i know she shocked me the other day beyond expression by telling me that she had asked him if he thought she was really fast and that she was sure he did poor child she evidently did not comprehend the dreadful significance of such terms a man like francis barold does understand their significance said lady theobald and it is to be deplored that your niece cannot be taught what her position in society will be if such a reputation attaches itself to her the men of the present day fight shy of such characters this dread clause so impressed poor miss belinda by its solemnity that she could not forbear repeating it to octavia afterward though it is to be regretted that it did not produce the effect she had hoped well i must say she observed that if some men fought a little shyer than they do i shouldnt mind it you always do have about half a dozen dangling around who only bore you and who will keep asking you to go to places and sending you bouquets and asking you to dance when they cant dance at all and only tear your dress and stand on your feet if they would fight shy it would be splendid to miss belinda who certainly had never been guilty of the indecorum of having any member of the stronger sex dangling about at all this was very trying my dear she said dont say you always have itit really seems to make it so personal octavia turned around and fixed her eyes wonderingly upon her blushing countenance for a moment she made no remark a marvellous thought shaping itself slowly in her mind aunt belinda she said at length did nobody ever ah no my dear no no i assure you cried miss belinda in the greatest possible trepidation ah dear no suchsuch things rarelyvery rarely happen inslowbridge and besides i couldnt possibly have thought of it i couldnt indeed she was so overwhelmed with maidenly confusion at the appalling thought that she did not recover herself for half an hour at least octavia feeling that it would not be safe to pursue the subject only uttered one word of comment gracious chapter xix an experiment much to her own astonishment lucia found herself allowed new liberty she was permitted to spend the afternoon frequently with octavia and on several occasions that young lady and miss bassett were invited to partake of tea at oldclough in company with no other guest than francis barold i dont know what it means and i think it must mean something said lucia to octavia but it is very pleasant i never was allowed to be so intimate with any one before perhaps suggested octavia sagely she thinks that if you see me often enough you will get sick of me and it will be a lesson to you the more i see of you answered lucia with a serious little air the fonder i am of you i understand you better you are not at all like what i thought you at first octavia but i dont know that theres much to understand in me there is a great deal to understand in you she replied you are a puzzle to me often you seem so frank and yet one knows so little about you after all for instance lucia went on who would imagine that you are so affectionate am i affectionate she asked yes answered lucia i am sure you are very affectionate i have found it out gradually you would suffer things for any one you loved octavia thought the matter over yes she said at length i would you are very fond of miss bassett proceeded lucia as if arraigning her at the bar of justice you are very fond of your father and i am sure there are other people you are very fond ofvery fond of indeed octavia pondered seriously again yes there are she remarked but no one would care about them here and so im not going to make a fuss you dont want to make a fuss over people you llike you dont said lucia you are like francis barold in one way but you are altogether different in another francis barold does not wish to show emotion and he is so determined to hedge himself around that one cant help suspecting that he is always guarding himself against one he seems always to be resenting any interference but you do not appear to care at all and so it is not natural that one should suspect you i did not suspect you what do you suspect me of now of thinking a great deal answered lucia affectionately and of being very clever and very good octavia was silent for a few moments i think she said after the pausei think youll find out that its a mistake no i shall not returned lucia quite glowing with enthusiasm and i know i shall learn a great deal from you this was such a startling proposition that octavia felt decidedly uncomfortable she flushed rosy red im the one who ought to learn things i think she said im always doing things that frighten aunt belinda and you know how the rest regard me octavia said lucia very naively indeed suppose we try to help each other if you will tell me when i am wrong i will try toto have the courage to tell you that will be good practice for me what i want most is courage and frankness and i am sure it will take courage to make up my mind to tell you of yourof your mistakes octavia regarded her with mingled admiration and respect i think thats a splendid idea she said are you sure faltered lucia are you sure you wont mind the things i may have to say really they are quite little things in themselveshardly worth mentioning tell me one of them right now said octavia pointblank oh no exclaimed lucia starting id rather notjust now well commented octavia that sounds as if they must be pretty unpleasant why dont you want to they will be quite as bad tomorrow and to refuse to tell me one is a bad beginning it looks as if you were frightened and it isnt good practice for you to be frightened at such a little thing lucia felt convicted she made an effort to regain her composure no it is not she said but that is always the way i am continually telling myself that i will be courageous and candid and the first time any thing happens i fail i will tell you one thing she stopped short here and looked at octavia guiltily it is somethingi think i would do ifif i were in your place lucia stammered a very little thing indeed well remarked octavia anxiously lucia lost her breath caught it again and proceeded cautiously and with blushes at her own daring if i were in your place she said i thinkthat perhapsonly perhaps you knowi would not wearmy hairquite so low downover my forehead octavia sprang from her seat and ran to the pierglass over the mantle she glanced at the reflection of her own startled pretty face and then putting her hand up to the soft blonde bang which met her brows turned to lucia isnt it becoming she asked breathlessly oh yes lucia answered very octavia started then why wouldnt you wear it she cried what do you mean lucia felt her position truly a delicate one she locked her hands and braced herself but she blushed vividly it may sound rather silly when i tell you why octavia she said but i really do think it is a sort of reason you know in those absurd pictures of actresses bangs always seem to be the principal feature i saw some in the shopwindows when i went to harriford with grandmamma and they were such dreadful womensome of themand had so very few clothes on that i cant help thinking i shouldnt like to look like them and does it make me look like them oh very little answered lucia very little indeed of course but but its the same thing after all put in octavia thats what you mean it is so very little faltered lucia thatthat perhaps it isnt a reason octavia looked at herself in the glass again it isnt a very good reason she remarked but i suppose it will do she paused and looked lucia in the face i dont think thats a little thing she said to be told you look like an opera bouffe actress i did not mean to say so cried lucia filled with the most poignant distress i beg your pardon indeedioh dear i was afraid you wouldnt like it i felt that it was taking a great liberty i dont like it answered octavia but that cant be helped i didnt exactly suppose i should but i wasnt going to say any thing about your hair when i began glancing at poor lucias coiffure though i suppose i might you might say a thousand things about it cried lucia piteously i know that mine is not only in bad taste but it is ugly and unbecoming yes said octavia cruelly it is and yours is neither the one nor the other protested lucia you know i told you it was pretty octavia octavia walked over to the table upon which stood miss belindas workbasket and took therefrom a small and gleaming pair of scissors returning to the mantleglass with them how short shall i cut it she demanded oh exclaimed lucia dont dont for answer octavia raised the scissors and gave a snip it was a savage snip and half the length and width of her lovelocks fell on the mantle then she gave another snip and the other half fell lucia scarcely dared to breathe for a moment octavia stood gazing at herself with pale face and dilated eyes then suddenly the folly of the deed she had done seemed to reveal itself to her oh she cried out oh how diabolical it looks she turned upon lucia why did you make me do it she exclaimed its all your faultevery bit of it and flinging the scissors to the other end of the room she threw herself into a chair and burst into tears lucias anguish of mind was almost more than she could bear for at least three minutes she felt herself a criminal of the deepest dye after the three minutes had elapsed however she began to reason and called to mind the fact that she was failing as usual under her crisis this is being a coward again she said to herself it is worse than to have said nothing it is true that she will look more refined now one can see a little of her forehead and it is cowardly to be afraid to stand firm when i really think so iyes i will say something to her octavia she began aloud i am sure you are making a mistake again this as decidedly as possible which was not very decidedly youyou look very muchnicer i look ghastly said octavia who began to feel rather absurd you do not your foreheadyou have the prettiest forehead i ever saw octavia said lucia eagerly and your eyebrows are perfect iwish you would look at yourself again rather to her surprise octavia began to laugh under cover of her handkerchief reaction had set in and though the laugh was a trifle hysterical it was still a laugh next she gave her eyes a final little dab and rose to go to the glass again she looked at herself touched up the short waving fringe left on her forehead and turned to lucia with a resigned expression do you think that any one who was used to seeing it the other way wouldwould think i looked horrid she inquired anxiously they would think you prettiera great deal lucia answered earnestly dont you know octavia that nothing could be really unbecoming to you you have that kind of face for a few seconds octavia seemed to lose herself in thought of a speculative nature jack always said so she remarked at length jack repeated lucia timidly octavia roused herself and smiled with candid sweetness he is some one i knew in nevada she explained he worked in fathers mine once you must have known him very well suggested lucia somewhat awed i did she replied calmly very well she tucked away her pockethandkerchief in the jaunty pocket at the back of her basque and returned to her chair then she turned again to lucia well she said i think you have found out that you were mistaken havent you dear suppose you tell me of something else lucia colored no she answered that is enough for today chapter xx peculiar to nevada whether or not lucia was right in accusing octavia bassett of being clever and thinking a great deal is a riddle which those who are interested in her must unravel as they read but whether the surmise was correct or incorrect it seemed possible that she had thought a little after the interview when barold saw her next he was struck by a slight but distinctly definable change he recognized in her dress and coiffure her pretty hair had a rather less professional appearance he had the pleasure of observing for the first time how very white her forehead was and how delicate the arch of her eyebrows her dress had a novel air of simplicity and the diamond rings were nowhere to be seen shes better dressed than usual he said to himself and shes always well dressedrather too well dressed fact is for a place like this this sort of thing is in better form under the circumstances it was so much better form and he so far approved of it that he quite thawed and was very amiable and very entertaining indeed octavia was entertaining too she asked several most interesting questions do you think she inquired that it is bad taste to wear diamonds my mother wears themoccasionally have you any sisters no any cousinsas young as i am yaas do they wear them i must admit he replied that they dont in the first place you know they havent any and in the second i am under the impression that lady beauchamptheir mamma you knowwouldnt permit it if they had wouldnt permit it said octavia i suppose they always do as she tells them he smiled a little they would be very courageous young women if they didnt he remarked what would she do if they tried it she inquired she couldnt beat them they will never try it he answered dryly and though i have never seen her beat them or heard their lamentations under chastisement i should not like to say that lady beauchamp could not do any thing she is a very determined personfor a gentlewoman octavia laughed you are joking she said lady beauchamp is a serious subject for jokes he responded my cousins think so at least i wonder if she is as bad as lady theobald octavia reflected aloud she says i have no right to wear diamonds at all until i am married but i dont mind lady theobald she added as a cheerful afterthought i am not fond enough of her to care about what she says are you fond of any one barold inquired speaking with a languid air but at the same time glancing at her with some slight interest from under his eyelids lucia says i am she returned with the calmness of a young person who wished to regard the matter from an unembarrassed point of view lucia says i am affectionate ah deliberately are you she turned and looked at him serenely should you think so she asked this was making such a personal matter of the question that he did not exactly enjoy it it was certainly not good form to pull a man up in such cool style really he replied iahhave had no opportunity of judging he had not the slightest intention of being amusing but to his infinite disgust he discovered as soon as he spoke that she was amused she laughed outright and evidently only checked herself because he looked so furious in consideration for his feelings she assumed an air of mild but preternatural seriousness no she remarked that is true you havent of course he was silent he did not enjoy being amusing at all and he made no pretence of appearing to submit to the indignity calmly she bent forward a little ah she exclaimed you are mad againi mean you are vexed i am always vexing you there was a hint of appeal in her voice which rather pleased him but he had no intention of relenting at once i confess i am at a loss to know why you laughed he said are you she asked really letting her eyes rest upon him anxiously for a moment then she actually gave vent to a little sigh we look at things so differently thats it she said i suppose it is he responded still chillingly in spite of this she suddenly assumed a comparatively cheerful aspect a happy thought occurred to her lucia would beg your pardon she said i am learning good manners from lucia suppose i beg your pardon it is quite unnecessary he replied lucia wouldnt think so she said and why shouldnt i be as wellbehaved as lucia i beg your pardon he felt rather absurd and yet somewhat mollified she had a way of looking at him sometimes when she had been unpleasant which rather soothed him in fact he had found of late a little to his private annoyance that it was very easy for her either to soothe or disturb him and now just as octavia had settled down into one of the prettiest and least difficult of her moods there came a knock at the front door which being answered by mary anne was found to announce the curate of st james enter consequently the rev arthur poppletonblushing a trifle timorous perhaps but happy beyond measure to find himself in miss belindas parlor again with miss belindas niece perhaps the least possible shade of his joyousness died out when he caught sight of mr francis barold and certainly mr francis barold was not at all delighted to see him what does the fellow want that gentleman was saying inwardly what does he come simpering and turning pink here for why doesnt he go and see some of his old women and read tracts to them thats his business octavias manner toward her visitor formed a fresh grievance for barold she treated the curate very well indeed she seemed glad to see him she was wholly at her ease with him she made no trying remarks to him she never stopped to fix her eyes upon him in that inexplicable style and she did not laugh when there seemed nothing to laugh at she was so gay and goodhumored that the rev arthur poppleton beamed and flourished under her treatment and forgot to change color and even ventured to talk a good deal and make divers quite presentable little jokes i should like to know thought barold growing sulkier as the others grew merrieri should like to know what she finds so interesting in him and why she chooses to treat him better than she treats me for she certainly does treat him better it was hardly fair however that he should complain for at times he was treated extremely well and his intimacy with octavia progressed quite rapidly perhaps if the truth were told it was always himself who was the first means of checking it by some suddenly prudent instinct which led him to feel that perhaps he was in rather a delicate position and had better not indulge in too much of a good thing he had not been an eligible and unimpeachable desirable parti for ten years without acquiring some of that discretion which is said to be the better part of valor the matteroffact air with which octavia accepted his attentions caused him to pull himself up sometimes if he had been brown or jones or even robinson she could not have appeared to regard them as more entirely natural whenhe had gone so far once or twicehe had deigned to make a more than usually agreeable speech to her it was received with none of that charming sensitive tremor to which he was accustomed octavia neither blushed nor dropped her eyes it did not add to barolds satisfaction to find her as cheerful and ready to be amused by a mild little curate who blushed and stammered and was neither brilliant graceful nor distinguished could not octavia see the wide difference between the two regarding the matter in this light and watching octavia as she encouraged her visitor and laughed at his jokes and never once tripped him up by asking him a startling question did not as already has been said improve mr francis barolds temper and by the time his visit was over he had lapsed into his coldest and most haughty manner as soon as miss belinda entered and engaged mr poppleton for a moment he rose and crossed the little room to octavias side i must bid you goodafternoon he said octavia did not rise sit down a minute while aunt belinda is talking about redflannel nightcaps and lumbago she said i wanted to ask you something by the way what is lumbago is that what you wished to ask me he inquired stiffly no i just thought of that have you ever had it and what is it like all the old people in slowbridge have it and they tell you all about it when you go to see them aunt belinda says so what i wanted to ask you was different possibly miss bassett might be able to tell you he remarked about the lumbago well perhaps she might ill ask her do you think it bad taste in me to wear diamonds she said this with the most delightful seriousness fixing her eyes upon him with her very prettiest look of candid appeal as if it were the most natural thing in the world that she should apply to him for information he felt himself faltering again how white that bit of forehead was how soft that blonde waving fringe of hair what a lovely shape her eyes were and how large and clear as she raised them why do you ask me he inquired because i think you are an unprejudiced person lady theobald is not i have confidence in you tell me there was a slight pause really he said after it i can scarcely believe that my opinion can be of any value in your eyes i amcan only tell you that it is hardly customary inanin england for young people to wear a profusion of ornament i wonder if i wear a profusion you dont need any he condescended you are too young andall that sort of thing she glanced down at her slim unringed hands for a moment her expression quite thoughtful lucia and i almost quarrelled the other day she saidat least i almost quarrelled it isnt so nice to be told of things after all i must say i dont like it as much as i thought i should he kept his seat longer than he had intended and when he rose to go the rev arthur poppleton was shaking hands with miss belinda and so it fell out that they left the house together you know miss octavia bassett well i suppose remarked barold with condescension as they passed through the gate you clergymen are fortunate fellows i wish that others knew her as well sir said the little gentleman kindling i wish they knew herher generosity and kindness of heart and ready sympathy with misfortune ah commented mr barold twisting his mustache with somewhat of an incredulous air this was not at all the sort of thing he had expected to hear for his own part it would not have occurred to him to suspect her of the possession of such desirable and orthodox qualities there are those whomisunderstand her cried the curate warming with his subject who misunderstand andyes and apply harsh terms to her innocent gayety and freedom of speech if they knew her as i do they would cease to do so i should scarcely have thoughtbegan barold there are many who scarcely think itif you will pardon my interrupting you said the curate i think they would scarcely believe it if i felt at liberty to tell them which i regret to say i do not i am almost breaking my word in saying what i cannot help saying to yourself the poor under my care are better off since she came and there are some who have seen her more than once though she did not go as a teacher or to reprove them for faults and her way of doing what she did was new to them and perhaps much less serious than they were accustomed to and they liked it all the better ah commented barold again flannel undergarments andthat sort of thing no with much spirit not at all sir but what as i said they liked much better it is not often they meet a beautiful creature who comes among them with open hands and the natural ungrudging way of giving which she has sometimes they are at a loss to understand as well as the rest they have been used to what is narrower and moremore exacting they have been used to lady theobald observed barold with a faint smile it would not become me toto mention lady theobald in any disparaging manner replied the curate but the best and most charitable among us do not always carry out our good intentions in the best way i dare say lady theobald would consider miss octavia bassett too readily influenced and too lavish she is as generous with her money as with her diamonds perhaps said barold possibly the quality is peculiar to nevada we part here mr poppleton i believe goodmorning chapter xxi lord lansdowne one morning in the following week mrs burnham attired herself in her secondbest black silk and leaving the misses burnham practising diligently turned her steps toward oldclough hall arriving there she was ushered into the blue drawingroom by dobson in his character of footman and in a few minutes lucia appeared when mrs burnham saw her she assumed a slight air of surprise why my dear she said as she shook hands i should scarcely have known you and though this was something of an exaggeration there was some excuse for the exclamation lucia was looking very charming and several changes might be noted in her attire and appearance the ugly twist had disappeared from her delicate head and in its place were soft loose waves and light puffs she had even ventured on allowing a few ringed locks to stray on to her forehead her white morningdress no longer wore the trademark of miss chickie but had been remodelled by some one of more taste what a pretty gown my dear said mrs burnham glancing at it curiously a watteau plait down the backisnt it a watteau plaitand little ruffles down the front and pale pink bows it is quite like some of miss octavia bassetts dresses only not so overtrimmed i do not think octavias dresses would seem overtrimmed if she wore them in london or paris said lucia bravely it is only because we are so very quiet and dress so little in slowbridge that they seem so and your hair remarked mrs burnham you drew your idea of that from some style of hers i suppose very becoming indeed well well and how does lady theobald like all this my dear i am not sure thatlucia was beginning when her ladyship interrupted her by entering my dear lady theobald cried her visitor rising i hope you are well i have just been complimenting lucia upon her pretty dress and her new style of dressing her hair miss octavia bassett has been giving her the benefit of her experience it appears we have not been doing her justice who would have believed that she had come from nevada to improve us miss octavia bassett said my lady sonorously has come from nevada to teach our young people a great many thingsnew fashions in duty and demeanor and respect for their elders let us hope they will be benefited if you will excuse me grandmamma said lucia speaking in a soft steady voice i will go and write the letters you wished written go said my lady with majesty and having bidden mrs burnham goodmorning lucia went if mrs burnham had expected any explanation of her ladyships evident displeasure she was doomed to disappointment that excellent and rigorous gentlewoman had a stern sense of dignity which forbade her condescending to the confidential weakness of mere ordinary mortals instead of referring to lucia she broached a more commonplace topic i hope your rheumatism does not threaten you again mrs burnham she remarked i am very well thank you my dear said mrs burnham so well that i am thinking quite seriously of taking the dear girls to the gardenparty when it comes off to the gardenparty repeated her ladyship may i ask who thinks of giving a gardenparty in slowbridge it is no one in slowbridge replied this lady cheerfully some one who lives a little out of slowbridgemr burmistone my dear lady theobald at his new place mr burmistone yes my dear and a most charming affair it is to be if we are to believe all we hear surely you have heard something of it from mr barold mr barold has not been to oldclough for several days then he will tell you when he comes for i suppose he has as much to do with it as mr burmistone i have heard before announced my lady of men of mr burmistones class securing the services of persons of established position in society when they wished to spend their money upon entertainments but i should scarcely have imagined that francis barold would have allowed himself to be made a party to such a transaction but put in mrs burnham rather eagerly it appears that mr burmistone is not such an obscure person after all he is an oxford man and came off with honors he is quite a wellborn man and gives this entertainment in honor of his friend and relation lord lansdowne lord lansdowne echoed her ladyship sternly son of the marquis of lauderdale whose wife was lady honora erroll did mr burmistone give you this information asked lady theobald with ironic calmness mrs burnham colored never so faintly ithat is to saythere is a sort of acquaintance between one of my maids and the butler at the burmistone place and when the girl was doing lydias hair she told her the story lord lansdowne and his father are quite fond of mr burmistone it is said it seems rather singular to my mind that we should not have known of this before but how should we learn we none of us know lord lansdowne or even the marquis i think he is only a second or third cousin we are a littlejust a little set in slowbridge you know my dear at least i have thought so sometimes lately i must confess remarked my lady that i have not regarded the matter in that light that is because you have a better right toto be a little set than the rest of us was the amiable response lady theobald did not disclaim the privilege she felt the sentiment an extremely correct one but she was not very warm in her manner during the remainder of the call and incongruous as such a statement may appear it must be confessed that she felt that miss octavia bassett must have something to do with these defections on all sides and that gardenparties and all such swervings from established slowbridge custom were the natural result of nevada frivolity and freedom of manners it may be that she felt remotely that even lord lansdowne and the marquis of lauderdale were to be referred to the same reprehensible cause and that but for octavia bassett mr burmistone would not have been educated at oxford and have come off with honors and have turned out to be related to respectable people but would have remained in appropriate obscurity i suppose she said afterward to lucia that your friend miss octavia bassett is in mr burmistones confidence if no one else has been permitted to have that honor i have no doubt she has known of this approaching entertainment for some weeks i do not know grandmamma replied lucia putting her letters together and gaining color as she bent over them she was wondering with inward trepidation what her ladyship would say if she knew the whole truthif she knew that it was her granddaughter and not octavia bassett who enjoyed mr burmistones confidence ah she thought how could i ever dare to tell her the same day francis barold sauntered up to pay them a visit and then as mrs burnham had prophesied lady theobald heard all she wished to hear and indeed a great deal more what is this i am told of mr burmistone francis she inquired that he intends to give a gardenparty and that lord lansdowne is to be one of the guests and that he has caused it to be circulated that they are cousins that lansdowne has caused it to be circulatedor burmistone it is scarcely likely that lord lansdowne beg pardon he interrupted fixing his single glass dexterously in his right eye and gazing at her ladyship through it cant see why lansdowne should object fact is he is a great deal fonder of burmistone than relations usually are of each other now i often find that kind of thing a bore but lansdowne doesnt seem to they were at school together it seems and at oxford too and burmistone is supposed to have behaved pretty well towards lansdowne at one time when he was rather a wild fellowso the father and mother say as to burmistone causing it to be circulated that sort of thing is rather absurd the man isnt a cad you know pray dont say you know francis said her ladyship i know very little but what i have chanced to see and i must confess i have not been prepossessed in mr burmistones favor why did he not choose to inform us that he was lord lansdownes second cousin and knew the marquis of lauderdale grandmamma broke in lucia with very pretty spirit would that have prepossessed you in his favor would you have forgiven him for building the mills on lord lansdownes account ii wish i was related to a marquis which was very bold indeed may i ask said her ladyship in her most monumental manner when you became mr burmistones champion chapter xxii you have made it livelier when she had become mr burmistones champion indeed she could scarcely have told when unless perhaps she had fixed the date at the first time she had heard his name introduced at a high tea with every politely opprobrious epithet affixed she had defended him in her own mind then and felt sure that he deserved very little that was said against him and very likely nothing at all and the first time she had seen and spoken to him she had been convinced that she had not made a mistake and that he had been treated with cruel injustice how kind he was how manly how clever and how well he bore himself under the popular adverse criticism she only wondered that anybody could be so blind and stupid and wilful as to assail him and if this had been the case in those early days imagine what she felt now whenah wellwhen her friendship had had time and opportunity to become a much deeper sentiment must it be confessed that she had seen mr burmistone even oftener than octavia and miss belinda knew of of course it had all been quite accidental but it had happened that now and then when she had been taking a quiet walk in the lanes about oldclough she had encountered a gentleman who had dismounted and led his horse by the bridle as he sauntered by her side she had always been very timid at such times and had felt rather like a criminal but mr burmistone had not been timid at all and would indeed as soon have met lady theobald as not for which courage his companion admired him more than ever it was not very long before to be with this hero reassured her and made her feel stronger and more selfreliant she was never afraid to open her soft little heart to him and show him innocently all its goodness and ignorance of worldliness she warmed and brightened under his kindly influence and was often surprised in secret at her own simple readiness of wit and speech it is odd that i am such a different girl whenwhen i am with you she said to him one day i even make little jokes i never should think of making even the tiniest joke before grandmamma somehow she never seems quite to understand jokes she never laughs at them you always laugh and i am sure it is very kind of you to encourage me so but you must not encourage me too much or i might forget and make a little joke at dinner and i think if i did she would choke over her soup perhaps when she dressed her hair and adorned herself with pale pink bows and like appurtenances this artful young person had privately in mind other beholders than mrs burnham and other commendation than that to be bestowed by that most excellent matron do you mind my telling you that you have put on an enchanted garment said mr burmistone the first time they met when she wore one of the oldnew gowns i thought i knew before how i dont mind it at all said lucia blushing brilliantly i rather like it it rewards me for my industry my hair is dressed in a new way i hope you like that too grandmamma does not it had been lady theobalds habit to treat lucia severely from a sense of duty her manner toward her had always rather the tone of implying that she was naturally at fault and yet her ladyship could not have told wherein she wished the girl changed in the good old school in which my lady had been trained it was customary to regard young people as weak foolish and if left to their own desires frequently sinful lucia had not been left to her own desires she had been taught to view herself as rather a bad case and to feel that she was far from being what her relatives had a right to expect to be thrown with a person who did not find her silly or dull or commonplace was a new experience if i had been clever lucia said once to mr burmistoneif i had been clever perhaps grandmamma would have been more satisfied with me i have often wished i had been clever if you had been a boy replied mr burmistone rather grimly and had squandered her money and run into debt and bullied her you would have been her idol and she would have pinched and starved herself to supply your highnesss extravagance when the gardenparty rumor began to take definite form and there was no doubt as to mr burmistones intentions a discussion arose at once and went on in every genteel parlor would lady theobald allow lucia to go and if she did not allow her would not such a course appear very pointed indeed it was universally decided that it would appear pointed but that lady theobald would not mind that in the least and perhaps would rather enjoy it than otherwise and it was thought lucia would not go and it is very likely that lucia would have remained at home if it had not been for the influence of mr francis barold making a call at oldclough he found his august relative in a very majestic mood and she applied to him again for information perhaps she said you may be able to tell me whether it is true that belinda bassettbelinda bassett with emphasis has been invited by mr burmistone to assist him to receive his guests yes it is true was the reply i think i advised it myself burmistone is fond of her they are great friends man needs a woman at such times and he chose belinda bassett in the first place he is on friendly terms with her as i said before replied barold in the second shes just what he wantswellbred kindhearted not likely to make rows et caetera there was a slight pause before he finished adding quietly hes not the man to submit to being refusedburmistone lady theobald did not reply or raise her eyes from her work she knew he was looking at her with calm fixedness through the glass he held in its place so cleverly and she detested this more than any thing else perhaps because she was invariably quelled by it and found she had nothing to say he did not address her again immediately but turned to lucia dropping the eyeglass and resuming his normal condition you will go of course he said lucia glanced across at my lady ido not know grandmamma oh interposed barold you must go there is no reason for your refusing the invitation unless you wish to imply something unpleasantwhich is of course out of the question but there may be reasonsbegan her ladyship burmistone is my friend put in barold in his coolest tone and i am your relative which would make my position in his house a delicate one if he has offended you when lucia saw octavia again she was able to tell her that they had received invitations to the fete and that lady theobald had accepted them she has not spoken a word to me about it but she has accepted them said lucia i dont quite understand her lately octavia she must be very fond of francis barold he never gives way to her in the least and she always seems to submit to him i know she would not have let me go if he had not insisted on it in that takingitforgranted way of his naturally mr burmistones fete caused great excitement miss chickie was never so busy in her life and there were rumors that her feelings had been outraged by the discovery that mrs burnham had sent to harriford for costumes for her daughters slowbridge is changing mem said miss chickie with brilliant sarcasm our ladies is led in their fashions by a nevada young person were improving most rapidmore rapid than id ever have dared to hope do you prefer a frill or a flounce mem octavia was in great good spirits at the prospect of the gayeties in question she had been in remarkably good spirits for some weeks she had received letters from nevada containing good news she said shares had gone up again and her father had almost settled his affairs and it would not be long before he would come to england she looked so exhilarated over the matter that lucia felt a little aggrieved will you be so glad to leave us octavia she asked we shall not be so glad to let you go we have grown very fond of you i shall be sorry to leave you and aunt belinda is going with us you dont expect me to be very fond of slowbridge do you and to be sorry i cant take mrs burnhamand the rest barold was present when she made this speech and it rather rankled am i one of the rest he inquired the first time he found himself alone with her he was sufficiently piqued to forget his usual hauteur and discretion would you like to be she said oh very muchvery muchnaturally he replied severely they were standing near a rosebush in the garden and she plucked a rose and regarded it with deep interest well she said next i must say i think i shouldnt have had such a good time if you hadnt been here you have made it livelier thaanks he remarked you are most kind oh she answered its true if it wasnt i shouldnt say it you and mr burmistone and mr poppleton have certainly made it livelier he went home in such a bad humor that his host who was rather happier than usual commented upon his grave aspect at dinner you look as if you had heard ill news old fellow he said whats up oh nothing he was answered sardonically nothing whateverunless that i have been rather snubbed by a young lady from nevada ah with great seriousness thats rather cool isnt it its her little way said barold it seems to be one of the customs of nevada in fact he was very savage indeed he felt that he had condescended a good deal lately he seldom bestowed his time on women and when he did so at rare intervals he chose those who would do the most honor to his taste at the least cost of trouble and he was obliged to confess to himself that he had broken his rule in this case upon analyzing his motives and necessities he found that after all he must have extended his visit simply because he chose to see more of this young woman from nevada and that really upon the whole he had borne a good deal from her sometimes he had been much pleased with her and very well entertained but often enoughin fact rather too oftenshe had made him exceedingly uncomfortable her manners were not what he was accustomed to she did not consider that all men were not to be regarded from the same point of view perhaps he did not put into definite words the noble and patriotic sentiment that an englishman was not to be regarded from the same point of view as an american and that though all this sort of thing might do with fellows in new york it was scarcely what an englishman would stand perhaps as i say he had not put this sentiment into words but it is quite certain that it had been uppermost in his mind upon more occasions than one as he thought their acquaintance over this evening he was rather severe upon octavia he even was roused so far as to condescend to talk her over with burmistone if she had been well brought up he said she would have been a different creature very different i have no doubt said burmistone thoughtfully when you say well brought up by the way do you mean brought up like your cousin miss gaston there is a medium said barold loftily i regret to say lady theobald has not hit upon it well as you say commented mr burmistone i suppose there is a medium a charming wife she would make for a man with a position to maintain remarked barold with a short and somewhat savage laugh octavia bassett queried burmistone thats true but i am afraid she wouldnt enjoy itif you are supposing the man to be an englishman brought up in the regulation groove ah exclaimed barold impatiently i was not looking at it from her point of view but from his mr burmistone slipped his hands in his pockets and jingled his keys slightly as he did once before in an earlier part of this narrative ah from his he repeated not from hers his point of view would differ from hersnaturally barold flashed a little and took his cigar from his mouth to knock off the ashes a man is not necessarily a snob he said because he is cool enough not to lose his head where a woman is concerned you cant marry a woman who will make mistakes and attract universal attention by her conduct has it struck you that octavia bassett would inquired burmistone she would do as she chose said barold petulantly she would do things which were unusual but i was not referring to her in particular why should i ah said burmistone i only thought of her because it did not strike me that one would ever feel she had exactly blundered she is not easily embarrassed there is a sangfroid about her which carries things off ah deigned barold she has sangfroid enough and to spare he was silent for some time afterward and sat smoking later than usual when he was about to leave the room for the night he made an announcement for which his host was not altogether prepared when the fete is over my dear fellow he said i must go back to london and i shall be deucedly sorry to do it look here said burmistone thats a new idea isnt it no an old one but i have been putting the thing off from day to day by jove i did not think it likely that i should put it off the day i landed here and he laughed rather uneasily chapter xxiii may i go the very day after this octavia opened the fourth trunk she had had it brought down from the garret when there came a summons on the door and lucia gaston appeared lucia was very pale and her large soft eyes wore a decidedly frightened look she seemed to have walked fast and was out of breath evidently something had happened octavia she said mr dugald binnie is at oldclough who is he he is my granduncle explained lucia tremulously he has a great deal of money grandmammashe stopped short and colored and drew her slight figure up i do not quite understand grandmamma octavia she said last night she came to my room to talk to me and this morning she came again andoh she broke out indignantly how could she speak to me in such a manner what did she say inquired octavia she said a great many things with great spirit it took her a long time to say them and i do not wonder at it it would have taken me a hundred years if i had been in her place ii was wrong to say i did not understand her i didbefore she had finished what did you understand she was afraid to tell me in plain wordsi never saw her afraid before but she was afraid she has been arranging my future for me and it does not occur to her that i dare object that is because she knows i am a coward and despises me for itand it is what i deserve if i make the marriage she chooses she thinks mr binnie will leave me his money i am to run after a man who does not care for me and make myself attractive in the hope that he will condescend to marry me because mr binnie may leave me his money do you wonder that it took even lady theobald a long time to say that well remarked octavia you wont do it i suppose i wouldnt worry she wants you to marry mr barold i suppose lucia started how did you guess she exclaimed oh i always knew it i didnt guess and she smiled ever so faintly that is one of the reasons why she loathes me so she added lucia thought deeply for a moment she recognized all at once several things she had been mystified by before oh it is it is she said and she has thought of it all the time when i never suspected her octavia smiled a little again lucia sat thinking her hands clasped tightly i am glad i came here she said at length i am angry now and i see things more clearly if she had only thought of it because mr binnie came i could have forgiven her more easily but she has been making coarse plans all the time and treating me with contempt octavia she added turning upon her with flushing cheeks and sparkling eyes i think that for the first time in my life i am in a passiona real passion i think i shall never be afraid of her any more her delicate nostrils were dilated she held her head up her breath came fast there was a hint of exultation in her tone yes she said i am in a passion and i am not afraid of her at all i will go home and tell her what i think and it is quite probable that she would have done so but for a trifling incident which occurred before she reached her ladyship she walked very fast after she left the house she wanted to reach oldclough before one whit of her anger cooled down though somehow she felt quite sure that even when her anger died out her courage would not take flight with it mr dugald binnie had not proved to be a very fascinating person he was an acrid dictatorial old man he contradicted lady theobald flatly every five minutes and bullied his manservant but it was not against him that lucias indignation was aroused she felt that lady theobald was quite capable of suggesting to him that francis barold would be a good match for her and if she had done so it was scarcely his fault if he had accepted the idea she understood now why she had been allowed to visit octavia and why divers other things had happened she had been sent to walk with francis barold he had been almost reproached when he had not called perhaps her ladyship had been good enough to suggest to him that it was his duty to further her plans she was as capable of that as of any thing else which would assist her to gain her point the girls cheeks grew hotter and hotter her eyes brighter at every step because every step brought some new thought her hands trembled and her heart beat i shall never be afraid of her again she said as she turned the corner into the road never never and at that very moment a gentleman stepped out of the wood at her right and stopped before her she started back with a cry mr burmistone she said mr burmistone she wondered if he had heard her last words she fancied he had he took hold of her shaking little hand and looked down at her excited face i am glad i waited for you he said in the quietest possible tone something is the matter she knew there would be no use in trying to conceal the truth and she was not in the mood to make the effort she scarcely knew herself she gave quite a fierce little laugh i am angry she said you have never seen me angry before i am on my way to myto lady theobald he held her hand as calmly as before he understood a great deal more than she could have imagined what are you going to say to her he asked she laughed again i am going to ask her what she means i am going to tell her she has made a mistake i am going to prove to her that i am not such a coward after all i am going to tell her that i dare disobey herthat is what i am going to say to her she concluded decisively he held her hand rather closer let us take a stroll in the copse and talk it over he said it is deliciously cool there i dont want to be cool she said but he drew her gently with him and a few steps took them into the shade of the young oaks and pines and there he paused she has made you very angry he said and then almost before she knew what she was doing she was pouring forth the whole of her story even more of it than she had told octavia she had not at all intended to do it but she did it nevertheless i am to marry mr francis barold if he will take me she said with a bitter little smilemr francis barold who is so much in love with me as you know his mother approves of the match and sent him here to make love to me which he has done as you have seen i have no money of my own but if i make a marriage which pleases him dugald binnie will probably leave me hiswhich it is thought will be an inducement to my cousin who needs one if i marry him or rather he marries me lady theobald thinks mr binnie will be pleased it does not even matter whether francis is pleased or not and of course i am out of the question but it is hoped that it will please mr binnie the two ladies have talked it over and decided the matter i dare say they have offered me to francis who has very likely refused me though perhaps he may be persuaded to relent in timeif i am very humble and he is shown the advantage of having mr binnies money added to his ownbut i have no doubt i shall have to be very humble indeed that is what i learned from lady theobald last night and it is what i am going to talk to her about is it enough to make one angry do you think is it enough he did not tell her whether he thought it enough or not he looked at her with steady eyes lucia he said i wish you would let me go and talk with lady theobald you she said with a little start yes he answered let me go to her let me tell her that instead of marrying francis barold you will marry me if you will say yes to that i think i can promise that you need never be afraid of her any more the fierce color died out of her cheeks and the tears rushed to her eyes she raised her face with a pathetic look oh she whispered you must be very sorry for me i think you have been sorry for me from the first i am desperately in love with you he answered in his quietest way i have been desperately in love with you from the first may i go she looked at him for a moment incredulously then she faltered yes she still looked up at him and then in spite of her happiness or perhaps because of it she suddenly began to cry softly and forgot she had been angry at all as he took her into his strong kind arms chapter xxiv the gardenparty the morning of the gardenparty arose bright and clear and slowbridge awakened in a great state of excitement miss chickie having worked until midnight that all her orders might be completed was so overpowered by her labors as to have to take her tea and toast in bed at oldclough varied sentiments prevailed lady theobalds manner was chiefly distinguished by an implacable rigidity she had chosen as an appropriate festal costume a funerealblack moire antique enlivened by massive fringes and ornaments of jet her jewelry being chains and manacles of the latter which rattled as she moved with a sound somewhat suggestive of bones mr dugald binnie who had received an invitation had as yet amiably forborne to say whether he would accept it or not he had been out when mr burmistone called and had not seen him when lady theobald descended to breakfast she found him growling over his newspaper and he glanced up at her with a polite scowl going to a funeral he demanded i accompany my granddaughter to thisthis entertainment her ladyship responded it is scarcely a joyous occasion to my mind no need to dress yourself like that if it isnt ejaculated mr binnie why dont you stay at home if you dont want to go mans all right isnt he once knew a man by the name of burmistone myself one of the few decent fellows ive met if i were sure this was the same man id go myself when i find a fellow whos neither knave nor fool i stick to him believe ill send to find out wheres lucia what his opinion of lucia was it was difficult to discover he had an agreeable habit of staring at her over the top of his paper and over his dinner the only time he had made any comment upon her was the first time he saw her in the dress she had copied from octavias nice gown that he blurted out didnt get it here ill wager its an old dress i remodelled answered lucia somewhat alarmed i made it myself doesnt look like it he said gruffly lucia had touched up another dress and was very happy in the prospect of wearing it at the gardenparty dont call on grandmamma until after wednesday she had said to mr burmistone perhaps she wouldnt let me go she will be very angry i am sure and you are not afraid no she answered i am not afraid at all i shall not be afraid again in fact she had perfectly confounded her ladyship by her demeanor she bore her fiercest glance without quailing in the least or making any effort to evade it under her most scathing comments she was composed and unmoved on the first occasion of my ladys referring to her plans for her future she received a blow which fairly stunned her the girl rose from her chair and looked her straight in the face unflinchingly and with a suggestion of hauteur not easy to confront i beg you will not speak to me of that again she said i will not listen and turning about she walked out of the room this her ladyship had said in sepulchral tones when she recovered her breath this is one of the results of miss octavia bassett and nothing more had been said on the subject since no one in slowbridge was in more brilliant spirits than octavia herself on the morning of the fete before breakfast miss belinda was startled by the arrival of another telegram which ran as follows arrived today per russia be with you tomorrow evening friend with me martin bassett on reading this communication miss belinda burst into floods of delighted tears dear dear martin she wept to think that we should meet again why didnt he let us know he was on the way i should have been so anxious that i should not have slept at all well remarked octavia i suppose that would have been an advantage suddenly she approached miss belinda kissed her and disappeared out of the room as if by magic not returning for a quarter of an hour looking rather soft and moist and brilliant about the eyes when she did return octavia was a marked figure upon the grounds at that gardenparty another dress my dear remarked mrs burnham and what a charming color she has i declare she is usually paler perhaps we owe this to lord lansdowne her dress is becoming at all events privately remarked miss lydia burnham whose tastes had not been consulted about her own it is she who is becoming said her sister it is not the dress so much though her clothes always have a look some way shes prettier than ever today and is enjoying herself she was enjoying herself mr francis barold observed it rather gloomily as he stood apart she was enjoying herself so much that she did not seem to notice that he had avoided her instead of going up to claim her attention half a dozen men were standing about her and making themselves agreeable and she was apparently quite equal to the emergencies of the occasion the young men from broadoaks had at once attached themselves to her train i say barold they had said to him why didnt you tell us about this jolly good fellow you are to come mooning here for a couple of months and keep it all to yourself and then had come lord lansdowne who in crossing the lawn to shake hands with his host had been observed to keep his eye fixed upon one particular point burmistone he said after having spoken his first words who is that tall girl in white and in ten minutes lady theobald mrs burnham mr barold and divers others too numerous to mention saw him standing at octavias side evidently with no intention of leaving it not long after this francis barold found his way to miss belinda who was very busy and rather nervous your niece is evidently enjoying herself he remarked octavia is most happy today answered miss belinda her father will reach slowbridge this evening she has been looking forward to his coming with great anxiety ah commented barold very few people understand octavia said miss belinda im not sure that i follow all her moods myself she is more affectionate than people fancy sheshe has very pretty ways i am very fond of her she is not as frivolous as she appears to those who dont know her well barold stood gnawing his mustache and made no reply he was not very comfortable he felt himself illused by fate and rather wished he had returned to london from broadoaks instead of loitering in slowbridge he had amused himself at first but in time he had been surprised to find his amusement lose something of its zest he glowered across the lawn at the group under a certain beechtree and as he did so octavia turned her face a little and saw him she stood waving her fan slowly and smiling at him in a calm way which reminded him very much of the time he had first caught sight of her at lady theobalds high tea he condescended to saunter over the grass to where she stood once there he proceeded to make himself as disagreeable as possible in a silent and lofty way he felt it only due to himself that he should he did not approve at all of the manner in which lansdowne kept by her its deucedly bad form on his part he said mentally what does he mean by it octavia on the contrary did not ask what he meant by it she chose to seem rather well entertained and did not notice that she was being frowned down there was no reason why she should not find lord lansdowne entertaining he was an agreeable young fellow with an inexhaustible fund of good spirits and no nonsense about him he was fond of all pleasant novelty and octavia was a pleasant novelty he had been thinking of paying a visit to america and he asked innumerable questions concerning that country all of which octavia answered i know half a dozen fellows who have been there he said and they all enjoyed it tremendously if you go to nevada you must visit the mines at bloody gulch she said where he ejaculated i say what a name dont deride my youth and ignorance miss bassett you can call it largentville if you would rather she replied i would rather try the other thank you he laughed it has a more hilarious sound will they despise me at bloody gulch miss bassett i never killed a man in my life barold turned and walked away angry and more melancholy than he could have believed it is time i went back to london he chose to put it the place begins to be deucedly dull mr francis barold seems rather out of spirits said mrs burnham to lady theobald lord lansdowne interferes with his pleasure i had not observed it answered her ladyship and it is scarcely likely that mr francis barold would permit his pleasure to be interfered with even by the son of the marquis of lauderdale but she glared at barold as he passed and beckoned to him where is lucia she demanded i saw her with burmistone half an hour ago he answered coldly have you any message for my mother i shall return to london tomorrow leaving here early she turned quite pale she had not counted upon this at all and it was extremely inopportune what has happened she asked rigidly he looked slightly surprised nothing whatever he replied i have remained here longer than i intended she began to move the manacles on her right wrist he made not the smallest profession of reluctance to go she said at last if you will find lucia you will oblige me she was almost uncivil to miss pilcher who chanced to join her after he was gone she had not the slightest intention of allowing her plans to be frustrated and was only roused to fresh obstinacy by encountering indifference on one side and rebellion on the other she had not brought lucia up under her own eye for nothing she had been disturbed of late but by no means considered herself baffled with the assistance of mr dugald binnie she could certainly subdue lucia though mr dugald binnie had been of no great help so far she would do her duty unflinchingly in fact she chose to persuade herself that if lucia was brought to a proper frame of mind there could be no real trouble with francis barold chapter xxv somebody else but barold did not make any very ardent search for lucia he stopped to watch a game of lawntennis in which octavia and lord lansdowne had joined and finally forgot lady theobalds errand altogether for some time octavia did not see him she was playing with great spirit and lord lansdowne was following her delightedly finally a chance of the game bringing her to him she turned suddenly and found barolds eyes fixed upon her how long have you been there she asked some time he answered when you are at liberty i wish to speak to you do you she said she seemed a little unprepared for the repressed energy of his manner which he strove to cover by a greater amount of coldness than usual well she said after thinking a moment the game will soon be ended i am going through the conservatories with lord lansdowne in course of time but i dare say he can wait she went back and finished her game apparently enjoying it as much as ever when it was over barold made his way to her he had resented her remaining oblivious of his presence when he stood near her and he had resented her enjoyment of her surroundings and now as he led her away leaving lord lansdowne rather disconsolate he resented the fact that she did not seem nervous or at all impressed by his silence what do you want to say to me she asked let us go and sit down in one of the arbors i believe i am a little tirednot that i mind it though ive been having a lovely time then she began to talk about lord lansdowne i like him ever so much she said do you think he will really go to america i wish he would but if he does i hope it wont be for a year or soi mean until we go back from europe still its rather uncertain when we shall go back did i tell you i had persuaded aunt belinda to travel with us shes horribly frightened but i mean to make her go shell get over being frightened after a little while suddenly she turned and looked at him why dont you say something she demanded whats the matter it is not necessary for me to say any thing she laughed do you mean because i am saying every thing myself well i suppose i am i amawfully happy today and cant help talking it seems to make the time go her face had lighted up curiously there was a delighted excitement in her eyes puzzling him are you so fond of your father as all that she laughed againa clear exultant laugh yes she answered of course i am as fond of him as all that its quite natural isnt it i havent observed the same degree of enthusiasm in all the young ladies of my acquaintance he returned dryly he thought such rapture disproportionate to the cause and regarded it grudgingly they turned into an arbor and octavia sat down and leaned forward on the rustic table then she turned her face up to look at the vines covering the roof it looks rather spidery doesnt it she remarked i hope it isnt dont you the light fell bewitchingly on her round little chin and white throat and a bar of sunlight struck on her upturned eyes and the blonde rings on her forehead there is nothing i hate more than spiders she said with a little shiver unless seriously its caterpillarsand caterpillars i loathe then she lowered her gaze and gave her hata large white rubens all soft curling feathers and satin bowsa charming tip over her eyes the brim is broad she said if any thing drops i hope it will drop on it instead of on me now what did you want to say he had not sat down but stood leaning against the rustic woodwork he looked pale and was evidently trying to be cooler than usual i brought you here to ask you a question well she remarked i hope its an important one you look serious enough it is importantrather he responded with a tone of sarcasm you will probably go away soon that isnt exactly a question she commented and its not as important to you as to me he paused a moment annoyed because he found it difficult to go on annoyed because she waited with such undisturbed serenity but at length he managed to begin again i do not think you are expecting the question i am going to ask he said ido not think i expected to ask it myselfuntil today i do not know whywhy i should ask it so awkwardly and feelat such a disadvantage i brought you here to ask youto marry me he had scarcely spoken four words before all her airy manner had taken flight and she had settled herself down to listen he had noticed this and had felt it quite natural when he stopped she was looking straight into his face her eyes were singularly large and bright and clear you did not expect to ask me to marry you she said why didnt you it was not at all what he had expected he did not understand her manner at all imust confess he said stiffly that i felt at first that there wereobstacles in the way of my doing so what were the obstacles he flushed and drew himself up i have been unfortunate in my mode of expressing myself he said i told you i was conscious of my own awkwardness yes she said quietly you have been unfortunate that is a good way of putting it then she let her eyes rest on the table a few seconds and thought a little after all she said i have the consolation of knowing that you must have been very much in love with me if you had not been very much in love with me you would never have asked me to marry you you would have considered the obstacles i am very much in love with you he said vehemently his feelings getting the better of his pride for once however badly i may have expressed myself i am very much in love with you i have been wretched for days was it because you felt obliged to ask me to marry you she inquired the delicate touch of spirit in her tone and words fired him to fresh admiration strange to say it suggested to him possibilities he had not suspected hitherto he drew nearer to her dont be too severe on me he saidquite humbly considering all things and he stretched out his hand as if to take hers but she drew it back smiling ever so faintly do you think i dont know what the obstacles are she said i will tell you my affection was strong enough to sweep them away he said or i should not be here she smiled slightly again i know all about them as well as you do she said i rather laughed at them at first but i dont now i suppose im impressed by their seriousness as aunt belinda says i suppose they are pretty seriousto you nothing would be so serious to me as that you should let them interfere with my happiness he answered thrown back upon himself and bewildered by her logical manner let us forget them i was a fool to speak as i did wont you answer my question she paused a second and then answered you didnt expect to ask me to marry you she said and i didnt expect you to but nowhe broke in impatiently nowi wish you hadnt done it you wish you dont want me she said you want somebody meekersomebody who would respect you very much and obey you im not used to obeying people do you mean also that you would not respect me he inquired bitterly oh she replied you havent respected me much excuse mehe began in his loftiest manner you didnt respect me enough to think me worth marrying she said i was not the kind of girl you would have chosen of your own will you are treating me unfairly he cried you were going to give me a great deal i supposelooking at it in your way she went on but if i wasnt exactly what you wanted i had something to give too im young enough to have a good many years to live and i should have to live them with you if i married you thats something you know he rose from his seat pale with wrath and wounded feeling does this mean that you refuse me he demanded that your answer is no she rose toonot exultant not confused neither pale nor flushed he had never seen her prettier more charming or more natural it would have been no even if there hadnt been any obstacle she answered then he said i need say no more i see that i havehumiliated myself in vain and it is rather bitter i must confess it wasnt my fault she remarked he stepped back with a haughty wave of the hand signifying that she should pass out of the arbor before him she did so but just as she reached the entrance she turned and stood for a second framed in by the swinging vines and their blossoms theres another reason why it should be no she said i suppose i may as well tell you of it im engaged to somebody else chapter xxvi jack the first person they saw when they reached the lawn was mr dugald binnie who had deigned to present himself and was talking to mr burmistone lucia and miss belinda ill go to them said octavia aunt belinda will wonder where i have been but before they reached the group they were intercepted by lord lansdowne and barold had the pleasure of surrendering his charge and watching her with some rather sharp pangs as she was borne off to the conservatories what is the matter with mr barold exclaimed miss pilcher pray look at him he has been talking to miss octavia bassett in one of the arbors put in miss lydia burnham emily and i passed them a few minutes ago and they were so absorbed that they did not see us there is no knowing what has happened lydia exclaimed mrs burnham in stern reproof of such flippancy but the next moment she exchanged a glance with miss pilcher do you thinkshe suggested is it possible it really looks very like it said miss pilcher though it is scarcely to be credited see how pale and angry he looks mrs burnham glanced toward him and then a slight smile illuminated her countenance how furious she remarked cheerfully how furious lady theobald will be naturally it was not very long before the attention of numerous other ladies was directed to mr francis barold it was observed that he took no share in the festivities that he did not regain his natural air of enviable indifference to his surroundingsthat he did not approach octavia bassett until all was over and she was on the point of going home what he said to her then no one heard i am going to london tomorrow goodby goodby she answered holding out her hand to him then she added quickly in an undertone you oughtnt to think badly of me you wont after a while as they drove homeward she was rather silent and miss belinda remarked it i am afraid you are tired octavia she said it is a pity that martin should come and find you tired oh im not tired i was onlythinking it has been a queer day a queer day my dear ejaculated miss belinda i thought it a charming day so it has been said octavia which miss belinda thought rather inconsistent both of them grew rather restless as they neared the house to think said miss belinda of my seeing poor martin again suppose said octavia nervously as they drew up suppose they are herealready they exclaimed miss belinda whobut she got no farther a cry burst from octaviaa queer soft little cry they are here she said they are jackjack and she was out of the carriage and miss belinda following her closely was horrified to see her caught at once in the embrace of a tall bronzed young man who a moment after drew her into the little parlor and shut the door mr martin bassett who was big and sunburned and prosperouslooking stood in the passage smiling triumphantly mmmartin gasped miss belinda whatoh what does this mean martin bassett led her to a seat and smiled more triumphantly still never mind belinda he said dont be frightened its jack belasys and hes the finest fellow in the west and she hasnt seen him for two years martin miss belinda fluttered it is not properit really isnt yes it is answered mr bassett for hes going to marry her before we go abroad it was an eventful day for all parties concerned at its close lady theobald found herself in an utterly bewildered and thunderstruck condition and to mr dugald binnie more than to any one else her demoralization was due that gentleman got into the carriage in rather a better humor than usual same man i used to know he remarked glad to see him i knew him as soon as i set eyes on him do you allude to mr burmistone yes had a long talk with him hes coming to see you tomorrow told him he might come myself appears hes taken a fancy to lucia wants to talk it over suits me exactly and suppose it suits her looks as if it does glad she hasnt taken a fancy to some hawhaw fellow like that fool barold girls generally do burmistones worth ten of him lucia who had been looking steadily out of the carriagewindow turned with an amazed expression lady theobald had received a shock which made all her manacles rattle she could scarcely support herself under it do ishe said am i to understand that mr francis barold does not meet with your approval mr binnie struck his stick sharply upon the floor of the carriage yes by george he said ill have nothing to do with chaps like that if shed taken up with him shed never have heard from me again make sure of that when they reached oldclough her ladyship followed lucia to her room she stood before her arranging the manacles on her wrists nervously i begin to understand now she said i find i was mistaken in my impressions of mr dugald binnies tastesand in my impressions of you you are to marry mr burmistone my rule is over permit me to congratulate you the tears rose to lucias eyes grandmamma she said her voice soft and broken i think i should have been more frank ifif you had been kinder sometimes i have done my duty by you said my lady lucia looked at her pathetically i have been ashamed to keep things from you she hesitated and i have often told myself thatthat it was sly to do itbut i could not help it i trust said my lady that you will be more candid with mr burmistone lucia blushed guiltily ithink i shall grandmamma she said it was the rev alfred poppleton who assisted the rector of st james to marry jack belasys and octavia bassett and it was observed that he was almost as pale as his surplice slowbridge had never seen such a wedding or such a bride as octavia it was even admitted that jack belasys was a singularly handsome fellow and had a dashing adventurous air which carried all before it there was a rumor that he owned silvermines himself and had even done something in diamonds in brazil where he had spent the last two years at all events it was ascertained beyond doubt that being at last a married woman and entitled to splendors of the kind octavia would not lack them her present to lucia who was one of her bridesmaids dazzled all beholders when she was borne away by the train with her father and husband and miss belinda whose bonnetstrings were bedewed with tears the rev alfred poppleton was the last man who shook hands with her he held in his hand a large bouquet which octavia herself had given him out of her abundance slowbridge will miss you missmrs belasys he faltered ii shall miss you perhaps wemay even meet again i have thought that perhaps i should like to go to america and as the train puffed out of the station and disappeared he stood motionless for several seconds and a large and brilliant drop of moisture appeared on the calyx of the lily which formed the centrepiece of his bouquet

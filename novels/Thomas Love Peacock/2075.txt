transcribed from the cassell company edition by david price email ccxpglaforg cassells national library crotchet castle by thomas love peacock picture decorative graphic cassell company limited london paris new york melbourne introduction thomas love peacock was born at weymouth in his first poem the genius of the thames was in its second edition when he became one of the friends of shelley that was in when shelleys age was twenty peacocks twenty seven the acquaintance strengthened until peacock became the friend in whose judgment shelley put especial trust there were many points of agreement peacock at that time shared in a more practical way shelleys desire for root and branch reform both wore poets although not equally gifted and both loved plato and the greek tragedians in crotchet castle peacock has expressed his own delight in greek literature through the talk of the reverend dr folliott but shelleys friendship for peacock included a trust in him that was maintained by points of unlikeness peacock was shrewd and witty he delighted in extravagance of a satire which usually said more than it meant but always rested upon a foundation of good sense then also there was a touch of the poet to give grace to the utterances of a clear headed man of the world it was peacock who gave its name to shelleys poem of alastor or the spirit of solitude published in the spirit of solitude being treated as a spirit of evil peacock suggested calling it alastor since the greek means an evil genius peacocks novels are unlike those of other men they are the genuine expressions of an original and independent mind his reading and his thinking ran together there is free quotation free play of wit and satire grace of invention too but always unconventional the story is always pleasant although always secondary to the play of thought for which it gives occasion he quarrelled with verse whimsically but in all seriousness in an article on the four ages of poetry contributed in to a short lived journal olliers literary miscellany the four ages were he said the iron age the bardic the golden the homeric the silver the virgilian and the brass in which he himself lived a poet in our time he said is a semi barbarian in a civilised community the highest inspirations of poetry are resolvable into three ingredients the rant of unregulated passion the whining of exaggerated feeling and the cant of factitious sentiment and can therefore serve only to ripen a splendid lunatic like alexander a puling driveller like werter or a morbid dreamer like wordsworth in another part of this essay he says while the historian and the philosopher are advancing in and accelerating the progress of knowledge the poet is wallowing in the rubbish of departed ignorance and raking up the ashes of dead savages to find gewgaws and rattles for the grown babies of the age mr scott digs up the poacher and cattle stealers of the ancient border lord byron cruises for thieves and pirates on the shores of the morea and among the greek islands mr southey wades through ponderous volumes of travels and old chronicles from which he carefully selects all that is false useless and absurd as being essentially poetical and when he has a commonplace book full of monstrosities strings them into an epic and so forth peacock going on to characterise in further illustration of his argument wordsworth coleridge moore and campbell he did not refer to shelley and shelley read his friends whimsical attack on poetry with all good humour proceeding to reply to it with a defence of poetry which would have appeared in the same journal if the journal had survived in this novel of crotchet castle there is the same good humoured exaggeration in the treatment of our learned friendlord broughamto whom and to whose labours for the diffusion of useful knowledge there are repeated allusions in one case peacock associates the labours of our learned friend for the general instruction of the masses with encouragement of robbery page and in another with body snatching or worsemurder for dissection page the lord deliver me from the learned friend says dr folliott broughams elevation to a peerage in november as lord brougham and vaux is referred to on page where he is called sir guy do vaux it is not to be forgotten in the reading that this story was written in the year before the passing of the reform bill it ends with a scene suggested by the agricultural riots of that time in the ninth chapter again there is a passage dealing with sir walter scott after the fashion of the criticisms in the four ages of poetry but this critical satire gave nobody pain always there was a ground work of good sense and the broad sweep of the satire was utterly unlike the nibbling censure of the men whose wit is tainted with ill humour we may see also that the poets nature cannot be expelled in this volume we should find the touch of a poets hand in the tale itself when dealing with the adventures of mr chainmail while he stays at the welsh mountain inn if the story did not again and again break out into actual song for it includes half a dozen little poems when peacock wrote his attack on poetry he had only two years before produced a poem of his ownrhododaphnewith a greek fancy of the true and the false love daintily worked out it was his chief work in verse and gave much pleasure to a few among them his friend shelley but he felt that as the world went he was not strong enough to help it by his singing so he confined his writing to the novels in which he could speak his mind in his own way while doing his duty by his country in the east india house where he obtained a post in from to when he retired on a pension he was examiner of india correspondence peacock died in aged eighty one h m note that in this tale mac quedy is mac q e d son of a demonstration mr skionar the transcendentalist is named from skias onar the dream of a shadow and mr philpotwho loves rivers is philopotamos chapter i the villa captain jamy i wad full fain hear some question tween you tway henry v in one of those beautiful valleys through which the thames not yet polluted by the tide the scouring of cities or even the minor defilement of the sandy streams of surrey rolls a clear flood through flowery meadows under the shade of old beech woods and the smooth mossy greensward of the chalk hills which pour into it their tributary rivulets as pure and pellucid as the fountain of bandusium or the wells of scamander by which the wives and daughters of the trojans washed their splendid garments in the days of peace before the coming of the greeks in one of those beautiful valleys on a bold round surfaced lawn spotted with juniper that opened itself in the bosom of an old wood which rose with a steep but not precipitous ascent from the river to the summit of the hill stood the castellated villa of a retired citizen ebenezer mac crotchet esquire was the london born offspring of a worthy native of the north countrie who had walked up to london on a commercial adventure with all his surplus capital not very neatly tied up in a not very clean handkerchief suspended over his shoulder from the end of a hooked stick extracted from the first hedge on his pilgrimage and who after having worked himself a step or two up the ladder of life had won the virgin heart of the only daughter of a highly respectable merchant of dukes place with whom he inherited the honest fruits of a long series of ingenuous dealings mr mac crotchet had derived from his mother the instinct and from his father the rational principle of enriching himself at the expense of the rest of mankind by all the recognised modes of accumulation on the windy side of the law after passing many years in the alley watching the turn of the market and playing many games almost as desperate as that of the soldier of lucullus the fear of losing what he had so righteously gained predominated over the sacred thirst of paper money his caution got the better of his instinct or rather transferred it from the department of acquisition to that of conservation his friend mr ramsbottom the zodiacal mythologist told him that he had done well to withdraw from the region of uranus or brahma the maker to that of saturn or veeshnu the preserver before he fell under the eye of jupiter or seva the destroyer who might have struck him down at a blow it is said that a scotchman returning home after some years residence in england being asked what he thought of the english answered they hanna ower muckle sense but they are an unco braw people to live amang which would be a very good story if it were not rendered apocryphal by the incredible circumstance of the scotchman going back mr mac crotchets experience had given him a just title to make in his own person the last quoted observation but he would have known better than to go back even if himself and not his father had been the first comer of his line from the north he had married an english christian and having none of the scotch accent was ungracious enough to be ashamed of his blood he was desirous to obliterate alike the hebrew and caledonian vestiges in his name and signed himself e m crotchet which by degrees induced the majority of his neighbours to think that his name was edward matthew the more effectually to sink the mac he christened his villa crotchet castle and determined to hand down to posterity the honours of crotchet of crotchet he found it essential to his dignity to furnish himself with a coat of arms which after the proper ceremonies payment being the principal he obtained videlicet crest a crotchet rampant in a sharp arms three empty bladders turgescent to show how opinions are formed three bags of gold pendent to show why they are maintained three naked swords tranchant to show how they are administered and three barbers blocks gaspant to show how they are swallowed mr crotchet was left a widower with two children and after the death of his wife so strong was his sense of the blessed comfort she had been to him that he determined never to give any other woman an opportunity of obliterating the happy recollection he was not without a plausible pretence for styling his villa a castle for in its immediate vicinity and within his own enclosed domain were the manifest traces on the brow of the hill of a roman station or castellum which was still called the castle by the country people the primitive mounds and trenches merely overgrown with greensward with a few patches of juniper and box on the vallum and a solitary ancient beech surmounting the place of the prtorium presented nearly the same depths heights slopes and forms which the roman soldiers had originally given them from this castellum mr crotchet christened his villa with his rustic neighbours he was of course immediately and necessarily a squire squire crotchet of the castle and he seemed to himself to settle down as naturally into an english country gentleman as if his parentage had been as innocent of both scotland and jerusalem as his education was of rome and athens but as though you expel nature with a pitch fork she will yet always come back he could not become like a true born english squire part and parcel of the barley giving earth he could not find in game bagging poacher shooting trespasser pounding footpath stopping common enclosing rack renting and all the other liberal pursuits and pastimes which make a country gentleman an ornament to the world and a blessing to the poor he could not find in these valuable and amiable occupations and in a corresponding range of ideas nearly commensurate with that of the great king nebuchadnezzar when he was turned out to grass he could not find in this great variety of useful action and vast field of comprehensive thought modes of filling up his time that accorded with his caledonian instinct the inborn love of disputation which the excitements and engagements of a life of business had smothered burst forth through the calmer surface of a rural life he grew as fain as captain jamy to hear some argument betwixt ony tway and being very hospitable in his establishment and liberal in his invitations a numerous detachment from the advanced guard of the march of intellect often marched down to crotchet castle when the fashionable season filled london with exhibitors of all descriptions lecturers and else mr crotchet was in his glory for in addition to the perennial literati of the metropolis he had the advantage of the visits of a number of hardy annuals chiefly from the north who as the interval of their metropolitan flowering allowed occasionally accompanied their london brethren in excursions to crotchet castle amongst other things he took very naturally to political economy read all the books on the subject which were put forth by his own countrymen attended all lectures thereon and boxed the technology of the sublime science as expertly as an able seaman boxes the compass with this agreeable mania he had the satisfaction of biting his son the hope of his name and race who had borne off from oxford the highest academical honours and who treading in his fathers footsteps to honour and fortune had by means of a portion of the old gentlemans surplus capital made himself a junior partner in the eminent loan jobbing firm of catchflat and company here in the days of paper prosperity he applied his science illumined genius to the blowing of bubbles the bursting of which sent many a poor devil to the gaol the workhouse or the bottom of the river but left young crotchet rolling in riches these riches he had been on the point of doubling by a marriage with the daughter of mr touchandgo the great banker when one foggy morning mr touchandgo and the contents of his till were suddenly reported absent and as the fortune which the young gentleman had intended to marry was not forthcoming this tender affair of the heart was nipped in the bud miss touchandgo did not meet the shock of separation quite so complacently as the young gentleman for he lost only the lady whereas she lost a fortune as well as a lover some jewels which had glittered on her beautiful person as brilliantly as the bubble of her fathers wealth had done in the eyes of his gudgeons furnished her with a small portion of paper currency and this added to the contents of a fairy purse of gold which she found in her shoe on the eventful morning when mr touchandgo melted into thin air enabled her to retreat into north wales where she took up her lodging in a farm house in merionethshire and boarded very comfortably for a trifling payment and the additional consideration of teaching english french and music to the little ap llymrys in the course of this occupation she acquired sufficient knowledge of welsh to converse with the country people she climbed the mountains and descended the dingles with a foot which daily habit made by degrees almost as steady as a natives she became the nymph of the scene and if she sometimes pined in thought for her faithless strephon her melancholy was anything but green and yellow it was as genuine white and red as occupation mountain air thyme fed mutton thick cream and fat bacon could make it to say nothing of an occasional glass of double x which ap llymry who yielded to no man west of the wrekin in brewage never failed to press upon her at dinner and supper he was also earnest and sometimes successful in the recommendation of his mead and most pertinacious on winter nights in enforcing a trial of the virtues of his elder wine the young ladys personal appearance consequently formed a very advantageous contrast to that of her quondam lover whose physiognomy the intense anxieties of his bubble blowing days notwithstanding their triumphant result had left blighted sallowed and crows footed to a degree not far below that of the fallen spirit who in the expressive language of german romance is described as scathed by the ineradicable traces of the thunderbolts of heaven so that contemplating their relative geological positions the poor deserted damsel was flourishing on slate while her rich and false young knight was pining on chalk squire crotchet had also one daughter whom he had christened lemma and who as likely to be endowed with a very ample fortune was of course an object very tempting to many young soldiers of fortune who were marching with the march of mind in a good condition for taking castles as far as not having a groat is a qualification for such exploits she was also a glittering bait to divers young squires expectant whose fathers were too well acquainted with the occult signification of mortgage and even to one or two sprigs of nobility who thought that the lining of a civic purse would superinduce a very passable factitious nap upon a thread bare title the young lady had received an expensive and complicated education complete in all the elements of superficial display she was thus eminently qualified to be the companion of any masculine luminary who had kept due pace with the astounding progress of intelligence it must be confessed that a man who has not kept due pace with it is not very easily found this march being one of that astounding character in which it seems impossible that the rear can be behind the van the young lady was also tolerably good looking north of tweed or in palestine she would probable have been a beauty but for the valleys of the thames she was perhaps a little too much to the taste of solomon and had a nose which rather too prominently suggested the idea of the tower of lebanon which looked towards damascus in a village in the vicinity of the castle was the vicarage of the reverend doctor folliott a gentleman endowed with a tolerable stock of learning an interminable swallow and an indefatigable pair of lungs his pre eminence in the latter faculty gave occasion to some etymologists to ring changes on his name and to decide that it was derived from follis optimus softened through an italian medium into folle ottimo contracted poetically into folleotto and elided anglic into folliott signifying a first rate pair of bellows he claimed to be descended lineally from the illustrious gilbert folliott the eminent theologian who was a bishop of london in the twelfth century whose studies were interrupted in the dead of night by the devil when a couple of epigrams passed between them and the devil of course proved the smaller wit of the two this reverend gentleman being both learned and jolly became by degrees an indispensable ornament to the new squires table mr crotchet himself was eminently jolly though by no means eminently learned in the latter respect he took after the great majority of the sons of his fathers land had a smattering of many things and a knowledge of none but possessed the true northern art of making the most of his intellectual harlequins jacket by keeping the best patches always bright and prominent chapter ii the march of mind quoth ralpho nothing but the abuse of human learning you producebutler god bless my soul sir exclaimed the reverend doctor folliott bursting one fine may morning into the breakfast room at crotchet castle i am out of all patience with this march of mind here has my house been nearly burned down by my cook taking it into her head to study hydrostatics in a sixpenny tract published by the steam intellect society and written by a learned friend who is for doing all the worlds business as well as his own and is equally well qualified to handle every branch of human knowledge i have a great abomination of this learned friend as author lawyer and politician he is triformis like hecate and in every one of his three forms he is bifrons like janus the true mr facing both ways of vanity fair my cook must read his rubbish in bed and as might naturally be expected she dropped suddenly fast asleep overturned the candle and set the curtains in a blaze luckily the footman went into the room at the moment in time to tear down the curtains and throw them into the chimney and a pitcher of water on her nightcap extinguished her wick she is a greasy subject and would have burned like a short mould the reverend gentleman exhaled his grievance without looking to the right or to the left at length turning on his pivot he perceived that the room was full of company consisting of young crotchet and some visitors whom he had brought from london the reverend doctor folliott was introduced to mr mac quedy the economist mr skionar the transcendental poet mr firedamp the meteorologist and lord bossnowl son of the earl of foolincourt and member for the borough of rogueingrain the divine took his seat at the breakfast table and began to compose his spirits by the gentle sedative of a large cup of tea the demulcent of a well buttered muffin and the tonic of a small lobster the rev dr folliottyou are a man of taste mr crotchet a man of taste is seen at once in the array of his breakfast table it is the foot of hercules the far shining face of the great work according to pindars doctrine the breakfast is the of the great work of the day chocolate coffee tea cream eggs ham tongue cold fowl all these are good and bespeak good knowledge in him who sets them forth but the touchstone is fish anchovy is the first step prawns and shrimps the second and i laud him who reaches even to these potted char and lampreys are the third and a fine stretch of progression but lobster is indeed matter for a may morning and demands a rare combination of knowledge and virtue in him who sets it forth mr mac quedywell sir and what say you to a fine fresh trout hot and dry in a napkin or a herring out of the water into the frying pan on the shore of loch fyne the rev dr folliottsir i say every nation has some eximious virtue and your country is pre eminent in the glory of fish for breakfast we have much to learn from you in that line at any rate mr mac quedyand in many others sir i believe morals and metaphysics politics and political economy the way to make the most of all the modifications of smoke steam gas and paper currency you have all these to learn from us in short all the arts and sciences we are the modern athenians the rev dr folliotti for one sir am content to learn nothing from you but the art and science of fish for breakfast be content sir to rival the boeotians whose redeeming virtue was in fish touching which point you may consult aristophanes and his scholiast in the passage of lysistrata and leave the name of athenians to those who have a sense of the beautiful and a perception of metrical quantity mr mac quedythen sir i presume you set no value on the right principles of rent profit wages and currency the rev dr folliottmy principles sir in these things are to take as much as i can get and pay no more than i can help these are every mans principles whether they be the right principles or no there sir is political economy in a nutshell mr mac quedythe principles sir which regulate production and consumption are independent of the will of any individual as to giving or taking and do not lie in a nutshell by any means the rev dr folliottsir i will thank you for a leg of that capon lord bossnowlbut sir by the bye how came your footman to be going into your cooks room it was very providential to be sure but the rev dr folliottsir as good came of it i shut my eyes and ask no questions i suppose he was going to study hydrostatics and he found himself under the necessity of practising hydraulics mr firedampsir you seem to make very light of science the rev dr folliottyes sir such science as the learned friend deals in everything for everybody science for all schools for all rhetoric for all law for all physic for all words for all and sense for none i say sir law for lawyers and cookery for cooks and i wish the learned friend for all his life a cook that will pass her time in studying his works then every dinner he sits down to at home he will sit on the stool of repentance lord bossnowlnow really that would be too severe my cook should read nothing but ude the rev dr folliottno sir let ude and the learned friend singe fowls together let both avaunt from my kitchen ude says an elegant supper may be given with sandwiches horresco referens an elegant supper d meliora piis no ude for me conviviality went out with punch and suppers i cherish their memory i sup when i can but not upon sandwiches to offer me a sandwich when i am looking for a supper is to add insult to injury let the learned friend and the modern athenians sup upon sandwiches mr mac quedynay sir the modern athenians know better than that a literary supper in sweet edinbro would cure you of the prejudice you seem to cherish against us the rev dr folliottwell sir well there is cogency in a good supper a good supper in these degenerate days bespeaks a good man but much more is wanted to make up an athenian athenians indeed where is your theatre who among you has written a comedy where is your attic salt which of you can tell who was jupiters great grandfather or what metres will successively remain if you take off the three first syllables one by one from a pure antispastic acatalectic tetrameter now sir there are three questions for you theatrical mythological and metrical to every one of which an athenian would give an answer that would lay me prostrate in my own nothingness mr mac quedywell sir as to your metre and your mythology they may een wait a wee for your comedy there is the gentle shepherd of the divine allan ramsay the rev dr folliottthe gentle shepherd it is just as much a comedy as the book of job mr mac quedywell sir if none of us have written a comedy i cannot see that it is any such great matter any more than i can conjecture what business a man can have at this time of day with jupiters great grandfather the rev dr folliottthe great business is sir that you call yourselves athenians while you know nothing that the athenians thought worth knowing and dare not show your noses before the civilised world in the practice of any one art in which they were excellent modern athens sir the assumption is a personal affront to every man who has a sophocles in his library i will thank you for an anchovy mr mac quedymetaphysics sir metaphysics logic and moral philosophy there we are at home the athenians only sought the way and we have found it and to all this we have added political economy the science of sciences the rev dr folliotta hyperbarbarous technology that no athenian ear could have borne premises assumed without evidence or in spite of it and conclusions drawn from them so logically that they must necessarily be erroneous mr skionari cannot agree with you mr mac quedy that you have found the true road of metaphysics which the athenians only sought the germans have found it sir the sublime kant and his disciples mr mac quedyi have read the sublime kant sir with an anxious desire to understand him and i confess i have not succeeded the rev dr folliotthe wants the two great requisites of head and tail mr skionartranscendentalism is the philosophy of intuition the development of universal convictions truths which are inherent in the organisation of mind which cannot be obliterated though they may be obscured by superstitious prejudice on the one hand and by the aristotelian logic on the other mr mac quedywell sir i have no notion of logic obscuring a question mr skionarthere is only one true logic which is the transcendental and this can prove only the one true philosophy which is also the transcendental the logic of your modern athens can prove everything equally and that is in my opinion tantamount to proving nothing at all mr crotchetthe sentimental against the rational the intuitive against the inductive the ornamental against the useful the intense against the tranquil the romantic against the classical these are great and interesting controversies which i should like before i die to see satisfactorily settled mr firedampthere is another great question greater than all these seeing that it is necessary to be alive in order to settle any question and this is the question of water against human life wherever there is water there is malaria and wherever there is malaria there are the elements of death the great object of a wise man should be to live on a gravelly hill without so much as a duck pond within ten miles of him eschewing cisterns and waterbutts and taking care that there be no gravel pits for lodging the rain the sun sucks up infection from water wherever it exists on the face of the earth the rev dr folliottwell sir you have for you the authority of the ancient mystagogue who said for my part i care not a rush or any other aquatic and inesculent vegetable who or what sucks up either the water or the infection i think the proximity of wine a matter of much more importance than the longinquity of water you are here within a quarter of a mile of the thames but in the cellar of my friend mr crotchet there is the talismanic antidote of a thousand dozen of old wine a beautiful spectacle i assure you and a model of arrangement mr firedampsir i feel the malignant influence of the river in every part of my system nothing but my great friendship for mr crotchet would have brought me so nearly within the jaws of the lion the rev dr folliottafter dinner sir after dinner i will meet you on this question i shall then be armed for the strife you may fight like hercules against achelous but i shall flourish the bacchic thyrsus which changed rivers into wine as nonnus sweetly sings mr crotchet juni hope mr firedamp you will let your friendship carry you a little closer into the jaws of the lion i am fitting up a flotilla of pleasure boats with spacious cabins and a good cellar to carry a choice philosophical party up the thames and severn into the ellesmere canal where we shall be among the mountains of north wales which we may climb or not as we think proper but we will at any rate keep our floating hotel well provisioned and we will try to settle all the questions over which a shadow of doubt yet hangs in the world of philosophy mr firedampout of my great friendship for you i will certainly go but i do not expect to survive the experiment the rev dr folliottalter erit tum tiphys et altera qu vehat argo delectos heroas i will be of the party though i must hire an officiating curate and deprive poor dear mrs folliott for several weeks of the pleasure of combing my wig lord bossnowli hope if i am to be of the party our ship is not to be the ship of fools he he the rev dr folliottif you are one of the party sir it most assuredly will not ha ha lord bossnowlpray sir what do you mean by ha ha the rev dr folliottprecisely sir what you mean by he he mr mac quedyyou need not dispute about terms they are two modes of expressing merriment with or without reason reason being in no way essential to mirth no man should ask another why he laughs or at what seeing that he does not always know and that if he does he is not a responsible agent laughter is an involuntary action of certain muscles developed in the human species by the progress of civilisation the savage never laughs the rev dr folliottno sir he has nothing to laugh at give him modern athens the learned friend and the steam intellect society they will develop his muscles chapter iii the roman camp he loved her more then seven yere yet was he of her love never the nere he was not ryche of golde and fe a gentyll man forsoth was he the squyr of lowe degre the reverend doctor folliott having promised to return to dinner walked back to his vicarage meditating whether he should pass the morning in writing his next sermon or in angling for trout and had nearly decided in favour of the latter proposition repeating to himself with great unction the lines of chaucer and as for me though that i can but lite on bokis for to read i me delite and to hem yeve i faithe and full credence and in mine herte have hem in reverence so hertily that there is gam none that fro my bokis makith me to gone but it be seldome on the holie daie save certainly whan that the month of maie is cousin and i here the foulis sing and that the flouris ginnin for to spring farwell my boke and my devocion when his attention was attracted by a young gentleman who was sitting on a camp stool with a portfolio on his knee taking a sketch of the roman camp which as has been already said was within the enclosed domain of mr crotchet the young stranger who had climbed over the fence espying the portly divine rose up and hoped that he was not trespassing by no means sir said the divine all the arts and sciences are welcome here music painting and poetry hydrostatics and political economy meteorology transcendentalism and fish for breakfast the strangera pleasant association sir and a liberal and discriminating hospitality this is an old british camp i believe sir the rev dr folliottroman sir roman undeniably roman the vallum is past controversy it was not a camp sir a castrum but a castellum a little camp or watch station to which was attached on the peak of the adjacent hill a beacon for transmitting alarms you will find such here and there all along the range of chalk hills which traverses the country from north east to south west and along the base of which runs the ancient iknield road whereof you may descry a portion in that long straight white line the strangeri beg your pardon sir do i understand this place to be your property the rev dr folliottit is not mine sir the more is the pity yet is it so far well that the owner is my good friend and a highly respectable gentleman the strangergood and respectable sir i take it means rich the rev dr folliottthat is their meaning sir the strangeri understand the owner to be a mr crotchet he has a handsome daughter i am told the rev dr folliotthe has sir her eyes are like the fish pools of heshbon by the gate of bethrabbim and she is to have a handsome fortune to which divers disinterested gentlemen are paying their addresses perhaps you design to be one of them the strangerno sir i beg pardon if my questions seem impertinent i have no such design there is a son too i believe sir a great and successful blower of bubbles the rev dr folliotta hero sir in his line never did angler in september hook more gudgeons the strangerto say the truth two very amiable young people with whom i have some little acquaintance lord bossnowl and his sister lady clarinda are reported to be on the point of concluding a double marriage with miss crotchet and her brother by way of putting a new varnish on old nobility lord foolincourt their father is terribly poor for a lord who owns a borough the rev dr folliottwell sir the crotchets have plenty of money and the old gentlemans weak point is a hankering after high blood i saw your acquaintance lord bossnowl this morning but i did not see his sister she may be there nevertheless and doing fashionable justice to this fine may morning by lying in bed till noon the strangeryoung mr crotchet sir has been like his father the architect of his own fortune has he not an illustrious example of the reward of honesty and industry the rev dr folliottas to honesty sir he made his fortune in the city of london and if that commodity be of any value there you will find it in the price current i believe it is below par like the shares of young crotchets fifty companies but his progress has not been exactly like his fathers it has been more rapid and he started with more advantages he began with a fine capital from his father the old gentleman divided his fortune into three not exactly equal portions one for himself one for his daughter and one for his son which he handed over to him saying take it once for all and make the most of it if you lose it where i won it not another stiver do you get from me during my life but sir young crotchet doubled and trebled and quadrupled it and is as you say a striking example of the reward of industry not that i think his labour has been so great as his luck the strangerbut sir is all this solid is there no danger of reaction no day of reckoning to cut down in an hour prosperity that has grown up like a mushroom the rev dr folliottnay sir i know not i do not pry into these matters i am for my own part very well satisfied with the young gentleman let those who are not so look to themselves it is quite enough for me that he came down last night from london and that he had the good sense to bring with him a basket of lobsters sir i wish you a good morning the stranger having returned the reverend gentlemans good morning resumed his sketch and was intently employed on it when mr crotchet made his appearance with mr mac quedy and mr skionar whom he was escorting round his grounds according to his custom with new visitors the principal pleasure of possessing an extensive domain being that of showing it to other people mr mac quedy according also to the laudable custom of his countrymen had been appraising everything that fell under his observation but on arriving at the roman camp of which the value was purely imaginary he contented himself with exclaiming eh this is just a curiosity and very pleasant to sit in on a summer day mr skionarand call up the days of old when the roman eagle spread its wings in the place of that beechen foliage it gives a fine idea of duration to think that that fine old tree must have sprung from the earth ages after this camp was formed mr mac quedyhow old think you may the tree be mr crotcheti have records which show it to be three hundred years old mr mac quedythat is a great age for a beech in good condition but you see the camp is some fifteen hundred years or so older and three times six being eighteen i think you get a clearer idea of duration out of the simple arithmetic than out of your eagle and foliage mr skionarthat is a very unpoetical if not unphilosophical mode of viewing antiquities your philosophy is too literal for our imperfect vision we cannot look directly into the nature of things we can only catch glimpses of the mighty shadow in the camera obscura of transcendental intelligence these six and eighteen are only words to which we give conventional meanings we can reason but we cannot feel by help of them the tree and the eagle contemplated in the ideality of space and time become subjective realities that rise up as landmarks in the mystery of the past mr mac quedywell sir if you understand that i wish you joy but i must be excused for holding that my proposition three times six are eighteen is more intelligible than yours a worthy friend of mine who is a sort of amateur in philosophy criticism politics and a wee bit of many things more says men never begin to study antiquities till they are saturated with civilisation mr skionarwhat is civilisation mr mac quedyit is just respect for property a state in which no man takes wrongfully what belongs to another is a perfectly civilised state mr skionaryour friends antiquaries must have lived in el dorado to have had an opportunity of being saturated with such a state mr mac quedyit is a question of degree there is more respect for property here than in angola mr skionarthat depends on the light in which things are viewed mr crotchet was rubbing his hands in hopes of a fine discussion when they came round to the side of the camp where the picturesque gentleman was sketching the stranger was rising up when mr crotchet begged him not to disturb himself and presently walked away with his two guests shortly after miss crotchet and lady clarinda who had breakfasted by themselves made their appearance at the same spot hanging each on an arm of lord bossnowl who very much preferred their company to that of the philosophers though he would have preferred the company of the latter or any company to his own he thought it very singular that so agreeable a person as he held himself to be to others should be so exceedingly tiresome to himself he did not attempt to investigate the cause of this phenomenon but was contented with acting on his knowledge of the fact and giving himself as little of his own private society as possible the stranger rose as they approached and was immediately recognised by the bossnowls as an old acquaintance and saluted with the exclamation of captain fitzchrome the interchange of salutations between lady clarinda and the captain was accompanied with an amiable confusion on both sides in which the observant eyes of miss crotchet seemed to read the recollection of an affair of the heart lord bossnowl was either unconscious of any such affair or indifferent to its existence he introduced the captain very cordially to miss crotchet and the young lady invited him as the friend of their guests to partake of her fathers hospitality an offer which was readily accepted the captain took his portfolio under his right arm his camp stool in his right hand offered his left arm to lady clarinda and followed at a reasonable distance behind miss crotchet and lord bossnowl contriving in the most natural manner possible to drop more and more into the rear lady clarindai am glad to see you can make yourself so happy with drawing old trees and mounds of grass captain fitzchromehappy lady clarinda oh no how can i be happy when i see the idol of my heart about to be sacrificed on the shrine of mammon lady clarindado you know though mammon has a sort of ill name i really think he is a very popular character there must be at the bottom something amiable about him he is certainly one of those pleasant creatures whom everybody abuses but without whom no evening party is endurable i dare say love in a cottage is very pleasant but then it positively must be a cottage orne but would not the same love be a great deal safer in a castle even if mammon furnished the fortification captain fitzchromeoh lady clarinda there is a heartlessness in that language that chills me to the soul lady clarindaheartlessness no my heart is on my lips i speak just what i think you used to like it and say it was as delightful as it was rare captain fitzchrometrue but you did not then talk as you do now of love in a castle lady clarindawell but only consider a dun is a horridly vulgar creature it is a creature i cannot endure the thought of and a cottage lets him in so easily now a castle keeps him at bay you are a half pay officer and are at leisure to command the garrison but where is the castle and who is to furnish the commissariat captain fitzchromeis it come to this that you make a jest of my poverty yet is my poverty only comparative many decent families are maintained on smaller means lady clarindadecent families ay decent is the distinction from respectable respectable means rich and decent means poor i should die if i heard my family called decent and then your decent family always lives in a snug little place i hate a little place i like large rooms and large looking glasses and large parties and a fine large butler with a tinge of smooth red in his face an outward and visible sign that the family he serves is respectable if not noble highly respectable captain fitzchromei cannot believe that you say all this in earnest no man is less disposed than i am to deny the importance of the substantial comforts of life i once flattered myself that in our estimate of these things we were nearly of a mind lady clarindado you know i think an opera box a very substantial comfort and a carriage you will tell me that many decent people walk arm in arm through the snow and sit in clogs and bonnets in the pit at the english theatre no doubt it is very pleasant to those who are used to it but it is not to my taste captain fitzchromeyou always delighted in trying to provoke me but i cannot believe that you have not a heart lady clarindayou do not like to believe that i have a heart you mean you wish to think i have lost it and you know to whom and when i tell you that it is still safe in my own keeping and that i do not mean to give it away the unreasonable creature grows angry captain fitzchromeangry far from it i am perfectly cool lady clarindawhy you are pursing your brows biting your lips and lifting up your foot as if you would stamp it into the earth i must say anger becomes you you would make a charming hotspur your every day dining out face is rather insipid but i assure you my heart is in danger when you are in the heroics it is so rare too in these days of smooth manners to see anything like natural expression in a mans face there is one set form for every mans face in female society a sort of serious comedy walking gentlemans face but the moment the creature falls in love he begins to give himself airs and plays off all the varieties of his physiognomy from the master slender to the petruchio and then he is actually very amusing captain fitzchromewell lady clarinda i will not be angry amusing as it may be to you i listen more in sorrow than in anger i half believe you in earnest and mourn as over a fallen angel lady clarindawhat because i have made up my mind not to give away my heart when i can sell it i will introduce you to my new acquaintance mr mac quedy he will talk to you by the hour about exchangeable value and show you that no rational being will part with anything except to the highest bidder captain fitzchromenow i am sure you are not in earnest you cannot adopt such sentiments in their naked deformity lady clarindanaked deformity why mr mac quedy will prove to you that they are the cream of the most refined philosophy you live a very pleasant life as a bachelor roving about the country with your portfolio under your arm i am not fit to be a poor mans wife i cannot take any kind of trouble or do any one thing that is of any use many decent families roast a bit of mutton on a string but if i displease my father i shall not have as much as will buy the string to say nothing of the meat and the bare idea of such cookery gives me the horrors by this time they were near the castle and met miss crotchet and her companion who had turned back to meet them captain fitzchrome was shortly after heartily welcomed by mr crotchet and the party separated to dress for dinner the captain being by no means in an enviable state of mind and full of misgivings as to the extent of belief that he was bound to accord to the words of the lady of his heart chapter iv the party en quoi cognoissez vous la folie anticque en quoi cognoissez vous la sagesse prsenterabelais if i were sketching a bandit who had just shot his last pursuer having outrun all the rest that is the very face i would give him soliloquised the captain as he studied the features of his rival in the drawing room during the miserable half hour before dinner when dulness reigns predominant over expectant company especially when they are waiting for some one last comer whom they all heartily curse in their hearts and whom nevertheless or indeed therefore the more they welcome as a sinner more heartily than all the just persons who had been punctual to their engagement some new visitors had arrived in the morning and as the company dropped in one by one the captain anxiously watched the unclosing door for the form of his beloved but she was the last to make her appearance and on her entry gave him a malicious glance which he construed into a telegraphic communication that she had stayed away to torment him young crotchet escorted her with marked attention to the upper end of the drawing room where a great portion of the company was congregated around miss crotchet these being the only ladies in the company it was evident that old mr crotchet would give his arm to lady clarinda an arrangement with which the captain could not interfere he therefore took his station near the door studying his rival from a distance and determined to take advantage of his present position to secure the seat next to his charmer he was meditating on the best mode of operation for securing this important post with due regard to bien sance when he was twitched by the button by mr mac quedy who said to him lady clarinda tells me sir that you are anxious to talk with me on the subject of exchangeable value from which i infer that you have studied political economy and as a great deal depends on the definition of value i shall be glad to set you right on that point i am much obliged to you sir said the captain and was about to express his utter disqualification for the proposed instruction when mr skionar walked up and said lady clarinda informs me that you wish to talk over with me the question of subjective reality i am delighted to fall in with a gentleman who daily appreciates the transcendental philosophy lady clarinda is too good said the captain and was about to protest that he had never heard the word transcendental before when the butler announced dinner mr crotchet led the way with lady clarinda lord bossnowl followed with miss crotchet the economist and transcendentalist pinned in the captain and held him one by each arm as he impatiently descended the stairs in the rear of several others of the company whom they had forced him to let pass but the moment he entered the dining room he broke loose from them and at the expense of a little brusquerie secured his position well captain said lady clarinda i perceive you can still manuvre what could possess you said the captain to send two unendurable and inconceivable bores to intercept me with rubbish about which i neither know nor care any more than the man in the moon perhaps said lady clarinda i saw your design and wished to put your generalship to the test but do not contradict anything i have said about you and see if the learned will find you out there is fine music as rabelais observes in the cliquetis dasssiettes a refreshing shade in the ombre de salle manger and an elegant fragrance in the fume de rti said a voice at the captains elbow the captain turning round recognised his clerical friend of the morning who knew him again immediately and said he was extremely glad to meet him there more especially as lady clarinda had assured him that he was an enthusiastic lover of greek poetry lady clarinda said the captain is a very pleasant young lady the rev dr folliottso she is sir and i understand she has all the wit of the family to herself whatever that totum may be but a glass of wine after soup is as the french say the verre de sant the current of opinion sets in favour of hock but i am for madeira i do not fancy hock till i have laid a substratum of madeira will you join me captain fitzchromewith pleasure the rev dr folliotthere is a very fine salmon before me and may is the very point nomm to have salmon in perfection there is a fine turbot close by and there is much to be said in his behalf but salmon in may is the king of fish mr crotchetthat salmon before you doctor was caught in the thames this morning the rev dr folliott rarity of rarities a thames salmon caught this morning now mr mac quedy even in fish your modern athens must yield cedite graii mr mac quedyeh sir on its own around your thames salmon has two virtues over all others first that it is fresh and second that it is rare for i understand you do not take half a dozen in a year the rev dr folliottin some years sir not one mud filth gas dregs lock weirs and the march of mind developed in the form of poaching have ruined the fishery but when we do catch a salmon happy the man to whom he falls mr mac quedyi confess sir this is excellent but i cannot see why it should be better than a tweed salmon at kelso the rev dr folliottsir i will take a glass of hock with you mr mac quedywith all my heart sir there are several varieties of the salmon genus but the common salmon the salmo salar is only one species one and the same everywhere just like the human mind locality and education make all the difference the rev dr folliotteducation well sir i have no doubt schools for all are just as fit for the species salmo salar as for the genus homo but you must allow that the specimen before us has finished his education in a manner that does honour to his college however i doubt that the salmo salar is only one species that is to say precisely alike in all localities i hold that every river has its own breed with essential differences in flavour especially and as for the human mind i deny that it is the same in all men i hold that there is every variety of natural capacity from the idiot to newton and shakespeare the mass of mankind midway between these extremes being blockheads of different degrees education leaving them pretty nearly as it found them with this single difference that it gives a fixed direction to their stupidity a sort of incurable wry neck to the thing they call their understanding so one nose points always east and another always west and each is ready to swear that it points due north mr crotchetif that be the point of truth very few intellectual noses point due north mr mac quedyonly those that point to the modern athens the rev dr folliottwhere all native noses point southward mr mac quedyeh sir northward for wisdom and southward for profit mr crotchet jun champagne doctor the rev dr folliottmost willingly but you will permit my drinking it while it sparkles i hold it a heresy to let it deaden in my hand while the glass of my compotator is being filled on the opposite side of the table by the bye captain you remember a passage in athenus where he cites menander on the subject of fish sauce the captain was aghast for an answer that would satisfy both his neighbours when he was relieved by the divine continuing the science of fish sauce mr mac quedy is by no means brought to perfection a fine field of discovery still lies open in that line mr mac quedynay sir beyond lobster sauce i take it ye cannot go the rev dr folliottin their line i grant you oyster and lobster sauce are the pillars of hercules but i speak of the cruet sauces where the quintessence of the sapid is condensed in a phial i can taste in my minds palate a combination which if i could give it reality i would christen with the name of my college and hand it down to posterity as a seat of learning indeed mr mac quedywell sir i wish you success but i cannot let slip the question we started just now i say cutting off idiots who have no minds at all all minds are by nature alike education which begins from their birth makes them what they are the rev dr folliottno sir it makes their tendencies not their power csar would have been the first wrestler on the village common education might have made him a nadir shah it might also have made him a washington it could not have made him a merry andrew for our newspapers to extol as a model of eloquence mr mac quedynow sir i think education would have made him just anything and fit for any station from the throne to the stocks saint or sinner aristocrat or democrat judge counsel or prisoner at the bar the rev dr folliotti will thank you for a slice of lamb with lemon and pepper before i proceed with this discussionvin de grave mr skionari must interpose one remark there is a set of persons in your city mr mac quedy who concoct every three or four months a thing which they call a review a sort of sugar plum manufacturers to the whig aristocracy mr mac quedyi cannot tell sir exactly what you mean by that but i hope you will speak of those gentlemen with respect seeing that i am one of them the rev dr folliottsir i must drown my inadvertence in a glass of sauterne with you there is a set of gentlemen in your city mr mac quedynot in our city exactly neither are they a set there is an editor who forages for articles in all quarters from john o groats house to the lands end it is not a board or a society it is a mere intellectual bazaar where a b and c bring their wares to market the rev dr folliottwell sir these gentlemen among them the present company excepted have practised as much dishonesty as in any other department than literature would have brought the practitioner under the cognisance of the police in politics they have ran with the hare and hunted with the hound in criticism they have knowingly and unblushingly given false characters both for good and for evil sticking at no art of misrepresentation to clear out of the field of literature all who stood in the way of the interests of their own clique they have never allowed their own profound ignorance of anything greek for instance to throw even an air of hesitation into their oracular decision on the matter they set an example of profligate contempt for truth of which the success was in proportion to the effrontery and when their prosperity had filled the market with competitors they cried out against their own reflected sin as if they had never committed it or were entitled to a monopoly of it the latter i rather think was what they wanted mr crotchethermitage doctor the rev dr folliottnothing better sir the father who first chose the solitude of that vineyard knew well how to cultivate his spirit in retirement now mr mac quedy achilles was distinguished above all the greeks for his inflexible love of truth could education have made achilles one of your reviewers mr mac quedyno doubt of it even if your character of them were true to the letter the rev dr folliottand i say sirchicken and asparagustitan had made him of better clay i hold with pindar all that is most excellent is so by nature education can give purposes but not powers and whatever purposes had been given him he would have gone straight forward to them straight forward mr mac quedy mr mac quedyno sir education makes the man powers purposes and all the rev dr folliottthere is the point sir on which we join issue several others of the company now chimed in with their opinions which gave the divine an opportunity to degustate one or two side dishes and to take a glass of wine with each of the young ladies chapter v characters ay imput a honte plus que mdiocre tre vu spectateur ocieux de tant vaillans disertz et chevalereux personnaiges rabelais lady clarinda to the captaini declare the creature has been listening to all this rigmarole instead of attending to me do you ever expect forgiveness but now that they are all talking together and you cannot make out a word they say nor they hear a word that we say i will describe the company to you first there is the old gentleman on my left hand at the head of the table who is now leaning the other way to talk to my brother he is a good tempered half informed person very unreasonably fond of reasoning and of reasoning people people that talk nonsense logically he is fond of disputation himself when there are only one or two but seldom does more than listen in a large company of illumins he made a great fortune in the city and has the comfort of a good conscience he is very hospitable and is generous in dinners though nothing would induce him to give sixpence to the poor because he holds that all misfortune is from imprudence that none but the rich ought to marry and that all ought to thrive by honest industry as he did he is ambitious of founding a family and of allying himself with nobility and is thus as willing as other grown children to throw away thousands for a gew gaw though he would not part with a penny for charity next to him is my brother whom you know as well as i do he has finished his education with credit and as he never ventures to oppose me in anything i have no doubt he is very sensible he has good manners is a model of dress and is reckoned ornamental in all societies next to him is miss crotchet my sister in law that is to be you see she is rather pretty and very genteel she is tolerably accomplished has her table always covered with new novels thinks mr mac quedy an oracle and is extremely desirous to be called my lady next to her is mr firedamp a very absurd person who thinks that water is the evil principle next to him is mr eavesdrop a man who by dint of a certain something like smartness has got into good society he is a sort of booksellers tool and coins all his acquaintance in reminiscences and sketches of character i am very shy of him for fear he should print me captain fitzchromeif he print you in your own likeness which is that of an angel you need not fear him if he print you in any other i will cut his throat but proceed lady clarindanext to him is mr henbane the toxicologist i think he calls himself he has passed half his life in studying poisons and antidotes the first thing he did on his arrival here was to kill the cat and while miss crotchet was crying over her he brought her to life again i am more shy of him than the other captain fitzchromethey are two very dangerous fellows and i shall take care to keep them both at a respectful distance let us hope that eavesdrop will sketch off henbane and that henbane will poison him for his trouble lady clarindawell next to him sits mr mac quedy the modern athenian who lays down the law about everything and therefore may be taken to understand everything he turns all the affairs of this world into questions of buying and selling he is the spirit of the frozen ocean to everything like romance and sentiment he condenses their volume of steam into a drop of cold water in a moment he has satisfied me that i am a commodity in the market and that i ought to set myself at a high price so you see he who would have me must bid for me captain fitzchromei shall discuss that point with mr mac quedy lady clarindanot a word for your life our flirtation is our own secret let it remain so captain fitzchromeflirtation clarinda is that all that the most ardent lady clarindanow dont be rhapsodical here next to mr mac quedy is mr skionar a sort of poetical philosopher a curious compound of the intense and the mystical he abominates all the ideas of mr mac quedy and settles everything by sentiment and intuition captain fitzchromethen i say he is the wiser man lady clarindathey are two oddities but a little of them is amusing and i like to hear them dispute so you see i am in training for a philosopher myself captain fitzchromeany philosophy for heavens sake but the pound shilling and pence philosophy of mr mac quedy lady clarindawhy they say that even mr skionar though he is a great dreamer always dreams with his eyes open or with one eye at any rate which is an eye to his gain but i believe that in this respect the poor man has got an ill name by keeping bad company he has two dear friends mr wilful wontsee and mr rumblesack shantsee poets of some note who used to see visions of utopia and pure republics beyond the western deep but finding that these el dorados brought them no revenue they turned their vision seeing faculty into the more profitable channel of espying all sorts of virtues in the high and the mighty who were able and willing to pay for the discovery captain fitzchromei do not fancy these virtue spyers lady clarindanext to mr skionar sits mr chainmail a good looking young gentleman as you see with very antiquated tastes he is fond of old poetry and is something of a poet himself he is deep in monkish literature and holds that the best state of society was that of the twelfth century when nothing was going forward but fighting feasting and praying which he says are the three great purposes for which man was made he laments bitterly over the inventions of gunpowder steam and gas which he says have ruined the world he lives within two or three miles and has a large hall adorned with rusty pikes shields helmets swords and tattered banners and furnished with yew tree chairs and two long old worm eaten oak tables where he dines with all his household after the fashion of his favourite age he wants us all to dine with him and i believe we shall go captain fitzchromethat will be something new at any rate lady clarindanext to him is mr toogood the co operationist who will have neither fighting nor praying but wants to parcel out the world into squares like a chess board with a community on each raising everything for one another with a great steam engine to serve them in common for tailor and hosier kitchen and cook captain fitzchromehe is the strangest of the set so far lady clarindathis brings us to the bottom of the table where sits my humble servant mr crotchet the younger i ought not to describe him captain fitzchromei entreat you do lady clarindawell i really have very little to say in his favour captain fitzchromei do not wish to hear anything in his favour and i rejoice to hear you say so because lady clarindado not flatter yourself if i take him it will be to please my father and to have a town and country house and plenty of servants and a carriage and an opera box and make some of my acquaintance who have married for love or for rank or for anything but money die for envy of my jewels you do not think i would take him for himself why he is very smooth and spruce as far as his dress goes but as to his face he looks as if he had tumbled headlong into a volcano and been thrown up again among the cinders captain fitzchromei cannot believe that speaking thus of him you mean to take him at all lady clarindaoh i am out of my teens i have been very much in love but now i am come to years of discretion and must think like other people of settling myself advantageously he was in love with a bankers daughter and cast her off at her fathers bankruptcy and the poor girl has gone to hide herself in some wild place captain fitzchromeshe must have a strange taste if she pines for the loss of him lady clarindathey say he was good looking till his bubble schemes as they call them stamped him with the physiognomy of a desperate gambler i suspect he has still a penchant towards his first flame if he takes me it will be for my rank and connection and the second seat of the borough of rogueingrain so we shall meet on equal terms and shall enjoy all the blessedness of expecting nothing from each other captain fitzchromeyou can expect no security with such an adventurer lady clarindai shall have the security of a good settlement and then if andare al diavolo be his destiny he may go you know by himself he is almost always dreaming and distrait it is very likely that some great reverse is in store for him but that will not concern me you perceive captain fitzchromeyou torture me clarinda with the bare possibility lady clarindahush here is music to soothe your troubled spirit next to him on this side sits the dilettante composer mr trillo they say his name was otrill and he has taken the o from the beginning and put it at the end i do not know how this may be he plays well on the violoncello and better on the piano sings agreeably has a talent at versemaking and improvises a song with some felicity he is very agreeable company in the evening with his instruments and music books he maintains that the sole end of all enlightened society is to get up a good opera and laments that wealth genius and energy are squandered upon other pursuits to the neglect of this one great matter captain fitzchromethat is a very pleasant fancy at any rate lady clarindai assure you he has a great deal to say for it well next to him again is dr morbific who has been all over the world to prove that there is no such thing as contagion and has inoculated himself with plague yellow fever and every variety of pestilence and is still alive to tell the story i am very shy of him too for i look on him as a walking phial of wrath corked full of all infections and not to be touched without extreme hazard captain fitzchromethis is the strangest fellow of all lady clarindanext to him sits mr philpot the geographer who thinks of nothing but the heads and tails of rivers and lays down the streams of terra incognita as accurately as if he had been there he is a person of pleasant fancy and makes a sort of fairy land of every country he touches from the frozen ocean to the deserts of sahara captain fitzchromehow does he settle matters with mr firedamp lady clarindayou see mr firedamp has got as far as possible out of his way next to him is sir simon steeltrap of steeltrap lodge member for crouching curtown justice of peace for the county and lord of the united manors of spring gun and treadmill a great preserver of game and public morals by administering the laws which he assists in making he disposes at his pleasure of the land and its live stock including all the two legged varieties with and without feathers in a circumference of several miles round steeltrap lodge he has enclosed commons and woodlands abolished cottage gardens taken the village cricket ground into his own park out of pure regard to the sanctity of sunday shut up footpaths and alehouses all but those which belong to his electioneering friend mr quassia the brewer put down fairs and fiddlers committed many poachers shot a few convicted one third of the peasantry suspected the rest and passed nearly the whole of them through a wholesome course of prison discipline which has finished their education at the expense of the county captain fitzchromehe is somewhat out of his element here among such a diversity of opinions he will hear some he will not like lady clarindait was rather ill judged in mr crotchet to invite him to day but the art of assorting company is above these parvenus they invite a certain number of persons without considering how they harmonise with each other between sir simon and you is the reverend doctor folliott he is said to be an excellent scholar and is fonder of books than the majority of his cloth he is very fond also of the good things of this world he is of an admirable temper and says rude things in a pleasant half earnest manner that nobody can take offence with and next to him again is one captain fitzchrome who is very much in love with a certain person that does not mean to have anything to say to him because she can better her fortune by taking somebody else captain fitzchromeand next to him again is the beautiful the accomplished the witty the fascinating the tormenting lady clarinda who traduces herself to the said captain by assertions which it would drive him crazy to believe lady clarindatime will show sir and now we have gone the round of the table captain fitzchromebut i must say though i know you had always a turn for sketching characters you surprise me by your observation and especially by your attention to opinions lady clarindawell i will tell you a secret i am writing a novel captain fitzchromea novel lady clarindayes a novel and i shall get a little finery by it trinkets and fal lals which i cannot get from papa you must know i have been reading several fashionable novels the fashionable this and the fashionable that and i thought to myself why i can do better than any of these myself so i wrote a chapter or two and sent them as a specimen to mr puffall the book seller telling him they were to be a part of the fashionable something or other and he offered me i will not say how much to finish it in three volumes and let him pay all the newspapers for recommending it as the work of a lady of quality who had made very free with the characters of her acquaintance captain fitzchromesurely you have not done so lady clarindaoh no i leave that to mr eavesdrop but mr puffall made it a condition that i should let him say so captain fitzchromea strange recommendation lady clarindaoh nothing else will do and it seems you may give yourself any character you like and the newspapers will print it as if it came from themselves i have commended you to three of our friends here as an economist a transcendentalist and a classical scholar and if you wish to be renowned through the world for these or any other accomplishments the newspapers will confirm you in their possession for half a guinea a piece captain fitzchrometruly the praise of such gentry must be a feather in any ones cap lady clarindaso you will see some morning that my novel is the most popular production of the day this is mr puffalls favourite phrase he makes the newspapers say it of everything he publishes but the day you know is a very convenient phrase it allows of three hundred and sixty five most popular productions in a year and in leap year one more chapter vi theories but when they came to shape the model not one could fit the others noddlebutler meanwhile the last course and the dessert passed by when the ladies had withdrawn young crotchet addressed the company mr crotchet jun there is one point in which philosophers of all classes seem to be agreed that they only want money to regenerate the world mr mac quedyno doubt of it nothing is so easy as to lay down the outlines of perfect society there wants nothing but money to set it going i will explain myself clearly and fully by reading a paper producing a large scroll in the infancy of society the rev dr folliottpray mr mac quedy how is it that all gentlemen of your nation begin everything they write with the infancy of society mr mac quedyeh sir it is the simplest way to begin at the beginning in the infancy of society when government was invented to save a percentage say two and a half per cent the rev dr folliotti will not say any such thing mr mac quedywell say any percentage you please the rev dr folliotti will not say any percentage at all mr mac quedyon the principle of the division of labour the rev dr folliottgovernment was invented to spend a percentage mr mac quedyto save a percentage the rev dr folliottno sir to spend a percentage and a good deal more than two and a half percent two hundred and fifty per cent that is intelligible mr mac quedyin the infancy of society mr toogoodnever mind the infancy of society the question is of society in its maturity here is what it should be producing a paper i have laid it down in a diagram mr skionarbefore we proceed to the question of government we must nicely discriminate the boundaries of sense understanding and reason sense is a receptivity mr crotchet junwe are proceeding too fast money being all that is wanted to regenerate society i will put into the hands of this company a large sum for the purpose now let us see how to dispose of it mr mac quedywe will begin by taking a committee room in london where we will dine together once a week to deliberate the rev dr folliottif the money is to go in deliberative dinners you may set me down for a committee man and honorary caterer mr mac quedynext you must all learn political economy which i will teach you very compendiously in lectures over the bottle the rev dr folliotti hate lectures over the bottle but pray sir what is political economy mr mac quedypolitical economy is to the state what domestic economy is to the family the rev dr folliottno such thing sir in the family there is a paterfamilias who regulates the distribution and takes care that there shall be no such thing in the household as one dying of hunger while another dies of surfeit in the state it is all hunger at one end and all surfeit at the other matchless claret mr crotchet mr crotchetvintage of fifteen doctor mr mac quedythe family consumes and so does the state the rev dr folliottconsumes air yes but the mode the proportions there is the essential difference between the state and the family sir i hate false analogies mr mac quedywell sir the analogy is not essential distribution will come under its proper head the rev dr folliottcome where it will the distribution of the state is in no respect analogous to the distribution of the family the paterfamilias sir the paterfamilias mr mac quedywell sir let that pass the family consumes and in order to consume it must have supply the rev dr folliottwell sir adam and eve knew that when they delved and span mr mac quedyvery true sir reproducing his scroll in the infancy of society mr toogoodthe reverend gentleman has hit the nail on the head it is the distribution that must be looked to

their theatre their most sacred and intangible fund did not they give to melopoeia choregraphy and the sundry forms of didascalics the precedence of all other matters civil and military was it not their law that even the proposal to divert this fund to any other purpose should be punished with death but sir i further propose that the athenian theatre being resuscitated the admission shall be

the flask shall shine and well sit till day but well find the way to drench the world with wine the schemes for the worlds regeneration evaporated in a tumult of voices chapter vii the sleeping venus quoth he in all my life till now i neer saw so profane a showbutler the library of crotchet castle was a large and well furnished apartment opening on one side into an ante room on the other into a music room it had several tables stationed at convenient distances one consecrated to the novelties of literature another to the novelties of embellishment others unoccupied and at the disposal of the company the walls were covered with a copious collection of ancient and modern books the ancient having been selected and arranged by the reverend doctor folliott in the ante room were card tables in the music room were various instruments all popular operas and all fashionable music in this suite of apartments and not in the drawing room were the evenings of crotchet castle usually passed the young ladies were in the music room miss crotchet at the piano lady clarinda at the harp playing and occasionally singing at the suggestion of mr trillo portions of matilde di shabran lord bossnowl was turning over the leaves for miss crotchet the captain was performing the same office for lady clarinda but with so much more attention to the lady than the book that he often made sad work with the harmony by turnover of two leaves together on these occasions miss crotchet paused lady clarinda laughed mr trillo scolded lord bossnowl yawned the captain apologised and the performance proceeded in the library mr mac quedy was expounding political economy to the reverend doctor folliott who was pro more demolishing its doctrines seriatim mr chainmail was in hot dispute with mr skionar touching the physical and moral well being of man mr skionar was enforcing his friend mr shantsees views of moral discipline maintaining that the sole thing needful for man in this world was loyal and pious education the giving men good books to read and enough of the hornbook to read them with a judicious interspersion of the lessons of old restraint which was his poetic name for the parish stocks mr chainmail on the other hand stood up for the exclusive necessity of beef and ale lodging and raiment wife and children courage to fight for them all and armour wherewith to do so mr henbane had got his face scratched and his finger bitten by the cat in trying to catch her for a second experiment in killing and bringing to life and doctor morbific was comforting him with a disquisition to prove that there were only four animals having the power to communicate hydrophobia of which the cat was one and that it was not necessary that the animal should be in a rabid state the nature of the wound being everything and the idea of contagion a delusion mr henbane was listening very lugubriously to this dissertation mr philpot had seized on mr firedamp and pinned him down to a map of africa on which he was tracing imaginary courses of mighty inland rivers terminating in lakes and marshes where they were finally evaporated by the heat of the sun and mr firedamps hair was standing on end at the bare imagination of the mass of malaria that must be engendered by the operation mr toogood had begun explaining his diagrams to sir simon steeltrap but sir simon grew testy and told mr toogood that the promulgators of such doctrines ought to be consigned to the treadmill the philanthropist walked off from the country gentleman and proceeded to hold forth to young crotchet who stood silent as one who listens but in reality without hearing a syllable mr crotchet senior as the master of the house was left to entertain himself with his own meditations till the reverend doctor folliott tore himself from mr mac quedy and proceeded to expostulate with mr crotchet on a delicate topic there was an italian painter who obtained the name of il bragatore by the superinduction of inexpressibles on the naked apollos and bacchuses of his betters the fame of this worthy remained one and indivisible till a set of heads which had been by a too common mistake of natures journeymen stuck upon magisterial shoulders as the corinthian capitals of fair round bellies with fat capon lined but which nature herself had intended for the noddles of porcelain mandarins promulgated simultaneously from the east and the west of london an order that no plaster of paris venus should appear in the streets without petticoats mr crotchet on reading this order in the evening paper which by the postmans early arrival was always laid on his breakfast table determined to fill his house with venuses of all sizes and kinds in pursuance of this resolution came packages by water carriage containing an infinite variety of venuses there were the medicean venus and the bathing venus the uranian venus and the pandemian venus the crouching venus and the sleeping venus the venus rising from the sea the venus with the apple of paris and the venus with the armour of mars the reverend doctor folliott had been very much astonished at this unexpected display disposed as he was to hold that whatever had been in greece was right he was more than doubtful of the propriety of throwing open the classical adytum to the illiterate profane whether in his interior mind he was at all influenced either by the consideration that it would be for the credit of his cloth with some of his vice suppressing neighbours to be able to say that he had expostulated or by curiosity to try what sort of defence his city bred friend who knew the classics only by translations and whose reason was always a little ahead of his knowledge would make for his somewhat ostentatious display of liberality in matters of taste is a question on which the learned may differ but after having duly deliberated on two full sized casts of the uranian and pandemian venus in niches on each side of the chimney and on three alabaster figures in glass cases on the mantelpiece he proceeded peirastically to open his fire the rev dr folliottthese little alabaster figures on the mantelpiece mr crotchet and those large figures in the nichesmay i take the liberty to ask you what they are intended to represent mr crotchetvenus sir nothing more sir just venus the rev dr folliottmay i ask you sir why they are there mr crotchetto be looked at sir just to be looked at the reasons for most things in a gentlemans house being in it at all from the paper on the walls and the drapery of the curtains even to the books in the library of which the most essential part is the appearance of the back the rev dr folliottvery true sir as great philosophers hold that the esse of things is percipi so a gentlemans furniture exists to be looked at nevertheless sir there are some things more fit to be looked at than others for instance there is nothing more fit to be looked at than the outside of a book it is as i may say from repeated experience a pure and unmixed pleasure to have a goodly volume lying before you and to know that you may open it if you please and need not open it unless you please it is a resource against ennui if ennui should come upon you to have the resource and not to feel the ennui to enjoy your bottle in the present and your book in the indefinite future is a delightful condition of human existence there is no place in which a man can move or sit in which the outside of a book can be otherwise than an innocent and becoming spectacle touching this matter there cannot i think be two opinions but with respect to your venuses there can be and indeed there are two very distinct opinions now sir that little figure in the centre of the mantelpieceas a grave paterfamilias mr crotchet with a fair nubile daughter whose eyes are like the fish pools of heshboni would ask you if you hold that figure to be altogether delicate mr crotchetthe sleeping venus sir nothing can be more delicate than the entire contour of the figure the flow of the hair on the shoulders and neck the form of the feet and fingers it is altogether a most delicate morsel the rev dr folliottwhy in that sense perhaps it is as delicate as whitebait in july but the attitude sir the attitude mr crotchetnothing can be more natural sir the rev dr folliottthat is the very thing sir it is too natural too natural sir it lies for all the world like i make no doubt the pious cheesemonger who recently broke its plaster facsimile over the head of the itinerant vendor was struck by a certain similitude to the position of his own sleeping beauty and felt his noble wrath thereby justly aroused mr crotchetvery likely sir in my opinion the cheesemonger was a fool and the justice who sided with him was a greater the rev dr folliottfool sir is a harsh term call not thy brother a fool mr crotchetsir neither the cheesemonger nor the justice is a brother of mine the rev dr folliottsir we are all brethren mr crotchetyes sir as the hangman is of the thief the squire of the poacher the judge of the libeller the lawyer of his client the statesman of his colleague the bubble blower of the bubble buyer the slave driver of the negro as these are brethren so am i and the worthies in question the rev dr folliottto be sure sir in these instances and in many others the term brother must be taken in its utmost latitude of interpretation we are all brothers nevertheless but to return to the point now these two large figures one with drapery on the lower half of the body and the other with no drapery at all upon my word sir it matters not what godfathers and godmothers may have promised and vowed for the children of this world touching the devil and other things to be renounced if such figures as those are to be put before their eyes mr crotchetsir the naked figure is the pandemian venus and the half draped figure is the uranian venus and i say sir that figure realises the finest imaginings of plato and is the personification of the most refined and exalted feeling of which the human mind is susceptible the love of pure ideal intellectual beauty the rev dr folliotti am aware sir that plato in his symposium discourseth very eloquently touching the uranian and pandemian venus but you must remember that in our universities plato is held to be little better than a misleader of youth and they have shown their contempt for him not only by never reading him a mode of contempt in which they deal very largely but even by never printing a complete edition of him although they have printed many ancient books which nobody suspects to have been ever read on the spot except by a person attached to the press who is therefore emphatically called the reader mr crotchetwell sir the rev dr folliottwhy sir to the reader aforesaid supposing either of our universities to have printed an edition of plato or to any one else who can be supposed to have read plato or indeed to be ever likely to do so i would very willingly show these figures because to such they would i grant you be the outward and visible signs of poetical and philosophical ideas but to the multitude the gross carnal multitude they are but two beautiful women one half undressed and the other quite so mr crotchetthen sir let the multitude look upon them and learn modesty the rev dr folliotti must say that if i wished my footman to learn modesty i should not dream of sending him to school to a naked venus mr crotchetsir ancient sculpture is the true school of modesty but where the greeks had modesty we have cant where they had poetry we have cant where they had patriotism we have cant where they had anything that exalts delights or adorns humanity we have nothing but cant cant cant and sir to show my contempt for cant in all its shapes i have adorned my house with the greek venus in all her shapes and am ready to fight her battle against all the societies that ever were instituted for the suppression of truth and beauty the rev dr folliottmy dear sir i am afraid you are growing warm pray be cool nothing contributes so much to good digestion as to be perfectly cool after dinner mr crotchetsir the lacedmonian virgins wrestled naked with young men and they grew up as the wise lycurgus had foreseen into the most modest of women and the most exemplary of wives and mothers the rev dr folliottvery likely sir but the athenian virgins did no such thing and they grew up into wives who stayed at homestayed at home sir and looked after their husbands dinnerhis dinner sir you will please to observe mr crotchetand what was the consequence of that sir that they were such very insipid persons that the husband would not go home to eat his dinner but preferred the company of some aspasia or lais the rev dr folliotttwo very different persons sir give me leave to remark mr crotchetvery likely sir but both too good to be married in athens the rev dr folliottsir lais was a corinthian mr crotchetods vengeance sir some aspasia and any other athenian name of the same sort of person you like the rev dr folliotti do not like the sort of person at all the sort of person i like as i have already implied is a modest woman who stays at home and looks after her husbands dinner mr crotchetwell sir that was not the taste of the athenians they preferred the society of women who would not have made any scruple about sitting as models to praxiteles as you know sir very modest women in italy did to canova one of whom an italian countess being asked by an english lady how she could bear it answered very well there was a good fire in the room the rev dr folliottsir the english lady should have asked how the italian ladys husband could bear it the phials of my wrath would overflow if poor dear mrs folliott sir in return for your story i will tell you a story of my ancestor gilbert folliott the devil haunted him as he did saint francis in the likeness of a beautiful damsel but all he could get from the exemplary gilbert was an admonition to wear a stomacher and longer petticoats mr crotchetsir your story makes for my side of the question it proves that the devil in the likeness of a fair damsel with short petticoats and no stomacher was almost too much for gilbert folliott the force of the spell was in the drapery the rev dr folliottbless my soul sir mr crotchetgive me leave sir diderot the rev dr folliottwho was he sir mr crotchetwho was he sir the sublime philosopher the father of the encyclopdia of all the encyclopdias that have ever been printed the rev dr folliottbless me sir a terrible progeny they belong to the tribe of incubi mr crotchetthe great philosopher diderot the rev dr folliottsir diderot is not a man after my heart keep to the greeks if you please albeit this sleeping venus is not an antique mr crotchetwell sir the greeks why do we call the elgin marbles inestimable simply because they are true to nature and why are they so superior in that point to all modern works with all our greater knowledge of anatomy why sir but because the greeks having no cant had better opportunities of studying models the rev dr folliottsir i deny our greater knowledge of anatomy but i shall take the liberty to employ on this occasion the argumentum ad hominem would you have allowed miss crotchet to sit for a model to canova mr crotchetyes sir god bless my soul sir exclaimed the reverend doctor folliott throwing himself back into a chair and flinging up his heels with the premeditated design of giving emphasis to his exclamation but by miscalculating his impetus he overbalanced his chair and laid himself on the carpet in a right angle of which his back was the base chapter viii science and charity chi sta nel mondo un par dore contento n gli vien tolta ovver contaminata quella sua pace in veruno momento puo dir che giove drittamente il guata forteguerri the reverend doctor folliott took his departure about ten oclock to walk home to his vicarage there was no moon but the night was bright and clear and afforded him as much light as he needed he paused a moment by the roman camp to listen to the nightingale repeated to himself a passage of sophocles proceeded through the park gate and entered the narrow lane that led to the village he walked on in a very pleasant mood of the state called reverie in which fish and wine greek and political economy the sleeping venus he had left behind and poor dear mrs folliott to whose fond arms he was returning passed as in a camera obscura over the tablets of his imagination presently the image of mr eavesdrop with a printed sketch of the reverend doctor f presented itself before him and he began mechanically to flourish his bamboo the movement was prompted by his good genius for the uplifted bamboo received the blow of a ponderous cudgel which was intended for his head the reverend gentleman recoiled two or three paces and saw before him a couple of ruffians who were preparing to renew the attack but whom with two swings of his bamboo he laid with cracked sconces on the earth where he proceeded to deal with them like corn beneath the flail of the thresher one of them drew a pistol which went off in the very act of being struck aside by the bamboo and lodged a bullet in the brain of the other there was then only one enemy who vainly struggled to rise every effort being attended with a new and more signal prostration the fellow roared for mercy mercy rascal cried the divine what mercy were you going to show me villain what i warrant me you thought it would be an easy matter and no sin to rob and murder a parson on his way home from dinner you said to yourself doubtless well waylay the fat parson you irreverent knave as he waddles home you disparaging ruffian half seas over you calumnious vagabond and with every dyslogistic term which he supposed had been applied to himself he inflicted a new bruise on his rolling and roaring antagonist ah rogue he proceeded you can roar now marauder you were silent enough when you devoted my brains to dispersion under your cudgel but seeing that i cannot bind you and that i intend you not to escape and that it would be dangerous to let you rise i will disable you in all your members i will contund you as thestylis did strong smelling herbs in the quality whereof you do most gravely partake as my nose beareth testimony ill weed that you are i will beat you to a jelly and i will then roll you into the ditch to lie till the constable comes for you thief hold hold reverend sir exclaimed the penitent culprit i am disabled already in every finger and in every joint i will roll myself into the ditch reverend sir stir not rascal returned the divine stir not so much as the quietest leaf above you or my bamboo rebounds on your body like hail in a thunder storm confess speedily villain are you a simple thief or would you have manufactured me into a subject for the benefit of science ay miscreant caitiff you would have made me a subject for science would you you are a school master abroad are you you are marching with a detachment of the march of mind are you you are a member of the steam intellect society are you you swear by the learned friend do you oh no reverend sir answered the criminal i am innocent of all these offences whatever they are reverend sir the only friend i had in the world is lying dead beside me reverend sir the reverend gentleman paused a moment and leaned on his bamboo the culprit bruised as he was sprang on his legs and went off in double quick time the doctor gave him chase and had nearly brought him within arms length when the fellow turned at right angles and sprang clean over a deep dry ditch the divine following with equal ardour and less dexterity went down over head and ears into a thicket of nettles emerging with much discomposure he proceeded to the village and roused the constable but the constable found on reaching the scene of action that the dead man was gone as well as his living accomplice oh the monster exclaimed the reverend doctor folliott he has made a subject for science of the only friend he had in the world ay my dear he resumed the next morning at breakfast if my old reading and my early gymnastics for as the great hermann says before i was demulced by the muses i was ferocis ingenii puer et ad arma quam ad literas paratior had not imbued me indelibly with some of the holy rage of frre jean des entommeures i should be at this moment lying on the table of some flinty hearted anatomist who would have sliced and disjointed me as unscrupulously as i do these remnants of the capon and chine wherewith you consoled yourself yesterday for my absence at dinner phew i have a noble thirst upon me which i will quench with floods of tea the reverend gentleman was interrupted by a messenger who informed him that the charity commissioners requested his presence at the inn where they were holding a sitting the charity commissioners exclaimed the reverend gentleman who on earth are they the messenger could not inform him and the reverend gentleman took his hat and stick and proceeded to the inn on entering the best parlour he saw three well dressed and bulky gentlemen sitting at a table and a fourth officiating as clerk with an open book before him and a pen in his hand the church wardens who had been also summoned were already in attendance the chief commissioner politely requested the reverend doctor folliott to be seated and after the usual meteorological preliminaries had been settled by a resolution nem con that it was a fine day but very hot the chief commissioner stated that in virtue of the commission of parliament which they had the honour to hold they were now to inquire into the state of the public charities of this village the rev dr folliottthe state of the public charities sir is exceedingly simple there are none the charities here are all private and so private that i for one know nothing of them first commissionerwe have been informed sir that there is an annual rent charged on the land of hautbois for the endowment and repair of an almshouse the rev dr folliotthautbois hautbois first commissionerthe manorial farm of hautbois now occupied by farmer seedling is charged with the endowment and maintenance of an almshouse the rev dr folliott to the churchwarden how is this mr bluenose first churchwardeni really do not know sir what say you mr appletwig mr appletwig parish clerk and schoolmaster an old man i do remember gentlemen to have been informed that there did stand at the end of the village a ruined cottage which had once been an almshouse which was endowed and maintained by an annual revenue of a mark and a half or one pound sterling charged some centuries ago on the farm of hautbois but the means by the progress of time having become inadequate to the end the almshouse tumbled to pieces first commissionerbut this is a right which cannot be abrogated by desuetude and the sum of one pound per annum is still chargeable for charitable purposes on the manorial farm of hautbois the rev dr folliottvery well sir mr appletwigbut sir the one pound per annum is still received by the parish but was long ago by an unanimous vote in open vestry given to the minister the three commissioners un voce the minister first commissionerthis is an unjustifiable proceeding second commissionera misappropriation of a public fund third commissionera flagrant perversion of a charitable donation the rev dr folliottgod bless my soul gentlemen i know nothing of this matter how

morning the rev dr folliotta very good morning to you gentlemen what in the name of all that is wonderful mr bluenose said the reverend doctor folliott as he walked out of the inn what in the name of all that is wonderful can those fellows mean they have come here in a chaise and four to make a fuss about a pound per annum which after all they leave as it was i wonder who pays them for their trouble and how much mr appletwigthe public pay for it sir it is a job of the learned friend whom you admire so much it makes away with public money in salaries and private money in lawsuits and does no particle of good to any living soul the rev dr folliottay ay mr appletwig that is just the sort of public service to be looked for from the learned friend oh the learned friend the learned friend he is the evil genius of everything that falls in his way the reverend doctor walked off to crotchet castle to narrate his misadventures and exhale his budget of grievances on mr mac quedy whom he considered a ringleader of the march of mind chapter ix the voyage mounting the bark they cleft the watery wayshomer four beautiful cabined pinnaces one for the ladies one for the gentlemen one for kitchen and servants one for a dining room and band of music weighed anchor on a fine july morning from below crotchet castle and were towed merrily by strong trotting horses against the stream of the thames they passed from the district of chalk successively into the districts of clay of sand rock of oolite and so forth sometimes they dined in their floating dining room sometimes in tents which they pitched on the dry smooth shaven green of a newly mown meadow sometimes they left their vessels to see sights in the vicinity sometimes they passed a day or two in a comfortable inn at oxford they walked about to see the curiosities of architecture painted windows and undisturbed libraries the reverend doctor folliott laid a wager with mr crotchet that in all their perlustrations they would not find a man reading and won it ay said the reverend gentleman this is still a seat of learning on the principle ofonce a captain always a captain we may well ask in these great reservoirs of books whereof no man ever draws a sluice quorsum pertinuit stipere platona menandro what is done here for the classics reprinting german editions on better paper a great boast verily what for mathematics what for metaphysics what for history what for anything worth knowing this was a seat of learning in the days of friar bacon but the friar is gone and his learning with him nothing of him is left but the immortal nose which when his brazen head had tumbled to pieces crying times past was the only palpable fragment among its minutely pulverised atoms and which is still resplendent over the portals of its cognominal college that nose sir is the only thing to which i shall take off my hat in all this babylon of buried literature mr crotchetbut doctor it is something to have a great reservoir of learning at which some may draw if they please the rev dr folliottbut here good care is taken that nobody shall please if even a small drop from the sacred fountain as callimachus has it were carried off by any one it would be evidence of something to hope for but the system of dissuasion from all good learning is brought here to a pitch of perfection that baffles the keenest aspirant i run over to myself the names of the scholars of germany a glorious catalogue but ask for those of oxfordwhere are they the echoes of their courts as vacant as their heads will answer where are they the tree shall be known by its fruit and seeing that this great tree with all its specious seeming brings forth no fruit i do denounce it as a barren fig mr mac quedyi shall set you right on this point we do nothing without motives if learning get nothing but honour and very little of that and if the good things of this world which ought to be the rewards of learning become the mere gifts of self interested patronage you must not wonder if in the finishing of education the science which takes precedence of all others should be the science of currying favour the rev dr folliottvery true sir education is well finished for all worldly purposes when the head is brought into the state whereinto i am accustomed to bring a marrow bone when it has been set before me on a toast with a white napkin wrapped round it nothing trundles along the high road of preferment so trimly as a well biassed sconce picked clean within and polished without totus teres atque rotundus the perfection of the finishing lies in the bias which keeps it trundling in the given direction there is good and sufficient reason for the fig being barren but it is not therefore the less a barren fig at godstow they gathered hazel on the grave of rosamond and proceeding on their voyage fell into a discussion on legendary histories lady clarindahistory is but a tiresome thing in itself it becomes more agreeable the more romance is mixed up with it the great enchanter has made me learn many things which i should never have dreamed of studying if they had not come to me in the form of amusement the rev dr

garden he who for more than a quarter of a century has produced two pantomimes a year to the delight of children of all ages including myself at all ages that is the enchanter for me i am for the pantomimes all the northern enchanters romances put together would not furnish materials for half the southern enchanters pantomimes lady clarindasurely you do not class literature with pantomime the rev dr folliottin these cases i do they are both one with a slight difference the one is the literature of pantomime the other is the pantomime of literature there is the same variety of character the same diversity of story the same copiousness of incident the same research into costume the same display of heraldry falconry minstrelsy scenery monkery witchery devilry robbery poachery piracy fishery gipsy astrology demonology architecture fortification castrametation navigation the same running base of love and battle the main difference is that the one set of amusing fictions is told in music and action the other in all the worst dialects of the english language as to any sentence worth remembering any moral or political truth anything having a tendency however remote to make men wiser or better to make them think to make them ever think of thinking they are both precisely alike nuspiam nequaquam nullibi nullimodis lady clarindavery amusing however the rev dr folliottvery amusing very amusing mr chainmailmy quarrel with the northern enchanter is that he has grossly misrepresented the twelfth century the rev dr folliotthe has misrepresented everything or he would not have been very amusing sober truth is but dull matter to the reading rabble the angler who puts not on his hook the bait that best pleases the fish may sit all day on the bank without catching a gudgeon mr mac quedybut how do you mean that he has misrepresented the twelfth century by exhibiting some of its knights and ladies in the colours of refinement and virtue seeing that they were all no better than ruffians and something else that shall be nameless mr chainmailby no means by depicting them as much worse than they were not as you suppose much better no one would infer from his pictures that theirs was a much better state of society than this which we live in mr mac quedyno nor was it it was a period of brutality ignorance fanaticism and tyranny when the land was covered with castles and every castle contained a gang of banditti headed by a titled robber who levied contributions with fire and sword plundering torturing ravishing burying his captives in loathsome dungeons and broiling them on gridirons to force from them the surrender of every particle of treasure which he suspected them of possessing and fighting every now and then with the neighbouring lords his conterminal bandits for the right of marauding on the boundaries this was the twelfth century as depicted by all contemporary historians and poets mr chainmailno sir weigh the evidence of specific facts you will find more good than evil who was englands greatest herothe mirror of chivalry the pattern of honour the fountain of generosity the model to all succeeding ages of military glory richard the first there is a king of the twelfth century what was the first step of liberty magna charta that was the best thing ever done by lords there are lords of the twelfth century you must remember too that these lords were petty princes and made war on each other as legitimately as the heads of larger communities did or do for their system of revenue it was to be sure more rough and summary than that which has succeeded it but it was certainly less searching and less productive and as to the people i content myself with these great points that every man was armed every man was a good archer every man could and would fight effectively with sword or pike or even with oaken cudgel no man would live quietly without beef and ale if he had them not he fought till he either got them or was put out of condition to want them they were not and could not be subjected to that powerful pressure of all the other classes of society combined by gunpowder steam and fiscality which has brought them to that dismal degradation in which we see them now and there are the people of the twelfth century mr mac quedyas to your king the enchanter has done him ample justice even in your own view as to your lords and their ladies he has drawn them too favourably given them too many of the false colours of chivalry thrown too attractive a light on their abominable doings as to the people he keeps them so much in the background that he can hardly be said to have represented them at all much less misrepresented them which indeed he could scarcely do seeing that by your own showing they were all thieves ready to knock down any man for what they could not come by honestly mr chainmailno sir they could come honestly by beef and ale while they were left to their simple industry when oppression interfered with them in that then they stood on the defensive and fought for what they were not permitted to come by quietly mr mac quedyif a being aggrieved by b knocks down c do you call that standing on the defensive mr chainmailthat depends on who or what c is the rev dr folliottgentlemen you will never settle this controversy till you have first settled what is good for man in this world the great question de finibus which has puzzled all philosophers if the enchanter has represented the twelfth century too brightly for one and too darkly for the other of you i should say as an impartial man he has represented it fairly my quarrel with him is that his works contain nothing worth quoting and a book that furnishes no quotations is me judice no bookit is a plaything there is no question about the amusementamusement of multitudes but if he who amuses us most is to be our enchanter then my enchanter is the enchanter of covent garden chapter x the voyage continued continuant nostre routte navigasmes par trois jours sans rien descouvrirrabelais there is a beautiful structure said mr chainmail as they glided by lechlade church a subject for the pencil captain it is a question worth asking mr mac quedy whether the religious spirit which reared these edifices and connected with them everywhere an asylum for misfortune and a provision for poverty was not better than the commercial spirit which has turned all the business of modern life into schemes of profit and processes of fraud and extortion i do not see in all your boasted improvements any compensation for the religious charity of the twelfth century i do not see any compensation for that kindly feeling which within their own little communities bound the several classes of society together while full scope was left for the development of natural character wherein individuals differed as conspicuously as in costume now we all wear one conventional dress one conventional face we have no bond of union but pecuniary interest we talk anything that comes uppermost for talkings sake and without expecting to be believed we have no nature no simplicity no picturesqueness everything about us is as artificial and as complicated as our steam machinery our poetry is a kaleidoscope of false imagery expressing no real feeling portraying no real existence i do not see any compensation for the poetry of the twelfth century mr mac quedyi wonder to hear you mr chainmail talking of the religious charity of a set of lazy monks and beggarly friars who were much more occupied with taking than giving of whom those who were in earnest did nothing but make themselves and everybody about them miserable with fastings and penances and other such trash and those who were not did nothing but guzzle and royster and having no wives of their own took very unbecoming liberties with those of honester men and as to your poetry of the twelfth century it is not good for much mr chainmailit has at any rate what ours wants truth to nature and simplicity of diction the poetry which was addressed to the people of the dark ages pleased in proportion to the truth with which it depicted familiar images and to their natural connection with the time and place to which they were assigned in the poetry of our enlightened times the characteristics of all seasons soils and climates may be blended together with much benefit to the authors fame as an original genius the cowslip of a civic poet is always in blossom his fern is always in full feather he gathers the celandine the primrose the heath flower the jasmine and the chrysanthemum all on the same day and from the same spot his nightingale sings all the year round his moon is always full his cygnet is as white as his swan his cedar is as tremulous as his aspen and his poplar as embowering as his beech thus all nature marches with the march of mind but among barbarians instead of mead and wine and the best seat by the fire the reward of such a genius would have been to be summarily turned out of doors in the snow to meditate on the difference between day and night and between december and july it is an age of liberality indeed when not to know an oak from a burdock is no disqualification for sylvan minstrelsy i am for truth and simplicity the rev dr folliottlet him who loves them read greek greek greek greek mr mac quedyif he can sir the rev dr folliottvery true sir if he can here is the captain who can but i think he must have finished his education at some very rigid college where a quotation or any other overt act showing acquaintance with classical literature was visited with a severe penalty for my part i make it my boast that i was not to be so subdued i could not be abated of a single quotation by all the bumpers in which i was fined in this manner they glided over the face of the waters discussing everything and settling nothing mr mac quedy and the reverend doctor folliott had many digladiations on political economy wherein each in his own view doctor folliott demolished mr mac quedys science and mr mac quedy demolished dr folliotts objections we would print these dialogues if we thought anyone would read them but the world is not yet ripe for this haute sagesse pantagrueline we must therefore content ourselves with an chantillon of one of the reverend doctors perorations you have given the name of a science to what is yet an imperfect inquiry and the upshot of your so called science is this that you increase the wealth of a nation by increasing in it the quantity of things which are produced by labour no matter what they are no matter how produced no matter how distributed the greater the quantity of labour that has gone to the production of the quantity of things in a community the richer is the community that is your doctrine now i say if this be so riches are not the object for a community to aim at i say the nation is best off in relation to other nations which has the greatest quantity of the common necessaries of life distributed among the greatest number of persons which has the greatest number of honest hearts and stout arms united in a common interest willing to offend no one but ready to fight in defence of their own community against all the rest of the world because they have something in it worth fighting for the moment you admit that one class of things without any reference to what they respectively cost is better worth having than another that a smaller commercial value with one mode of distribution is better than a greater commercial value with another mode of distribution the whole of that curious fabric of postulates and dogmas which you call the science of political economy and which i call politic conomi inscientia tumbles to pieces mr toogood agreed with mr chainmail against mr mac quedy that the existing state of society was worse than that of the twelfth century but he agreed with mr mac quedy against mr chainmail that it was in progress to something much better than eitherto which something much better mr toogood and mr mac quedy attached two very different meanings mr chainmail fought with doctor folliott the battle of the romantic against the classical in poetry and mr skionar contended with mr mac quedy for intuition and synthesis against analysis and induction in philosophy mr philpot would lie along for hours listening to the gurgling of the water round the prow and would occasionally edify the company with speculations on the great changes that would be effected in the world by the steam navigation of rivers sketching the course of a steamboat up and down some mighty stream which civilisation had either never visited or long since deserted the missouri and the columbia the oroonoko and the amazon the nile and the niger the euphrates and the tigris the oxus and the indus the ganges and the hoangho under the over canopying forests of the new or by the long silent ruins of the ancient world through the shapeless mounds of babylon or the gigantic temples of thebes mr trillo went on with the composition of his opera and took the opinions of the young ladies on every step in its progress occasionally regaling the company with specimens and wondering at the blindness of mr mac quedy who could not or would not see that an opera in perfection being the union of all the beautiful artsmusic painting dancing poetryexhibiting female beauty in its most attractive aspects and in its most becoming costumewas according to the well known precept ingenuas didicisse etc the most efficient instrument of civilisation and ought to take precedence of all other pursuits in the minds of true philanthropists the reverend doctor folliott on these occasions never failed to say a word or two on mr trillos side derived from the practice of the athenians and from the combination in their theatre of all the beautiful arts in a degree of perfection unknown to the modern world leaving lechlade they entered the canal that connects the thames with the severn ascended by many locks passed by a tunnel three miles long through the bowels of sapperton hill agreed unanimously that the greatest pleasure derivable from visiting a cavern of any sort was that of getting out of it descended by many locks again through the valley of stroud into the severn continued their navigation into the ellesmere canal moored their pinnaces in the vale of llangollen by the aqueduct of pontycysyllty and determined to pass some days in inspecting the scenery before commencing their homeward voyage the captain omitted no opportunity of pressing his suit on lady clarinda but could never draw from her any reply but the same doctrines of worldly wisdom delivered in a tone of badinage mixed with a certain kindness of manner that induced him to hope she was not in earnest but the morning after they had anchored under the hills of the deewhether the lady had reflected more seriously than usual or was somewhat less in good humour than usual or the captain was more pressing than usualshe said to him it must not be captain fitzchrome the course of true love never did run smooth my father must keep his borough and i must have a town house and a country house and an opera box and a carriage it is not well for either of us that we should flirt any longer i must be cruel only to be kind be satisfied with the assurance that you alone of all men have ever broken my rest to be sure it was only for about three nights in all but that is too much the captain had le cur navr he took his portfolio under his arm made up the little valise of a pedestrian and without saying a word to anyone wandered off at random among the mountains after the lapse of a day or two the captain was missed and everyone marvelled what was become of him mr philpot thought he must have been exploring a river and fallen in and got drowned in the process mr firedamp had no doubt he had been crossing a mountain bog and had been suddenly deprived of life by the exhalations of marsh miasmata mr henbane deemed it probable that he had been tempted in some wood by the large black brilliant berries of the atropa belladonna or deadly nightshade and lamented that he had not been by to administer an infallible antidote mr eavesdrop hoped the particulars of his fate would be ascertained and asked if anyone present could help him to any authentic anecdotes of their departed friend the reverend doctor folliott proposed that an inquiry should be instituted as to whether the march of intellect had reached that neighbourhood as if so the captain had probably been made a subject for science mr mac quedy said it was no such great matter to ascertain the precise mode in which the surplus population was diminished by one mr toogood asseverated that there was no such thing as surplus population and that the land properly managed would maintain twenty times its present inhabitants and hereupon they fell into a disputation lady clarinda did not doubt that the captain had gone away designedly she missed him more than she could have anticipated and wished she had at least postponed her last piece of cruelty till the completion of their homeward voyage chapter xi correspondence base is the slave that paysancient pistol the captain was neither drowned nor poisoned neither miasmatised nor anatomised but before we proceed to account for him we must look back to a young lady of whom some little notice was taken in the first chapter and who though she has since been out of sight has never with us been out of mind miss susannah touchandgo the forsaken of the junior crotchet whom we left an inmate of a solitary farm in one of the deep valleys under the cloud capt summits of meirion comforting her wounded spirit with air and exercise rustic cheer music painting and poetry and the prattle of the little ap llymrys one evening after an interval of anxious expectation the farmer returning from market brought for her two letters of which the contents were these dotandcarryonetown state of apodidraskiana april my dear child i am anxious to learn what are your present position intention and prospects the fairies who dropped gold in your shoe on the morning when i ceased to be a respectable man in london will soon find a talismanic channel for transmitting you a stocking full of dollars which will fit the shoe as well as the foot of cinderella fitted her slipper i am happy to say i am again become a respectable man it was always my ambition to be a respectable man and i am a very respectable man here in this new township of a new state where i have purchased five thousand acres of land at two dollars an acre hard cash and established a very flourishing bank the notes of touchandgo and company soft cash are now the exclusive currency of all this vicinity this is the land in which all men flourish but there are three classes of men who flourish especiallymethodist preachers slave drivers and paper money manufacturers and as one of the latter i have just painted the word bank on a fine slab of maple which was green and growing when i arrived and have discounted for the settlers in my own currency sundry bills which are to be paid when the proceeds of the crop they have just sown shall return from new orleans so that my notes are the representatives of vegetation that is to be and i am accordingly a capitalist of the first magnitude the people here know very well that i ran away from london but the most of them have run away from some place or other and they have a great respect for me because they think i ran away with something worth taking which few of them had the luck or the wit to do this gives them confidence in my resources at the same time that as there is nothing portable in the settlement except my own notes they have no fear that i shall run away with them they know i am thoroughly conversant with the principles of banking and as they have plenty of industry no lack of sharpness and abundance of land they wanted nothing but capital to organise a flourishing settlement and this capital i have manufactured to the extent required at the expense of a small importation of pens ink and paper and two or three inimitable copper plates i have abundance here of all good things a good conscience included for i really cannot see that i have done any wrong this was my position i owed half a million of money and i had a trifle in my pocket it was clear that this trifle could never find its way to the right owner the question was whether i should keep it and live like a gentleman or hand it over to lawyers and commissioners of bankruptcy and die like a dog on a dunghill if i could have thought that the said lawyers etc had a better title to it than myself i might have hesitated but as such title was not apparent to my satisfaction i decided the question in my own favour the right owners as i have already said being out of the question altogether i have always taken scientific views of morals and politics a habit from which i derive much comfort under existing circumstances i hope you adhere to your music though i cannot hope again to accompany your harp with my flute my last andante movement was too forte for those whom it took by surprise let not your allegro vivace be damped by young crotchets desertion which though i have not heard it i take for granted he is like myself a scientific politician and has an eye as keen as a needle to his own interest he has had good luck so far and is gorgeous in the spoils of many gulls but i think the polar basin and walrus company will be too much for him yet there has been a splendid outlay on credit and he is the only man of the original parties concerned of whom his majestys sheriffs could give any account i will not ask you to come here there is no husband for you the men smoke drink and fight and break more of their own heads than of girls hearts those among them who are musical sing nothing but psalms they are excellent fellows in their way but you would not like them au reste here are no rents no taxes no poor rates no tithes no church establishment no routs no clubs no rotten boroughs no operas no concerts no theatres no beggars no thieves no king no lords no ladies and only one gentleman videlicet your loving father timothy touchandgo psi send you one of my notes i can afford to part with it if you are accused of receiving money from me you may pay it over to my assignees robthetill continues to be my factotum i say no more of him in this place he will give you an account of himself dotandcarryonetown etc dear miss mr touchandgo will have told you of our arrival here of our setting up a bank and so forth we came here in a tilted waggon which served us for parlour kitchen and all we soon got up a log house and unluckily we as soon got it down again for the first fire we made in it burned down house and all however our second experiment was more fortunate and we are pretty well lodged in a house of three rooms on a floor i should say the floor for there is but one this new state is free to hold slaves all the new states have not this privilege mr touchandgo has bought some and they are building him a villa mr touchandgo is in a thriving way but he is not happy here he longs for parties and concerts and a seat in congress he thinks it very hard that he cannot buy one with his own coinage as he used to do in england besides he is afraid of the regulators who if they do not like a mans character wait upon him and flog him doubling the dose at stated intervals till he takes himself off he does not like this system of administering justice though i think he has nothing to fear from it he has the character of having money which is the best of all characters here as at home he lets his old english prejudices influence his opinions of his new neighbours but i assure you they have many virtues though they do keep slaves they are all ready to fight for their own liberty and i should not like to be an enemy within reach of one of their rifles when i say enemy i include bailiff in the term one was shot not long ago there was a trial the jury gave two dollars damages the judge said they must find guilty or not guilty but the counsel for the defendant they would not call him prisoner offered to fight the judge upon the point and as this was said literally not metaphorically and the counsel was a stout fellow the judge gave in the two dollars damages were not paid after all for the defendant challenged the foreman to box for double or quits and the foreman was beaten the folks in new york made a great outcry about it but here it was considered all as it should be so you see miss justice liberty and everything else of that kind are different in different places just as suits the convenience of those who have the sword in their own hands hoping to hear of your health and happiness i remain dear miss your dutiful servant roderick robthetill miss touchandgo replied as follows to the first of these letters my dear father i am sure you have the best of hearts and i have no doubt you have acted with the best intentions my lover or i should rather say my fortunes lover has indeed forsaken me i cannot say i did not feel it indeed i cried very much and the altered looks of people who used to be so delighted to see me really annoyed me so that i determined to change the scene altogether i have come into wales and am boarding with a farmer and his wife their stock of english is very small but i managed to agree with them and they have four of the sweetest children i ever saw to whom i teach all i know and i manage to pick up some welsh i have puzzled out a little song which i think very pretty i have translated it into english and i send it you with the original air you shall play it on your flute at eight oclock every saturday evening and i will play and sing it at the same time and i will fancy that i hear my dear papa accompanying me the people in london said very unkind things of you they hurt me very much at the time but now i am out of their way i do not seem to think their opinion of much consequence i am sure when i recollect at leisure everything i have seen and heard among them i cannot make out what they do that is so virtuous as to set them up for judges of morals and i am sure they never speak the truth about anything and there is no sincerity in either their love or their friendship an old welsh bard here who wears a waistcoat embroidered with leeks and is called the green bard of cadeir idris says the scotch would be the best people in the world if there was nobody but themselves to give them a character and so i think would the londoners i hate the very thought of them for i do believe they would have broken my heart if i had not got out of their way now i shall write you another letter very soon and describe to you the country and the people and the children and how i amuse myself and everything that i think you will like to hear about and when i seal this letter i shall drop a kiss on the cover your loving daughter susannah touchandgo pstell mr robthetill i will write to him in a day or two this is the little song i spoke of beyond the sea beyond the sea my heart is gone far far from me and ever on its track will flee my thoughts my dreams beyond the sea beyond the sea beyond the sea the swallow wanders fast and free oh happy bird were i like thee i too would fly beyond the sea beyond the sea beyond the sea are kindly hearts and social glee but here for me they may not be my heart is gone beyond the sea chapter xii the mountain inn how sweet to minds that love not sordid ways is solitudemenander the captain wandered despondingly up and down hill for several days passing many hours of each in sitting on rocks making almost mechanically sketches of waterfalls and mountain pools taking care nevertheless to be always before nightfall in a comfortable inn where being a temperate man he whiled away the evening with making a bottle of sherry into negus his rambles brought him at length into the interior of merionethshire the land of all that is beautiful in nature and all that is lovely in woman here in a secluded village he found a little inn of small pretension and much comfort he felt so satisfied with his quarters and discovered every day so much variety in the scenes of the surrounding mountains that his inclination to proceed farther diminished progressively it is one thing to follow the high road through a country with every principally remarkable object carefully noted down in a book taking as therein directed a guide at particular points to the more recondite sights it is another to sit down on one chosen spot especially when the choice is unpremeditated and from thence by a series of explorations to come day by day on unanticipated scenes the latter process has many advantages over the former it is free from the disappointment which attends excited expectation when imagination has outstripped reality and from the accidents that mar the scheme of the tourists single day when the valleys may be drenched with rain or the mountains shrouded with mist the captain was one morning preparing to sally forth on his usual exploration when he heard a voice without inquiring for a guide to the ruined castle the voice seemed familiar to him and going forth into the gateway he recognised mr chainmail after greetings and inquiries for the absent you vanished very abruptly captain said mr chainmail from our party on the canal captain fitzchrometo tell you the truth i had a particular reason for trying the effect of absence from a part of that party mr chainmaili surmised as much at the same time the unusual melancholy of an in general most vivacious young lady made me wonder at your having acted so precipitately the ladys heart is yours if there be truth in signs captain fitzchromehearts are not now what they were in the days of the old song will love be controlled by advice mr chainmailvery true hearts heads and arms have all degenerated most sadly we can no more feel the high impassioned love of the ages which some people have the impudence to call dark than we can wield king richards battleaxe bend robin hoods bow or flourish the oaken graft of the pindar of wakefield still we have our tastes and feelings though they deserve not the name of passions and some of us may pluck up spirit to try to carry a point when we reflect that we have to contend with men no better than ourselves captain fitzchromewe do not now break lances for ladies mr chainmailno nor even bulrushes we jingle purses for them flourish paper money banners and tilt with scrolls of parchment captain fitzchromein which sort of tilting i have been thrown from the saddle i presume it was not love that led you from the flotilla mr chainmailby no means i was tempted by the sight of an old tower not to leave this land of ruined castles without having collected a few hints for the adornment of my baronial hall captain fitzchromei understand you live en famille with your domestics you will have more difficulty in finding a lady who would adopt your fashion of living than one who would prefer you to a richer man mr chainmailvery true i have tried the experiment on several as guests but once was enough for them so i suppose i shall die a bachelor captain fitzchromei see like some others of my friends you will give up anything except your hobby mr chainmaili will give up anything but my baronial hall captain fitzchromeyou will never find a wife for your purpose unless in the daughter of some old fashioned farmer mr chainmailno i thank you i must have a lady of gentle blood i shall not marry below my own condition i am too much of a herald i have too much of the twelfth century in me for that captain fitzchromewhy then your chance is not much better than mine a well born beauty would scarcely be better pleased with your baronial hall than with my more humble offer of love in a cottage she must have a town house and an opera box and roll about the streets in a carriage especially if her father has a rotten borough for the sake of which he sells his daughter that he may continue to sell his country but you were inquiring for a guide to the ruined castle in this vicinity i know the way and will conduct you the proposal pleased mr chainmail and they set forth on their expedition chapter xiii the lakethe ruin or vieni amore e qu meco tassetta orlando innamorato mr chainmailwould it not be a fine thing captain you being picturesque and i poetical you being for the lights and shadows of the present and i for those of the past if we were to go together over the ground which was travelled in the twelfth century by giraldus de barri when he accompanied archbishop baldwin to preach the crusade captain fitzchromenothing in my present frame of mind could be more agreeable to me mr chainmailwe would provide ourselves with his itinerarium compare what has been with what is contemplate in their decay the castles and abbeys which he saw in their strength and splendour and while you were sketching their remains i would dispassionately inquire what has been gained by the change captain fitzchromebe it so but the scheme was no sooner arranged than the captain was summoned to london by a letter on business which he did not expect to detain him long mr chainmail who like the captain was fascinated with the inn and the scenery determined to await his companions return and having furnished him with a list of books which he was to bring with him from london took leave of him and began to pass his days like the heroes of ariosto who tutto il giorno al bel oprar intenti saliron balze e traversar torrenti one day mr chainmail traced upwards the course of a mountain stream to a spot where a small waterfall threw itself over a slab of perpendicular rock which seemed to bar his farther progress on a nearer view he discovered a flight of steps roughly hewn in the rock on one side of the fall ascending these steps he entered a narrow winding pass between high and naked rocks that afforded only space for a rough footpath carved on one side at some height above the torrent the pass opened on a lake from which the stream issued and which lay like a dark mirror set in a gigantic frame of mountain precipices fragments of rock lay scattered on the edge of the lake some half buried in the water mr chainmail scrambled some way over these fragments till the base of a rock sinking abruptly in the water effectually barred his progress he sat down on a large smooth stone the faint murmur of the stream he had quitted the occasional flapping of the wings of the heron and at long intervals the solitary springing of a trout were the only sounds that came to his ear the sun shone brightly half way down the opposite rocks presenting on their irregular faces strong masses of light and shade suddenly he heard the dash of a paddle and turning his eyes saw a solitary and beautiful girl gliding over the lake in a coracle she was proceeding from the vicinity of the point he had quitted towards the upper end of the lake her apparel was rustic but there was in its style something more recherche in its arrangement something more of elegance and precision than was common to the mountain peasant girl it had more of the contadina of the opera than of the genuine mountaineer so at least thought mr chainmail but she passed so rapidly and took him so much by surprise that he had little opportunity for accurate observation he saw her land at the farther extremity and disappear among the rocks he rose from his seat returned to the mouth of the pass stepped from stone to stone across the stream and attempted to pass round by the other side of the lake but there again the abruptly sinking precipice closed his way day after day he haunted the spot but never saw again either the damsel or the coracle at length marvelling at himself for being so solicitous about the apparition of a peasant girl in a coracle who could not by any possibility be anything to him he resumed his explorations in another direction one day he wandered to the ruined castle on the sea shore which was not very distant from his inn and sitting on the rock near the base of the ruin was calling up the forms of past ages on the wall of an ivied tower when on its summit appeared a female figure whom he recognised in an instant for his nymph of the coracle the folds of the blue gown pressed by the sea breeze against one of the most symmetrical of figures the black feather of the black hat and the ringleted hair beneath it fluttering in the wind the apparent peril of her position on the edge of the mouldering wall from whose immediate base the rock went down perpendicularly to the sea presented a singularly interesting combination to the eye of the young antiquary mr chainmail had to pass half round the castle on the land side before he could reach the entrance he coasted the dry and bramble grown moat crossed the unguarded bridge passed the unportcullised arch of the gateway entered the castle court ascertained the tower ascended the broken stairs and stood on the ivied wall but the nymph of the place was gone he searched the ruins within and without but he found not what he sought he haunted the castle day after day as he had done the lake but the damsel appeared no more chapter xiv the dingle the stars of midnight shall be dear to her and she shall lean her ear in many a secret place where rivulets dance their wayward round and beauty born of murmuring sound shall pass into her facewordsworth miss susannah touchandgo had read the four great poets of italy and many of the best writers of france about the time of her fathers downfall accident threw into her way les rveries du promeneur solitaire and from the impression which these made on her she carried with her into retirement all the works of rousseau in the midst of that startling light which the conduct of old friends on a sudden reverse of fortune throws on a young and inexperienced mind the doctrines of the philosopher of geneva struck with double force upon her sympathies she imbibed the sweet poison as somebody calls it of his writings even to a love of truth which every wise man knows ought to be left to those who can get anything by it the society of children the beauties of nature the solitude of the mountains became her consolation and by degrees her delight the gay society from which she had been excluded remained on her memory only as a disagreeable dream she imbibed her new monitors ideas of simplicity of dress assimilating her own with that of the peasant girls in the neighbourhood the black hat the blue gown the black stockings the shoes tied on the instep pride was perhaps at the bottom of the change she was willing to impose in some measure on herself by marking a contemptuous indifference to the characteristics of the class of society from which she had fallen and with the food of pride sustained her soul in solitude it is true that she somewhat modified the forms of her rustic dress to the black hat she added a black feather to the blue gown she added a tippet and a waistband fastened in front with a silver buckle she wore her black stockings very smooth and tight on her ankles and tied her shoes in tasteful bows with the nicest possible ribbon in this apparel to which in winter she added a scarlet cloak she made dreadful havoc among the rustic mountaineers many of whom proposed to keep company with her in the cambrian fashion an honour which to their great surprise she always declined among these harry ap heather whose father rented an extensive sheepwalk and had a thousand she lambs wandering in the mountains was the most strenuous in his suit and the most pathetic in his lamentations for her cruelty miss susannah often wandered among the mountains alone even to some distance from the farmhouse sometimes she descended into the bottom of the dingles to the black rocky beds of the torrents and dreamed away hours at the feet of the cataracts one spot in particular from which she had at first shrunk with terror became by degrees her favourite haunt a path turning and returning at acute angles led down a steep wood covered slope to the edge of a chasm where a pool or resting place of a torrent lay far below a cataract fell in a single sheet into the pool the pool boiled and bubbled at the base of the fall but through the greater part of its extent lay calm deep and black as if the cataract had plunged through it to an unimaginable depth without disturbing its eternal repose at the opposite extremity of the pool the rocks almost met at their summits the trees of the opposite banks intermingled their leaves and another cataract plunged from the pool into a chasm on which the sunbeams never gleamed high above on both sides the steep woody slopes of the dingle soared into the sky and from a fissure in the rock on which the little path terminated a single gnarled and twisted oak stretched itself over the pool forming a fork with its boughs at a short distance from the rock miss susannah often sat on the rock with her feet resting on this tree in time she made her seat on the tree itself with her feet hanging over the abyss and at length she accustomed herself to lie along upon its trunk with her side on the mossy bole of the fork and an arm round one of the branches from this position a portion of the sky and the woods was reflected in the pool which from its bank was but a mass of darkness the first time she reclined in this manner her heart beat audibly in time she lay down as calmly as on the mountain heather the perception of the sublime was probably heightened by an intermingled sense of danger and perhaps that indifference to life which early disappointment forces upon sensitive minds was necessary to the first experiment there was in the novelty and strangeness of the position an excitement which never wholly passed away but which became gradually subordinate to the influence at once tranquillising and elevating of the mingled eternity of motion sound and solitude one sultry noon she descended into this retreat with a mind more than usually disturbed by reflections on the past she lay in her favourite position sometimes gazing on the cataract looking sometimes up the steep sylvan acclivities into the narrow space of the cloudless ether sometimes down into the abyss of the pool and the deep bright blue reflections that opened another immensity below her the distressing recollections of the morning the world and all its littlenesses faded from her thoughts like a dream but her wounded and wearied spirit drank in too deeply the tranquillising power of the place and she dropped asleep upon the tree like a ship boy on the mast at this moment mr chainmail emerged into daylight on a projection of the opposite rock having struck down through the woods in search of unsophisticated scenery the scene he discovered filled him with delight he seated himself on the rock and fell into one of his romantic reveries when suddenly the semblance of a black hat and feather caught his eye among the foliage of the projecting oak he started up shifted his position and got a glimpse of a blue gown it was his lady of the lake his enchantress of the ruined castle divided from him by a barrier which at a few yards below he could almost overleap yet unapproachable but by a circuit perhaps of many hours he watched with intense anxiety to listen if she breathed was out of the question the noses of a dean and chapter would have been soundless in the roar of the torrent from her extreme stillness she appeared to sleep yet what creature not desperate would go wilfully to sleep in such a place was she asleep then nay was she alive she was as motionless as death had she been murdered thrown from above and caught in the tree she lay too regularly and too composedly for such a supposition she was asleep then and in all probability her waking would be fatal he shifted his position below the pool two beetle browed rocks nearly overarched the chasm leaving just such a space at the summit as was within the possibility of a leap the torrent roared below in a fearful gulf he paused some time on the brink measuring the practicability and the danger and casting every now and then an anxious glance to his sleeping beauty in one of these glances he saw a slight movement of the blue gown and in a moment after the black hat and feather dropped into the pool reflection was lost for a moment and by a sudden impulse he bounded over the chasm he stood above the projecting oak the unknown beauty lay like the nymph of the scene her long black hair which the fall of her hat had disengaged from its fastenings drooping through the boughs he saw that the first thing to be done was to prevent her throwing her feet off the trunk in the first movements of waking he sat down on the rock and placed his feet on the stem securing her ankles between his own one of her arms was round a branch of the fork the other lay loosely on her side the hand of this arm he endeavoured to reach by leaning forward from his seat he approximated but could not touch it after several tantalising efforts he gave up the point in despair he did not attempt to wake her because he feared it might have bad consequences and he resigned himself to expect the moment of her natural waking determined not to stir from his post if she should sleep till midnight in this period of forced inaction he could contemplate at leisure the features and form of his charmer she was not one of the slender beauties of romance she was as plump as a partridge her cheeks were two roses not absolutely damask yet verging thereupon her lips twin cherries of equal size her nose regular and almost grecian her forehead high and delicately fair her eyebrows symmetrically arched her eyelashes long black and silky fitly corresponding with the beautiful tresses that hung among the leaves of the oak like clusters of wandering grapes her eyes were yet to be seen but how could he doubt that their opening would be the rising of the sun when all that surrounded their fringy portals was radiant as the forehead of the morning sky chapter xv the farm da ydywr gwaith rhaid dweyd y gwir ar fryniau sir meirionydd golwg oer or gwaela gawn mae hi etto yn llawn llawenydd though meirions rocks and hills of heath repel the distant sight yet where than those bleak hills beneath is found more true delight at length the young lady awoke she was startled at the sudden sight of the stranger and somewhat terrified at the first perception of her position but she soon recovered her self possession and extending her hand to the offered hand of mr chainmail she raised herself up on the tree and stepped on the rocky bank mr chainmail solicited permission to attend her to her home which the young lady graciously conceded they emerged from the woody dingle traversed an open heath wound along a mountain road by the shore of a lake descended to the deep bed of another stream crossed it by a series of stepping stones ascended to some height on the opposite side and followed upwards the line of the stream till the banks opened into a spacious amphitheatre where stood in its fields and meadows the farmhouse of ap llymry during this walk they had kept up a pretty animated conversation the lady had lost her hat and as she turned towards mr chainmail in speaking to him there was no envious projection of brim to intercept the beams of those radiant eyes he had been so anxious to see unclosed there was in them a mixture of softness and brilliancy the perfection of the beauty of female eyes such as some men have passed through life without seeing and such as no man ever saw in any pair of eyes but once such as can never be seen and forgotten young crotchet had seen it he had not forgotten it but he had trampled on its memory as the renegade tramples on the emblems of a faith which his interest only and not his heart or his reason has rejected her hair streamed over her shoulders the loss of the black feather had left nothing but the rustic costume the blue gown the black stockings and the ribbon tied shoes her voice had that full soft volume of melody which gives to common speech the fascination of music mr chainmail could not reconcile the dress of the damsel with her conversation and manners he threw out a remote question or two with the hope of solving the riddle but receiving no reply he became satisfied that she was not disposed to be communicative respecting herself and fearing to offend her fell upon other topics they talked of the scenes of the mountains of the dingle the ruined castle the solitary lake she told him that lake lay under the mountains behind her home and the coracle and the pass at the extremity saved a long circuit to the nearest village whither she sometimes went to inquire for letters mr chainmail felt curious to know from whom these letters might be and he again threw out two or three fishing questions to which as before he obtained no answer the only living biped they met in their walk was the unfortunate harry ap heather with whom they fell in by the stepping stones who seeing the girl of his heart hanging on another mans arm and concluding at once that they were keeping company fixed on her a mingled look of surprise reproach and tribulation and unable to control his feelings under the sudden shock burst into a flood of tears and blubbered till the rocks re echoed they left him mingling his tears with the stream and his lamentations with its murmurs mr chainmail inquired who that strange creature might be and what was the matter with him the young lady answered that he was a very worthy young man to whom she had been the innocent cause of much unhappiness i pity him sincerely said mr chainmail and nevertheless he could scarcely restrain his laughter at the exceedingly original figure which the unfortunate rustic lover had presented by the stepping stones the children ran out to meet their dear miss susan jumped all round her and asked what was become of her hat ap llymry came out in great haste and invited mr chainmail to walk in and dine mr chainmail did not wait to be asked twice in a few minutes the whole party miss susan and mr chainmail mr and mrs ap llymry and progeny were seated over a clean homespun table cloth ornamented with fowls and bacon a pyramid of potatoes another of cabbage which ap llymry said was poiled with the pacon and as coot as marrow a bowl of milk for the children and an immense brown jug of foaming ale with which ap llymry seemed to delight in filling the horn of his new guest shall we describe the spacious apartment which was at once kitchen hall and dining roomthe large dark rafters the pendent bacon and onions the strong old oaken furniture the bright and trimly arranged utensils shall we describe the cut of ap llymrys coat the colour and tie of his neckcloth the number of buttons at his kneesthe structure of mrs ap llymrys cap having lappets over the ears which were united under the chin setting forth especially whether the bond of union were a pin or a ribbon we shall leave this tempting field of interesting expatiation to those whose brains are high pressure steam engines for spinning prose by the furlong to be trumpeted in paid for paragraphs in the quacks corner of newspapers modern literature having attained the honourable distinction of sharing with blacking and macassar oil the space which used to be monopolised by razor strops and the lottery whereby that very enlightened community the reading public is tricked into the perusal of much exemplary nonsense though the few who see through the trickery have no reason to complain since as good wine needs no bush so ex vi oppositi these bushes of venal panegyric point out very clearly that the things they celebrate are not worth reading the party dined very comfortably in a corner most remote from the fire and mr chainmail very soon found his head swimming with two or three horns of ale of a potency to which even he was unaccustomed after dinner ap llymry made him finish a bottle of mead which he willingly accepted both as an excuse to remain and as a drink of the dark ages which he had no doubt was a genuine brewage from uncorrupted tradition in the meantime as soon as the cloth was removed the children had brought out miss susannahs harp she began without affectation to play and sing to the children as was her custom of an afternoon first in their own language and their national melodies then in english but she was soon interrupted by a general call of little voices for ouf di giorno she complied with the request and sang the ballad from pars camilla un d carco il mulinaro the children were very familiar with every syllable of this ballad which had been often fully explained to them they danced in a circle with the burden of every verse shouting out the chorus with good articulation and joyous energy and at the end of the second stanza where the traveller has his nose pinched by his grandmothers ghost every nose in the party was nipped by a pair of little fingers mr chainmail who was not prepared for the process came in for a very energetic tweak from a chubby girl that sprang suddenly on his knees for the purpose and made the roof ring with her laughter so passed the time till evening when mr chainmail moved to depart but it turned out on inquiry that he was some miles from his inn that the way was intricate and that he must not make any difficulty about accepting the farmers hospitality till morning the evening set in with rain the fire was found agreeable they drew around it the young lady made tea and afterwards from time to time at mr chainmails special request delighted his ear with passages of ancient music then came a supper of lake trout fried on the spot and thrown smoking hot from the pan to the plate then came a brewage which the farmer called his nightcap of which he insisted on mr chainmails taking his full share after which the gentleman remembered nothing till he awoke the next morning to the pleasant consciousness that he was under the same roof with one of the most fascinating creatures under the canopy of heaven chapter xvi the newspaper sprung from what line adorns the maid these valleys deep in mountain shade pind pyth ix mr chainmail forgot the captain and the route of giraldus de barri he became suddenly satisfied that the ruined castle in his present neighbourhood was the best possible specimen of its class and that it was needless to carry his researches further he visited the farm daily found himself always welcome flattered himself that the young lady saw him with pleasure and dragged a heavier chain at every new parting from miss susan as the children called his nymph of the mountains what might be her second name he had vainly endeavoured to discover mr chainmail was in love but the determination he had long before formed and fixed in his mind to marry only a lady of gentle blood without a blot in her escutcheon repressed the declarations of passion which were often rising to his lips in the meantime he left no means untried to pluck out the heart of her mystery the young lady soon divined his passion and penetrated his prejudices she began to look on him with favourable eyes but she feared her name and parentage would present an insuperable barrier to his feudal pride things were in this state when the captain returned and unpacked his maps and books in the parlour of the inn mr chainmailreally captain i find so many objects of attraction in this neighbourhood that i would gladly postpone our purpose captain fitzchromeundoubtedly this neighbourhood has many attractions but there is something very inviting in the scheme you laid down mr chainmailno doubt there is something very tempting in the route of giraldus de barri but there are better things in this vicinity even than that to tell you the truth captain i have fallen in love captain fitzchromewhat while i have been away mr chainmaileven so captain fitzchromethe plunge must have been very sudden if you are already over head and ears mr chainmailas deep as llyn y dreiddiad vrawd captain fitzchromeand what may that be mr chainmaila pool not far off a resting place of a mountain stream which is said to have no bottom there is a tradition connected with it and here is a ballad on it at your service llyn y dreiddiad vrawd the pool of the diving friar gwenwynwyn withdrew from the feasts of his hall he slept very little he prayed not at all he pondered and wandered and studied alone and sought night and day the philosophers stone he found it at length and he made its first proof by turning to gold all the lead of his roof then he bought some magnanimous heroes all fire who lived but to smite and be smitten for hire with these on the plains like a torrent he broke he filled the whole country with flame and with smoke he killed all the swine and he broached all the wine he drove off the sheep and the beeves and the kine he took castles and towns he cut short limbs and lives he made orphans and widows of children and wives this course many years he triumphantly ran and did mischief enough to be called a great man when at last he had gained all for which he held striven he bethought him of buying a passport to heaven good and great as he was yet he did not well know how soon or which way his great spirit might go he sought the grey friars who beside a wild stream refected their frames on a primitive scheme the gravest and wisest gwenwynwyn found out all lonely and ghostly and angling for trout below the white dash of a mighty cascade where a pool of the stream a deep resting place made and rock rooted oaks stretched their branches on high the friar stood musing and throwing his fly to him said gwenwynwyn hold father heres store for the good of the church and the good of the poor then he gave him the stone but ere more he could speak wrath came on the friar so holy and meek he had stretched forth his hand to receive the red gold and he thought himself mocked by gwenwynwyn the bold and in scorn of the gift and in rage at the giver he jerked it immediately into the river gwenwynwyn aghast not a syllable spake the philosophers stone made a duck and a drake two systems of circles a moment were seen and the stream smoothed them off as they never had been gwenwynwyn regained and uplifted his voice oh friar grey friar full rash was thy choice the stone the good stone which away thou hast thrown was the stone of all stones the philosophers stone the friar looked pale when his error he knew the friar looked red and the friar looked blue and heels over head from the point of a rock he plunged without stopping to pull off his frock he dived very deep but he dived all in vain the prize he had slighted he found not again many times did the friar his diving renew and deeper and deeper the river still grew gwenwynwyn gazed long of his senses in doubt to see the grey friar a diver so stout then sadly and slowly his castle he sought and left the friar diving like dabchick distraught gwenwynwyn fell sick with alarm and despite died and went to the devil the very same night the magnanimous heroes he held in his pay sacked his castle and marched with the plunder away no knell on the silence of midnight was rolled for the flight of the soul of gwenwynwyn the bold the brethren unfeed let the mighty ghost pass without praying a prayer or intoning a mass the friar haunted ever beside the dark stream the philosophers stone was his thought and his dream and day after day ever head under heels he dived all the time he could spare from his meals he dived and he dived to the end of his days as the peasants oft witnessed with fear and amaze the mad friars diving place long was their theme and no plummet can fathom that pool of the stream and still when light clouds on the midnight winds ride if by moonlight you stray on the lone river side the ghost of the friar may be seen diving there with head in the water and heels in the air captain fitzchromewell your ballad is very pleasant you shall show me the scene and i will sketch it but just now i am more interested about your love what heroine of the twelfth century has risen from the ruins of the old castle and looked down on you from the ivied battlements mr chainmailyou are nearer the mark than you suppose even from those battlements a heroine of the twelfth century has looked down on me captain fitzchromeoh some vision of an ideal beauty i suppose the whole will end in another tradition and a ballad mr chainmailgenuine flesh and blood as genuine as lady clarinda i will tell you the story mr chainmail narrated his adventures captain fitzchromethen you seem to have found what you wished chance has thrown in your way what none of the gods would have ventured to promise you mr chainmailyes but i know nothing of her birth and parentage she tells me nothing of herself and i have no right to question her directly captain fitzchromeshe appears to be expressly destined for the light of your baronial hall introduce me in this case two heads are better than one mr chainmailno i thank you leave me to manage my chance of a prize and keep you to your own chance of a captain fitzchromeblank as you please well i will pitch my tent here till i have filled my portfolio and shall be glad of as much of your company as you can spare from more attractive society matters went on pretty smoothly for several days when an unlucky newspaper threw all into confusion mr chainmail received newspapers by the post which came in three times a week one morning over their half finished breakfast the captain had read half a newspaper very complacently when suddenly he started up in a frenzy hurled over the breakfast table and bouncing from the apartment knocked down harry ap heather who was coming in at the door to challenge his supposed rival to a boxing match harry sprang up in a double rage and intercepted mr chainmails pursuit of the captain placing himself in the doorway in a pugilistic attitude mr chainmail not being disposed for this mode of combat stepped back into the parlour took the poker in his right hand and displacing the loose bottom of a large elbow chair threw it over his left arm as a shield harry not liking the aspect of the enemy in this imposing attitude retreated with backward steps into the kitchen and tumbled over a cur which immediately fastened on his rear mr chainmail half laughing half vexed anxious to overtake the captain and curious to know what was the matter with him pocketed the newspaper and sallied forth leaving harry roaring for a doctor and tailor to repair the lacerations of his outward man mr chainmail could find no trace of the captain indeed he sought him but in one direction which was that leading to the farm where he arrived in due time and found miss susan alone he laid the newspaper on the table as was his custom and proceeded to converse with the young lady a conversation of many pauses as much of signs as of words the young lady took up the paper and turned it over and over while she listened to mr chainmail whom she found every day more and more agreeable when suddenly her eye glanced on something which made her change colour and dropping the paper on the ground she rose from her seat exclaiming miserable must she be who trusts any of your faithless sex never never never will i endure such misery twice and she vanished up the stairs mr chainmail was petrified at length he cried aloud cornelius agrippa must have laid a spell on this accursed newspaper and was turning it over to look for the source of the mischief when mrs ap llymry made her appearance mrs ap llymrywhat have you done to poor dear miss susan she is crying ready to break her heart mr chainmailso help me the memory of richard coeur de lion i have not the most distant notion of what is the matter mrs ap llymryoh dont tell me sir you must have ill used her i know how it is you have been keeping company with her as if you wanted to marry her and now all at once you have been insulting her i have seen such tricks more than once and you ought to be ashamed of yourself mr chainmailmy dear madam you wrong me utterly i have none but the kindest feelings and the most honourable purposes towards her she has been disturbed by something she has seen in this rascally paper mrs ap llymrywhy then the best thing you can do is to go away and come again tomorrow mr chainmailnot i indeed madam out of this house i stir not till i have seen the young lady and obtained a full explanation mrs ap llymryi will tell miss susan what you say perhaps she will come down mr chainmail sat with as much patience as he could command running over the paper from column to column at length he lighted on an announcement of the approaching marriage of lady clarinda bossnowl with mr crotchet the younger this explained the captains discomposure but the cause of miss susans was still to be sought he could not know that it was one and the same presently the sound of the longed for step was heard on the stairs the young lady reappeared and resumed her seat her eyes showed that she had been weeping the gentleman was now exceedingly puzzled how to begin but the young lady relieved him by asking with great simplicity what do you wish to have explained sir mr chainmaili wish if i may be permitted to explain myself to you yet could i first wish to know what it was that disturbed you in this unlucky paper happy should i be if i could remove the cause of your inquietude miss susannahthe cause is already removed i saw something that excited painful recollections nothing that i could now wish otherwise than as it is mr chainmailyet may i ask why it is that i find one so accomplished living in this obscurity and passing only by the name of miss susan miss susannahthe world and my name are not friends i have left the world and wish to remain for ever a stranger to all whom i once knew in it mr chainmailyou can have done nothing to dishonour your name miss susannahno sir my father has done that of which the world disapproves in matters of which i pretend not to judge i have suffered for it as i will never suffer again my name is my own secret i have no other and that is one not worth knowing you see what i am and all i am i live according to the condition of my present fortune and here so living i have found tranquillity mr chainmailyet i entreat you tell me your name miss susannahwhy sir mr chainmailwhy but to throw my hand my heart my fortune at your feet if miss susannahif my name be worthy of them mr chainmailnay nay not so if your hand and heart are free miss susannahmy hand and heart are free but they must be sought from myself and not from my name she fixed her eyes on him with a mingled expression of mistrust of kindness and of fixed resolution which the far gone inamorato found irresistible mr chainmailthen from yourself alone i seek them miss susannahreflect you have prejudices on the score of parentage i have not conversed with you so often without knowing what they are choose between them and me i too have my own prejudices on the score of personal pride mr chainmaili would choose you from all the world were you even the daughter of the excuteur des hautes uvres as the heroine of a romantic story i once read turned out to be miss susannahi am satisfied you have now a right to know my history and if you repent i absolve you from all obligations she told him her history but he was out of the reach of repentance it is true as at a subsequent period he said to the captain she is the daughter of a money changer one who in the days of richard the first would have been plucked by the beard in the streets but she is according to modern notions a lady of gentle blood as to her fathers running away that is a minor consideration i have always understood from mr mac quedy who is a great oracle in this way that promises to pay ought not to be kept the essence of a safe and economical currency being an interminable series of broken promises there seems to be a difference among the learned as to the way in which the promises ought to be broken but i am not deep enough in this casuistry to enter into such nice distinctions in a few days there was a wedding a pathetic leave taking of the farmers family a hundred kisses from the bride to the children and promises twenty times reclaimed and renewed to visit them in the ensuing year chapter xvii the invitation a cup of wine thats brisk and fine and drink unto the lemon mine master silence this veridicous history began in may and the occurrences already narrated have carried it on to the middle of autumn stepping over the interval to christmas we find ourselves in our first locality among the chalk hills of the thames and we discover our old friend mr crotchet in the act of accepting an invitation for himself and any friends who might be with him to pass their christmas day at chainmail hall after the fashion of the twelfth century mr

some of the after dinner conversations of the castle had had sentence of exclusion passed upon him on the motion of the reverend doctor folliott as a flagitious violator of the confidences of private life miss crotchet had become lady bossnowl but lady clarinda had not yet changed her name to crotchet she had on one pretence and another procrastinated the happy event and the gentleman had not been very pressing she had however accompanied her brother and sister in law to pass christmas at crotchet castle with these mr mac quedy mr philpot mr trillo mr skionar mr toogood and mr firedamp were

says my house has been broken open on the most scientific principles all this comes of education mr mac quedyi rather think it comes of poverty the rev dr folliottno sir robbery perhaps comes of

meshaignent de jour en jourrabelias c the party which was assembled on christmas day in chainmail hall comprised all the guests of crotchet castle some of mr chainmails other neighbours all his tenants and domestics and captain fitzchrome the hall was spacious and lofty and with its tall fluted pillars and pointed arches its windows of stained glass its display of arms and banners intermingled with holly and mistletoe its blazing cressets and torches and a stupendous fire in the centre on which blocks of pine were flaming and crackling had a striking effect on eyes unaccustomed to such a dining room the fire was open on all sides and the smoke was caught and carried back under a funnel formed canopy into a hollow central pillar this fire was the line of demarcation between gentle and simple on days of high festival tables extended from it on two sides to nearly the end of the hall mrs chainmail was introduced to the company young crotchet felt some revulsion of feeling at the unexpected sight of one whom he had forsaken but not forgotten in a condition apparently so much happier than his own the lady held out her hand to him with a cordial look of more than forgiveness it seemed to say that she had much to thank him for she was the picture of a happy bride rayonnante de joie et damour mr crotchet told the reverend doctor folliott the news of the morning as you predicted he said your friend the learned friend is in office he has also a title he is now sir guy de vaux the rev dr folliottthank heaven for that he is disarmed from further mischief it is something at any rate to have that hollow and wind shaken reed rooted up for ever from the field of public delusion mr crotcheti suppose doctor you do not like to see a great reformer in office you are afraid for your vested interests the rev dr folliottnot i indeed sir my vested interests are very safe from all such reformers as the learned friend i vaticinate what will be the upshot of all his schemes of reform he will make a speech of seven hours duration and this will be its quintessence that seeing the exceeding difficulty of putting salt on the birds tail it will be expedient to consider the best method of throwing dust in the birds eyes all the rest will be as aristophanes has it and so i leave him in nephelococcygia mr mac quedy came up to the divine as mr crotchet left him and said there is one piece of news which the old gentleman has not told you the great firm of catchflat and company in which young crotchet is a partner has stopped payment the rev dr folliottbless me that accounts for the young gentlemans melancholy i thought they would overreach themselves with their own tricks the day of reckoning mr mac quedy is the point which your paper money science always leaves out of view mr mac quedyi do not see sir that the failure of catchflat and company has anything to do with my science the rev dr folliottit has this to do with it sir that you would turn the whole nation into a great paper money shop and take no thought of the day of reckoning but the dinner is coming i think you who are so fond of paper promises should dine on the bill of fare the harper at the head of the hall struck up an ancient march and the dishes were brought in in grand procession the boars head garnished with rosemary with a citron in its mouth led the van then came tureens of plum porridge then a series of turkeys and in the midst of them an enormous sausage which it required two men to carry then came geese and capons tongues and hams the ancient glory of the christmas pie a gigantic plum pudding a pyramid of mince pies and a baron of beef bringing up the rear it is something new under the sun said the divine as he sat down to see a great dinner without fish mr chainmailfish was for fasts in the twelfth century the rev dr folliottwell sir i prefer our reformed system of putting fasts and feasts together not but here is ample indemnity ale and wine flowed in abundance the dinner passed off merrily the old harper playing all the while the oldest music in his repertory the tables being cleared he indemnified himself for lost time at the lower end of the hall in company with the old butler and the other domestics whose attendance on the banquet had been indispensable the scheme of christmas gambols which mr chainmail had laid for the evening was interrupted by a tremendous clamour without the rev dr folliottwhat have we here mummers mr chainmailnay i know not i expect none who is there he added approaching the door of the hall who is there vociferated the divine with the voice of stentor captain swing replied a chorus of discordant voices the rev dr folliottho ho here is a piece of the dark ages we did not bargain for here is the jacquerie here is the march of mind with a witness mr mac quedydo you not see that you have brought disparates together the jacquerie and the march of mind the rev dr folliottnot at all sir they are the same thing under different names what was jacquerie in the dark ages is the march of mind in this very enlightened onevery enlightened one mr chainmailthe cause is the same in both poverty in despair mr mac quedyvery likely but the effect is extremely disagreeable the rev dr folliottit is the natural result mr mac quedy of that system of state seamanship which your science upholds putting the crew on short allowance and doubling the rations of the officers is the sure way to make a mutiny on board a ship in distress mr mac quedy mr mac quedyeh sir i uphold no such system as that i shall set you right as to cause and effect discontent arises with the increase of information that is all the rev dr folliotti said it was the march of mind but we have not time for discussing cause and effect now let us get rid of the enemy and he vociferated at the top of his voice what do you want here arms arms replied a hundred voices give us the arms the rev dr folliottyou see mr chainmail this is the inconvenience of keeping an armoury not fortified with sand bags green bags and old bags of all kinds mr mac quedyjust give them the old spits and toasting irons and they will go away quietly mr chainmailmy spears and swords not without my life these assailants are all aliens to my land and house my men will fight for me one and all this is the fortress of beef and ale mr mac quedyeh sir when the rabble is up it is very indiscriminating you are een suffering for the sins of sir simon steeltrap and the like who have pushed the principle of accumulation a little too far mr chainmailthe way to keep the people down is kind and liberal usage mr mac quedythat is very well where it can be afforded in the way of prevention but in the way of cure the operation must be more drastic taking down a battle axe i would fain have a good blunderbuss charged with slugs mr chainmailwhen i suspended these arms for ornament i never dreamed of their being called into use mr skionarlet me address them i never failed to convince an audience that the best thing they could do was to go away mr mac quedyeh sir i can bring them to that conclusion in less time than you mr crotcheti have no fancy for fighting it is a very hard case upon a guest when the latter end of a feast is the beginning of a fray mr mac quedygive them the old iron the rev dr folliottgive them the weapons pessimo medius fidius exemplo forbid it the spirit of frre jean des entommeures no let us see what the church militant in the armour of the twelfth century will do against the march of mind follow me who will and stay who list here goes pro aris et focis that is for tithe pigs and fires to roast them he clapped a helmet on his head seized a long lance threw open the gates and tilted out on the rabble side by side with mr chainmail followed by the greater portion of the male inmates of the hall who had armed themselves at random the rabble rout being unprepared for such a sortie fled in all directions over hedge and ditch mr trillo stayed in the hall playing a march on the harp to inspirit the rest to sally out the water loving mr philpot had diluted himself with so much wine as to be quite hors de combat mr toogood intending to equip himself in purely defensive armour contrived to slip a ponderous coat of mail over his shoulders which pinioned his arms to his sides and in this condition like a chicken trussed for roasting he was thrown down behind a pillar in the first rush of the sortie mr crotchet seized the occurrence as a pretext for staying with him and passed the whole time of the action in picking him out of his shell phew said the divine returning an inglorious victory but it deserves a devil and a bowl of punch mr chainmaila wassail bowl the rev dr folliottno sir no more of the twelfth century for me mr chainmailnay doctor the twelfth century has backed you well its manners and habits its community of kind feelings between master and man are the true remedy for these ebullitions mr toogoodsomething like it improved by my diagram arts for arms the rev dr folliottno wassail bowl for me give me an unsophisticated bowl of punch which belongs to that blissful middle period after the jacquerie was down and before the march of mind was up but see who is floundering in the water proceeding to the edge of the moat they fished up mr firedamp who had missed his way back and tumbled in he was drawn out exclaiming that he had taken his last dose of malaria in this world the rev dr folliotttut man dry clothes a turkeys leg and rump well devilled and a quart of strong punch will set all to rights wood embers said mr firedamp when he had been accommodated with a change of clothes there is no antidote to malaria like the smoke of wood embers pine embers and he placed himself with his mouth open close by the fire the rev dr folliottpunch sir punch there is no antidote like punch mr chainmailwell doctor you shall be indulged but i shall have my wassail bowl nevertheless an immense bowl of spiced wine with roasted apples hissing on its surface was borne into the hall by four men followed by an empty bowl of the same dimensions with all the materials of arrack punch for the divines especial brewage he accinged himself to the task with his usual heroism and having finished it to his entire satisfaction reminded his host to order in the devil the rev dr folliotti think mr chainmail we can amuse ourselves very well here all night the enemy may be still excubant and we had better not disperse till daylight i am perfectly satisfied with my quarters let the young folk go on with their gambols let them dance to your old harpers minstrelsy and if they please to kiss under the mistletoe whereof i espy a goodly bunch suspended at the end of the hall let those who like it not leave it to those who do moreover if among the more sedate portion of the assembly which i foresee will keep me company there were any to revive the good old custom of singing after supper so to fill up the intervals of the dances the steps of night would move more lightly mr chainmailmy susan will set the example after she has set that of joining in the rustic dance according to good customs long departed after the first dance in which all classes of the company mingled the young lady of the mansion took her harp and following the reverend gentlemans suggestion sang a song of the twelfth century florence and blanchflor florence and blanchflor loveliest maids within a summer grove amid the flower enamelled shades together talked of love a clerk sweet blanchflors heart had gaind fair florence loved a knight and each with ardent voice maintained she loved the worthiest wight sweet blanchflor praised her scholar dear as courteous kind and true fair florence said her chevalier could every foe subdue and florence scorned the bookworm vain who sword nor spear could raise and blanchflor scorned the unlettered brain could sing no ladys praise from dearest love the maidens bright to deadly hatred fell each turned to shun the others sight and neither said farewell the king of birds who held his court within that flowery grove sang loudly twill be rare disport to judge this suit of love before him came the maidens bright with all his birds around to judge the cause if clerk or knight in love be worthiest found the falcon and the sparrow hawk stood forward for the fight ready to do and not to talk they voted for the knight and blanchflors heart began to fail till rose the strong voiced lark and after him the nightingale and pleaded for the clerk the nightingale prevailed at length her pleading had such charms so eloquence can conquer strength and arts can conquer arms the lovely florence tore her hair and died upon the place and all the birds assembled there bewailed the mournful case they piled up leaves and flowerets rare above the maiden bright and sang farewell to florence fair who too well loved her knight several others of the party sang in the intervals of the dances mr chainmail handed to mr trillo another ballad of the twelfth century of a merrier character than the former mr trillo readily accommodated it with an air and sang the priest and the mulberry tree did you hear of the curate who mounted his mare and merrily trotted along to the fair of creature more tractable none ever heard in the height of her speed she would stop at a word and again with a word when the curate said hey she put forth her mettle and galloped away as near to the gates of the city he rode while the sun of september all brilliantly glowed the good priest discovered with eyes of desire a mulberry tree in a hedge of wild briar on boughs long and lofty in many a green shoot hung large black and glossy the beautiful fruit the curate was hungry and thirsty to boot he shrunk from the thorns though he longed for the fruit with a word he arrested his coursers keen speed and he stood up erect on the back of his steed on the saddle he stood while the creature stood still and he gathered the fruit till he took his good fill sure never he thought was a creature so rare so docile so true as my excellent mare lo here how i stand and he gazed all around as safe and as steady as if on the ground yet how had it been if some traveller this way had dreaming no mischief but chanced to cry hey he stood with his head in the mulberry tree and he spoke out aloud in his fond reverie at the sound of the word the good mare made a push and down went the priest in the wild briar bush he remembered too late on his thorny green bed much that well may be thought cannot wisely be said lady clarinda being prevailed on to take the harp in her turn sang the following stanzas in the days of old lovers felt true passion deeming years of sorrow by a smile repaid now the charms of gold spells of pride and fashion bid them say good morrow to the best loved maid through the forests wild oer the mountains lonely they were never weary honour to pursue if the damsel smiled once in seven years only all their wanderings dreary ample guerdon knew now one days caprice weighs down years of smiling youthful hearts are rovers love is bought and sold fortunes gifts may cease love is less beguiling wisest were the lovers in the days of old the glance which she threw at the captain as she sang the last verse awakened his dormant hopes looking round for his rival he saw that he was not in the hall and approaching the lady of his heart he received one of the sweetest smiles of their earlier days after a time the ladies and all the females of the party retired the males remained on duty with punch and wassail and dropped off one by one into sweet forgetfulness so that when the rising sun of december looked through the painted windows on mouldering embers and flickering lamps the vaulted roof was echoing to a mellifluous concert of noses from the clarionet of the waiting boy at one end of the hall to the double bass of the reverend doctor ringing over the empty punch bowl at the other conclusion from this eventful night young crotchet was seen no more on english mould whither he had vanished was a question that could no more be answered in his case than in that of king arthur after the battle of camlan the great firm of catchflat and company figured in the gazette and paid sixpence in the pound and it was clear that he had shrunk from exhibiting himself on the scene of his former greatness shorn of the beams of his paper prosperity some supposed him to be sleeping among the undiscoverable secrets of some barbel pool in the thames but those who knew him best were more inclined to the opinion that he had gone across the atlantic with his pockets full of surplus capital to join his old acquaintance mr touchandgo in the bank of dotandcarryonetown lady clarinda was more sorry for her fathers disappointment than her own but she had too much pride to allow herself to be put up a second time in the money market and when the captain renewed his assiduities her old partiality for him combining with a sense of gratitude for a degree of constancy which she knew she scarcely deserved induced her with lord foolincourts hard wrung consent to share with him a more humble but less precarious fortune than that to which she had been destined as the price of a rotten borough

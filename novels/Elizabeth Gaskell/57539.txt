cranford illustration publlishers logo illustration miss matty cranford by mrs gaskell with a preface by anne thackeray ritchie and illustrations by hugh thomson london macmillan and co and new york printed by r r clark edinburgh illustration preface i my father has written of the memories connected with the writing of books and of the scenes and feelings which are printed on the pages quite other from those which they recount and there are also the associations of the readers as well as of the writers one scene in cranford always comes back to me not only for its own most pathetic value but because i saw my father reading it i can still remember him coming through the doorway just as i had finished the chapter when not without some agitation and excitement i put the close printed number of household words into his hand it was in the little diningroom of his house in young street by gas light just before dinnertime the story was that of captain brown and he sat down and read it then and there and afterwards told me the writers name but indeed i did not think of it as a story at all it seemed to me rather that i had witnessed some most touching and heroic deed some sad disaster and though i was a grown girl at the time i had a foolish childish wish for my fathers sympathy and a feeling that even yet he might avert the catastrophe dear captain brown in his shabby wig and faded coat loved and remembered far beyond the narrow boundaries of cranfordthe city of the amazons the home of miss pole and miss matty and miss jenkyns the place where economy was always elegant where though some might be poor we were all aristocratic ever since the winters evening when i made my first acquaintance with that delightful place it has seemed to me something of a visionary country home which i have visited at intervals all my life long in spirit for refreshment and change of scene i have been there in good company thank you for your letter charlotte bront writes to mrs gaskell in it was as pleasant as a quiet chat as welcome as spring showers as reviving as a friends visit in short it was very like a page of cranford the quotation breaks off with little dots but i am sure that each one of them represents a happy moment for currer bell who had not many such in her sad life there is a most interesting notice of mrs gaskell in the biographical dictionary in which lord houghton is quoted as writing of cranford as the finest piece of humoristic description that has been added to british literature since charles lamb i had been thinking of elia after rereading the book and i was pleased to find myself on the steps of such a critic as lord houghton one could imagine mrs sarah battle and the poor relation dwelling in cranford and if charles lamb could have liked anything that was not london he too might have fancied the place perhaps miss austens ladies may also have visited there but i feel less certainty about them they belong to a different condition of things to a more lively lovemaking set of people both younger in age and older in generation than the cranford ladies cranford is farther removed from the world and yet more attuned to its larger interests than meryton or kellynch or hartfield drumble the great noisy manufacturing town is its metropolis not bath with its succession of card parties and assembly rooms at cranford love is a memory rather than a present emotion the sentimental locks of hair have turned to gray the billet doux to yellow like autumn leaves falling from the tree of life but there is more of real feeling in these few signs of what was once than in all the misses bennetts youthful romances put together only miss austens very sweetest heroines including her own irresistible darkeyed self in her big cap and folded kerchief are worthy of the old place i should give the freedom of cranford were it mine to bestow in the usual handsome casket to anne elliott to fanny price perhaps but as i write some spirit of compunction disturbs the obiter dicta of a hasty moment where is one to draw the line lady bertram and the honourable mrs jamieson would surely have been kindred souls delightful creatures both with their divergences who will ever forget lady bertrams plea for morality or mrs jamiesons languid replies to miss mattys inquiries as to the preparations expected in a gentlemans dressingroom those answers given in the wearied manner of the scandinavian prophetess leave me leave me to repose but it is all very well to decide who shall and who shall not in turn be a dweller in this favoured spot cranford chooses its own inhabitants and is everywhere where people have individuality and kindliness and where oddities are tolerated nay greatly loved for the sake of the individuals i am sure cranford existed in the quarter in paris where my own early youth was passed i can remember it in kensington also though we did not quite go the length of putting our cows into gray flannel dressinggowns as miss betsy barker did perhaps cranford did not even stop at kensington but may have reached farther afield taking chiswick on its way miss debrah as she preferred to be called is certainly first cousin to miss pinkerton can either of these ladies have been connected with the unrivalled miss seward herself i do not quite know upon what terms miss seward and dr johnson happened to be but i could imagine the great lexicographer driving them all before him and miss pinkertons turban or miss jenkyns in her little helmetlike bonnet miss debrah and miss pinkerton belong to an altogether bygone type but all the rest of the ladies in cranford are as modern and as much alive as if they had been born in the s i believe the art of telling a story is born with some people writes the author of cranford it was certainly born with mrs gaskell my sister and i were once under the same roof with her in the house of our friends mr and mrs george smith and the remembrance of her voice comes back to me harmoniously flowing on and on with spirit and intention and delightful emphasis as we all sat indoors one gusty morning listening to her ghost stories they were scotch ghosts historical ghosts spirited ghosts with faded uniforms and nice old powdered queues as i think it over i am suddenly struck by the immense superiority of the ghosts of my youth to the present legion of unclean spirits which surround us as we are toldwielding teacups smashing accordions and banjos breaking furniture in bits that morning at hampstead which i recall was of a different order of things spiritual and unseen mystery was there romantic feeling some holy terror and emotion all combined to keep us gratefully silent and delighted ii it is something for us cockneys to know that mrs gaskell belongs to london after all if only as a baby although so much of her life was spent in the north and knutsford was the home of her childhood and manchester that of her married life yet she was born in chelsea she was born in in pretty old lindsay place of which the windowsancient lights even thenstill look out upon the river at its turn as it flows from cheyne row towards the sunset past fulham palace where the bishops dwell and hampton court and its histories out into the country plains beyond mrs gaskell was born in that propitious hour of the great men and women who came into the world in the beginning of this century may the next hundred years bring to our descendants many more such birthdays she belonged to a good stock on either side her father came from berwick upon tweed that city built upon the rock he was mr william stevenson a unitarian minister there is a tradition that the stevensons came originally from norway and there are old family papers in which the name is spelled stevensen mrs gaskell liked to think of her scandinavian forefathers and when she went away now and again for little jaunts and expeditions such as she always enjoyed she used to laugh and say that the blood of the vikings her ancestors was rising in her veins she was always tenderly attached to her fathers memory and proud and fond of him and he must have been indeed a most interesting and delightful character a letter lately written to the athenum evidently by some old friend of the family gives a quotation from longmans annual obituary for and of the notice of mr stevensons death beginning thus the literary and scientific world has sustained a great loss in the death of mr stevenson a man remarkable for the stores of knowledge which he possessed and for the simplicity and modesty by which his rare attainments were concealed among other facts we read that in early life while preaching at manchester mr stevenson was also classical tutor in the manchester academy so well known through the aikens and barbaulds he was afterwards appointed secretary to lord lauderdale and finally keeper of the records to the treasury both of which appointments brought him up to london he laboured with unremitting diligence contributing to the edinburgh review the westminster and dr brewsters encyclopedia he had the true spirit of a faithful historian and contrary to the practice too prevalent in those days dived into original sources of information was not this the father one might imagine for such a daughter mr stevenson married as his first wife miss eliza holland of sandlebridge it would not be difficult to name some dozen families now existing which have set their mark upon the times trump cards in the game of life so to speak and to one of these families mrs gaskells mother belonged the poor young lady died very soon after her little girl was born and the child was taken away to the care of an aunt her mothers sister who was living at knutsford in cheshire with an only child a cripple the whole story was very melancholy and one can imagine that it may have been a somewhat sad and silent home for a little girl full of life and imagination there was an uncle also dwelling in the same little country town dr peter holland who was the father of the great physician sir henry holland and the grandfather of the present lord knutsford besides their houses in knutsford the holland family had a pretty old country house some two or three miles beyond the town from whence mrs gaskells own mother had come the house where mrs gaskell lived as a little girl with her aunt is on the heath a tall red house with a wide spreading view and with a pretty carved staircase and many light windows both back and front i have heard that mrs gaskell was not always quite happy in those daysimaginative children go through many phases and trials of their ownin her hours of childish sorrow and trouble she used to run away from her aunts house across the heath and hide herself in one of its many green hollows finding comfort in the silence and in the company of birds and insects and natural things but at other times she had delightful games of play with her cousins in the sweet old family house at sandlebridge where so many hollands in turn had lived the old house stands lonely in a beautiful and tranquil position with a waving prospect of fields and shady trees and hedges reaching to the hills which rise in the far distance as we stood there we could see alderley edge clean painted against the stormy sky just before reaching the house the road dips into a green hollow where stands a forge which has been there for over two hundred years handed down from father to son just beyond the forge is an old mill shaded by beautiful trees we could hear the peaceful sounds of labour the clanking blows of the anvil the soft monotonous thud of the mill sandlebridge is now given up to a farmer a pretty flagged stone path leads up to the front door there used to be two brick pediments with balls at the garden gate years ago so long ago that the great lord clive was only a schoolboy in knutsford at the time his mother was a gaskell and had connections in the place he used to come over to spend his half holidays at sandlebridge and his pleasure was to jump across from one stone ball to the other to the great danger of his legs and arms here too in later times as we have said mrs gaskell used to come as a little girl and play with her cousins and gather flowers from the garden there was a great bed of saxifrage which may still be there it was always her favourite flower the old house is now dismantled but one or two things still remain out of its past among others are the fine old wooden chimneypieces in the front parlour one within the otherso it seemed to meand the old shuffleboard a shuffleboard is an immensely long table standing upon legs of shining oak with many drawers and cupboards underneath there are hardly any left anywhere now they were once used for a game which consisted in jerking heavy counters from one end to the other of the shining board and trying to keep your own and to throw your enemys over the side of the table as we were looking with interest at all these relics of bygone times we heard a sort of chucking noise from the big inner room or kitchen it came from a little person some two or three months old lying in a huge carved oak cradle by the fire which cradle must have rocked any number of generations to sleep knutsford itself is a little town of many oak beams and solid brick walls there are so many slanting gables left and lattices and corners that the high street has something the look of a medival street tis an old ancient place said the shopwoman standing by her slanting counter where shakespeare himself might have purchased hardware from the main street several narrow courts and passages lead to the other side of the little town the aristocratic quarter where are the old houses with their walled gardens one of these passages runs right through the royal george hotel itself leading from shadow into the sunshine where a goat disports itself and one or two ladies seem always passing with quiet yet rapid stepsthe inhabitants of knutsford do not saunter my friend the shopwoman told us she had a beautiful garden at the back of her old ancient place all the houses in knutsford have gardens with parterres beautifully kept and flowers in abundance it was autumn but everything was swept and tidy straggling branches plants overgrown and run to seed do not seem to be known in knutsford amidst its heathy open spaces there is something so spirited and fresh and methodical in the place that i can understand how even the flowerbeds have a certain selfrespect and grow trim and straight instead of straggling about in lazy abandon as mine do at home as we entered the royal george hotel out of the dark street we came upon a delightful broadside of shining oak staircase and panelled wainscot old oak settles and cupboards stood upon the landings on the walls hung pictures one was of lord beaconsfield one was a fine print of george iv and others again of that denuded classic school of art which seems to have taken a last refuge in old english inns there were chippendale cabinets old bits of china and above all there were the beautiful oak bannisters to admire but these handsome staircases the china the wood carvings are all about the place to which the great traffic of the coaches from liverpool and manchester brought real prosperity for many years so that the modest little houses are full of worthy things of pretty doorways arched corners carved landings and mahogany doors to make the fortune of a dealer in bricbrac only that these are not bricbrac and this is their charm the staircases and chimneypieces are their own original selves the cupboards were made to dwell in their own particular niches and it is the passing generations who turn and unturn the keys as they go by our kind interpreter at knutsford patiently led us from one place to another sometimes we seemed to be in cranford greeting our visionary friends sometimes we were back in knutsford again looking at the homes of the people we had known in the fact rather than in the fancy and just as one sometimes sees traces of another place and time still showing in the streets of some new and busy town so every here and there seemed isolated signs and tokens of the visionary familiar city as it has been raised by the genius of its founder iii mrs gaskell was a very beautiful young woman i heard her described only the other day by a friend who remembered her in her youth she had a wellshaped head regular finelycut features her mien was bright and dignified almost joyous so my informant said and among her many other gifts was that of delightful companionship she was very young when she was married to the reverend william gaskell minister of the cross street unitarian chapel in manchester she was married from her aunts house at cranford at the parish church and not in the beautiful old unitarian chapel with its ivyclad walls and its latticed windows dating from oliver cromwells time in those days marriages were only solemnised in the parish church the young couple settled in their new home mrs gaskell cooperated with her husband in his work we are told and was always ready for any useful work of charity or helpfulness mr gaskell was one of those ministers whose congregations are outside as well as inside chapel walls for i have heard his name mentioned again and again by different people and always with affection and respect for some years after her marriage mrs gaskell lived a domestic life busy with her children and ordering her household and training her maids for which indeed she had a special gift then a terrible sorrow fell upon her and we know how she began to write to divert her mind from brooding upon the loss of her only son in she had finished that noble book mary barton that book with a sob in it as the french critic says ah quelle musique douloureuse dans un sanglot but there is something far beyond a sob in mary barton the writer is writing of what she has lived not only of what she has read or even looked at as she passed her way it is true she read adam smith and studied social politics but with that admirable blending of the imaginative and the practical qualities which was her gift she knows how to stir the dry skeleton to life and reach her readers hearts many books and novels dealing with the poor are touchingly expressed and finely conceived but somehow this particular gift of the spirit is wanting we admire the books without being ourselves absorbed by them it is the difference in short between the light of genius and the rays of the prism analysed calculated divided this power of living in the lives of others and calling others to share the emotion does not mean as people sometimes imagine that a writer copies textually from the world before her i have heard my father say that no author worth anything deliberately and as a rule copies the subject before him and so with mrs gaskell her early impressions were vivid and dear to her but her world though coloured by remembrance and sympathy was peopled by the fresh creations of her vivid imagination not by stale copies of the people she had known mary barton made a great and remarkable sensation carlyle landor miss edgeworth praised and applauded and nameless thousands also praised and read the noble outspoken book individuals may have complained so says the biographer from whom i have so often quoted but the work has unquestionably helped to make the manufacturing world very different from what it was forty years ago the same intuition which guided her along the pleasant country lanes made her at home in the teeming streets and crowded alleys of manchester a very interesting article by monsieur emile montgut written some thirty years ago pays a fine tribute to mrs gaskells striking exposition of the life amidst which so much of her own was passed to her depth of feeling to her moderation of statement the article also to my surprise gives an answer to the little riddle i was trying to solve in my own mind as to the difference between the world of cranford and that of miss austen each century possesses a force of its own says the critic one particular means of action to the exclusion of others it may be intelligence it may be passion it may be determination each rules in turn in the sixteenth century will prevailed and the character of the men and the martyrs of that time were in value far beyond their convictions in the eighteenth century on the contrary the ideas were worth more than the lives books and pamphlets were better than the men who wrote them what is the force says mr montgut of the age in which we ourselves are living it is certainly not will nor is it brilliant intelligence as in the days of voltaire it is a quality which for want of a better word we will call the force of sentiment people he continues have little confidence in systems a man with a hobby is immediately a butt but a man who is not obliged to be right in order to guard his vanity has but to describe in a few simple and true sentences some fact some moral wrong which needs redressing and see the effect and the silent help which immediately follows and for this reason it is that in literature we have seen of late the almost exclusive reign of fiction it is this quality of statement which we find in mrs gaskells books which distinguishes them from so many which preceded them and which gives them their influence it was because she had written mary barton that some deeper echoes reach us in cranford than are to be found in any of jane austens books delightful as they are young people read books to learn about their lives which are to come old people read them to forget the present there is yet another class of readers old and young who read to find expression to the indefinite unshaped feelings by which they are hauntedof all these will not each find response in the books of elizabeth gaskell in ruth in cousin phyllis in sylvias lovers in that last fine work which she never finished it must be remembered that mrs gaskell wrote in the great time of literature in the earlier part of the century it remains for readers of this later time to see how nobly she held her own among the masters of her craft she has done what we none of us could do said george sand to lord houghton she has written novels which excite the deepest interest in men of the world and yet which every girl will be the better for reading we all know what a friend mrs gaskell proved herself to charlotte bront and what happiness this friendship brought to the author of jane eyre mrs gaskell had the gift of giving out in a very remarkable degree miss bront as we all know was tortured and imprisoned by shyness she does not and cannot care for me for she does not know me how should she miss bront says writing of a child of mrs gaskell but that childs mother did charlotte bront justice and guessed by happy intuition at the treasure concealed in the unpretending casket mrs gaskell quotes a letter from miss bront in her life which is very characteristic of them both do you who have so many friends so large a circle of acquaintance find it easy when you sit down to write to isolate yourself from all those ties and their sweet associations so as to be your own woman uninfluenced or swayed by the consciousness of how your work may affect other minds what blame or what sympathy it may call forth does no luminous cloud ever come between you and the severe truth in your own secret or clearseeing soul this question is best answered by mrs gaskells own pages whether or not she found it easy i cannot say but that she did not isolate herself but did on the contrary entirely associate her own woman with the work of her life her readers can best realise her great natural gift and genius instinctively led her to the secret of things to the very soul of her race she must have felt its life and spirit too keenly indeed for her own happiness at times but how much has she not added to the sunshine of the world not long ago i found myself in mrs gaskells old home in manchester and the thought of the beautiful books created in those very rooms seemed to give life to the stones and to light up the grim manchester streets outside cranford was written in the house in plymouth grove as were almost all mrs gaskells books but when tired or overdone she used often to return to knutsford for rest and for refreshment sometimes in later life she stayed with her cousins the miss hollands whose traditions she wove into shape together with the quaint conceits and stories which are still told in knutsford it has its customs and oddities now just as when mrs gaskell was a girl i am told that the streets are sanded on certain days in pretty patterns all along the pavement there are temperance processions in which the immortal sedan chair still figures and i myself observed that some of the humbler bonnets formed quite an important feature in the scene while recollections of miss mattys successive caps seemed to float across ones mind it was delightful to hear the people of knutsford still speak of mrs gaskell and of the pleasure her visits always brought and the pleasure she always took in them of her long country drives with an old friend a doctor going his rounds twenty and thirty miles at a time of her talk and interest in all the details along the way she loved country things and farming things she always kept her cow even in manchester she understood the practical facts of life as well as its feelings i have heard of her tired and ill starting on a three mile walk on behalf of a poor dependent so as to make sure that some necessary help was properly administered there is one thrilling tradition of knutsford far too melodramatic for our cranford where the mere rumour of the housebreaker so alarmed mr mulliner this story is that of the highwayman higgins who lived in heath house and who kept his horses underground concealed in the cellar the highwayman must have enjoyed his lovely garden and his fine old staircase when he was not escaping by his secret passage i heard of one knutsford lady the other day greatly excited by some piece of newsno highway robbery but a wedding i believe to soothe herself she was obliged to have a dish of toasted cheese prepared and to send for a friend to play bezique and share the news and the dainty it might have been miss barker herself another little story amused us greatly so well was it told and so characteristic of all times old and new one of the young hollands born in the south was greatly interested in the family traditions and he came for a holiday to knutsford to see the old home of his fathers he looked all about knutsford and then went on to sandlebridge to call on the old farmer there and asked him many questions and begged him to show him all over the place and the old farmer kindly welcomed the young man for his parents and grandparents sake and said o yes master frank ill show you about ill show you wonderful things ill show you things will mak your hair stan on end coom along o me so they drove and they drove along the lanes and under the hedgerows and all the way the young man wondered what was coming until finally the old farmer who would not say a word beforehand stopped his horse and triumphantly pointed to the bran new red and yellow villas which had been built on alderley edge where he found such good custom for his butter and eggs and these were the wonderful things knutsford likes to associate itself with cranford in a desultory visionary sort of way one house claims miss mattys teashop the owner was standing in the doorway and he kindly brought us into the little wainscoted parlour with the window on the street through which aga jenkyns may have dispensed miss mattys stock of sugar plums here too was a pretty carved staircase and arches belonging to the early georges another most charming old house church house with the lovely garden where the children were gathering the apples and the gay flower beds were skirting the turf walk might almost have been the home of molly gibson and its present mistress said she liked to imagine her peeping out from the side window at the old coaches as they clattered through the town as i sate there drinking my tea i thought i could almost hear mrs gibson herself conversing spring primavera as the italians call it the lady was saying illustration page preface v chapter i our society

amazons all the holders of houses above a certain rent are women if a married couple come to settle in the town somehow the gentleman disappears he is either fairly frightened to death by being the only man in the cranford evening parties or he is accounted for by being with his regiment his ship or closely engaged in business all the week in the great neighbouring commercial town of drumble distant only twenty miles on a railroad in short whatever does become of the gentlemen they are not at cranford what could they do if they were there the surgeon has his round of thirty miles and sleeps at cranford but every man cannot be a surgeon for keeping the trim gardens full of choice flowers without a weed to speck them for frightening away little boys who look wistfully at the said flowers through the railings for rushing out at the geese that occasionally venture into the gardens if the gates are left open for deciding all questions of literature and politics without troubling themselves with unnecessary reasons or arguments for obtaining clear and correct knowledge of everybodys affairs in the parish for keeping their neat maidservants in admirable order for kindness somewhat dictatorial to the poor and real tender good offices to each other whenever they are in distressthe ladies of cranford are quite sufficient a man as one of them observed to me once is so in the way in the house although the ladies of cranford know all each others proceedings they are exceedingly indifferent to each others opinions indeed as each has her own individuality not to say eccentricity pretty strongly developed nothing is so easy as verbal retaliation but somehow goodwill reigns among them to a considerable degree the cranford ladies have only an occasional little quarrel spirted out in a few peppery words and angry jerks of the head just enough to prevent the even tenor of their lives from becoming too flat their dress is very independent of fashion as they observe what does it signify how we dress here at cranford where everybody knows us and if they go from home their reason is equally cogent what does it signify how we dress here where nobody knows us the materials of their clothes are in general good and plain and most of them are nearly as scrupulous as miss tyler of cleanly memory but i will answer for it the last gigot the last tight and scanty petticoat in wear in england was seen in cranfordand seen without a smile illustration a magnificent family red silk umbrella i can testify to a magnificent family red silk umbrella under which a gentle little spinster left alone of many brothers and sisters used to patter to church on rainy days have you any red silk umbrellas in london we had a tradition of the first that had ever been seen in cranford and the little boys mobbed it and called it a stick in petticoats it might have been the very red silk one i have described held by a strong father over a troop of little ones the poor little ladythe survivor of allcould scarcely carry it then there were rules and regulations for visiting and calls and they were announced to any young people who might be staying in the town with all the solemnity with which the old manx laws were read once a year on the tinwald mount our friends have sent to inquire how you are after your journey tonight my dear fifteen miles in a gentlemans carriage they will give you some rest tomorrow but the next day i have no doubt they will call so be at liberty after twelvefrom twelve to three are our callinghours then after they had called it is the third day i daresay your mamma has told you my dear never to let more than three days elapse between receiving a call and returning it and also that you are never to stay longer than a quarter of an hour but am i to look at my watch how am i to find out when a quarter of an hour has passed you must keep thinking about the time my dear and not allow yourself to forget it in conversation as everybody had this rule in their minds whether they received or paid a call of course no absorbing subject was ever spoken about we kept ourselves to short sentences of small talk and were punctual to our time i imagine that a few of the gentlefolks of cranford were poor and had some difficulty in making both ends meet but they were like the spartans and concealed their smart under a smiling face we none of us spoke of money because that subject savoured of commerce and trade and though some might be poor we were all aristocratic the cranfordians had that kindly esprit de corps which made them overlook all deficiencies in success when some among them tried to conceal their poverty when mrs forrester for instance gave a party in her babyhouse of a dwelling and the little maiden disturbed the ladies on the sofa by a request that she might get the teatray out from underneath every one took this novel proceeding as the most natural thing in the world and talked on about household forms and ceremonies as if we all believed that our hostess had a regular servants hall second table with housekeeper and steward instead of the one little charityschool maiden whose short ruddy arms could never have been strong enough to carry the tray upstairs if she had not been assisted in private by her mistress who now sat in state pretending not to know what cakes were sent up though she knew and we knew and she knew that we knew and we knew that she knew that we knew she had been busy all the morning making teabread and spongecakes there were one or two consequences arising from this general but unacknowledged poverty and this very much acknowledged gentility which were not amiss and which might be introduced into many circles of society to their great improvement for instance the inhabitants of cranford kept early hours and clattered home in their pattens under the guidance of a lanternbearer about nine oclock at night and the whole town was abed and asleep by halfpast ten moreover it was considered vulgar a tremendous word in cranford to give anything expensive in the way of eatable or drinkable at the evening entertainments wafer breadandbutter and spongebiscuits were all that the honourable mrs jamieson gave and she was sisterinlaw to the late earl of glenmire although she did practise such elegant economy illustration clattered home in their pattens elegant economy how naturally one falls back into the phraseology of cranford there economy was always elegant and moneyspending always vulgar and ostentatious a sort of sour grapism which made us very peaceful and satisfied i never shall forget the dismay felt when a certain captain brown came to live at cranford and openly spoke about his being poornot in a whisper to an intimate friend the doors and windows being previously closed but in the public street in a loud military voice alleging his poverty as a reason for not taking a particular house the ladies of cranford were already rather moaning over the invasion of their territories by a man and a gentleman he was a halfpay captain and had obtained some situation on a neighbouring railroad which had been vehemently petitioned against by the little town and if in addition to his masculine gender and his connection with the obnoxious railroad he was so brazen as to talk of being poorwhy then indeed he must be sent to coventry death was as true and as common as poverty yet people never spoke about that loud out in the streets it was a word not to be mentioned to ears polite we had tacitly agreed to ignore that any with whom we associated on terms of visiting equality could ever be prevented by poverty from doing anything that they wished if we walked to or from a party it was because the night was so fine or the air so refreshing not because sedan chairs were expensive if we wore prints instead of summer silks it was because we preferred a washing material and so on till we blinded ourselves to the vulgar fact that we were all of us people of very moderate means of course then we did not know what to make of a man who could speak of poverty as if it was not a disgrace yet somehow captain brown made himself respected in cranford and was called upon in spite of all resolutions to the contrary i was surprised to hear his opinions quoted as authority at a visit which i paid to cranford about a year after he had settled in the town my own friends had been among the bitterest opponents of any proposal to visit the captain and his daughters only twelve months before and now he was even admitted in the tabooed hours before twelve true it was to discover the cause of a smoking chimney before the fire was lighted but still captain brown walked upstairs nothing daunted spoke in a voice too large for the room and joked quite in the way of a tame man about the house he had been blind to all the small slights and omissions of trivial ceremonies with which he had been received he had been friendly though the cranford ladies had been cool he had answered small sarcastic compliments in good faith and with his manly frankness had overpowered all the shrinking which met him as a man who was not ashamed to be poor and at last his excellent masculine common sense and his facility in devising expedients to overcome domestic dilemmas had gained him an extraordinary place as authority among the cranford ladies he himself went on in his course as unaware of his popularity as he had been of the reverse and i am sure he was startled one day when he found his advice so highly esteemed as to make some counsel which he had given in jest to be taken in sober serious earnest it was on this subject an old lady had an alderney cow which she looked upon as a daughter you could not pay the short quarterofanhour call without being told of the wonderful milk or wonderful intelligence of this animal the whole town knew and kindly regarded miss betsy barkers alderney therefore great was the sympathy and regret when in an unguarded moment the poor cow tumbled into a limepit she moaned so loudly that she was soon heard and rescued but meanwhile the poor beast had lost most of her hair and came out looking naked cold and miserable in a bare skin everybody pitied the animal though a few could not restrain their smiles at her droll appearance miss betsy barker absolutely cried with sorrow and dismay and it was said she thought of trying a bath of oil this remedy perhaps was recommended by some one of the number whose advice she asked but the proposal if ever it was made was knocked on the head by captain browns decided get her a flannel waistcoat and flannel drawers maam if you wish to keep her alive but my advice is kill the poor creature at once illustration to see the alderney miss betsy barker dried her eyes and thanked the captain heartily she set to work and by and by all the town turned out to see the alderney meekly going to her pasture clad in dark gray flannel i have watched her myself many a time do you ever see cows dressed in gray flannel in london captain brown had taken a small house on the outskirts of the town where he lived with his two daughters he must have been upwards of sixty at the time of the first visit i paid to cranford after i had left it as a residence but he had a wiry welltrained elastic figure a stiff military throwback of his head and a springing step which made him appear much younger than he was his eldest daughter looked almost as old as himself and betrayed the fact that his real was more than his apparent age miss brown must have been forty she had a sickly pained careworn expression on her face and looked as if the gaiety of youth had long faded out of sight even when young she must have been plain and hardfeatured miss jessie brown was ten years younger than her sister and twenty shades prettier her face was round and dimpled miss jenkyns once said in a passion against captain brown the cause of which i will tell you presently that she thought it was time for miss jessie to leave off her dimples and not always to be trying to look like a child it was true there was something childlike in her face and there will be i think till she dies though she should live to a hundred her eyes were large blue wondering eyes looking straight at you her nose was unformed and snub and her lips were red and dewy she wore her hair too in little rows of curls which heightened this appearance i do not know whether she was pretty or not but i liked her face and so did everybody and i do not think she could help her dimples she had something of her fathers jauntiness of gait and manner and any female observer might detect a slight difference in the attire of the two sistersthat of miss jessie being about two pounds per annum more expensive than miss browns two pounds was a large sum in captain browns annual disbursements illustration sang out loud and joyfully such was the impression made upon me by the brown family when i first saw them all together in cranford church the captain i had met beforeon the occasion of the smoky chimney which he had cured by some simple alteration in the flue in church he held his double eyeglass to his eyes during the morning hymn and then lifted up his head erect and sang out loud and joyfully he made the responses louder than the clerkan old man with a piping feeble voice who i think felt aggrieved at the captains sonorous bass and quavered higher and higher in consequence illustration coming out of church on coming out of church the brisk captain paid the most gallant attention to his two daughters he nodded and smiled to his acquaintances but he shook hands with none until he had helped miss brown to unfurl her umbrella had relieved her of her prayerbook and had waited patiently till she with trembling nervous hands had taken up her gown to walk through the wet roads i wondered what the cranford ladies did with captain brown at their parties we had often rejoiced in former days that there was no gentleman to be attended to and to find conversation for at the cardparties we had congratulated ourselves upon the snugness of the evenings and in our love for gentility and distaste of mankind we had almost persuaded ourselves that to be a man was to be vulgar so that when i found my friend and hostess miss jenkyns was going to have a party in my honour and that captain and the miss browns were invited i wondered much what would be the course of the evening cardtables with greenbaize tops were set out by daylight just as usual it was the third week in november so the evenings closed in about four candles and clean packs of cards were arranged on each table the fire was made up the neat maidservant had received her last directions and there we stood dressed in our best each with a candlelighter in our hands ready to dart at the candles as soon as the first knock came parties in cranford were solemn festivities making the ladies feel gravely elated as they sat together in their best dresses as soon as three had arrived we sat down to preference i being the unlucky fourth the next four comers were put down immediately to another table and presently the teatrays which i had seen set out in the storeroom as i passed in the morning were placed each on the middle of a cardtable the china was delicate eggshell the oldfashioned silver glittered with polishing but the eatables were of the slightest description while the trays were yet on the tables captain and the miss browns came in and i could see that somehow or other the captain was a favourite with all the ladies present ruffled brows were smoothed sharp voices lowered at his approach miss brown looked ill and depressed almost to gloom miss jessie smiled as usual and seemed nearly as popular as her father he immediately and quietly assumed the mans place in the room attended to every ones wants lessened the pretty maidservants labour by waiting on empty cups and breadandbutterless ladies and yet did it all in so easy and dignified a manner and so much as if it were a matter of course for the strong to attend to the weak that he was a true man throughout he played for threepenny points with as grave an interest as if they had been pounds and yet in all his attention to strangers he had an eye on his suffering daughterfor suffering i was sure she was though to many eyes she might only appear to be irritable miss jessie could not play cards but she talked to the sittersout who before her coming had been rather inclined to be cross she sang too to an old cracked piano which i think had been a spinnet in its youth miss jessie sang jock o hazeldean a little out of tune but we were none of us musical though miss jenkyns beat time out of time by way of appearing to be so it was very good of miss jenkyns to do this for i had seen that a little before she had been a good deal annoyed by miss jessie browns unguarded admission propos of shetland wool that she had an uncle her mothers brother who was a shopkeeper in edinburgh miss jenkyns tried to drown this confession by a terrible coughfor the honourable mrs jamieson was sitting at the cardtable nearest miss jessie and what would she say or think if she found out she was in the same room with a shopkeepers niece but miss jessie brown who had no tact as we all agreed the next morning would repeat the information and assure miss pole she could easily get her the identical shetland wool required through my uncle who has the best assortment of shetland goods of any one in edinbro it was to take the taste of this out of our mouths and the sound of this out of our ears that miss jenkyns proposed music so i say again it was very good of her to beat time to the song when the trays reappeared with biscuits and wine punctually at a quarter to nine there was conversation comparing of cards and talking over tricks but by and by captain brown sported a bit of literature have you seen any numbers of the pickwick papers said he they were then publishing in parts capital thing now miss jenkyns was daughter of a deceased rector of cranford and on the strength of a number of manuscript sermons and a pretty good library of divinity considered herself literary and looked upon any conversation about books as a challenge to her so she answered and said yes she had seen them indeed she might say she had read them and what do you think of them exclaimed captain brown arent they famously good so urged miss jenkyns could not but speak i must say i dont think they are by any means equal to dr johnson still perhaps the author is young let him persevere and who knows what he may become if he will take the great doctor for his model this was evidently too much for captain brown to take placidly and i saw the words on the tip of his tongue before miss jenkyns had finished her sentence it is quite a different sort of thing my dear madam he began illustration the account of the swarry i am quite aware of that returned she and i make allowances captain brown just allow me to read you a scene out of this months number pleaded he i had it only this morning and i dont think the company can have read it yet as you please said she settling herself with an air of resignation he read the account of the swarry which sam weller gave at bath some of us laughed heartily i did not dare because i was staying in the house miss jenkyns sat in patient gravity when it was ended she turned to me and said with mild dignity fetch me rasselas my dear out of the bookroom when i brought it to her she turned to captain brown now allow me to read you a scene and then the present company can judge between your favourite mr boz and dr johnson she read one of the conversations between rasselas and imlac in a highpitched majestic voice and when she had ended she said i imagine i am now justified in my preference of dr johnson as a writer of fiction the captain screwed his lips up and drummed on the table but he did not speak she thought she would give a finishing blow or two i consider it vulgar and below the dignity of literature to publish in numbers how was the rambler published maam asked captain brown in a low voice which i think miss jenkyns could not have heard dr johnsons style is a model for young beginners my father recommended it to me when i began to write lettersi have formed my own style upon it i recommend it to your favourite i should be very sorry for him to exchange his style for any such pompous writing said captain brown miss jenkyns felt this as a personal affront in a way of which the captain had not dreamed epistolary writing she and her friends considered as her forte many a copy of many a letter have i seen written and corrected on the slate before she seized the halfhour just previous to posttime to assure her friends of this or of that and dr johnson was as she said her model in these compositions she drew herself up with dignity and only replied to captain browns last remark by saying with marked emphasis on every syllable i prefer dr johnson to mr boz it is saidi wont vouch for the factthat captain brown was heard to say sotto voce dn dr johnson if he did he was penitent afterwards as he showed by going to stand near miss jenkynss armchair and endeavouring to beguile her into conversation on some more pleasing subject but she was inexorable the next day she made the remark i have mentioned about miss jessies dimples illustration chapter tailpiece illustration chapter the captain it was impossible to live a month at cranford and not know the daily habits of each resident and long before my visit was ended i knew much concerning the whole brown trio there was nothing new to be discovered respecting their poverty for they had spoken simply and openly about that from the very first they made no mystery of the necessity for their being economical all that remained to be discovered was the captains infinite kindness of heart and the various modes in which unconsciously to himself he manifested it some little anecdotes were talked about for some time after they occurred as we did not read much and as all the ladies were pretty well suited with servants there was a dearth of subjects for conversation we therefore discussed the circumstance of the captain taking a poor old womans dinner out of her hands one very slippery sunday he had met her returning from the bakehouse as he came from church and noticed her precarious footing and with the grave dignity with which he did everything he relieved her of her burden and steered along the street by her side carrying her baked mutton and potatoes safely home this was thought very eccentric and it was rather expected that he would pay a round of calls on the monday morning to explain and apologise to the cranford sense of propriety but he did no such thing and then it was decided that he was ashamed and was keeping out of sight in a kindly pity for him we began to say after all the sunday mornings occurrence showed great goodness of heart and it was resolved that he should be comforted on his next appearance amongst us but lo he came down upon us untouched by any sense of shame speaking loud and bass as ever his head thrown back his wig as jaunty and wellcurled as usual and we were obliged to conclude he had forgotten all about sunday illustration carrying her baked mutton and potatoes miss pole and miss jessie brown had set up a kind of intimacy on the strength of the shetland wool and the new knitting stitches so it happened that when i went to visit miss pole i saw more of the browns than i had done while staying with miss jenkyns who had never got over what she called captain browns disparaging remarks upon dr johnson as a writer of light and agreeable fiction i found that miss brown was seriously ill of some lingering incurable complaint the pain occasioned by which gave the uneasy expression to her face that i had taken for unmitigated crossness cross too she was at times when the nervous irritability occasioned by her disease became past endurance miss jessie bore with her at these times even more patiently than she did with the bitter selfupbraidings by which they were invariably succeeded miss brown used to accuse herself not merely of hasty and irritable temper but also of being the cause why her father and sister were obliged to pinch in order to allow her the small luxuries which were necessaries in her condition she would so fain have made sacrifices for them and have lightened their cares that the original generosity of her disposition added acerbity to her temper all this was borne by miss jessie and her father with more than placiditywith absolute tenderness i forgave miss jessie her singing out of tune and her juvenility of dress when i saw her at home i came to perceive that captain browns dark brutus wig and padded coat alas too often threadbare were remnants of the military smartness of his youth which he now wore unconsciously he was a man of infinite resources gained in his barrack experience as he confessed no one could black his boots to please him except himself but indeed he was not above saving the little maidservants labours in every wayknowing most likely that his daughters illness made the place a hard one illustration no one could black his boots except himself he endeavoured to make peace with miss jenkyns soon after the memorable dispute i have named by a present of a wooden fireshovel his own making having heard her say how much the grating of an iron one annoyed her she received the present with cool gratitude and thanked him formally when he was gone she bade me put it away in the lumberroom feeling probably that no present from a man who preferred mr boz to dr johnson could be less jarring than an iron fireshovel illustration miss jenkyns such was the state of things when i left cranford and went to drumble i had however several correspondents who kept me au fait as to the proceedings of the dear little town there was miss pole who was becoming as much absorbed in crochet as she had been once in knitting and the burden of whose letter was something like but dont you forget the white worsted at flints of the old song for at the end of every sentence of news came a fresh direction as to some crochet commission which i was to execute for her miss matilda jenkyns who did not mind being called miss matty when miss jenkyns was not by wrote nice kind rambling letters now and then venturing into an opinion of her own but suddenly pulling herself up and either begging me not to name what she had said as deborah thought differently and she knew or else putting in a postscript to the effect that since writing the above she had been talking over the subject with deborah and was quite convinced that etchere probably followed a recantation of every opinion she had given in the letter then came miss jenkynsdebrah as she liked miss matty to call her her father having once said that the hebrew name ought to be so pronounced i secretly think she took the hebrew prophetess for a model in character and indeed she was not unlike the stern prophetess in some ways making allowance of course for modern customs and difference in dress miss jenkyns wore a cravat and a little bonnet like a jockeycap and altogether had the appearance of a strongminded woman although she would have despised the modern idea of women being equal to men equal indeed she knew they were superior but to return to her letters everything in them was stately and grand like herself i have been looking them over dear miss jenkyns how i honoured her and i will give an extract more especially because it relates to our friend captain brown the honourable mrs jamieson has only just quitted me and in the course of conversation she communicated to me the intelligence that she had yesterday received a call from her revered husbands quondam friend lord mauleverer you will not easily conjecture what brought his lordship within the precincts of our little town it was to see captain brown with whom it appears his lordship was acquainted in the plumed wars and who had the privilege of averting destruction from his lordships head when some great peril was impending over it off the misnomered cape of good hope you know our friend the honourable mrs jamiesons deficiency in the spirit of innocent curiosity and you will therefore not be so much surprised when i tell you she was quite unable to disclose to me the exact nature of the peril in question i was anxious i confess to ascertain in what manner captain brown with his limited establishment could receive so distinguished a guest and i discovered that his lordship retired to rest and let us hope to refreshing slumbers at the angel hotel but shared the brunonian meals during the two days that he honoured cranford with his august presence mrs johnson our civil butchers wife informs me that miss jessie purchased a leg of lamb but besides this i can hear of no preparation whatever to give a suitable reception to so distinguished a visitor perhaps they entertained him with the feast of reason and the flow of soul and to us who are acquainted with captain browns sad want of relish for the pure wells of english undefiled it may be matter for congratulation that he has had the opportunity of improving his taste by holding converse with an elegant and refined member of the british aristocracy but from some mundane failings who is altogether free illustration one with whom his lordship held conversation miss pole and miss matty wrote to me by the same post such a piece of news as lord mauleverers visit was not to be lost on the cranford letterwriters they made the most of it miss matty humbly apologised for writing at the same time as her sister who was so much more capable than she to describe the honour done to cranford but in spite of a little bad spelling miss mattys account gave me the best idea of the commotion occasioned by his lordships visit after it had occurred for except the people at the angel the browns mrs jamieson and a little lad his lordship had sworn at for driving a dirty hoop against the aristocratic legs i could not hear of any one with whom his lordship had held conversation my next visit to cranford was in the summer there had been neither births deaths nor marriages since i was there last everybody lived in the same house and wore pretty nearly the same wellpreserved oldfashioned clothes the greatest event was that the miss jenkynses had purchased a new carpet for the drawingroom oh the busy work miss matty and i had in chasing the sunbeams as they fell in an afternoon right down on this carpet through the blindless window we spread newspapers over the places and sat down to our book or our work and lo in a quarter of an hour the sun had moved and was blazing away on a fresh spot and down again we went on our knees to alter the position of the newspapers we were very busy too one whole morning before miss jenkyns gave her party in following her directions and in cutting out and stitching together pieces of newspaper so as to form little paths to every chair set for the expected visitors lest their shoes might dirty or defile the purity of the carpet do you make paper paths for every guest to walk upon in london captain brown and miss jenkyns were not very cordial to each other the literary dispute of which i had seen the beginning was a raw the slightest touch on which made them wince it was the only difference of opinion they had ever had but that difference was enough miss jenkyns could not refrain from talking at captain brown and though he did not reply he drummed with his fingers which action she felt and resented as very disparaging to dr johnson he was rather ostentatious in his preference of the writings of mr boz would walk through the streets so absorbed in them that he all but ran against miss jenkyns and though his apologies were earnest and sincere and though he did not in fact do more than startle her and himself she owned to me she had rather he had knocked her down if he had only been reading a higher style of literature the poor brave captain he looked older and more worn and his clothes were very threadbare but he seemed as bright and cheerful as ever unless he was asked about his daughters health she suffers a great deal and she must suffer more we do what we can to alleviate her paingods will be done he took off his hat at these last words i found from miss matty that everything had been done in fact a medical man of high repute in that country neighbourhood had been sent for and every injunction he had given was attended to regardless of expense miss matty was sure they denied themselves many things in order to make the invalid comfortable but they never spoke about it and as for miss jessiei really think shes an angel said poor miss matty quite overcome to see her way of bearing with miss browns crossness and the bright face she puts on after shes been sitting up a whole night and scolded above half of it is quite beautiful yet she looks as neat and as ready to welcome the captain at breakfasttime as if she had been asleep in the queens bed all night my dear you could never laugh at her prim little curls or her pink bows again if you saw her as i have done i could only feel very penitent and greet miss jessie with double respect when i met her next she looked faded and pinched and her lips began to quiver as if she was very weak when she spoke of her sister but she brightened and sent back the tears that were glittering in her pretty eyes as she said but to be sure what a town cranford is for kindness i dont suppose any one has a better dinner than usual cooked but the best part of all comes in a little covered basin for my sister the poor people will leave their earliest vegetables at our door for her they speak short and gruff as if they were ashamed of it but i am sure it often goes to my heart to see their thoughtfulness the tears now came back and overflowed but after a minute or two she began to scold herself and ended by going away the same cheerful miss jessie as ever but why does not this lord mauleverer do something for the man who saved his life said i why you see unless captain brown has some reason for it he never speaks about being poor and he walked along by his lordship looking as happy and cheerful as a prince and as they never called attention to their dinner by apologies and as miss brown was better that day and all seemed bright i daresay his lordship never knew how much care there was in the background he did send game in the winter pretty often but now he is gone abroad i had often occasion to notice the use that was made of fragments and small opportunities in cranford the roseleaves that were gathered ere they fell to make into a potpourri for some one who had no garden the little bundles of lavenderflowers sent to strew the drawers of some towndweller or to burn in the chamber of some invalid things that many would despise and actions which it seemed scarcely worth while to perform were all attended to in cranford miss jenkyns stuck an apple full of cloves to be heated and smell pleasantly in miss browns room and as she put in each clove she uttered a johnsonian sentence indeed she never could think of the browns without talking johnson and as they were seldom absent from her thoughts just then i heard many a rolling threepiled sentence captain brown called one day to thank miss jenkyns for many little kindnesses which i did not know until then that she had rendered he had suddenly become like an old man his deep bass voice had a quavering in it his eyes looked dim and the lines on his face were deep he did notcould notspeak cheerfully of his daughters state but he talked with manly pious resignation and not much twice over he said what jessie has been to us god only knows and after the second time he got up hastily shook hands all round without speaking and left the room that afternoon we perceived little groups in the street all listening with faces aghast to some tale or other miss jenkyns wondered what could be the matter for some time before she took the undignified step of sending jenny out to inquire jenny came back with a white face of terror oh maam oh miss jenkyns maam captain brown is killed by them nasty cruel railroads and she burst into tears she along with many others had experienced the poor captains kindness howwherewhere good god jenny dont waste time in crying but tell us something miss matty rushed out into the street at once and collared the man who was telling the tale illustration and he shuddered at the recollection come income to my sister at oncemiss jenkyns the rectors daughter oh man mansay it is not true she cried as she brought the affrighted carter sleeking down his hair into the drawingroom where he stood with his wet boots on the new carpet and no one regarded it please mum it is true i seed it myself and he shuddered at the recollection the captain was areading some new book as he was deep in awaiting for the down train and there was a little lass as wanted to come to its mammy and gave its sister the slip and came toddling across the line and he looked up sudden at the sound of the train coming and seed the child and he darted on the line and cotched it up and his foot slipped and the train came over him in no time oh lord lord mum its quite trueand theyve come over to tell his daughters the childs safe though with only a bang on its shoulder as he threw it to its mammy poor captain would be glad of that mum wouldnt he god bless him the great rough carter puckered up his manly face and turned away to hide his tears i turned to miss jenkyns she looked very ill as if she were going to faint and signed to me to open the window matilda bring me my bonnet i must go to those girls god pardon me if ever i have spoken contemptuously to the captain miss jenkyns arrayed herself to go out telling miss matilda to give the man a glass of wine while she was away miss matty and i huddled over the fire talking in a low and awestruck voice i know we cried quietly all the time miss jenkyns came home in a silent mood and we durst not ask her many questions she told us that miss jessie had fainted and that she and miss pole had had some difficulty in bringing her round but that as soon as she recovered she begged one of them to go and sit with her sister mr hoggins says she cannot live many days and she shall be spared this shock said miss jessie shivering with feelings to which she dared not give way but how can you manage my dear asked miss jenkyns you cannot bear up she must see your tears god will help mei will not give wayshe was asleep when the news came she may be asleep yet she would be so utterly miserable not merely at my fathers death but to think of what would become of me she is so good to me she looked up earnestly in their faces with her soft true eyes and miss pole told miss jenkyns afterwards she could hardly bear it knowing as she did how miss brown treated her sister however it was settled according to miss jessies wish miss brown was to be told her father had been summoned to take a short journey on railway business they had managed it in some waymiss jenkyns could not exactly say how miss pole was to stop with miss jessie mrs jamieson had sent to inquire and this was all we heard that night and a sorrowful night it was the next day a full account of the fatal accident was in the county paper which miss jenkyns took in her eyes were very weak she said and she asked me to read it when i came to the gallant gentleman was deeply engaged in the perusal of a number of pickwick which he had just received miss jenkyns shook her head long and solemnly and then sighed out poor dear infatuated man the corpse was to be taken from the station to the parish church there to be interred miss jessie had set her heart on following it to the grave and no dissuasives could alter her resolve her restraint upon herself made her almost obstinate she resisted all miss poles entreaties and miss jenkynss advice at last miss jenkyns gave up the point and after a silence which i feared portended some deep displeasure against miss jessie miss jenkyns said she should accompany the latter to the funeral it is not fit for you to go alone it would be against both propriety and humanity were i to allow it miss jessie seemed as if she did not half like this arrangement but her obstinacy if she had any had been exhausted in her determination to go to the interment she longed poor thing i have no doubt to cry alone over the grave of the dear father to whom she had been all in all and to give way for one little halfhour uninterrupted by sympathy and unobserved by friendship but it was not to be that afternoon miss jenkyns sent out for a yard of black crape and employed herself busily in trimming the little black silk bonnet i have spoken about when it was finished she put it on and looked at us for approbationadmiration she despised i was full of sorrow but by one of those whimsical thoughts which come unbidden into our heads in times of deepest grief i no sooner saw the bonnet than i was reminded of a helmet and in that hybrid bonnet halfhelmet halfjockey cap did miss jenkyns attend captain browns funeral and i believe supported miss jessie with a tender indulgent firmness which was invaluable allowing her to weep her passionate fill before they left miss pole miss matty and i meanwhile attended to miss brown and hard work we found it to relieve her querulous and neverending complaints but if we were so weary and dispirited what must miss jessie have been yet she came back almost calm as if she had gained a new strength she put off her mourning dress and came in looking pale and gentle thanking us each with a soft long pressure of the hand she could even smilea faint sweet wintry smileas if to reassure us of her power to endure but her look made our eyes fill suddenly with tears more than if she had cried outright it was settled that miss pole was to remain with her all the watching livelong night and that miss matty and i were to return in the morning to relieve them and give miss jessie the opportunity for a few hours of sleep but when the morning came miss jenkyns appeared at the breakfasttable equipped in her helmetbonnet and ordered miss matty to stay at home as she meant to go and help to nurse she was evidently in a state of great friendly excitement which she showed by eating her breakfast standing and scolding the household all round no nursingno energetic strongminded woman could help miss brown now there was that in the room as we entered which was stronger than us all and made us shrink into solemn awestruck helplessness miss brown was dying we hardly knew her voice it was so devoid of the complaining tone we had always associated with it miss jessie told me afterwards that it and her face too were just what they had been formerly when her mothers death left her the young anxious head of the family of whom only miss jessie survived she was conscious of her sisters presence though not i think of ours we stood a little behind the curtain miss jessie knelt with her face near her sisters in order to catch the last soft awful whispers oh jessie jessie how selfish i have been god forgive me for letting you sacrifice yourself for me as you did i have so loved youand yet i have thought only of myself god forgive me hush love hush said miss jessie sobbing and my father my dear dear father i will not complain now if god will give me strength to be patient but oh jessie tell my father how i longed and yearned to see him at last and to ask his forgiveness he can never know now how i loved himoh if i might but tell him before i die what a life of sorrow his has been and i have done so little to cheer him a light came into miss jessies face would it comfort you dearest to think that he does knowwould it comfort you love to know that his cares his sorrows her voice quivered but she steadied it into calmnessmary he has gone before you to the place where the weary are at rest he knows now how you loved him a strange look which was not distress came over miss browns face she did not speak for some time but then we saw her lips form the words rather than heard the soundfather mother harry archythen as if it were a new idea throwing a filmy shadow over her darkened mindbut you will be alone jessie miss jessie had been feeling this all during the silence i think for the tears rolled down her cheeks like rain at these words and she could not answer at first then she put her hands together tight and lifted them up and saidbut not to us though he slay me yet will i trust in him in a few moments more miss brown lay calm and stillnever to sorrow or murmur more after this second funeral miss jenkyns insisted that miss jessie should come to stay with her rather than go back to the desolate house which in fact we learned from miss jessie must now be given up as she had not wherewithal to maintain it she had something above twenty pounds ayear besides the interest of the money for which the furniture would sell but she could not live upon that and so we talked over her qualifications for earning money i can sew neatly said she and i like nursing i think too i could manage a house if any one would try me as housekeeper or i would go into a shop as saleswoman if they would have patience with me at first miss jenkyns declared in an angry voice that she should do no such thing and talked to herself about some people having no idea of their rank as a captains daughter nearly an hour afterwards when she brought miss jessie up a basin of delicatelymade arrowroot and stood over her like a dragoon until the last spoonful was finished then she disappeared miss jessie began to tell me some more of the plans which had suggested themselves to her and insensibly fell into talking of the days that were past and gone and interested me so much i neither knew nor heeded how time passed we were both startled when miss jenkyns reappeared and caught us crying i was afraid lest she would be displeased as she often said that crying hindered digestion and i knew she wanted miss jessie to get strong but instead she looked queer and excited and fidgeted round us without saying anything at last she spoke i have been so much startledno ive not been at all startleddont mind me my dear miss jessieive been very much surprisedin fact ive had a caller whom you knew once my dear miss jessie miss jessie went very white then flushed scarlet and looked eagerly at miss jenkyns a gentleman my dear who wants to know if you would see him is itit is not stammered out miss jessieand got no farther this is his card said miss jenkyns giving it to miss jessie and while her head was bent over it miss jenkyns went through a series of winks and odd faces to me and formed her lips into a long sentence of which of course i could not understand a word may he come up asked miss jenkyns at last illustration he shook hands with miss jessie oh yes certainly said miss jessie as much as to say this is your house you may show any visitor where you like she took up some knitting of miss mattys and began to be very busy though i could see how she trembled all over miss jenkyns rang the bell and told the servant who answered it to show major gordon upstairs and presently in walked a tall fine franklooking man of forty or upwards he shook hands with miss jessie but he could not see her eyes she kept them so fixed on the ground miss jenkyns asked me if i would come and help her to tie up the preserves in the storeroom and though miss jessie plucked at my gown and even looked up at me with begging eye i durst not refuse to go where miss jenkyns asked instead of tying up preserves in the storeroom however we went to talk in the diningroom and there miss jenkyns told me what major gordon had told herhow he had served in the same regiment with captain brown and had become acquainted with miss jessie then a sweetlooking blooming girl of eighteen how the acquaintance had grown into love on his part though it had been some years before he had spoken how on becoming possessed through the will of an uncle of a good estate in scotland he had offered and been refused though with so much agitation and evident distress that he was sure she was not indifferent to him and how he had discovered that the obstacle was the fell disease which was even then too surely threatening her sister she had mentioned that the surgeons foretold intense suffering and there was no one but herself to nurse her poor mary or cheer and comfort her father during the time of illness they had had long discussions and on her refusal to pledge herself to him as his wife when all should be over he had grown angry and broken off entirely and gone abroad believing that she was a coldhearted person whom he would do well to forget he had been travelling in the east and was on his return home when at rome he saw the account of captain browns death in galignani just then miss matty who had been out all the morning and had only lately returned to the house burst in with a face of dismay and outraged propriety oh goodness me she said deborah theres a gentleman sitting in the drawingroom with his arm round miss jessies waist miss mattys eyes looked large with terror miss jenkyns snubbed her down in an instant the most proper place in the world for his arm to be in go away matilda and mind your own business this from her sister who had hitherto been a model of feminine decorum was a blow for poor miss matty and with a double shock she left the room the last time i ever saw poor miss jenkyns was many years after this mrs gordon had kept up a warm and affectionate intercourse with all at cranford miss jenkyns miss matty and miss pole had all been to visit her and returned with wonderful accounts of her house her husband her dress and her looks for with happiness something of her early bloom returned she had been a year or two younger than we had taken her for her eyes were always lovely and as mrs gordon her dimples were not out of place at the time to which i have referred when i last saw miss jenkyns that lady was old and feeble and had lost something of her strong mind little flora gordon was staying with the misses jenkyns and when i came in she was reading aloud to miss jenkyns who lay feeble and changed on the sofa flora put down the rambler when i came in ah said miss jenkyns you find me changed my dear i cant see as i used to do if flora were not here to read to me i hardly know how i should get through the day did you ever read the rambler its a wonderful bookwonderful and the most improving reading for flora which i daresay it would have been if she could have read half the words without spelling and could have understood the meaning of a third better than that strange old book with the queer name poor captain brown was killed for readingthat book by mr boz you knowold poz when i was a girlbut thats a long time agoi acted lucy in old poz she babbled on long enough for flora to get a good long spell at the christmas carol which miss matty had left on the table illustration illustration chapter a love affair of long ago i thought probably my connection with cranford would cease after miss jenkynss death at least that it would have to be kept up by correspondence which bears much the same relation to personal intercourse that the books of dried plants i sometimes see hortus siccus i think they call the thing do to the living and fresh flowers in the lanes and meadows i was pleasantly surprised therefore by receiving a letter from miss pole who had always come in for a supplementary week after my annual visit to miss jenkyns proposing that i should go and stay with her and then in a couple of days after my acceptance came a note from miss matty in which in a rather circuitous and very humble manner she told me how much pleasure i should confer if i could spend a week or two with her either before or after i had been at miss poles for she said since my dear sisters death i am well aware i have no attractions to offer it is only to the kindness of my friends that i can owe their company of course i promised to come to dear miss matty as soon as i had ended my visit to miss pole and the day after my arrival at cranford i went to see her much wondering what the house would be like without miss jenkyns and rather dreading the changed aspect of things miss matty began to cry as soon as she saw me she was evidently nervous from having anticipated my call i comforted her as well as i could and i found the best consolation i could give was the honest praise that came from my heart as i spoke of the deceased miss matty slowly shook her head over each virtue as it was named and attributed to her sister and at last she could not restrain the tears which had long been silently flowing but hid her face behind her handkerchief and sobbed aloud dear miss matty said i taking her handfor indeed i did not know in what way to tell her how sorry i was for her left deserted in the world she put down her handkerchief and said my dear id rather you did not call me matty she did not like it but i did many a thing she did not like im afraidand now shes gone if you please my love will you call me matilda i promised faithfully and began to practise the new name with miss pole that very day and by degrees miss matildas feeling on the subject was known through cranford and we all tried to drop the more familiar name but with so little success that by and by we gave up the attempt illustration if you please my love will you call me matilda my visit to miss pole was very quiet miss jenkyns had so long taken the lead in cranford that now she was gone they hardly knew how to give a party the honourable mrs jamieson to whom miss jenkyns herself had always yielded the post of honour was fat and inert and very much at the mercy of her old servants if they chose that she should give a party they reminded her of the necessity for so doing if not she let it alone there was all the more time for me to hear oldworld stories from miss pole while she sat knitting and i making my fathers shirts i always took a quantity of plain sewing to cranford for as we did not read much or walk much i found it a capital time to get through my work one of miss poles stories related to a shadow of a love affair that was dimly perceived or suspected long years before presently the time arrived when i was to remove to miss matildas house i found her timid and anxious about the arrangements for my comfort many a time while i was unpacking did she come backwards and forwards to stir the fire which burned all the worse for being so frequently poked have you drawers enough dear asked she i dont know exactly how my sister used to arrange them she had capital methods i am sure she would have trained a servant in a week to make a better fire than this and fanny has been with me four months illustration so as to throw the shadow on the clock face this subject of servants was a standing grievance and i could not wonder much at it for if gentlemen were scarce and almost unheard of in the genteel society of cranford they or their counterpartshandsome young menabounded in the lower classes the pretty neat servantmaids had their choice of desirable followers and their mistresses without having the sort of mysterious dread of men and matrimony that miss matilda had might well feel a little anxious lest the heads of their comely maids should be turned by the joiner or the butcher or the gardener who were obliged by their callings to come to the house and who as illluck would have it were generally handsome and unmarried fannys lovers if she had anyand miss matilda suspected her of so many flirtations that if she had not been very pretty i should have doubted her having onewere a constant anxiety to her mistress she was forbidden by the articles of her engagement to have followers and though she had answered innocently enough doubling up the hem of her apron as she spoke please maam i never had more than one at a time miss matty prohibited that one but a vision of a man seemed to haunt the kitchen fanny assured me that it was all fancy or else i should have said myself that i had seen a mans coattails whisk into the scullery once when i went on an errand into the storeroom at night and another evening when our watches having stopped i went to look at the clock there was a very odd appearance singularly like a young man squeezed up between the clock and the back of the open kitchen door and i thought fanny snatched up the candle very hastily so as to throw the shadow on the clock face while she very positively told me the time half an hour too early as we found out afterwards by the church clock but i did not add to miss mattys anxieties by naming my suspicions especially as fanny said to me the next day that it was such a queer kitchen for having odd shadows about it she really was almost afraid to stay for you know miss she addedi dont see a creature from six oclock tea till missus rings the bell for prayers at ten however it so fell out that fanny had to leave and miss matilda begged me to stay and settle her with the new maid to which i consented after i had heard from my father that he did not want me at home the new servant was a rough honestlooking country girl who had only lived in a farm place before but i liked her looks when she came to be hired and i promised miss matilda to put her in the ways of the house the said ways were religiously such as miss matilda thought her sister would approve many a domestic rule and regulation had been a subject of plaintive whispered murmur to me during miss jenkynss life but now that she was gone i do not think that even i who was a favourite durst have suggested an alteration to give an instance we constantly adhered to the forms which were observed at meal times in my father the rectors house accordingly we had always wine and dessert but the decanters were only filled when there was a party and what remained was seldom touched though we had two wine glasses apiece every day after dinner until the next festive occasion arrived when the state of the remainder wine was examined into in a family council the dregs were often given to the poor but occasionally when a good deal had been left at the last party five months ago it might be it was added to some of a fresh bottle brought up from the cellar i fancy poor captain brown did not much like wine for i noticed he never finished his first glass and most military men take several then as to our dessert miss jenkyns used to gather currants and gooseberries for it herself which i sometimes thought would have tasted better fresh from the trees but then as miss jenkyns observed there would have been nothing for dessert in summertime as it was we felt very genteel with our two glasses apiece and a dish of gooseberries at the top of currants and biscuits at the sides and two decanters at the bottom when oranges came in a curious proceeding was gone through miss jenkyns did not like to cut the fruit for as she observed the juice all ran out nobody knew where sucking only i think she used some more recondite word was in fact the only way of enjoying oranges but then there was the unpleasant association with a ceremony frequently gone through by little babies and so after dessert in orange season miss jenkyns and miss matty used to rise up possess themselves each of an orange in silence and withdraw to the privacy of their own rooms to indulge in sucking oranges i had once or twice tried on such occasions to prevail on miss matty to stay and had succeeded in her sisters lifetime i held up a screen and did not look and as she said she tried not to make the noise very offensive but now that she was left alone she seemed quite horrified when i begged her to remain with me in the warm diningparlour and enjoy her orange as she liked best and so it was in everything miss jenkynss rules were made more stringent than ever because the framer of them was gone where there could be no appeal in all things else miss matilda was meek and undecided to a fault i have heard fanny turn her round twenty times in a morning about dinner just as the little hussy chose and i sometimes fancied she worked on miss matildas weakness in order to bewilder her and to make her feel more in the power of her clever servant i determined that i would not leave her till i had seen what sort of a person martha was and if i found her trustworthy i would tell her not to trouble her mistress with every little decision martha was blunt and plainspoken to a fault otherwise she was a brisk wellmeaning but very ignorant girl she had not been with us a week before miss matilda and i were astounded one morning by the receipt of a letter from a cousin of hers who had been twenty or thirty years in india and who had lately as we had seen by the army list returned to england bringing with him an invalid wife who had never been introduced to her english relations major jenkyns wrote to propose that he and his wife should spend a night at cranford on his way to scotlandat the inn if it did not suit miss matilda to receive them into her house in which case they should hope to be with her as much as possible during the day of course it must suit her as she said for all cranford knew that she had her sisters bedroom at liberty but i am sure she wished the major had stopped in india and forgotten his cousins out and out oh how must i manage asked she helplessly if deborah had been alive she would have known what to do with a gentlemanvisitor must i put razors in his dressingroom dear dear and ive got none deborah would have had them and slippers and coatbrushes i suggested that probably he would bring all these things with him and after dinner how am i to know when to get up and leave him to his wine deborah would have done it so well she would have been quite in her element will he want coffee do you think i undertook the management of the coffee and told her i would instruct martha in the art of waitingin which it must be owned she was terribly deficientand that i had no doubt major and mrs jenkyns would understand the quiet mode in which a lady lived by herself in a country town but she was sadly fluttered i made her empty her decanters and bring up two fresh bottles of wine i wished i could have prevented her from being present at my instructions to martha for she frequently cut in with some fresh direction muddling the poor girls mind as she stood openmouthed listening to us both hand the vegetables round said i foolishly i see nowfor it was aiming at more than we could accomplish with quietness and simplicity and then seeing her look bewildered i added take the vegetables round to people and let them help themselves and mind you go first to the ladies put in miss matilda always go to the ladies before gentlemen when you are waiting ill do it as you tell me maam said martha but i like lads best we felt very uncomfortable and shocked at this speech of marthas yet i dont think she meant any harm and on the whole she attended very well to our directions except that she nudged the major when he did not help himself as soon as she expected to the potatoes while she was handing them round illustration she nudged the major the major and his wife were quiet unpretending people enough when they did come languid as all east indians are i suppose we were rather dismayed at their bringing two servants with them a hindoo bodyservant for the major and a steady elderly maid for his wife but they slept at the inn and took off a good deal of the responsibility by attending carefully to their masters and mistresss comfort martha to be sure had never ended her staring at the east indians white turban and brown complexion and i saw that miss matilda shrunk away from him a little as he waited at dinner indeed she asked me when they were gone if he did not remind me of blue beard on the whole the visit was most satisfactory and is a subject of conversation even now with miss matilda at the time it greatly excited cranford and even stirred up the apathetic and honourable mrs jamieson to some expression of interest when i went to call and thank her for the kind answers she had vouchsafed to miss matildas inquiries as to the arrangement of a gentlemans dressingroomanswers which i must confess she had given in the wearied manner of the scandinavian prophetess leave me leave me to repose and now i come to the love affair it seems that miss pole had a cousin once or twice removed who had offered to miss matty long ago now this cousin lived four or five miles from cranford on his own estate but his property was not large enough to entitle him to rank higher than a yeoman or rather with something of the pride which apes humility he had refused to push himself on as so many of his class had done into the ranks of the squires he would not allow himself to be called thomas holbrook esq he even sent back letters with this address telling the postmistress at cranford that his name was mr thomas holbrook yeoman he rejected all domestic innovations he would have the housedoor stand open in summer and shut in winter without knocker or bell to summon a servant the closed fist or the knob of the stick did this office for him if he found the door locked he despised every refinement which had not its root deep down in humanity if people were not ill he saw no necessity for moderating his voice he spoke the dialect of the country in perfection and constantly used it in conversation although miss pole who gave me these particulars added that he read aloud more beautifully and with more feeling than any one she had ever heard except the late rector and how came miss matilda not to marry him asked i oh i dont know she was willing enough i think but you know cousin thomas would not have been enough of a gentleman for the rector and miss jenkyns well but they were not to marry him said i impatiently no but they did not like miss matty to marry below her rank you know she was the rectors daughter and somehow they are related to sir peter arley miss jenkyns thought a deal of that poor miss matty said i nay now i dont know anything more than that he offered and was refused miss matty might not like himand miss jenkyns might never have said a wordit is only a guess of mine has she never seen him since i inquired no i think not you see woodley cousin thomass house lies halfway between cranford and misselton and i know he made misselton his markettown very soon after he had offered to miss matty and i dont think he has been into cranford above once or twice sinceonce when i was walking with miss matty in high street and suddenly she darted from me and went up shire lane a few minutes after i was startled by meeting cousin thomas how old is he i asked after a pause of castlebuilding he must be about seventy i think my dear said miss pole blowing up my castle as if by gunpowder into small fragments illustration how are you how are you very soon afterat least during my long visit to miss matildai had the opportunity of seeing mr holbrook seeing too his first encounter with his former love after thirty or forty years separation i was helping to decide whether any of the new assortment of coloured silks which they had just received at the shop would do to match a gray and black mousselinedelaine that wanted a new breadth when a tall thin don quixotelooking old man came into the shop for some woollen gloves i had never seen the person who was rather striking before and i watched him rather attentively while miss matty listened to the shopman the stranger wore a blue coat with brass buttons drab breeches and gaiters and drummed with his fingers on the counter until he was attended to when he answered the shopboys question what can i have the pleasure of showing you today sir i saw miss matilda start and then suddenly sit down and instantly i guessed who it was she had made some inquiry which had to be carried round to the other shopman miss jenkyns wants the black sarsenet twoandtwopence the yard and mr holbrook had caught the name and was across the shop in two strides mattymiss matildamiss jenkyns god bless my soul i should not have known you how are you how are you he kept shaking her hand in a way which proved the warmth of his friendship but he repeated so often as if to himself i should not have known you that any sentimental romance which i might be inclined to build was quite done away with by his manner however he kept talking to us all the time we were in the shop and then waving the shopman with the unpurchased gloves on one side with another time sir another time he walked home with us i am happy to say my client miss matilda also left the shop in an equally bewildered state not having purchased either green or red silk mr holbrook was evidently full with honest loudspoken joy at meeting his old love again he touched on the changes that had taken place he even spoke of miss jenkyns as your poor sister well well we have all our faults and bade us goodbye with many a hope that he should soon see miss matty again she went straight to her room and never came back till our early teatime when i thought she looked as if she had been crying illustration chapter tailpiece illustration chapter a visit to an old bachelor a few days after a note came from mr holbrook asking usimpartially asking both of usin a formal oldfashioned style to spend a day at his housea long june dayfor it was june now he named that he had also invited his cousin miss pole so that we might join in a fly which could be put up at his house i expected miss matty to jump at this invitation but no miss pole and i had the greatest difficulty in persuading her to go she thought it was improper and was even half annoyed when we utterly ignored the idea of any impropriety in her going with two other ladies to see her old lover then came a more serious difficulty she did not think deborah would have liked her to go this took us half a days good hard talking to get over but at the first sentence of relenting i seized the opportunity and wrote and despatched an acceptance in her namefixing day and hour that all might be decided and done with the next morning she asked me if i would go down to the shop with her and there after much hesitation we chose out three caps to be sent home and tried on that the most becoming might be selected to take with us on thursday she was in a state of silent agitation all the way to woodley she had evidently never been there before and although she little dreamt i knew anything of her early story i could perceive she was in a tremor at the thought of seeing the place which might have been her home and round which it is probable that many of her innocent girlish imaginations had clustered it was a long drive there through paved jolting lanes miss matilda sat bolt upright and looked wistfully out of the windows as we drew near the end of our journey the aspect of the country was quiet and pastoral woodley stood among fields and there was an oldfashioned garden where roses and currantbushes touched each other and where the feathery asparagus formed a pretty background to the pinks and gillyflowers there was no drive up to the door we got out at a little gate and walked up a straight boxedged path my cousin might make a drive i think said miss pole who was afraid of earache and had only her cap on i think it is very pretty said miss matty with a soft plaintiveness in her voice and almost in a whisper for just then mr holbrook appeared at the door rubbing his hands in very effervescence of hospitality he looked more like my idea of don quixote than ever and yet the likeness was only external his respectable housekeeper stood modestly at the door to bid us welcome and while she led the elder ladies upstairs to a bedroom i begged to look about the garden my request evidently pleased the old gentleman who took me all round the place and showed me his six and twenty cows named after the different letters of the alphabet as we went along he surprised me occasionally by repeating apt and beautiful quotations from the poets ranging easily from shakespeare and george herbert to those of our own day he did this as naturally as if he were thinking aloud and their true and beautiful words were the best expression he could find for what he was thinking or feeling to be sure he called byron my lord byrron and pronounced the name of goethe strictly in accordance with the english sound of the lettersas goethe says ye eververdant palaces etc altogether i never met with a man before or since who had spent so long a life in a secluded and not impressive country with everincreasing delight in the daily and yearly change of season and beauty when he and i went in we found that dinner was nearly ready in the kitchenfor so i suppose the room ought to be called as there were oak dressers and cupboards all round all over by the side of the fireplace and only a small turkey carpet in the middle of the flagfloor the room might have been easily made into a handsome dark oak diningparlour by removing the oven and a few other appurtenances of a kitchen which were evidently never used the real cookingplace being at some distance the room in which we were expected to sit was a stifflyfurnished ugly apartment but that in which we did sit was what mr holbrook called the countinghouse when he paid his labourers their weekly wages at a great desk near the door the rest of the pretty sittingroomlooking into the orchard and all covered over with dancing treeshadowswas filled with books they lay on the ground they covered the walls they strewed the table he was evidently halfashamed and halfproud of his extravagance in this respect they were of all kindspoetry and wild weird tales prevailing he evidently chose his books in accordance with his own tastes not because such and such were classical or established favourites ah he said we farmers ought not to have much time for reading yet somehow one cant help it what a pretty room said miss matty sotto voce what a pleasant place said i aloud almost simultaneously nay if you like it replied he but can you sit on these great blackleather threecornered chairs i like it better than the best parlour but i thought ladies would take that for the smarter place it was the smarter place but like most smart things not at all pretty or pleasant or homelike so while we were at dinner the servantgirl dusted and scrubbed the countinghouse chairs and we sat there all the rest of the day we had pudding before meat and i thought mr holbrook was going to make some apology for his oldfashioned ways for he began i dont know whether you like newfangled ways oh not at all said miss matty no more do i said he my housekeeper will have these in her new fashion or else i tell her that when i was a young man we used to keep strictly to my fathers rule no broth no ball no ball no beef and always began dinner with broth then we had suet puddings boiled in the broth with the beef and then the meat itself if we did not sup our broth we had no ball which we liked a deal better and the beef came last of all and only those had it who had done justice to the broth and the ball now folks begin with sweet things and turn their dinners topsyturvy when the ducks and green peas came we looked at each other in dismay we had only twopronged blackhandled forks it is true the steel was as bright as silver but what were we to do miss matty picked up her peas one by one on the point of the prongs much as amin ate her grains of rice after her previous feast with the ghoul miss pole sighed over her delicate young peas as she left them on one side of her plate untasted for they would drop between the prongs i looked at my host the peas were going wholesale into his capacious mouth shovelled up by his large roundended knife i saw i imitated i survived my friends in spite of my precedent could not muster up courage enough to do an ungenteel thing and if mr holbrook had not been so heartily hungry he would probably have seen that the good peas went away almost untouched illustration requested her to fill the bowl after dinner a clay pipe was brought in and a spittoon and asking us to retire to another room where he would soon join us if we disliked tobaccosmoke he presented his pipe to miss matty and requested her to fill the bowl this was a compliment to a lady in his youth but it was rather inappropriate to propose it as an honour to miss matty who had been trained by her sister to hold smoking of every kind in utter abhorrence but if it was a shock to her refinement it was also a gratification to her feelings to be thus selected so she daintily stuffed the strong tobacco into the pipe and then we withdrew it is very pleasant dining with a bachelor said miss matty softly as we settled ourselves in the countinghouse i only hope it is not improper so many pleasant things are what a number of books he has said miss pole looking round the room and how dusty they are i think it must be like one of the great dr johnsons rooms said miss matty what a superior man your cousin must be yes said miss pole hes a great reader but i am afraid he has got into very uncouth habits with living alone oh uncouth is too hard a word i should call him eccentric very clever people always are replied miss matty when mr holbrook returned he proposed a walk in the fields but the two elder ladies were afraid of damp and dirt and had only very unbecoming calashes to put on over their caps so they declined and i was again his companion in a turn which he said he was obliged to take to see after his men he strode along either wholly forgetting my existence or soothed into silence by his pipeand yet it was not silence exactly he walked before me with a stooping gait his hands clasped behind him and as some tree or cloud or glimpse of distant upland pastures struck him he quoted poetry to himself saying it out loud in a grand sonorous voice with just the emphasis that true feeling and appreciation give we came upon an old cedartree which stood at one end of the house the cedar spreads his darkgreen layers of shade capital termlayers wonderful man i did not know whether he was speaking to me or not but i put in an assenting wonderful although i knew nothing about it just because i was tired of being forgotten and of being consequently silent illustration or glimpse of distant upland pastures he turned sharp round ay you may say wonderful why when i saw the review of his poems in blackwood i set off within an hour and walked seven miles to misselton for the horses were not in the way and ordered them now what colour are ashbuds in march is the man going mad thought i he is very like don quixote what colour are they i say repeated he vehemently i am sure i dont know sir said i with the meekness of ignorance i knew you didnt no more did ian old fool that i amtill this young man comes and tells me black as ashbuds in march and ive lived all my life in the country more shame for me not to know black they are jetblack madam and he went off again swinging along to the music of some rhyme he had got hold of when we came back nothing would serve him but he must read us the poems he had been speaking of and miss pole encouraged him in his proposal i thought because she wished me to hear his beautiful reading of which she had boasted but she afterwards said it was because she had got to a difficult part of her crochet and wanted to count her stitches without having to talk whatever he had proposed would have been right to miss matty although she did fall sound asleep within five minutes after he had begun a long poem called locksley hall and had a comfortable nap unobserved till he ended when the cessation of his voice wakened her up and she said feeling that something was expected and that miss pole was counting what a pretty book pretty madam its beautiful pretty indeed oh yes i meant beautiful said she fluttered at his disapproval of her word it is so like that beautiful poem of dr johnsons my sister used to readi forget the name of it what was it my dear turning to me which do you mean maam what was it about i dont remember what it was about and ive quite forgotten what the name of it was but it was written by dr johnson and was very beautiful and very like what mr holbrook has just been reading i dont remember it said he reflectively but i dont know dr johnsons poems well i must read them illustration he had begun a long poem as we were getting into the fly to return i heard mr holbrook say he should call on the ladies soon and inquire how they got home and this evidently pleased and fluttered miss matty at the time he said it but after we had lost sight of the old house among the trees her sentiments towards the master of it were gradually absorbed into a distressing wonder as to whether martha had broken her word and seized on the opportunity of her mistresss absence to have a follower martha looked good and steady and composed enough as she came to help us out she was always careful of miss matty and tonight she made use of this unlucky speech eh dear maam to think of your going out in an evening in such a thin shawl its no better than muslin at your age maam you should be careful my age said miss matty almost speaking crossly for her for she was usually gentlemy age why how old do you think i am that you talk about my age well maam i should say you were not far short of sixty but folks looks is often against themand im sure i meant no harm martha im not yet fiftytwo said miss matty with grave emphasis for probably the remembrance of her youth had come very vividly before her this day and she was annoyed at finding that golden time so far away in the past but she never spoke of any former and more intimate acquaintance with mr holbrook she had probably met with so little sympathy in her early love that she had shut it up close in her heart and it was only by a sort of watching which i could hardly avoid since miss poles confidence that i saw how faithful her poor heart had been in its sorrow and its silence she gave me some good reason for wearing her best cap every day and sat near the window in spite of her rheumatism in order to see without being seen down into the street he came he put his open palms upon his knees which were far apart as he sat with his head bent down whistling after we had replied to his inquiries about our safe return suddenly he jumped up well madam have you any commands for paris i am going there in a week or two to paris we both exclaimed yes madam ive never been there and always had a wish to go and i think if i dont go soon i maynt go at all so as soon as the hay is got in i shall go before harvest time illustration here are the poems for you we were so much astonished that we had no commissions just as he was going out of the room he turned back with his favourite exclamation god bless my soul madam but i nearly forgot half my errand here are the poems for you you admired so much the other evening at my house he tugged away at a parcel in his coatpocket goodbye miss said he goodbye matty take care of yourself and he was gone but he had given her a book and he had called her matty just as he used to do thirty years ago i wish he would not go to paris said miss matilda anxiously i dont believe frogs will agree with him he used to have to be very careful what he ate which was curious in so stronglooking a young man soon after this i took my leave giving many an injunction to martha to look after her mistress and to let me know if she thought that miss matilda was not so well in which case i would volunteer a visit to my old friend without noticing marthas intelligence to her accordingly i received a line or two from martha every now and then and about november i had a note to say her mistress was very low and sadly off her food and the account made me so uneasy that although martha did not decidedly summon me i packed up my things and went i received a warm welcome in spite of the little flurry produced by my impromptu visit for i had only been able to give a days notice miss matilda looked miserably ill and i prepared to comfort and cosset her i went down to have a private talk with martha how long has your mistress been so poorly i asked as i stood by the kitchen fire well i think its better than a fortnight it is i know it was one tuesday after miss pole had been that she went into this moping way i thought she was tired and it would go off with a nights rest but no she has gone on and on ever since till i thought it my duty to write to you maam you did quite right martha it is a comfort to think she has so faithful a servant about her and i hope you find your place comfortable well maam missus is very kind and theres plenty to eat and drink and no more work but what i can do easilybut martha hesitated but what martha why it seems so hard of missus not to let me have any followers theres such lots of young fellows in the town and many a one has as much as offered to keep company with me and i may never be in such a likely place again and its like wasting an opportunity many a girl as i know would have em unbeknownst to missus but ive given my word and ill stick to it or else this is just the house for missus never to be the wiser if they did come and its such a capable kitchentheres such good dark corners in itid be bound to hide any one i counted up last sunday nightfor ill not deny i was crying because i had to shut the door in jem hearns face and hes a steady young man fit for any girl only i had given missus my word martha was all but crying again and i had little comfort to give her for i knew from old experience of the horror with which both the miss jenkynses looked upon followers and in miss mattys present nervous state this dread was not likely to be lessened i went to see miss pole the next day and took her completely by surprise for she had not been to see miss matilda for two days and now i must go back with you my dear for i promised to let her know how thomas holbrook went on and im sorry to say his housekeeper has sent me word today that he hasnt long to live poor thomas that journey to paris was quite too much for him his housekeeper says he has hardly ever been round his fields since but just sits with his hands on his knees in the countinghouse not reading or anything but only saying what a wonderful city paris was paris has much to answer for if its killed my cousin thomas for a better man never lived does miss matilda know of his illness asked ia new light as to the cause of her indisposition dawning upon me dear to be sure yes has not she told you i let her know a fortnight ago or more when first i heard of it how odd she shouldnt have told you not at all i thought but i did not say anything i felt almost guilty of having spied too curiously into that tender heart and i was not going to speak of its secretshidden miss matty believed from all the world i ushered miss pole into miss matildas little drawingroom and then left them alone but i was not surprised when martha came to my bedroom door to ask me to go down to dinner alone for that missus had one of her bad headaches she came into the drawingroom at teatime but it was evidently an effort to her and as if to make up for some reproachful feeling against her late sister miss jenkyns which had been troubling her all the afternoon and for which she now felt penitent she kept telling me how good and how clever deborah was in her youth how she used to settle what gowns they were to wear at all the parties faint ghostly ideas of grim parties far away in the distance when miss matty and miss pole were young and how deborah and her mother had started the benefit society for the poor and taught girls cooking and plain sewing and how deborah had once danced with a lord and how she used to visit at sir peter arleys and try to remodel the quiet rectory establishment on the plans of arley hall where they kept thirty servants and how she had nursed miss matty through a long long illness of which i had never heard before but which i now dated in my own mind as following the dismissal of the suit of mr holbrook so we talked softly and quietly of old times through the long november evening the next day miss pole brought us word that mr holbrook was dead miss matty heard the news in silence in fact from the account of the previous day it was only what we had to expect miss pole kept calling upon us for some expression of regret by asking if it was not sad that he was gone and saying to think of that pleasant day last june when he seemed so well and he might have lived this dozen years if he had not gone to that wicked paris where they are always having revolutions she paused for some demonstration on our part i saw miss matty could not speak she was trembling so nervously so i said what i really felt and after a call of some durationall the time of which i have no doubt miss pole thought miss matty received the news very calmlyour visitor took her leave miss matty made a strong effort to conceal her feelingsa concealment she practised even with me for she has never alluded to mr holbrook again although the book he gave her lies with her bible on the little table by her bedside she did not think i heard her when she asked the little milliner of cranford to make her caps something like the honourable mrs jamiesons or that i noticed the reply but she wears widows caps maam oh i only meant something in that style not widows of course but rather like mrs jamiesons illustration god forbid that i should grieve any young hearts this effort at concealment was the beginning of the tremulous motion of head and hands which i have seen ever since in miss matty the evening of the day on which we heard of mr holbrooks death miss matilda was very silent and thoughtful after prayers she called martha back and then she stood uncertain what to say martha she said at last you are youngand then she made so long a pause that martha to remind her of her halffinished sentence dropped a curtsey and said yes please maam two and twenty last third of october please maam and perhaps martha you may some time meet with a young man you like and who likes you i did say you were not to have followers but if you meet with such a young man and tell me and i find he is respectable i have no objection to his coming to see you once a week god forbid said she in a low voice that i should grieve any young hearts she spoke as if she were providing for some distant contingency and was rather startled when martha made her ready eager answer please maam theres jem hearn and hes a joiner making threeandsixpence a day and six foot one in his stocking feet please maam and if youll ask about him tomorrow morning every one will give him a character for steadiness and hell be glad enough to come tomorrow night ill be bound though miss matty was startled she submitted to fate and love illustration illustration chapter old letters i have often noticed that almost every one has his own individual small economiescareful habits of saving fractions of pennies in some one peculiar directionany disturbance of which annoys him more than spending shillings or pounds on some real extravagance an old gentleman of my acquaintance who took the intelligence of the failure of a jointstock bank in which some of his money was invested with stoical mildness worried his family all through a long summers day because one of them had torn instead of cutting out the written leaves of his now useless bankbook of course the corresponding pages at the other end came out as well and this little unnecessary waste of paper his private economy chafed him more than all the loss of his money envelopes fretted his soul terribly when they first came in the only way in which he could reconcile himself to such waste of his cherished article was by patiently turning inside out all that were sent to him and so making them serve again even now though tamed by age i see him casting wistful glances at his daughters when they send a whole inside of a halfsheet of notepaper with the three lines of acceptance to an invitation written on only one of the sides i am not above owning that i have this human weakness myself string is my foible my pockets get full of little hanks of it picked up and twisted together ready for uses that never come i am seriously annoyed if any one cuts the string of a parcel instead of patiently and faithfully undoing it fold by fold how people can bring themselves to use indiarubber rings which are a sort of deification of string as lightly as they do i cannot imagine to me an indiarubber ring is a precious treasure i have one which is not newone that i picked up off the floor nearly six years ago i have really tried to use it but my heart failed me and i could not commit the extravagance small pieces of butter grieve others they cannot attend to conversation because of the annoyance occasioned by the habit which some people have of invariably taking more butter than they want have you not seen the anxious look almost mesmeric which such persons fix on the article they would feel it a relief if they might bury it out of their sight by popping it into their own mouths and swallowing it down and they are really made happy if the person on whose plate it lies unused suddenly breaks off a piece of toast which he does not want at all and eats up his butter they think that this is not waste now miss matty jenkyns was chary of candles we had many devices to use as few as possible in the winter afternoons she would sit knitting for two or three hoursshe could do this in the dark or by firelightand when i asked if i might not ring for candles to finish stitching my wristbands she told me to keep blind mans holiday they were usually brought in with tea but we only burnt one at a time as we lived in constant preparation for a friend who might come in any evening but who never did it required some contrivance to keep our two candles of the same length ready to be lighted and to look as if we burnt two always the candles took it in turns and whatever we might be talking about or doing miss mattys eyes were habitually fixed upon the candle ready to jump up and extinguish it and to light the other before they had become too uneven in length to be restored to equality in the course of the evening illustration when martha brought in the lighted candle and tea one night i remember this candle economy particularly annoyed me i had been very much tired of my compulsory blind mans holiday especially as miss matty had fallen asleep and i did not like to stir the fire and run the risk of awakening her so i could not even sit on the rug and scorch myself with sewing by firelight according to my usual custom i fancied miss matty must be dreaming of her early life for she spoke one or two words in her uneasy sleep bearing reference to persons who were dead long before when martha brought in the lighted candle and tea miss matty started into wakefulness with a strange bewildered look around as if we were not the people she expected to see about her there was a little sad expression that shadowed her face as she recognised me but immediately afterwards she tried to give me her usual smile all through teatime her talk ran upon the days of her childhood and youth perhaps this reminded her of the desirableness of looking over all the old family letters and destroying such as ought not to be allowed to fall into the hands of strangers for she had often spoken of the necessity of this task but had always shrunk from it with a timid dread of something painful tonight however she rose up after tea and went for themin the dark for she piqued herself on the precise neatness of all her chamber arrangements and used to look uneasily at me when i lighted a bedcandle to go to another room for anything when she returned there was a faint pleasant smell of tonquin beans in the room i had always noticed this scent about any of the things which had belonged to her mother and many of the letters were addressed to heryellow bundles of loveletters sixty or seventy years old miss matty undid the packet with a sigh but she stifled it directly as if it were hardly right to regret the flight of time or of life either we agreed to look them over separately each taking a different letter out of the same bundle and describing its contents to the other before destroying it i never knew what sad work the reading of old letters was before that evening though i could hardly tell why the letters were as happy as letters could beat least those early letters were there was in them a vivid and intense sense of the present time which seemed so strong and full as if it could never pass away and as if the warm living hearts that so expressed themselves could never die and be as nothing to the sunny earth i should have felt less melancholy i believe if the letters had been more so i saw the tears stealing down the wellworn furrows of miss mattys cheeks and her spectacles often wanted wiping i trusted at last that she would light the other candle for my own eyes were rather dim and i wanted more light to see the pale faded ink but no even through her tears she saw and remembered her little economical ways the earliest set of letters were two bundles tied together and ticketed in miss jenkynss handwriting letters interchanged between my everhonoured father and my dearlybeloved mother prior to their marriage in july i should guess that the rector of cranford was about twentyseven years of age when he wrote those letters and miss matty told me that her mother was just eighteen at the time of her wedding with my idea of the rector derived from a picture in the diningparlour stiff and stately in a huge fullbottomed wig with gown cassock and bands and his hand upon a copy of the only sermon he ever publishedit was strange to read these letters they were full of eager passionate ardour short homely sentences right fresh from the heart very different from the grand latinised johnsonian style of the printed sermon preached before some judge at assize time his letters were a curious contrast to those of his girlbride she was evidently rather annoyed at his demands upon her for expressions of love and could not quite understand what he meant by repeating the same thing over in so many different ways but what she was quite clear about was a longing for a white paduasoywhatever that might be and six or seven letters were principally occupied in asking her lover to use his influence with her parents who evidently kept her in good order to obtain this or that article of dress more especially the white paduasoy he cared nothing how she was dressed she was always lovely enough for him as he took pains to assure her when she begged him to express in his answers a predilection for particular pieces of finery in order that she might show what he said to her parents but at length he seemed to find out that she would not be married till she had a trousseau to her mind and then he sent her a letter which had evidently accompanied a whole boxful of finery and in which he requested that she might be dressed in everything her heart desired this was the first letter ticketed in a frail delicate hand from my dearest john shortly afterwards they were married i suppose from the intermission in their correspondence illustration preached before some judge we must burn them i think said miss matty looking doubtfully at me no one will care for them when i am gone and one by one she dropped them into the middle of the fire watching each blaze up die out and rise away in faint white ghostly semblance up the chimney before she gave another to the same fate the room was light enough now but i like her was fascinated into watching the destruction of those letters into which the honest warmth of a manly heart had been poured forth the next letter likewise docketed by miss jenkyns was endorsed letter of pious congratulation and exhortation from my venerable grandfather to my beloved mother on occasion of my own birth also some practical remarks on the desirability of keeping warm the extremities of infants from my excellent grandmother the first part was indeed a severe and forcible picture of the responsibilities of mothers and a warning against the evils that were in the world and lying in ghastly wait for the little baby of two days old his wife did not write said the old gentleman because he had forbidden it she being indisposed with a sprained ankle which he said quite incapacitated her from holding a pen however at the foot of the page was a small to and on turning it over sure enough there was a letter to my dear dearest molly begging her when she left her room whatever she did to go up stairs before going down and telling her to wrap her babys feet up in flannel and keep it warm by the fire although it was summer for babies were so tender it was pretty to see from the letters which were evidently exchanged with some frequency between the young mother and the grandmother how the girlish vanity was being weeded out of her heart by love for her baby the white paduasoy figured again in the letters with almost as much vigour as before in one it was being made into a christening cloak for the baby it decked it when it went with its parents to spend a day or two at arley hall it added to its charms when it was the prettiest little baby that ever was seen dear mother i wish you could see her without any parshality i do think she will grow up a regular bewty i thought of miss jenkyns gray withered and wrinkled and i wondered if her mother had known her in the courts of heaven and then i knew that she had and that they stood there in angelic guise there was a great gap before any of the rectors letters appeared and then his wife had changed her mode of endorsement it was no longer from my dearest john it was from my honoured husband the letters were written on occasion of the publication of the same sermon which was represented in the picture the preaching before my lord judge and the publishing by request was evidently the culminating pointthe event of his life it had been necessary for him to go up to london to superintend it through the press many friends had to be called upon and consulted before he could decide on any printer fit for so onerous a task and at length it was arranged that j and j rivingtons were to have the honourable responsibility the worthy rector seemed to be strung up by the occasion to a high literary pitch for he could hardly write a letter to his wife without cropping out into latin i remember the end of one of his letters ran thus i shall ever hold the virtuous qualities of my molly in remembrance dum memor ipse mei dum spiritus regit artus which considering that the english of his correspondent was sometimes at fault in grammar and often in spelling might be taken as a proof of how much he idealised his molly and as miss jenkyns used to say people talk a great deal about idealising nowadays whatever that may mean but this was nothing to a fit of writing classical poetry which soon seized him in which his molly figured away as maria the letter containing the carmen was endorsed by her hebrew verses sent me by my honoured husband i thowt to have had a letter about killing the pig but must wait mem to send the poetry to sir peter arley as my husband desires and in a postscriptum note in his handwriting it was stated that the ode had appeared in the gentlemans magazine december her letters back to her husband treasured as fondly by him as if they had been m t ciceronis epistol were more satisfactory to an absent husband and father than his could ever have been to her she told him how deborah sewed her seam very neatly every day and read to her in the books he had set her how she was a very forrard good child but would ask questions her mother could not answer but how she did not let herself down by saying she did not know but took to stirring the fire or sending the forrard child on an errand matty was now the mothers darling and promised like her sister at her age to be a great beauty i was reading this aloud to miss matty who smiled and sighed a little at the hope so fondly expressed that little matty might not be vain even if she were a bewty i had very pretty hair my dear said miss matilda and not a bad mouth and i saw her soon afterwards adjust her cap and draw herself up but to return to mrs jenkynss letters she told her husband about the poor in the parish what homely domestic medicines she had administered what kitchen physic she had sent she had evidently held his displeasure as a rod in pickle over the heads of all the neerdowells she asked for his directions about the cows and pigs and did not always obtain them as i have shown before the kind old grandmother was dead when a little boy was born soon after the publication of the sermon but there was another letter of exhortation from the grandfather more stringent and admonitory than ever now that there was a boy to be guarded from the snares of the world he described all the various sins into which men might fall until i wondered how any man ever came to a natural death the gallows seemed as if it must have been the termination of the lives of most of the grandfathers friends and acquaintance and i was not surprised at the way in which he spoke of this life being a vale of tears it seemed curious that i should never have heard of this brother before but i concluded that he had died young or else surely his name would have been alluded to by his sisters by and by we came to packets of miss jenkynss letters these miss matty did regret to burn she said all the others had been only interesting to those who loved the writers and that it seemed as if it would have hurt her to allow them to fall into the hands of strangers who had not known her dear mother and how good she was although she did not always spell quite in the modern fashion but deborahs letters were so very superior any one might profit by reading them it was a long time since she had read mrs chapone but she knew she used to think that deborah could have said the same things quite as well and as for mrs carter people thought a deal of her letters just because she had written epictetus but she was quite sure deborah would never have made use of such a common expression as i canna be fashed illustration a post boy miss matty did grudge burning these letters it was evident she would not let them be carelessly passed over with any quiet reading and skipping to myself she took them from me and even lighted the second candle in order to read them aloud with a proper emphasis and without stumbling over the big words oh dear how i wanted facts instead of reflections before those letters were concluded they lasted us two nights and i wont deny that i made use of the time to think of many other things and yet i was always at my post at the end of each sentence the rectors letters and those of his wife and motherinlaw had all been tolerably short and pithy written in a straight hand with the lines very close together sometimes the whole letter was contained on a mere scrap of paper the paper was very yellow and the ink very brown some of the sheets were as miss matty made me observe the old original post with the stamp in the corner representing a postboy riding for life and twanging his horn the letters of mrs jenkyns and her mother were fastened with a great round red wafer for it was before miss edgeworths patronage had banished wafers from polite society it was evident from the tenor of what was said that franks were in great request and were even used as a means of paying debts by needy members of parliament the rector sealed his espistles with an immense coat of arms and showed by the care with which he had performed this ceremony that he expected they should be cut open not broken by any thoughtless or impatient hand now miss jenkynss letters were of a later date in form and writing she wrote on the square sheet which we have learned to call oldfashioned her hand was admirably calculated together with her use of manysyllabled words to fill up a sheet and then came the pride and delight of crossing poor miss matty got sadly puzzled with this for the words gathered size like snowballs and towards the end of her letter miss jenkyns used to become quite sesquipedalian in one to her father slightly theological and controversial in its tone she had spoken of herod tetrarch of idumea miss matty read it herod petrarch of etruria and was just as well pleased as if she had been right illustration turning out of the volunteers i cant quite remember the date but i think it was in that miss jenkyns wrote the longest series of letterson occasion of her absence on a visit to some friends near newcastleupontyne these friends were intimate with the commandant of the garrison there and heard from him of all the preparations that were being made to repel the invasion of buonaparte which some people imagined might take place at the mouth of the tyne miss jenkyns was evidently very much alarmed and the first part of her letters was often written in pretty intelligible english conveying particulars of the preparations which were made in the family with whom she was residing against the dreaded event the bundles of clothes that were packed up ready for a flight to alston moor a wild hilly piece of ground between northumberland and cumberland the signal that was to be given for this flight and for the simultaneous turning out of the volunteers under armswhich said signal was to consist if i remember rightly in ringing the church bells in a particular and ominous manner one day when miss jenkyns and her hosts were at a dinner party in newcastle this warning summons was actually given not a very wise proceeding if there be any truth in the moral attached to the fable of the boy and the wolf but so it was and miss jenkyns hardly recovered from her fright wrote the next day to describe the sound the breathless shock the hurry and alarm and then taking breath she added how trivial my dear father do all our apprehensions of the last evening appear at the present moment to calm and inquiring minds and here miss matty broke in with but indeed my dear they were not at all trivial or trifling at the time i know i used to wake up in the night many a time and think i heard the tramp of the french entering cranford many people talked of hiding themselves in the salt minesand meat would have kept capitally down there only perhaps we should have been thirsty and my father preached a whole set of sermons on the occasion one set in the mornings all about david and goliath to spirit up the people to fighting with spades or bricks if need were and the other set in the afternoons proving that napoleon that was another name for bony as we used to call him was all the same as an apollyon and abaddon i remember my father rather thought he should be asked to print this last set but the parish had perhaps had enough of them with hearing peter marmaduke arley jenkyns poor peter as miss matty began to call him was at school at shrewsbury by this time the rector took up his pen and rubbed up his latin once more to correspond with his boy it was very clear that the lads were what are called show letters they were of a highly mental description giving an account of his studies and his intellectual hopes of various kinds with an occasional quotation from the classics but now and then the animal nature broke out in such a little sentence as this evidently written in a trembling hurry after the letter had been inspected mother dear do send me a cake and put plenty of citron in the mother dear probably answered her boy in the form of cakes and goody for there were none of her letters among this set but a whole collection of the rectors to whom the latin in his boys letters was like a trumpet to the old warhorse i do not know much about latin certainly and it is perhaps an ornamental language but not very useful i thinkat least to judge from the bits i remember out of the rectors letters one was you have not got that town in your map of ireland but bonus bernardus non videt omnia as the proverbia say presently it became very evident that poor peter got himself into many scrapes there were letters of stilted penitence to his father for some wrongdoing and among them all was a badlywritten badlysealed badlydirected blotted notemy dear dear dear dearest mother i will be a better boy i will indeed but dont please be ill for me i am not worth it but i will be good darling mother miss matty could not speak for crying after she had read this note she gave it to me in silence and then got up and took it to her sacred recesses in her own room for fear by any chance it might get burnt poor peter she said he was always in scrapes he was too easy they led him wrong and then left him in the lurch but he was too fond of mischief he could never resist a joke poor peter illustration chapter tailpiece illustration chapter poor peter poor peters career lay before him rather pleasantly mapped out by kind friends but bonus bernardus non videt omnia in this map too he was to win honours at shrewsbury school and carry them thick to cambridge and after that a living awaited him the gift of his godfather sir peter arley poor peter his lot in life was very different to what his friends had hoped and planned miss matty told me all about it and i think it was a relief to her when she had done so he was the darling of his mother who seemed to dote on all her children though she was perhaps a little afraid of deborahs superior acquirements deborah was the favourite of her father and when peter disappointed him she became his pride the sole honour peter brought away from shrewsbury was the reputation of being the best good fellow that ever was and of being the captain of the school in the art of practical joking his father was disappointed but set about remedying the matter in a manly way he could not afford to send peter to read with any tutor but he could read with him himself and miss matty told me much of the awful preparations in the way of dictionaries and lexicons that were made in her fathers study the morning peter began my poor mother said she i remember how she used to stand in the hall just near enough the studydoor to catch the tone of my fathers voice i could tell in a moment if all was going right by her face and it did go right for a long time what went wrong at last said i that tiresome latin i daresay no it was not the latin peter was in high favour with my father for he worked up well for him but he seemed to think that the cranford people might be joked about and made fun of and they did not like it nobody does he was always hoaxing them hoaxing is not a pretty word my dear and i hope you wont tell your father i used it for i should not like him to think that i was not choice in my language after living with such a woman as deborah and be sure you never use it yourself i dont know how it slipped out of my mouth except it was that i was thinking of poor peter and it was always his expression but he was a very gentlemanly boy in many things he was like dear captain brown in always being ready to help any old person or a child still he did like joking and making fun and he seemed to think the old ladies in cranford would believe anything there were many old ladies living here then we are principally ladies now i know but we are not so old as the ladies used to be when i was a girl i could laugh to think of some of peters jokes no my dear i wont tell you of them because they might not shock you as they ought to do and they were very shocking he even took in my father once by dressing himself up as a lady that was passing through the town and wished to see the rector of cranford who had published that admirable assize sermon peter said he was awfully frightened himself when he saw how my father took it all in and even offered to copy out all his napoleon buonaparte sermons for herhim i meanno her for peter was a lady then he told me he was more terrified than he ever was before all the time my father was speaking he did not think my father would have believed him and yet if he had not it would have been a sad thing for peter as it was he was none so glad of it for my father kept him hard at work copying out all those twelve buonaparte sermons for the ladythat was for peter himself you know he was the lady and once when he wanted to go fishing peter said confound the womanvery bad language my dear but peter was not always so guarded as he should have been my father was so angry with him it nearly frightened me out of my wits and yet i could hardly keep from laughing at the little curtseys peter kept making quite slyly whenever my father spoke of the ladys excellent taste and sound discrimination did miss jenkyns know of these tricks said i illustration the little curtseys oh no deborah would have been too much shocked no no one knew but me i wish i had always known of peters plans but sometimes he did not tell me he used to say the old ladies in the town wanted something to talk about but i dont think they did they had the st jamess chronicle three times a week just as we have now and we have plenty to say and i remember the clacking noise there always was when some of the ladies got together but probably schoolboys talk more than ladies at last there was a terrible sad thing happened miss matty got up went to the door and opened it no one was there she rang the bell for martha and when martha came her mistress told her to go for eggs to a farm at the other end of the town i will lock the door after you martha you are not afraid to go are you no maam not at all jem hearn will be only too proud to go with me miss matty drew herself up and as soon as we were alone she wished that martha had more maidenly reserve well put out the candle my dear we can talk just as well by firelight you know there well you see deborah had gone from home for a fortnight or so it was a very still quiet day i remember overhead and the lilacs were all in flower so i suppose it was spring my father had gone out to see some sick people in the parish i recollect seeing him leave the house with his wig and shovelhat and cane what possessed our poor peter i dont know he had the sweetest temper and yet he always seemed to like to plague deborah she never laughed at his jokes and thought him ungenteel and not careful enough about improving his mind and that vexed him well he went to her room it seems and dressed himself in her old gown and shawl and bonnet just the things she used to wear in cranford and was known by everywhere and he made the pillow into a littleyou are sure you locked the door my dear for i should not like any one to hearintointoa little baby with white long clothes it was only as he told me afterwards to make something to talk about in the town he never thought of it as affecting deborah and he went and walked up and down in the filbert walkjust halfhidden by the rails and halfseen and he cuddled his pillow just like a baby and talked to it all the nonsense people do oh dear and my father came stepping stately up the street as he always did and what should he see but a little black crowd of peoplei daresay as many as twentyall peeping through his garden rails so he thought at first they were only looking at a new rhododendron that was in full bloom and that he was very proud of and he walked slower that they might have more time to admire and he wondered if he could make out a sermon from the occasion and thought perhaps there was some relation between the rhododendrons and the lilies of the field my poor father when he came nearer he began to wonder that they did not see him but their heads were all so close together peeping and peeping my father was amongst them meaning he said to ask them to walk into the garden with him and admire the beautiful vegetable production whenoh my dear i tremble to think of ithe looked through the rails himself and sawi dont know what he thought he saw but old clare told me his face went quite graywhite with anger and his eyes blazed out under his frowning black brows and he spoke outoh so terriblyand bade them all stop where they werenot one of them to go not one to stir a step and swift as light he was in at the garden door and down the filbert walk and seized hold of poor peter and tore his clothes off his backbonnet shawl gown and alland threw the pillow among the people over the railings and then he was very very angry indeed and before all the people he lifted up his cane and flogged peter illustration have you done enough sir my dear that boys trick on that sunny day when all seemed going straight and well broke my mothers heart and changed my father for life it did indeed old clare said peter looked as white as my father and stood as still as a statue to be flogged and my father struck hard when my father stopped to take breath peter said have you done enough sir quite hoarsely and still standing quite quiet i dont know what my father saidor if he said anything but old clare said peter turned to where the people outside the railing were and made them a low bow as grand and as grave as any gentleman and then walked slowly into the house i was in the storeroom helping my mother to make cowslip wine i cannot abide the wine now nor the scent of the flowers they turn me sick and faint as they did that day when peter came in looking as haughty as any manindeed looking like a man not like a boy mother he said i am come to say god bless you for ever i saw his lips quiver as he spoke and i think he durst not say anything more loving for the purpose that was in his heart she looked at him rather frightened and wondering and asked him what was to do he did not smile or speak but put his arms round her and kissed her as if he did not know how to leave off and before she could speak again he was gone we talked it over and could not understand it and she bade me go and seek my father and ask what it was all about i found him walking up and down looking very highly displeased tell your mother i have flogged peter and that he richly deserved it i durst not ask any more questions when i told my mother she sat down quite faint for a minute i remember a few days after i saw the poor withered cowslip flowers thrown out to the leaf heap to decay and die there there was no making of cowslipwine that year at the rectorynor indeed ever after presently my mother went to my father i know i thought of queen esther and king ahasuerus for my mother was very pretty and delicatelooking and my father looked as terrible as king ahasuerus some time after they came out together and then my mother told me what had happened and that she was going up to peters room at my fathers desirethough she was not to tell peter thisto talk the matter over with him but no peter was there we looked over the house no peter was there even my father who had not liked to join in the search at first helped us before long the rectory was a very old housesteps up into a room steps down into a room all through at first my mother went calling low and soft as if to reassure the poor boy peter peter dear its only me but by and by as the servants came back from the errands my father had sent them in different directions to find where peter wasas we found he was not in the garden nor the hayloft nor anywhere aboutmy mothers cry grew louder and wilder peter peter my darling where are you for then she felt and understood that that long kiss meant some sad kind of goodbye the afternoon went onmy mother never resting but seeking again and again in every possible place that had been looked into twenty times before nay that she had looked into over and over again herself my father sat with his head in his hands not speaking except when his messengers came in bringing no tidings then he lifted up his face so strong and sad and told them to go again in some new direction my mother kept passing from room to room in and out of the house moving noiselessly but never ceasing neither she nor my father durst leave the house which was the meetingplace for all the messengers at last and it was nearly dark my father rose up he took hold of my mothers arm as she came with wild sad pace through one door and quickly towards another she started at the touch of his hand for she had forgotten all in the world but peter molly said he i did not think all this would happen he looked into her face for comforther poor face all wild and white for neither she nor my father had dared to acknowledgemuch less act uponthe terror that was in their hearts lest peter should have made away with himself my father saw no conscious look in his wifes hot dreary eyes and he missed the sympathy that she had always been ready to give himstrong man as he was and at the dumb despair in her face his tears began to flow but when she saw this a gentle sorrow came over her countenance and she said dearest john dont cry come with me and well find him almost as cheerfully as if she knew where he was and she took my fathers great hand in her little soft one and led him along the tears dropping as he walked on that same unceasing weary walk from room to room through house and garden oh how i wished for deborah i had no time for crying for now all seemed to depend on me i wrote for deborah to come home i sent a message privately to that same mr holbrooks housepoor mr holbrookyou know who i mean i dont mean i sent a message to him but i sent one that i could trust to know if peter was at his house for at one time mr holbrook was an occasional visitor at the rectoryyou know he was miss poles cousinand he had been very kind to peter and taught him how to fishhe was very kind to everybody and i thought peter might have gone off there but mr holbrook was from home and peter had never been seen it was night now but the doors were all wide open and my father and mother walked on and on it was more than an hour since he had joined her and i dont believe they had ever spoken all that time i was getting the parlour fire lighted and one of the servants was preparing tea for i wanted them to have something to eat and drink and warm them when old clare asked to speak to me i have borrowed the nets from the weir miss matty shall we drag the ponds tonight or wait for the morning i remember staring in his face to gather his meaning and when i did i laughed out loud the horror of that new thoughtour bright darling peter cold and stark and dead i remember the ring of my own laugh now the next day deborah was at home before i was myself again she would not have been so weak as to give way as i had done but my screams my horrible laughter had ended in crying had roused my sweet dear mother whose poor wandering wits were called back and collected as soon as a child needed her care she and deborah sat by my bedside i knew by the looks of each that there had been no news of peterno awful ghastly news which was what i most had dreaded in my dull state between sleeping and waking the same result of all the searching had brought something of the same relief to my mother to whom i am sure the thought that peter might even then be hanging dead in some of the familiar home places had caused that neverending walk of yesterday her soft eyes never were the same again after that they had always a restless craving look as if seeking for what they could not find oh it was an awful time coming down like a thunderbolt on the still sunny day when the lilacs were all in bloom where was mr peter said i he had made his way to liverpool and there was war then and some of the kings ships lay off the mouth of the mersey and they were only too glad to have a fine likely boy such as him five foot nine he was come to offer himself the captain wrote to my father and peter wrote to my mother stay those letters will be somewhere here we lighted the candle and found the captains letter and peters too and we also found a little simple begging letter from mrs jenkyns to peter addressed to him at the house of an old schoolfellow whither she fancied he might have gone they had returned it unopened and unopened it had remained ever since having been inadvertently put by among the other letters of that time this is it my dearest peteryou did not think we should be so sorry as we are i know or you would never have gone away you are too good your father sits and sighs till my heart aches to hear him he cannot hold up his head for grief and yet he only did what he thought was right perhaps he has been too severe and perhaps i have not been kind enough but god knows how we love you my dear only boy don looks so sorry you are gone come back and make us happy who love you so much i know you will come back but peter did not come back that spring day was the last time he ever saw his mothers face the writer of the letterthe lastthe only person who had ever seen what was written in it was dead long ago and i a stranger not born at the time when this occurrence took place was the one to open it the captains letter summoned the father and mother to liverpool instantly if they wished to see their boy and by some of the wild chances of life the captains letter had been detained somewhere somehow miss matty went on and it was racetime and all the posthorses at cranford were gone to the races but my father and mother set off in our own gigand oh my dear they were too latethe ship was gone and now read peters letter to my mother it was full of love and sorrow and pride in his new profession and a sore sense of his disgrace in the eyes of the people at cranford but ending with a passionate entreaty that she would come and see him before he left the mersey mother we may go into battle i hope we shall and lick those french but i must see you again before that time and she was too late said miss matty too late we sat in silence pondering on the full meaning of those sad sad words at length i asked miss matty to tell me how her mother bore it oh she said she was patience itself she had never been strong and this weakened her terribly my father used to sit looking at her far more sad than she was he seemed as if he could look at nothing else when she was by and he was so humbleso very gentle now he would perhaps speak in his old waylaying down the law as it wereand then in a minute or two he would come round and put his hand on our shoulders and ask us in a low voice if he had said anything to hurt us i did not wonder at his speaking so to deborah for she was so clever but i could not bear to hear him talking so to me but you see he saw what we did notthat it was killing my mother yes killing her put out the candle my dear i can talk better in the dark for she was but a frail woman and ill fitted to stand the fright and shock she had gone through and she would smile at him and comfort him not in words but in her looks and tones which were always cheerful when he was there and she would speak of how she thought peter stood a good chance of being admiral very soonhe was so brave and clever and how she thought of seeing him in his navy uniform and what sort of hats admirals wore and how much more fit he was to be a sailor than a clergyman and all in that way just to make my father think she was quite glad of what came of that unlucky mornings work and the flogging which was always in his mind as we all knew but oh my dear the bitter bitter crying she had when she was alone and at last as she grew weaker she could not keep her tears in when deborah or me was by and would give us message after message for peter his ship had gone to the mediterranean or somewhere down there and then he was ordered off to india and there was no overland route then but she still said that no one knew where their death lay in wait and that we were not to think hers was near we did not think it but we knew it as we saw her fading away well my dear its very foolish of me i know when in all likelihood i am so near seeing her again and only think love the very day after her deathfor she did not live quite a twelvemonth after peter went awaythe very day aftercame a parcel for her from indiafrom her poor boy it was a large soft white india shawl with just a little narrow border all round just what my mother would have liked we thought it might rouse my father for he had sat with her hand in his all night long so deborah took it in to him and peters letter to her and all at first he took no notice and we tried to make a kind of light careless talk about the shawl opening it out and admiring it then suddenly he got up and spoke she shall be buried in it he said peter shall have that comfort and she would have liked it well perhaps it was not reasonable but what could we do or say one gives people in grief their own way he took it up and felt it it is just such a shawl as she wished for when she was married and her mother did not give it her i did not know of it till after or she should have had itshe should but she shall have it now my mother looked so lovely in her death she was always pretty and now she looked fair and waxen and youngyounger than deborah as she stood trembling and shivering by her we decked her in the long soft folds she lay smiling as if pleased and people cameall cranford cameto beg to see her for they had loved her dearly as well they might and the countrywomen brought posies old clares wife brought some white violets and begged they might lie on her breast deborah said to me the day of my mothers funeral that if she had a hundred offers she never would marry and leave my father it was not very likely she would have so manyi dont know that she had one but it was not less to her credit to say so she was such a daughter to my father as i think there never was before or since his eyes failed him and she read book after book and wrote and copied and was always at his service in any parish business she could do many more things than my poor mother could she even once wrote a letter to the bishop for my father but he missed my mother sorely the whole parish noticed it not that he was less active i think he was more so and more patient in helping every one i did all i could to set deborah at liberty to be with him for i knew i was good for little and that my best work in the world was to do odd jobs quietly and set others at liberty but my father was a changed man did mr peter ever come home yes once he came home a lieutenant he did not get to be admiral and he and my father were such friends my father took him into every house in the parish he was so proud of him he never walked out without peters arm to lean upon deborah used to smile i dont think we ever laughed again after my mothers death and say she was quite put in a corner not but what my father always wanted her when there was letterwriting or reading to be done or anything to be settled illustration he and my father were such friends and then said i after a pause then peter went to sea again and by and by my father died blessing us both and thanking deborah for all she had been to him and of course our circumstances were changed and instead of living at the rectory and keeping three maids and a man we had to come to this small house and be content with a servantofallwork but as deborah used to say we have always lived genteelly even if circumstances have compelled us to simplicity poor deborah and mr peter asked i oh there was some great war in indiai forget what they call itand we have never heard of peter since then i believe he is dead myself and it sometimes fidgets me that we have never put on mourning for him and then again when i sit by myself and all the house is still i think i hear his step coming up the street and my heart begins to flutter and beat but the sound always goes pastand peter never comes thats martha back no ill go my dear i can always find my way in the dark you know and a blow of fresh air at the door will do my head good and its rather got a trick of aching so she pattered off i had lighted the candle to give the room a cheerful appearance against her return was it martha asked i yes and i am rather uncomfortable for i heard such a strange noise just as i was opening the door where i asked for her eyes were round with affright in the streetjust outsideit sounded like talking i put in as she hesitated a little no kissing illustration chapter visiting one morning as miss matty and i sat at our workit was before twelve oclock and miss matty had not changed the cap with yellow ribbons that had been miss jenkynss best and which miss matty was now wearing out in private putting on the one made in imitation of mrs jamiesons at all times when she expected to be seenmartha came up and asked if miss betty barker might speak to her mistress miss matty assented and quickly disappeared to change the yellow ribbons while miss barker came upstairs but as she had forgotten her spectacles and was rather flurried by the unusual time of the visit i was not surprised to see her return with one cap on the top of the other she was quite unconscious of it herself and looked at us with bland satisfaction nor do i think miss barker perceived it for putting aside the little circumstance that she was not so young as she had been she was very much absorbed in her errand which she delivered herself of with an oppressive modesty that found vent in endless apologies illustration with bland satisfaction miss betty barker was the daughter of the old clerk at cranford who had officiated in mr jenkynss time she and her sister had had pretty good situations as ladies maids and had saved money enough to set up a milliners shop which had been patronised by the ladies in the neighbourhood lady arley for instance would occasionally give miss barkers the pattern of an old cap of hers which they immediately copied and circulated among the lite of cranford i say the lite for miss barkers had caught the trick of the place and piqued themselves upon their aristocratic connection they would not sell their caps and ribbons to any one without a pedigree many a farmers wife or daughter turned away huffed from miss barkers select millinery and went rather to the universal shop where the profits of brown soap and moist sugar enabled the proprietor to go straight to paris he said until he found his customers too patriotic and john bullish to wear what the mounseers wore london where as he often told his customers queen adelaide had appeared only the very week before in a cap exactly like the one he showed them trimmed with yellow and blue ribbons and had been complimented by king william on the becoming nature of her headdress miss barkers who confined themselves to truth and did not approve of miscellaneous customers throve notwithstanding they were selfdenying good people many a time have i seen the eldest of them she that had been maid to mrs jamieson carrying out some delicate mess to a poor person they only aped their betters in having nothing to do with the class immediately below theirs and when miss barker died their profits and income were found to be such that miss betty was justified in shutting up shop and retiring from business she also as i think i have before said set up her cow a mark of respectability in cranford almost as decided as setting up a gig is among some people she dressed finer than any lady in cranford and we did not wonder at it for it was understood that she was wearing out all the bonnets and caps and outrageous ribbons which had once formed her stockintrade it was five or six years since she had given up shop so in any other place than cranford her dress might have been considered passe and now miss betty barker had called to invite miss matty to tea at her house on the following tuesday she gave me also an impromptu invitation as i happened to be a visitorthough i could see she had a little fear lest since my father had gone to live in drumble he might have engaged in that horrid cotton trade and so dragged his family down out of aristocratic society she prefaced this invitation with so many apologies that she quite excited my curiosity her presumption was to be excused what had she been doing she seemed so overpowered by it i could only think that she had been writing to queen adelaide to ask for a receipt for washing lace but the act which she so characterised was only an invitation she had carried to her sisters former mistress mrs jamieson her former occupation considered could miss matty excuse the liberty ah thought i she has found out that double cap and is going to rectify miss mattys headdress no it was simply to extend her invitation to miss matty and to me miss matty bowed acceptance and i wondered that in the graceful action she did not feel the unusual weight and extraordinary height of her headdress but i do not think she did for she recovered her balance and went on talking to miss betty in a kind condescending manner very different from the fidgety way she would have had if she had suspected how singular her appearance was mrs jamieson is coming i think you said asked miss matty yes mrs jamieson most kindly and condescendingly said she would be happy to come one little stipulation she made that she should bring carlo i told her that if i had a weakness it was for dogs and miss pole questioned miss matty who was thinking of her pool at preference in which carlo would not be available as a partner i am going to ask miss pole of course i could not think of asking her until i had asked you madamthe rectors daughter madam believe me i do not forget the situation my father held under yours and mrs forrester of course and mrs forrester i thought in fact of going to her before i went to miss pole although her circumstances are changed madam she was born a tyrrell and we can never forget her alliance to the bigges of bigelow hall miss matty cared much more for the little circumstance of her being a very good cardplayer mrs fitzadami suppose no madam i must draw a line somewhere mrs jamieson would not i think like to meet mrs fitzadam i have the greatest respect for mrs fitzadambut i cannot think her fit society for such ladies as mrs jamieson and miss matilda jenkyns miss betty barker bowed low to miss matty and pursed up her mouth she looked at me with sidelong dignity as much as to say although a retired milliner she was no democrat and understood the difference of ranks may i beg you to come as near halfpast six to my little dwelling as possible miss matilda mrs jamieson dines at five but has kindly promised not to delay her visit beyond that timehalfpast six and with a swimming curtsey miss betty barker took her leave my prophetic soul foretold a visit that afternoon from miss pole who usually came to call on miss matilda after any eventor indeed in sight of any eventto talk it over with her miss betty told me it was to be a choice and select few said miss pole as she and miss matty compared notes yes so she said not even mrs fitzadam now mrs fitzadam was the widowed sister of the cranford surgeon whom i have named before their parents were respectable farmers content with their station the name of these good people was hoggins mr hoggins was the cranford doctor now we disliked the name and considered it coarse but as miss jenkyns said if he changed it to piggins it would not be much better we had hoped to discover a relationship between him and that marchioness of exeter whose name was molly hoggins but the man careless of his own interests utterly ignored and denied any such relationship although as dear miss jenkyns had said he had a sister called mary and the same christian names were very apt to run in families soon after miss mary hoggins married mr fitzadam she disappeared from the neighbourhood for many years she did not move in a sphere in cranford society sufficiently high to make any of us care to know what mr fitzadam was he died and was gathered to his fathers without our ever having thought about him at all and then mrs fitzadam reappeared in cranford as bold as a lion miss pole said a welltodo widow dressed in rustling black silk so soon after her husbands death that poor miss jenkyns was justified in the remark she made that bombazine would have shown a deeper sense of her loss i remember the convocation of ladies who assembled to decide whether or not mrs fitzadam should be called upon by the old blueblooded inhabitants of cranford she had taken a large rambling house which had been usually considered to confer a patent of gentility upon its tenant because once upon a time seventy or eighty years before the spinster daughter of an earl had resided in it i am not sure if the inhabiting this house was not also believed to convey some unusual power of intellect for the earls daughter lady jane had a sister lady anne who had married a general officer in the time of the american war and this general officer had written one or two comedies which were still acted on the london boards and which when we saw them advertised made us all draw up and feel that drury lane was paying a very pretty compliment to cranford still it was not at all a settled thing that mrs fitzadam was to be visited when dear miss jenkyns died and with her something of the clear knowledge of the strict code of gentility went out too as miss pole observed as most of the ladies of good family in cranford were elderly spinsters or widows without children if we did not relax a little and become less exclusive by and by we should have no society at all mrs forrester continued on the same side she had always understood that fitz meant something aristocratic there was fitzroyshe thought that some of the kings children had been called fitzroy and there was fitzclarence nowthey were the children of dear good king william the fourth fitzadamit was a pretty name and she thought it very probably meant child of adam no one who had not some good blood in their veins would dare to be called fitz there was a deal in a nameshe had had a cousin who spelt his name with two little ffsffoulkesand he always looked down upon capital letters and said they belonged to latelyinvented families she had been afraid he would die a bachelor he was so very choice when he met with a mrs ffarringdon at a wateringplace he took to her immediately and a very pretty genteel woman she wasa widow with a very good fortune and my cousin mr ffoulkes married her and it was all owing to her two little ffs mrs fitzadam did not stand a chance of meeting with a mr fitzanything in cranford so that could not have been her motive for settling there miss matty thought it might have been the hope of being admitted into the society of the place which would certainly be a very agreeable rise for cidevant miss hoggins and if this had been her hope it would be cruel to disappoint her so everybody called upon mrs fitzadameverybody but mrs jamieson who used to show how honourable she was by never seeing mrs fitzadam when they met at the cranford parties there would be only eight or ten ladies in the room and mrs fitzadam was the largest of all and she invariably used to stand up when mrs jamieson came in and curtsey very low to her whenever she turned in her directionso low in fact that i think mrs jamieson must have looked at the wall above her for she never moved a muscle of her face no more than if she had not seen her still mrs fitzadam persevered illustration mrs ffarringdon and mr ffoulkes the spring evenings were getting bright and long when three or four ladies in calashes met at miss barkers door do you know what a calash is it is a covering worn over caps not unlike the heads fastened on oldfashioned gigs but sometimes it is not quite so large this kind of headgear always made an awful impression on the children in cranford and now two or three left off their play in the quiet sunny little street and gathered in wondering silence round miss pole miss matty and myself we were silent too so that we could hear loud suppressed whispers inside miss barkers house wait peggy wait till ive run upstairs and washed my hands when i cough open the door ill not be a minute and true enough it was not a minute before we heard a noise between a sneeze and a crow on which the door flew open behind it stood a roundeyed maiden all aghast at the honourable company of calashes who marched in without a word she recovered presence of mind enough to usher us into a small room which had been the shop but was now converted into a temporary dressingroom there we unpinned and shook ourselves and arranged our features before the glass into a sweet and gracious companyface and then bowing backwards with after you maam we allowed mrs forrester to take precedence up the narrow staircase that led to miss barkers drawingroom there she sat as stately and composed as though we had never heard that oddsounding cough from which her throat must have been even then sore and rough kind gentle shabbilydressed mrs forrester was immediately conducted to the second place of honoura seat arranged something like prince alberts near the queensgood but not so good the place of preeminence was of course reserved for the honourable mrs jamieson who presently came panting up the stairscarlo rushing round her on her progress as if he meant to trip her up and now miss betty barker was a proud and happy woman she stirred the fire and shut the door and sat as near to it as she could quite on the edge of her chair when peggy came in tottering under the weight of the teatray i noticed that miss barker was sadly afraid lest peggy should not keep her distance sufficiently she and her mistress were on very familiar terms in their everyday intercourse and peggy wanted now to make several little confidences to her which miss barker was on thorns to hear but which she thought it her duty as a lady to repress so she turned away from all peggys asides and signs but she made one or two very malapropos answers to what was said and at last seized with a bright idea she exclaimed poor sweet carlo im forgetting him come downstairs with me poor ittie doggie and it shall have its tea it shall in a few minutes she returned bland and benignant as before but i thought she had forgotten to give the poor ittie doggie anything to eat judging by the avidity with which he swallowed down chance pieces of cake the teatray was abundantly loadedi was pleased to see it i was so hungry but i was afraid the ladies present might think it vulgarly heaped up i know they would have done at their own houses but somehow the heaps disappeared here i saw mrs jamieson eating seedcake slowly and considerately as she did everything and i was rather surprised for i knew she had told us on the occasion of her last party that she never had it in her house it reminded her so much of scented soap she always gave us savoy biscuits however mrs jamieson was kindly indulgent to miss barkers want of knowledge of the customs of high life and to spare her feelings ate three large pieces of seedcake with a placid ruminating expression of countenance not unlike a cows after tea there was some little demur and difficulty we were six in number four could play at preference and for the other two there was cribbage but all except myself i was rather afraid of the cranford ladies at cards for it was the most earnest and serious business they ever engaged in were anxious to be of the pool even miss barker while declaring she did not know spadille from manille was evidently hankering to take a hand the dilemma was soon put an end to by a singular kind of noise if a barons daughterinlaw could ever be supposed to snore i should have said mrs jamieson did so then for overcome by the heat of the room and inclined to doze by nature the temptation of that very comfortable armchair had been too much for her and mrs jamieson was nodding once or twice she opened her eyes with an effort and calmly but unconsciously smiled upon us but by and by even her benevolence was not equal to this exertion and she was sound asleep it is very gratifying to me whispered miss barker at the cardtable to her three opponents whom notwithstanding her ignorance of the game she was basting most unmercifullyvery gratifying indeed to see how completely mrs jamieson feels at home in my poor little dwelling she could not have paid me a greater compliment miss barker provided me with some literature in the shape of three or four handsomelybound fashionbooks ten or twelve years old observing as she put a little table and a candle for my especial benefit that she knew young people liked to look at pictures carlo lay and snorted and started at his mistresss feet he too was quite at home illustration hush ladies if you please hush the cardtable was an animated scene to watch four ladies heads with niddlenoddling caps all nearly meeting over the middle of the table in their eagerness to whisper quick enough and loud enough and every now and then came miss barkers hush ladies if you please hush mrs jamieson is asleep it was very difficult to steer clear between mrs forresters deafness and mrs jamiesons sleepiness but miss barker managed her arduous task well she repeated the whisper to mrs forrester distorting her face considerably in order to show by the motions of her lips what was said and then she smiled kindly all round at us and murmured to herself very gratifying indeed i wish my poor sister had been alive to see this day presently the door was thrown wide open carlo started to his feet with a loud snapping bark and mrs jamieson awoke or perhaps she had not been asleepas she said almost directly the room had been so light she had been glad to keep her eyes shut but had been listening with great interest to all our amusing and agreeable conversation peggy came in once more red with importance another tray oh gentility thought i can you endure this last shock for miss barker had ordered nay i doubt not prepared although she did say why peggy what have you brought us and looked pleasantly surprised at the unexpected pleasure all sorts of good things for supperscalloped oysters potted lobsters jelly a dish called little cupids which was in great favour with the cranford ladies although too expensive to be given except on solemn and state occasionsmacaroons sopped in brandy i should have called it if i had not known its more refined and classical name in short we were evidently to be feasted with all that was sweetest and best and we thought it better to submit graciously even at the cost of our gentilitywhich never ate suppers in general but which like most nonsuppereaters was particularly hungry on all special occasions miss barker in her former sphere had i daresay been made acquainted with the beverage they call cherrybrandy we none of us had ever seen such a thing and rather shrank back when she proffered it usjust a little leetle glass ladies after the oysters and lobsters you know shellfish are sometimes thought not very wholesome we all shook our heads like female mandarins but at last mrs jamieson suffered herself to be persuaded and we followed her lead it was not exactly unpalatable though so hot and so strong that we thought ourselves bound to give evidence that we were not accustomed to such things by coughing terriblyalmost as strangely as miss barker had done before we were admitted by peggy its very strong said miss pole as she put down her empty glass i do believe theres spirit in it only a little dropjust necessary to make it keep said miss barker you know we put brandypaper over preserves to make them keep i often feel tipsy myself from eating damson tart i question whether damson tart would have opened mrs jamiesons heart as the cherrybrandy did but she told us of a coming event respecting which she had been quite silent till that moment my sisterinlaw lady glenmire is coming to stay with me there was a chorus of indeed and then a pause each one rapidly reviewed her wardrobe as to its fitness to appear in the presence of a barons widow for of course a series of small festivals were always held in cranford on the arrival of a visitor at any of our friends houses we felt very pleasantly excited on the present occasion not long after this the maids and the lanterns were announced mrs jamieson had the sedan chair which had squeezed itself into miss barkers narrow lobby with some difficulty and most literally stopped the way it required some skilful manuvring on the part of the old chairmen shoemakers by day but when summoned to carry the sedan dressed up in a strange old liverylong greatcoats with small capes coeval with the sedan and similar to the dress of the class in hogarths pictures to edge and back and try at it again and finally to succeed in carrying their burden out of miss barkers front door then we heard their quick pitapat along the quiet little street as we put on our calashes and pinned up our gowns miss barker hovering about us with offers of help which if she had not remembered her former occupation and wished us to forget it would have been much more pressing illustration pitapat illustration chapter your ladyship early the next morningdirectly after twelvemiss pole made her appearance at miss mattys some very trifling piece of business was alleged as a reason for the call but there was evidently something behind at last out it came by the way youll think im strangely ignorant but do you really know i am puzzled how we ought to address lady glenmire do you say your ladyship where you would say you to a common person i have been puzzling all morning and are we to say my lady instead of maam now you knew lady arleywill you kindly tell me the most correct way of speaking to the peerage poor miss matty she took off her spectacles and she put them on againbut how lady arley was addressed she could not remember it is so long ago she said dear dear how stupid i am i dont think i ever saw her more than twice i know we used to call sir peter sir peterbut he came much oftener to see us than lady arley did deborah would have known in a minute my ladyyour ladyship it sounds very strange and as if it was not natural i never thought of it before but now you have named it i am all in a puzzle it was very certain miss pole would obtain no wise decision from miss matty who got more bewildered every moment and more perplexed as to etiquettes of address well i really think said miss pole i had better just go and tell mrs forrester about our little difficulty one sometimes grows nervous and yet one would not have lady glenmire think we were quite ignorant of the etiquettes of high life in cranford and will you just step in here dear miss pole as you come back please and tell me what you decide upon whatever you and mrs forrester fix upon will be quite right im sure lady arley sir peter said miss matty to herself trying to recall the old forms of words who is lady glenmire asked i oh shes the widow of mr jamiesonthats mrs jamiesons late husband you knowwidow of his eldest brother mrs jamieson was a miss walker daughter of governor walker your ladyship my dear if they fix on that way of speaking you must just let me practise a little on you first for i shall feel so foolish and hot saying it the first time to lady glenmire it was really a relief to miss matty when mrs jamieson came on a very unpolite errand i notice that apathetic people have more quiet impertinence than others and mrs jamieson came now to insinuate pretty plainly that she did not particularly wish that the cranford ladies should call upon her sisterinlaw i can hardly say how she made this clear for i grew very indignant and warm while with slow deliberation she was explaining her wishes to miss matty who a true lady herself could hardly understand the feeling which made mrs jamieson wish to appear to her noble sisterinlaw as if she only visited county families miss matty remained puzzled and perplexed long after i had found out the object of mrs jamiesons visit when she did understand the drift of the honourable ladys call it was pretty to see with what quiet dignity she received the intimation thus uncourteously given she was not in the least hurtshe was of too gentle a spirit for that nor was she exactly conscious of disapproving of mrs jamiesons conduct but there was something of this feeling in her mind i am sure which made her pass from the subject to others in a less flurried and more composed manner than usual mrs jamieson was indeed the more flurried of the two and i could see she was glad to take her leave a little while afterwards miss pole returned red and indignant well to be sure youve had mrs jamieson here i find from martha and we are not to call on lady glenmire yes i met mrs jamieson halfway between here and mrs forresters and she told me she took me so by surprise i had nothing to say i wish i had thought of something very sharp and sarcastic i daresay i shall tonight and lady glenmire is but the widow of a scotch baron after all i went on to look at mrs forresters peerage to see who this lady was that is to be kept under a glass case widow of a scotch peernever sat in the house of lordsand as poor as job i daresay and shefifth daughter of some mr campbell or other you are the daughter of a rector at any rate and related to the arleys and sir peter might have been viscount arley every one says miss matty tried to soothe miss pole but in vain that lady usually so kind and goodhumoured was now in a full flow of anger and i went and ordered a cap this morning to be quite ready said she at last letting out the secret which gave sting to mrs jamiesons intimation mrs jamieson shall see if it is so easy to get me to make fourth at a pool when she has none of her fine scotch relations with her in coming out of church the first sunday on which lady glenmire appeared in cranford we sedulously talked together and turned our backs on mrs jamieson and her guest if we might not call on her we would not even look at her though we were dying with curiosity to know what she was like we had the comfort of questioning martha in the afternoon martha did not belong to a sphere of society whose observation could be an implied compliment to lady glenmire and martha had made good use of her eyes well maam is it the little lady with mrs jamieson you mean i thought you would like more to know how young mrs smith was dressed her being a bride mrs smith was the butchers wife miss pole said good gracious me as if we cared about a mrs smith but was silent as martha resumed her speech illustration we sedulously talked together the little lady in mrs jamiesons pew had on maam rather an old black silk and a shepherds plaid cloak maam and very bright black eyes she had maam and a pleasant sharp face not over young maam but yet i should guess younger than mrs jamieson herself she looked up and down the church like a bird and nipped up her petticoats when she came out as quick and sharp as ever i see ill tell you what maam shes more like mrs deacon at the coach and horses nor any one hush martha said miss matty thats not respectful isnt it maam i beg pardon im sure but jem hearn said so as well he said she was just such a sharp stirring sort of a body lady said miss pole ladyas mrs deacon another sunday passed away and we still averted our eyes from mrs jamieson and her guest and made remarks to ourselves that we thought were very severealmost too much so miss matty was evidently uneasy at our sarcastic manner of speaking perhaps by this time lady glenmire had found out that mrs jamiesons was not the gayest liveliest house in the world perhaps mrs jamieson had found out that most of the county families were in london and that those who remained in the country were not so alive as they might have been to the circumstance of lady glenmire being in their neighbourhood great events spring out of small causes so i will not pretend to say what induced mrs jamieson to alter her determination of excluding the cranford ladies and send notes of invitation all round for a small party on the following tuesday mr mulliner himself brought them round he would always ignore the fact of there being a backdoor to any house and gave a louder rattat than his mistress mrs jamieson he had three little notes which he carried in a large basket in order to impress his mistress with an idea of their great weight though they might easily have gone into his waistcoat pocket illustration mr mulliner miss matty and i quietly decided we would have a previous engagement at home it was the evening on which miss matty usually made candlelighters of all the notes and letters of the week for on mondays her accounts were always made straightnot a penny owing from the week before so by a natural arrangement making candlelighters fell upon a tuesday evening and gave us a legitimate excuse for declining mrs jamiesons invitation but before our answer was written in came miss pole with an open note in her hand so she said ah i see you have got your note too better late than never i could have told my lady glenmire she would be glad enough of our society before a fortnight was over yes said miss matty were asked for tuesday evening and perhaps you would just kindly bring your work across and drink tea with us that night it is my usual regular time for looking over the last weeks bills and notes and letters and making candlelighters of them but that does not seem quite reason enough for saying i have a previous engagement at home though i meant to make it do now if you would come my conscience would be quite at ease and luckily the note is not written yet i saw miss poles countenance change while miss matty was speaking dont you mean to go then asked she oh no said miss matty quietly you dont either i suppose i dont know replied miss pole yes i think i do said she rather briskly and on seeing miss matty looked surprised she added you see one would not like mrs jamieson to think that anything she could do or say was of consequence enough to give offence it would be a kind of letting down of ourselves that i for one should not like it would be too flattering to mrs jamieson if we allowed her to suppose that what she had said affected us a week nay ten days afterwards well i suppose it is wrong to be hurt and annoyed so long about anything and perhaps after all she did not mean to vex us but i must say i could not have brought myself to say the things mrs jamieson did about our not calling i really dont think i shall go oh come miss matty you must go you know our friend mrs jamieson is much more phlegmatic than most people and does not enter into the little delicacies of feeling which you possess in so remarkable a degree i thought you possessed them too that day mrs jamieson called to tell us not to go said miss matty innocently but miss pole in addition to her delicacies of feeling possessed a very smart cap which she was anxious to show to an admiring world and so she seemed to forget all her angry words uttered not a fortnight before and to be ready to act on what she called the great christian principle of forgive and forget and she lectured dear miss matty so long on this head that she absolutely ended by assuring her it was her duty as a deceased rectors daughter to buy a new cap and go to the party at mrs jamiesons so we were most happy to accept instead of regretting that we were obliged to decline the expenditure on dress in cranford was principally in that one article referred to if the heads were buried in smart new caps the ladies were like ostriches and cared not what became of their bodies old gowns white and venerable collars any number of brooches up and down and everywhere some with dogs eyes painted in them some that were like small pictureframes with mausoleums and weepingwillows neatly executed in hair inside some again with miniatures of ladies and gentlemen sweetly smiling out of a nest of stiff muslin old brooches for a permanent ornament and new caps to suit the fashion of the daythe ladies of cranford always dressed with chaste elegance and propriety as miss barker once prettily expressed it illustration miss pole and the brooches and with three new caps and a greater array of brooches than had ever been seen together at one time since cranford was a town did mrs forrester and miss matty and miss pole appear on that memorable tuesday evening i counted seven brooches myself on miss poles dress two were fixed negligently in her cap one was a butterfly made of scotch pebbles which a vivid imagination might believe to be the real insect one fastened her net neckerchief one her collar one ornamented the front of her gown midway between her throat and waist and another adorned the point of her stomacher where the seventh was i have forgotten but it was somewhere about her i am sure but i am getting on too fast in describing the dresses of the company i should first relate the gathering on the way to mrs jamiesons that lady lived in a large house just outside the town a road which had known what it was to be a street ran right before the house which opened out upon it without any intervening garden or court whatever the sun was about he never shone on the front of that house to be sure the living rooms were at the back looking on to a pleasant garden the front windows only belonged to kitchens and housekeepers rooms and pantries and in one of them mr mulliner was reported to sit indeed looking askance we often saw the back of a head covered with hairpowder which also extended itself over his coatcollar down to his very waist and this imposing back was always engaged in reading the st jamess chronicle opened wide which in some degree accounted for the length of time the said newspaper was in reaching usequal subscribers with mrs jamieson though in right of her honourableness she always had the reading of it first this very tuesday the delay in forwarding the last number had been particularly aggravating just when both miss pole and miss matty the former more especially had been wanting to see it in order to coach up the court news ready for the evenings interview with the aristocracy miss pole told us she had absolutely taken time by the forelock and been dressed by five oclock in order to be ready if the st jamess chronicle should come in at the last momentthe very st jamess chronicle which the powdered head was tranquilly and composedly reading as we passed the accustomed window this evening the impudence of the man said miss pole in a low indignant whisper i should like to ask him whether his mistress pays her quartershare for his exclusive use we looked at her in admiration of the courage of her thought for mr mulliner was an object of great awe to all of us he seemed never to have forgotten his condescension in coming to live at cranford miss jenkyns at times had stood forth as the undaunted champion of her sex and spoken to him on terms of equality but even miss jenkyns could get no higher in his pleasantest and most gracious moods he looked like a sulky cockatoo he did not speak except in gruff monosyllables he would wait in the hall when we begged him not to wait and then look deeply offended because we had kept him there while with trembling hasty hands we prepared ourselves for appearing in company miss pole ventured on a small joke as we went upstairs intended though addressed to us to afford mr mulliner some slight amusement we all smiled in order to seem as if we felt at our ease and timidly looked for mr mulliners sympathy not a muscle of that wooden face had relaxed and we were grave in an instant mrs jamiesons drawingroom was cheerful the evening sun came streaming into it and the large square window was clustered round with flowers the furniture was white and gold not the later style louis quatorze i think they call it all shells and twirls no mrs jamiesons chairs and tables had not a curve or bend about them the chair and table legs diminished as they neared the ground and were straight and square in all their corners the chairs were all arow against the walls with the exception of four or five which stood in a circle round the fire they were railed with white bars across the back and nobbed with gold neither the railings nor the nobs invited to ease there was a japanned table devoted to literature on which lay a bible a peerage and a prayerbook there was another square pembroke table dedicated to the fine arts on which were a kaleidoscope conversationcards puzzlecards tied together to an interminable length with faded pink satin ribbon and a box painted in fond imitation of the drawings which decorate teachests carlo lay on the worstedworked rug and ungraciously barked at us as we entered mrs jamieson stood up giving us each a torpid smile of welcome and looking helplessly beyond us at mr mulliner as if she hoped he would place us in chairs for if he did not she never could i suppose he thought we could find our way to the circle round the fire which reminded me of stonehenge i dont know why lady glenmire came to the rescue of our hostess and somehow or other we found ourselves for the first time placed agreeably and not formally in mrs jamiesons house lady glenmire now we had time to look at her proved to be a bright little woman of middle age who had been very pretty in the days of her youth and who was even yet very pleasantlooking i saw miss pole appraising her dress in the first five minutes and i take her word when she said the next day my dear ten pounds would have purchased every stitch she had onlace and all it was pleasant to suspect that a peeress could be poor and partly reconciled us to the fact that her husband had never sat in the house of lords which when we first heard of it seemed a kind of swindling us out of our respect on false pretences a sort of a lord and no lord business we were all very silent at first we were thinking what we could talk about that should be high enough to interest my lady there had been a rise in the price of sugar which as preservingtime was near was a piece of intelligence to all our housekeeping hearts and would have been the natural topic if lady glenmire had not been by but we were not sure if the peerage ate preservesmuch less knew how they were made at last miss pole who had always a great deal of courage and savoir faire spoke to lady glenmire who on her part had seemed just as much puzzled to know how to break the silence as we were has your ladyship been to court lately asked she and then gave a little glance round at us half timid and half triumphant as much as to say see how judiciously i have chosen a subject befitting the rank of the stranger i never was there in my life said lady glenmire with a broad scotch accent but in a very sweet voice and then as if she had been too abrupt she added we very seldom went to londononly twice in fact during all my married life and before i was married my father had far too large a family fifth daughter of mr campbell was in all our minds i am sure to take us often from our home even to edinburgh yell have been in edinburgh maybe said she suddenly brightening up with the hope of a common interest we had none of us been there but miss pole had an uncle who once had passed a night there which was very pleasant mrs jamieson meanwhile was absorbed in wonder why mr mulliner did not bring the tea and at length the wonder oozed out of her mouth i had better ring the bell my dear had not i said lady glenmire briskly noi think notmulliner does not like to be hurried we should have liked our tea for we dined at an earlier hour than mrs jamieson i suspect mr mulliner had to finish the st jamess chronicle before he chose to trouble himself about tea his mistress fidgeted and fidgeted and kept saying i cant think why mulliner does not bring tea i cant think what he can be about and lady glenmire at last grew quite impatient but it was a pretty kind of impatience after all and she rang the bell rather sharply on receiving a halfpermission from her sisterinlaw to do so mr mulliner appeared in dignified surprise oh said mrs jamieson lady glenmire rang the bell i believe it was for tea illustration in dignified surprise in a few minutes tea was brought very delicate was the china very old the plate very thin the bread and butter and very small the lumps of sugar sugar was evidently mrs jamiesons favourite economy i question if the little filigree sugartongs made something like scissors could have opened themselves wide enough to take up an honest vulgar goodsized piece and when i tried to seize two little minnikin pieces at once so as not to be detected in too many returns to the sugarbasin they absolutely dropped one with a little sharp clatter quite in a malicious and unnatural manner but before this happened we had had a slight disappointment in the little silver jug was cream in the larger one was milk as soon as mr mulliner came in carlo began to beg which was a thing our manners forbade us to do though i am sure we were just as hungry and mrs jamieson said she was certain we would excuse her if she gave her poor dumb carlo his tea first she accordingly mixed a saucerful for him and put it down for him to lap and then she told us how intelligent and sensible the dear little fellow was he knew cream quite well and constantly refused tea with only milk in it so the milk was left for us but we silently thought we were quite as intelligent and sensible as carlo and felt as if insult were added to injury when we were called upon to admire the gratitude evinced by his wagging his tail for the cream which should have been ours after tea we thawed down into common lifesubjects we were thankful to lady glenmire for having proposed some more bread and butter and this mutual want made us better acquainted with her than we should ever have been with talking about the court though miss pole did say she had hoped to know how the dear queen was from some one who had seen her the friendship begun over bread and butter extended on to cards lady glenmire played preference to admiration and was a complete authority as to ombre and quadrille even miss pole quite forgot to say my lady and your ladyship and said basto maam you have spadille i believe just as quietly as if we had never held the great cranford parliament on the subject of the proper mode of addressing a peeress as a proof of how thoroughly we had forgotten that we were in the presence of one who might have sat down to tea with a coronet instead of a cap on her head mrs forrester related a curious little fact to lady glenmirean anecdote known to the circle of her intimate friends but of which even mrs jamieson was not aware it related to some fine old lace the sole relic of better days which lady glenmire was admiring on mrs forresters collar yes said that lady such lace cannot be got now for either love or money made by the nuns abroad they tell me they say that they cant make it now even there but perhaps they can now theyve passed the catholic emancipation bill i should not wonder but in the meantime i treasure up my lace very much i darent even trust the washing of it to my maid the little charity schoolgirl i have named before but who sounded well as my maid i always wash it myself and once it had a narrow escape of course your ladyship knows that such lace must never be starched or ironed some people wash it in sugar and water and some in coffee to make it the right yellow colour but i myself have a very good receipt for washing it in milk which stiffens it enough and gives it a very good creamy colour well maam i had tacked it together and the beauty of this fine lace is that when it is wet it goes into a very little space and put it to soak in milk when unfortunately i left the room on my return i found pussy on the table looking very like a thief but gulping very uncomfortably as if she was halfchoked with something she wanted to swallow and could not and would you believe it at first i pitied her and said poor pussy poor pussy till all at once i looked and saw the cup of milk emptycleaned out you naughty cat said i and i believe i was provoked enough to give her a slap which did no good but only helped the lace downjust as one slaps a choking child on the back i could have cried i was so vexed but i determined i would not give the lace up without a struggle for it i hoped the lace might disagree with her at any rate but it would have been too much for job if he had seen as i did that cat come in quite placid and purring not a quarter of an hour after and almost expecting to be stroked no pussy said i if you have any conscience you ought not to expect that and then a thought struck me and i rang the bell for my maid and sent her to mr hoggins with my compliments and would he be kind enough to lend me one of his topboots for an hour i did not think there was anything odd in the message but jenny said the young men in the surgery laughed as if they would be ill at my wanting a topboot when it came jenny and i put pussy in with her forefeet straight down so that they were fastened and could not scratch and we gave her a teaspoonful of currantjelly in which your ladyship must excuse me i had mixed some tartar emetic i shall never forget how anxious i was for the next halfhour i took pussy to my own room and spread a clean towel on the floor i could have kissed her when she returned the lace to sight very much as it had gone down jenny had boiling water ready and we soaked it and soaked it and spread it on a lavenderbush in the sun before i could touch it again even to put it in milk but now your ladyship would never guess that it had been in pussys inside we found out in the course of the evening that lady glenmire was going to pay mrs jamieson a long visit as she had given up her apartments in edinburgh and had no ties to take her back there in a hurry on the whole we were rather glad to hear this for she had made a pleasant impression upon us and it was also very comfortable to find from things which dropped out in the course of conversation that in addition to many other genteel qualities she was far removed from the vulgarity of wealth dont you find it very unpleasant walking asked mrs jamieson as our respective servants were announced it was a pretty regular question from mrs jamieson who had her own carriage in the coachhouse and always went out in a sedanchair to the very shortest distances the answers were nearly as much a matter of course oh dear no it is so pleasant and still at night such a refreshment after the excitement of a party the stars are so beautiful this last was from miss matty are you fond of astronomy lady glenmire asked not very replied miss matty rather confused at the moment to remember which was astronomy and which was astrologybut the answer was true under either circumstance for she read and was slightly alarmed at francis moores astrological predictions and as to astronomy in a private and confidential conversation she had told me she never could believe that the earth was moving constantly and that she would not believe it if she could it made her feel so tired and dizzy whenever she thought about it in our pattens we picked our way home with extra care that night so refined and delicate were our perceptions after drinking tea with my lady illustration chapter tailpiece illustration chapter signor brunoni soon after the events of which i gave an account in my last paper i was summoned home by my fathers illness and for a time i forgot in anxiety about him to wonder how my dear friends at cranford were getting on or how lady glenmire could reconcile herself to the dulness of the long visit which she was still paying to her sisterinlaw mrs jamieson when my father grew a little stronger i accompanied him to the seaside so that altogether i seemed banished from cranford and was deprived of the opportunity of hearing any chance intelligence of the dear little town for the greater part of that year late in novemberwhen we had returned home again and my father was once more in good healthi received a letter from miss matty and a very mysterious letter it was she began many sentences without ending them running them one into another in much the same confused sort of way in which written words run together on blottingpaper all i could make out was that if my father was better which she hoped he was and would take warning and wear a greatcoat from michaelmas to ladyday if turbans were in fashion could i tell her such a piece of gaiety was going to happen as had not been seen or known of since wombwells lions came when one of them ate a little childs arm and she was perhaps too old to care about dress but a new cap she must have and having heard that turbans were worn and some of the county families likely to come she would like to look tidy if i would bring her a cap from the milliner i employed and oh dear how careless of her to forget that she wrote to beg i would come and pay her a visit next tuesday when she hoped to have something to offer me in the way of amusement which she would not now more particularly describe only seagreen was her favourite colour so she ended her letter but in a ps she added she thought she might as well tell me what was the peculiar attraction to cranford just now signor brunoni was going to exhibit his wonderful magic in the cranford assembly rooms on wednesday and friday evening in the following week i was very glad to accept the invitation from my dear miss matty independently of the conjuror and most particularly anxious to prevent her from disfiguring her small gentle mousey face with a great saracens head turban and accordingly i bought her a pretty neat middleaged cap which however was rather a disappointment to her when on my arrival she followed me into my bedroom ostensibly to poke the fire but in reality i do believe to see if the seagreen turban was not inside the capbox with which i had travelled it was in vain that i twirled the cap round on my hand to exhibit back and sidefronts her heart had been set upon a turban and all she could do was to say with resignation in her look and voice i am sure you did your best my dear it is just like the caps all the ladies in cranford are wearing and they have had theirs for a year i daresay i should have liked something newer i confesssomething more like the turbans miss betty barker tells me queen adelaide wears but it is very pretty my dear and i daresay lavender will wear better than seagreen well after all what is dress that we should care about it youll tell me if you want anything my dear here is the bell i suppose turbans have not got down to drumble yet so saying the dear old lady gently bemoaned herself out of the room leaving me to dress for the evening when as she informed me she expected miss pole and mrs forrester and she hoped i should not feel myself too much tired to join the party of course i should not and i made some haste to unpack and arrange my dress but with all my speed i heard the arrivals and the buzz of conversation in the next room before i was ready just as i opened the door i caught the words i was foolish to expect anything very genteel out of the drumble shops poor girl she did her best ive no doubt but for all that i had rather that she blamed drumble and me than disfigured herself with a turban miss pole was always the person in the trio of cranford ladies now assembled to have had adventures she was in the habit of spending the morning in rambling from shop to shop not to purchase anything except an occasional reel of cotton or a piece of tape but to see the new articles and report upon them and to collect all the stray pieces of intelligence in the town she had a way too of demurely popping hither and thither into all sorts of places to gratify her curiosity on any pointa way which if she had not looked so very genteel and prim might have been considered impertinent and now by the expressive way in which she cleared her throat and waited for all minor subjects such as caps and turbans to be cleared off the course we knew she had something very particular to relate when the due pause cameand i defy any people possessed of common modesty to keep up a conversation long where one among them sits up aloft in silence looking down upon all the things they chance to say as trivial and contemptible compared to what they could disclose if properly entreated miss pole began as i was stepping out of gordons shop today i chanced to go into the george my betty has a secondcousin who is chambermaid there and i thought betty would like to hear how she was and not seeing any one about i strolled up the staircase and found myself in the passage leading to the assembly room you and i remember the assembly room i am sure miss matty and the menuets de la cour so i went on not thinking of what i was about when all at once i perceived that i was in the middle of the preparations for tomorrow nightthe room being divided with great clothesmaids over which crosbys men were tacking red flannel very dark and odd it seemed it quite bewildered me and i was going on behind the screens in my absence of mind when a gentleman quite the gentleman i can assure you stepped forwards and asked if i had any business he could arrange for me he spoke such pretty broken english i could not help thinking of thaddeus of warsaw and the hungarian brothers and santo sebastiani and while i was busy picturing his past life to myself he had bowed me out of the room but wait a minute you have not heard half my story yet i was going downstairs when who should i meet but bettys secondcousin so of course i stopped to speak to her for bettys sake and she told me that i had really seen the conjurorthe gentleman who spoke broken english was signor brunoni himself just at this moment he passed us on the stairs making such a graceful bow in reply to which i dropped a curtseyall foreigners have such polite manners one catches something of it but when he had gone downstairs i bethought me that i had dropped my glove in the assembly room it was safe in my muff all the time but i never found it till afterwards so i went back and just as i was creeping up the passage left on one side of the great screen that goes nearly across the room who should i see but the very same gentleman that had met me before and passed me on the stairs coming now forwards from the inner part of the room to which there is no entranceyou remember miss mattyand just repeating in his pretty broken english the inquiry if i had any business therei dont mean that he put it quite so bluntly but he seemed very determined that i should not pass the screenso of course i explained about my glove which curiously enough i found at that very moment illustration making such a graceful bow miss pole then had seen the conjurorthe real live conjuror and numerous were the questions we all asked her had he a beard was he young or old fair or dark did he lookunable to shape my question prudently i put it in another formhow did he look in short miss pole was the heroine of the evening owing to her mornings encounter if she was not the rose that is to say the conjuror she had been near it conjuration sleight of hand magic witchcraft were the subjects of the evening miss pole was slightly sceptical and inclined to think there might be a scientific solution found for even the proceedings of the witch of endor mrs forrester believed everything from ghosts to deathwatches miss matty ranged between the twoalways convinced by the last speaker i think she was naturally more inclined to mrs forresters side but a desire of proving herself a worthy sister to miss jenkyns kept her equally balancedmiss jenkyns who would never allow a servant to call the little rolls of tallow that formed themselves round candles windingsheets but insisted on their being spoken of as roleypoleys a sister of hers to be superstitious it would never do after tea i was despatched downstairs into the diningparlour for that volume of the old encyclopdia which contained the nouns beginning with c in order that miss pole might prime herself with scientific explanations for the tricks of the following evening it spoilt the pool at preference which miss matty and mrs forrester had been looking forward to for miss pole became so much absorbed in her subject and the plates by which it was illustrated that we felt it would be cruel to disturb her otherwise than by one or two welltimed yawns which i threw in now and then for i was really touched by the meek way in which the two ladies were bearing their disappointment but miss pole only read the more zealously imparting to us no more interesting information than this ah i see i comprehend perfectly a represents the ball put a between b and dno between c and f and turn the second joint of the third finger of your left hand over the wrist of your right h very clear indeed my dear mrs forrester conjuring and witchcraft is a mere affair of the alphabet do let me read you this one passage mrs forrester implored miss pole to spare her saying from a child upwards she never could understand being read aloud to and i dropped the pack of cards which i had been shuffling very audibly and by this discreet movement i obliged miss pole to perceive that preference was to have been the order of the evening and to propose rather unwillingly that the pool should commence the pleasant brightness that stole over the other two ladies faces on this miss matty had one or two twinges of selfreproach for having interrupted miss pole in her studies and did not remember her cards well or give her full attention to the game until she had soothed her conscience by offering to lend the volume of the encyclopdia to miss pole who accepted it thankfully and said betty should take it home when she came with the lantern the next evening we were all in a little gentle flutter at the idea of the gaiety before us miss matty went up to dress betimes and hurried me until i was ready when we found we had an hour and a half to wait before the doors opened at seven precisely and we had only twenty yards to go however as miss matty said it would not do to get too much absorbed in anything and forget the time so she thought we had better sit quietly without lighting the candles till five minutes to seven so miss matty dozed and i knitted at length we set off and at the door under the carriageway at the george we met mrs forrester and miss pole the latter was discussing the subject of the evening with more vehemence than ever and throwing and at our heads like hailstones she had even copied one or two of the receiptsas she called themfor the different tricks on backs of letters ready to explain and to detect signor brunonis arts we went into the cloakroom adjoining the assembly room miss matty gave a sigh or two to her departed youth and the remembrance of the last time she had been there as she adjusted her pretty new cap before the strange quaint old mirror in the cloakroom the assembly room had been added to the inn about a hundred years before by the different county families who met together there once a month during the winter to dance and play at cards many a county beauty had first swum through the minuet that she afterwards danced before queen charlotte in this very room it was said that one of the gunnings had graced the apartment with her beauty it was certain that a rich and beautiful widow lady williams had here been smitten with the noble figure of a young artist who was staying with some family in the neighbourhood for professional purposes and accompanied his patrons to the cranford assembly and a pretty bargain poor lady williams had of her handsome husband if all tales were true now no beauty blushed and dimpled along the sides of the cranford assembly room no handsome artist won hearts by his bow chapeau bras in hand the old room was dingy the salmoncoloured paint had faded into a drab great pieces of plaster had chipped off from the white wreaths and festoons on its walls but still a mouldy odour of aristocracy lingered about the place and a dusty recollection of the days that were gone made miss matty and mrs forrester bridle up as they entered and walk mincingly up the room as if there were a number of genteel observers instead of two little boys with a stick of toffy between them with which to beguile the time illustration walk mincingly up the room we stopped short at the second front row i could hardly understand why until i heard miss pole ask a stray waiter if any of the county families were expected and when he shook his head and believed not mrs forrester and miss matty moved forwards and our party represented a conversational square the front row was soon augmented and enriched by lady glenmire and mrs jamieson we six occupied the two front rows and our aristocratic seclusion was respected by the groups of shopkeepers who strayed in from time to time and huddled together on the back benches at least i conjectured so from the noise they made and the sonorous bumps they gave in sitting down but when in weariness of the obstinate green curtain that would not draw up but would stare at me with two odd eyes seen through holes as in the old tapestry story i would fain have looked round at the merry chattering people behind me miss pole clutched my arm and begged me not to turn for it was not the thing what the thing was i never could find out but it must have been something eminently dull and tiresome however we all sat eyes right square front gazing at the tantalising curtain and hardly speaking intelligibly we were so afraid of being caught in the vulgarity of making any noise in a place of public amusement mrs jamieson was the most fortunate for she fell asleep at length the eyes disappearedthe curtain quiveredone side went up before the other which stuck fast it was dropped again and with a fresh effort and a vigorous pull from some unseen hand it flew up revealing to our sight a magnificent gentleman in the turkish costume seated before a little table gazing at us i should have said with the same eyes that i had last seen through the hole in the curtain with calm and condescending dignity like a being of another sphere as i heard a sentimental voice ejaculate behind me thats not signor brunoni said miss pole decidedly and so audibly that i am sure he heard for he glanced down over his flowing beard at our party with an air of mute reproach signor brunoni had no beardbut perhaps hell come soon so she lulled herself into patience meanwhile miss matty had reconnoitred through her eyeglass wiped it and looked again then she turned round and said to me in a kind mild sorrowful tone you see my dear turbans are worn but we had no time for more conversation the grand turk as miss pole chose to call him arose and announced himself as signor brunoni i dont believe him exclaimed miss pole in a defiant manner he looked at her again with the same dignified upbraiding in his countenance i dont she repeated more positively than ever signor brunoni had not got that muffy sort of thing about his chin but looked like a closeshaved christian gentleman miss poles energetic speeches had the good effect of wakening up mrs jamieson who opened her eyes wide in sign of the deepest attentiona proceeding which silenced miss pole and encouraged the grand turk to proceed which he did in very broken englishso broken that there was no cohesion between the parts of his sentences a fact which he himself perceived at last and so left off speaking and proceeded to action now we were astonished how he did his tricks i could not imagine no not even when miss pole pulled out her pieces of paper and began reading aloudor at least in a very audible whisperthe separate receipts for the most common of his tricks if ever i saw a man frown and look enraged i saw the grand turk frown at miss pole but as she said what could be expected but unchristian looks from a mussulman if miss pole were sceptical and more engrossed with her receipts and diagrams than with his tricks miss matty and mrs forrester were mystified and perplexed to the highest degree mrs jamieson kept taking her spectacles off and wiping them as if she thought it was something defective in them which made the legerdemain and lady glenmire who had seen many curious sights in edinburgh was very much struck with the tricks and would not at all agree with miss pole who declared that anybody could do them with a little practice and that she would herself undertake to do all he did with two hours given to study the encyclopdia and make her third finger flexible at last miss matty and mrs forrester became perfectly awestricken they whispered together i sat just behind them so i could not help hearing what they were saying miss matty asked mrs forrester if she thought it was quite right to have come to see such things she could not help fearing they were lending encouragement to something that was not quite a little shake of the head filled up the blank mrs forrester replied that the same thought had crossed her mind she too was feeling very uncomfortable it was so very strange she was quite certain that it was her pockethandkerchief which was in that loaf just now and it had been in her own hand not five minutes before she wondered who had furnished the bread she was sure it could not be dakin because he was the churchwarden suddenly miss matty halfturned towards me will you look my dearyou are a stranger in the town and it wont give rise to unpleasant reportswill you just look round and see if the rector is here if he is i think we may conclude that this wonderful man is sanctioned by the church and that will be a great relief to my mind illustration the church smiling approval i looked and i saw the tall thin dry dusty rector sitting surrounded by national school boys guarded by troops of his own sex from any approach of the many cranford spinsters his kind face was all agape with broad smiles and the boys around him were in chinks of laughing i told miss matty that the church was smiling approval which set her mind at ease i have never named mr hayter the rector because i as a welltodo and happy young woman never came in contact with him he was an old bachelor but as afraid of matrimonial reports getting abroad about him as any girl of eighteen and he would rush into a shop or drive down an entry sooner than encounter any of the cranford ladies in the street and as for the preference parties i did not wonder at his not accepting invitations to them to tell the truth i always suspected miss pole of having given very vigorous chase to mr hayter when he first came to cranford and not the less because now she appeared to share so vividly in his dread lest her name should ever be coupled with his he found all his interests among the poor and helpless he had treated the national school boys this very night to the performance and virtue was for once its own reward for they guarded him right and left and clung round him as if he had been the queenbee and they the swarm he felt so safe in their environment that he could even afford to give our party a bow as we filed out miss pole ignored his presence and pretended to be absorbed in convincing us that we had been cheated and had not seen signor brunoni after all i think a series of circumstances dated from signor brunonis visit to cranford which seemed at the time connected in our minds with him though i dont know that he had anything really to do with them all at once all sorts of uncomfortable rumours got afloat in the town there were one or two robberiesreal bon fide robberies men had up before the magistrates and committed for trialand that seemed to make us all afraid of being robbed and for a long time at miss mattys i know we used to make a regular expedition all round the kitchens and cellars every night miss matty leading the way armed with the poker i following with the hearthbrush and martha carrying the shovel and fireirons with which to sound the alarm and by the accidental hitting together of them she often frightened us so much that we bolted ourselves up all three together in the backkitchen or storeroom or wherever we happened to be till when our affright was over we recollected ourselves and set out afresh with double valiance by day we heard strange stories from the shopkeepers and cottagers of carts that went about in the dead of night drawn by horses shod with felt and guarded by men in dark clothes going round the town no doubt in search of some unwatched house or some unfastened door illustration a regular expedition miss pole who affected great bravery herself was the principal person to collect and arrange these reports so as to make them assume their most fearful aspect but we discovered that she had begged one of mr hogginss wornout hats to hang up in her lobby and we at least i had doubts as to whether she really would enjoy the little adventure of having her house broken into as she protested she should miss matty made no secret of being an arrant coward but she went regularly through her housekeepers duty of inspectiononly the hour for this became earlier and earlier till at last we went the rounds at halfpast six and miss matty adjourned to bed soon after seven in order to get the night over the sooner cranford had so long piqued itself on being an honest and moral town that it had grown to fancy itself too genteel and wellbred to be otherwise and felt the stain upon its character at this time doubly but we comforted ourselves with the assurance which we gave to each other that the robberies could never have been committed by any cranford person it must have been a stranger or strangers who brought this disgrace upon the town and occasioned as many precautions as if we were living among the red indians or the french this last comparison of our nightly state of defence and fortification was made by mrs forrester whose father had served under general burgoyne in the american war and whose husband had fought the french in spain she indeed inclined to the idea that in some way the french were connected with the small thefts which were ascertained facts and the burglaries and highway robberies which were rumours she had been deeply impressed with the idea of french spies at some time in her life and the notion could never be fairly eradicated but sprang up again from time to time and now her theory was this the cranford people respected themselves too much and were too grateful to the aristocracy who were so kind as to live near the town ever to disgrace their bringing up by being dishonest or immoral therefore we must believe that the robbers were strangersif strangers why not foreignersif foreigners who so likely as the french signor brunoni spoke broken english like a frenchman and though he wore a turban like a turk mrs forrester had seen a print of madame de stal with a turban on and another of mr denon in just such a dress as that in which the conjuror had made his appearance showing clearly that the french as well as the turks wore turbans there could be no doubt signor brunoni was a frenchmana french spy come to discover the weak and undefended places of england and doubtless he had his accomplices for her part she mrs forrester had always had her own opinion of miss poles adventure at the george innseeing two men where only one was believed to be french people had ways and means which she was thankful to say the english knew nothing about and she had never felt quite easy in her mind about going to see that conjurorit was rather too much like a forbidden thing though the rector was there in short mrs forrester grew more excited than we had ever known her before and being an officers daughter and widow we looked up to her opinion of course really i do not know how much was true or false in the reports which flew about like wildfire just at this time but it seemed to me then that there was every reason to believe that at mardon a small town about eight miles from cranford houses and shops were entered by holes made in the walls the bricks being silently carried away in the dead of the night and all done so quietly that no sound was heard either in or out of the house miss matty gave it up in despair when she heard of this what was the use said she of locks and bolts and bells to the windows and going round the house every night that last trick was fit for a conjuror now she did believe that signor brunoni was at the bottom of it one afternoon about five oclock we were startled by a hasty knock at the door miss matty bade me run and tell martha on no account to open the door till she miss matty had reconnoitred through the window and she armed herself with a footstool to drop down on the head of the visitor in case he should show a face covered with black crape as he looked up in answer to her inquiry of who was there but it was nobody but miss pole and betty the former came upstairs carrying a little handbasket and she was evidently in a state of great agitation take care of that said she to me as i offered to relieve her of her basket its my plate i am sure there is a plan to rob my house tonight i am come to throw myself on your hospitality miss matty betty is going to sleep with her cousin at the george i can sit up here all night if you will allow me but my house is so far from any neighbours and i dont believe we could be heard if we screamed ever so but said miss matty what has alarmed you so much have you seen any men lurking about the house oh yes answered miss pole two very badlooking men have gone three times past the house very slowly and an irish beggarwoman came not halfanhour ago and all but forced herself in past betty saying her children were starving and she must speak to the mistress you see she said mistress though there was a hat hanging up in the hall and it would have been more natural to have said master but betty shut the door in her face and came up to me and we got the spoons together and sat in the parlourwindow watching till we saw thomas jones going from his work when we called to him and asked him to take care of us into the town illustration armed with a footstool we might have triumphed over miss pole who had professed such bravery until she was frightened but we were too glad to perceive that she shared in the weaknesses of humanity to exult over her and i gave up my room to her very willingly and shared miss mattys bed for the night but before we retired the two ladies rummaged up out of the recesses of their memory such horrid stories of robbery and murder that i quite quaked in my shoes miss pole was evidently anxious to prove that such terrible events had occurred within her experience that she was justified in her sudden panic and miss matty did not like to be outdone and capped every story with one yet more horrible till it reminded me oddly enough of an old story i had read somewhere of a nightingale and a musician who strove one against the other which could produce the most admirable music till poor philomel dropped down dead one of the stories that haunted me for a long time afterwards was of a girl who was left in charge of a great house in cumberland on some particular fairday when the other servants all went off to the gaieties the family were away in london and a pedlar came by and asked to leave his large and heavy pack in the kitchen saying he would call for it again at night and the girl a gamekeepers daughter roaming about in search of amusement chanced to hit upon a gun hanging up in the hall and took it down to look at the chasing and it went off through the open kitchen door hit the pack and a slow dark thread of blood came oozing out how miss pole enjoyed this part of the story dwelling on each word as if she loved it she rather hurried over the further account of the girls bravery and i have but a confused idea that somehow she baffled the robbers with italian irons heated redhot and then restored to blackness by being dipped in grease we parted for the night with an awestricken wonder as to what we should hear of in the morningand on my part with a vehement desire for the night to be over and gone i was so afraid lest the robbers should have seen from some dark lurkingplace that miss pole had carried off her plate and thus have a double motive for attacking our house but until lady glenmire came to call next day we heard of nothing unusual the kitchen fireirons were in exactly the same position against the back door as when martha and i had skilfully piled them up like spillikins ready to fall with an awful clatter if only a cat had touched the outside panels i had wondered what we should all do if thus awakened and alarmed and had proposed to miss matty that we should cover up our faces under the bedclothes so that there should be no danger of the robbers thinking that we could identify them but miss matty who was trembling very much scouted this idea and said we owed it to society to apprehend them and that she should certainly do her best to lay hold of them and lock them up in the garret till morning illustration called out valiantly when lady glenmire came we almost felt jealous of her mrs jamiesons house had really been attacked at least there were mens footsteps to be seen on the flower borders underneath the kitchen windows where nae men should be and carlo had barked all through the night as if strangers were abroad mrs jamieson had been awakened by lady glenmire and they had rung the bell which communicated with mr mulliners room in the third story and when his nightcapped head had appeared over the banisters in answer to the summons they had told him of their alarm and the reasons for it whereupon he retreated into his bedroom and locked the door for fear of draughts as he informed them in the morning and opened the window and called out valiantly to say if the supposed robbers would come to him he would fight them but as lady glenmire observed that was but poor comfort since they would have to pass by mrs jamiesons room and her own before they could reach him and must be of a very pugnacious disposition indeed if they neglected the opportunities of robbery presented by the unguarded lower stories to go up to a garret and there force a door in order to get at the champion of the house lady glenmire after waiting and listening for some time in the drawingroom had proposed to mrs jamieson that they should go to bed but that lady said she should not feel comfortable unless she sat up and watched and accordingly she packed herself warmly up on the sofa where she was found by the housemaid when she came into the room at six oclock fast asleep but lady glenmire went to bed and kept awake all night when miss pole heard of this she nodded her head in great satisfaction she had been sure we should hear of something happening in cranford that night and we had heard it was clear enough they had first proposed to attack her house but when they saw that she and betty were on their guard and had carried off the plate they had changed their tactics and gone to mrs jamiesons and no one knew what might have happened if carlo had not barked like a good dog as he was poor carlo his barking days were nearly over whether the gang who infested the neighbourhood were afraid of him or whether they were revengeful enough for the way in which he had baffled them on the night in question to poison him or whether as some among the more uneducated people thought he died of apoplexy brought on by too much feeding and too little exercise at any rate it is certain that two days after this eventful night carlo was found dead with his poor little legs stretched out stiff in the attitude of running as if by such unusual exertion he could escape the sure pursuer death we were all sorry for carlo the old familiar friend who had snapped at us for so many years and the mysterious mode of his death made us very uncomfortable could signor brunoni be at the bottom of this he had apparently killed a canary with only a word of command his will seemed of deadly force who knew but what he might yet be lingering in the neighbourhood willing all sorts of awful things we whispered these fancies among ourselves in the evenings but in the mornings our courage came back with the daylight and in a weeks time we had got over the shock of carlos death all but mrs jamieson she poor thing felt it as she had felt no event since her husbands death indeed miss pole said that as the honourable mr jamieson drank a good deal and occasioned her much uneasiness it was possible that carlos death might be the greater affliction but there was always a tinge of cynicism in miss poles remarks however one thing was clear and certainit was necessary for mrs jamieson to have some change of scene and mr mulliner was very impressive on this point shaking his head whenever we inquired after his mistress and speaking of her loss of appetite and bad nights very ominously and with justice too for if she had two characteristics in her natural state of health they were a facility of eating and sleeping if she could neither eat nor sleep she must be indeed out of spirits and out of health illustration speaking very ominously lady glenmire who had evidently taken very kindly to cranford did not like the idea of mrs jamiesons going to cheltenham and more than once insinuated pretty plainly that it was mr mulliners doing who had been much alarmed on the occasion of the house being attacked and since had said more than once that he felt it a very responsible charge to have to defend so many women be that as it might mrs jamieson went to cheltenham escorted by mr mulliner and lady glenmire remained in possession of the house her ostensible office being to take care that the maidservants did not pick up followers she made a very pleasantlooking dragon and as soon as it was arranged for her stay in cranford she found out that mrs jamiesons visit to cheltenham was just the best thing in the world she had let her house in edinburgh and was for the time houseless so the charge of her sisterinlaws comfortable abode was very convenient and acceptable miss pole was very much inclined to instal herself as a heroine because of the decided steps she had taken in flying from the two men and one woman whom she entitled that murderous gang she described their appearance in glowing colours and i noticed that every time she went over the story some fresh trait of villany was added to their appearance one was tallhe grew to be gigantic in height before we had done with him he of course had black hairand by and by it hung in elflocks over his forehead and down his back the other was short and broadand a hump sprouted out on his shoulder before we heard the last of him he had red hairwhich deepened into carroty and she was almost sure he had a cast in the eyea decided squint as for the woman her eyes glared and she was masculine lookinga perfect virago most probably a man dressed in womans clothes afterwards we heard of a beard on her chin and a manly voice and a stride if miss pole was delighted to recount the events of that afternoon to all inquirers others were not so proud of their adventures in the robbery line mr hoggins the surgeon had been attacked at his own door by two ruffians who were concealed in the shadow of the porch and so effectually silenced him that he was robbed in the interval between ringing his bell and the servants answering it miss pole was sure it would turn out that this robbery had been committed by her men and went the very day she heard the report to have her teeth examined and to question mr hoggins she came to us afterwards so we heard what she had heard straight and direct from the source while we were yet in the excitement and flutter of the agitation caused by the first intelligence for the event had only occurred the night before illustration to have her teeth examined well said miss pole sitting down with the decision of a person who has made up her mind as to the nature of life and the world and such people never tread lightly or seat themselves without a bump well miss matty men will be men every mothers son of them wishes to be considered samson and solomon rolled into onetoo strong ever to be beaten or discomfitedtoo wise ever to be outwitted if you will notice they have always foreseen events though they never tell one for ones warning before the events happen my father was a man and i know the sex pretty well she had talked herself out of breath and we should have been very glad to fill up the necessary pause as chorus but we did not exactly know what to say or which man had suggested this diatribe against the sex so we only joined in generally with a grave shake of the head and a soft murmur of they are very incomprehensible certainly now only think said she there i have undergone the risk of having one of my remaining teeth drawn for one is terribly at the mercy of any surgeondentist and i for one always speak them fair till i have got my mouth out of their clutches and after all mr hoggins is too much of a man to own that he was robbed last night not robbed exclaimed the chorus dont tell me miss pole exclaimed angry that we could be for a moment imposed upon i believe he was robbed just as betty told me and he is ashamed to own it and to be sure it was very silly of him to be robbed just at his own door i daresay he feels that such a thing wont raise him in the eyes of cranford society and is anxious to conceal itbut he need not have tried to impose upon me by saying i must have heard an exaggerated account of some petty theft of a neck of mutton which it seems was stolen out of the safe in his yard last week he had the impertinence to add he believed that that was taken by the cat i have no doubt if i could get at the bottom of it it was that irishman dressed up in womans clothes who came spying about my house with the story about the starving children after we had duly condemned the want of candour which mr hoggins had evinced and abused men in general taking him for the representative and type we got round to the subject about which we had been talking when miss pole came in namely how far in the present disturbed state of the country we could venture to accept an invitation which miss matty had just received from mrs forrester to come as usual and keep the anniversary of her weddingday by drinking tea with her at five oclock and playing a quiet pool afterwards mrs forrester had said that she asked us with some diffidence because the roads were she feared very unsafe but she suggested that perhaps one of us would not object to take the sedan and that the others by walking briskly might keep up with the long trot of the chairmen and so we might all arrive safely at over place a suburb of the town no that is too large an expression a small cluster of houses separated from cranford by about two hundred yards of a dark and lonely lane there was no doubt but that a similar note was awaiting miss pole at home so her call was a very fortunate affair as it enabled us to consult together we would all much rather have declined this invitation but we felt that it would not be quite kind to mrs forrester who would otherwise be left to a solitary retrospect of her not very happy or fortunate life miss matty and miss pole had been visitors on this occasion for many years and now they gallantly determined to nail their colours to the mast and to go through darknesslane rather than fail in loyalty to their friend illustration implored the chairman but when the evening came miss matty for it was she who was voted into the chair as she had a cold before being shut down in the sedan like jackinabox implored the chairman whatever might befall not to run away and leave her fastened up there to be murdered and even after they had promised i saw her tighten her features into the stern determination of a martyr and she gave me a melancholy and ominous shake of the head through the glass however we got there safely only rather out of breath for it was who could trot hardest through darknesslane and i am afraid poor miss matty was sadly jolted mrs forrester had made extra preparations in acknowledgment of our exertion in coming to see her through such dangers the usual forms of genteel ignorance as to what her servants might send up were all gone through and harmony and preference seemed likely to be the order of the evening but for an interesting conversation that began i dont know how but which had relation of course to the robbers who infested the neighbourhood of cranford having braved the dangers of darknesslane and thus having a little stock of reputation for courage to fall back upon and also i dare say desirous of proving ourselves superior to men videlicet mr hoggins in the article of candour we began to relate our individual fears and the private precautions we each of us took i owned that my pet apprehension was eyeseyes looking at me and watching me glittering out from some dull flat wooden surface and that if i dared to go up to my lookingglass when i was panicstricken i should certainly turn it round with its back towards me for fear of seeing eyes behind me looking out of the darkness i saw miss matty nerving herself up for a confession and at last out it came she owned that ever since she had been a girl she had dreaded being caught by her last leg just as she was getting into bed by some one concealed under it she said when she was younger and more active she used to take a flying leap from a distance and so bring both her legs up safely into bed at once but that this had always annoyed deborah who piqued herself upon getting into bed gracefully and she had given it up in consequence but now the old terror would often come over her especially since miss poles house had been attacked we had got quite to believe in the fact of the attack having taken place and yet it was very unpleasant to think of looking under a bed and seeing a man concealed with a great fierce face staring out at you so she had bethought herself of somethingperhaps i had noticed that she had told martha to buy her a penny ball such as children play withand now she rolled this ball under the bed every night if it came out on the other side well and good if not she always took care to have her hand on the bellrope and meant to call out john and harry just as if she expected menservants to answer her ring we all applauded this ingenious contrivance and miss matty sank back into satisfied silence with a look at mrs forrester as if to ask for her private weakness illustration he was a sharp lad mrs forrester looked askance at miss pole and tried to change the subject a little by telling us that she had borrowed a boy from one of the neighbouring cottages and promised his parents a hundredweight of coals at christmas and his supper every evening for the loan of him at nights she had instructed him in his possible duties when he first came and finding him sensible she had given him the majors sword the major was her late husband and desired him to put it very carefully behind his pillow at night turning the edge towards the head of the pillow he was a sharp lad she was sure for spying out the majors cocked hat he had said if he might have that to wear he was sure he could frighten two englishmen or four frenchmen any day but she had impressed upon him anew that he was to lose no time in putting on hats or anything else but if he heard any noise he was to run at it with his drawn sword on my suggesting that some accident might occur from such slaughterous and indiscriminate directions and that he might rush on jenny getting up to wash and have spitted her before he had discovered that she was not a frenchman mrs forrester said she did not think that that was likely for he was a very sound sleeper and generally had to be well shaken or coldpigged in a morning before they could rouse him she sometimes thought such dead sleep must be owing to the hearty suppers the poor lad ate for he was halfstarved at home and she told jenny to see that he got a good meal at night still this was no confession of mrs forresters peculiar timidity and we urged her to tell us what she thought would frighten her more than anything she paused and stirred the fire and snuffed the candles and then she said in a sounding whisper ghosts she looked at miss pole as much as to say she had declared it and would stand by it such a look was a challenge in itself miss pole came down upon her with indigestion spectral illusions optical delusions and a great deal out of dr ferrier and dr hibbert besides miss matty had rather a leaning to ghosts as i have mentioned before and what little she did say was all on mrs forresters side who emboldened by sympathy protested that ghosts were a part of her religion that surely she the widow of a major in the army knew what to be frightened at and what not in short i never saw mrs forrester so warm either before or since for she was a gentle meek enduring old lady in most things not all the elderwine that ever was mulled could this night wash out the remembrance of this difference between miss pole and her hostess indeed when the elderwine was brought in it gave rise to a new burst of discussion for jenny the little maiden who staggered under the tray had to give evidence of having seen a ghost with her own eyes not so many nights ago in darknesslane the very lane we were to go through on our way home illustration leading questions in spite of the uncomfortable feeling which this last consideration gave me i could not help being amused at jennys position which was exceedingly like that of a witness being examined and crossexamined by two counsel who are not at all scrupulous about asking leading questions the conclusion i arrived at was that jenny had certainly seen something beyond what a fit of indigestion would have caused a lady all in white and without her head was what she deposed and adhered to supported by a consciousness of the secret sympathy of her mistress under the withering scorn with which miss pole regarded her and not only she but many others had seen this headless lady who sat by the roadside wringing her hands as in deep grief mrs forrester looked at us from time to time with an air of conscious triumph but then she had not to pass through darknesslane before she could bury herself beneath her own familiar bedclothes we preserved a discreet silence as to the headless lady while we were putting on our things to go home for there was no knowing how near the ghostly head and ears might be or what spiritual connection they might be keeping up with the unhappy body in darknesslane and therefore even miss pole felt that it was as well not to speak lightly on such subjects for fear of vexing or insulting that woebegone trunk at least so i conjecture for instead of the busy clatter usual in the operation we tied on our cloaks as sadly as mutes at a funeral miss matty drew the curtains round the windows of the chair to shut out disagreeable sights and the men either because they were in spirits that their labours were so nearly ended or because they were going down hill set off at such a round and merry pace that it was all miss pole and i could do to keep up with them she had breath for nothing beyond an imploring dont leave me uttered as she clutched my arm so tightly that i could not have quitted her ghost or no ghost what a relief it was when the men weary of their burden and their quick trot stopped just where headingleycauseway branches off from darknesslane miss pole unloosed me and caught at one of the men could not youcould not you take miss matty round by headingleycausewaythe pavement in darknesslane jolts so and she is not very strong a smothered voice was heard from the inside of the chair oh pray go on what is the matter what is the matter i will give you sixpence more to go on very fast pray dont stop here and ill give you a shilling said miss pole with tremulous dignity if youll go by headingleycauseway the two men grunted acquiescence and took up the chair and went along the causeway which certainly answered miss poles kind purpose of saving miss mattys bones for it was covered with soft thick mud and even a fall there would have been easy till the getting up came when there might have been some difficulty in extrication illustration chapter tailpiece illustration the next morning i met lady glenmire and miss pole setting out on a long walk to find some old woman who was famous in the neighbourhood for her skill in knitting woollen stockings miss pole said to me with a smile halfkindly and halfcontemptuous upon her countenance i have been just telling lady glenmire of our poor friend mrs forrester and her terror of ghosts it comes from living so much alone and listening to the bugaboo stories of that jenny of hers she was so calm and so much above superstitious fears herself that i was almost ashamed to say how glad i had been of her headingleycauseway proposition the night before and turned off the conversation to something else illustration perplexed about the exact path in the afternoon miss pole called on miss matty to tell her of the adventurethe real adventure they had met with on their mornings walk they had been perplexed about the exact path which they were to take across the fields in order to find the knitting old woman and had stopped to inquire at a little wayside publichouse standing on the high road to london about three miles from cranford the good woman had asked them to sit down and rest themselves while she fetched her husband who could direct them better than she could and while they were sitting in the sanded parlour a little girl came in they thought that she belonged to the landlady and began some trifling conversation with her but on mrs robertss return she told them that the little thing was the only child of a couple who were staying in the house and then she began a long story out of which lady glenmire and miss pole could only gather one or two decided facts which were that about six weeks ago a light spring cart had broken down just before their door in which there were two men one woman and this child one of the men was seriously hurtno bones broken only shaken the landlady called it but he had probably sustained some severe internal injury for he had languished in their house ever since attended by his wife the mother of this little girl miss pole had asked what he was what he looked like and mrs roberts had made answer that he was not like a gentleman nor yet like a common person if it had not been that he and his wife were such decent quiet people she could almost have thought he was a mountebank or something of that kind for they had a great box in the cart full of she did not know what she had helped to unpack it and take out their linen and clothes when the other manhis twin brother she believed he washad gone off with the horse and cart miss pole had begun to have her suspicions at this point and expressed her idea that it was rather strange that the box and cart and horse and all should have disappeared but good mrs roberts seemed to have become quite indignant at miss poles implied suggestion in fact miss pole said she was as angry as if miss pole had told her that she herself was a swindler as the best way of convincing the ladies she bethought her of begging them to see the wife and as miss pole said there was no doubting the honest worn bronze face of the woman who at the first tender word from lady glenmire burst into tears which she was too weak to check until some word from the landlady made her swallow down her sobs in order that she might testify to the christian kindness shown by mr and mrs roberts miss pole came round with a swing to as vehement a belief in the sorrowful tale as she had been sceptical before and as a proof of this her energy in the poor sufferers behalf was nothing daunted when she found out that he and no other was our signor brunoni to whom all cranford had been attributing all manner of evil this six weeks past yes his wife said his proper name was samuel brownsam she called himbut to the last we preferred calling him the signor it sounded so much better illustration riding over the end of their conversation with the signora brunoni was that it was agreed that he should be placed under medical advice and for any expense incurred in procuring this lady glenmire promised to hold herself responsible and had accordingly gone to mr hoggins to beg him to ride over to the rising sun that very afternoon and examine into the signors real state and as miss pole said if it was desirable to remove him to cranford to be more immediately under mr hogginss eye she would undertake to seek for lodgings and arrange about the rent mrs roberts had been as kind as could be all throughout but it was evident that their long residence there had been a slight inconvenience before miss pole left us miss matty and i were as full of the mornings adventure as she was we talked about it all the evening turning it in every possible light and we went to bed anxious for the morning when we should surely hear from some one what mr hoggins thought and recommended for as miss matty observed though mr hoggins did say jacks up a fig for his heels and called preference pref she believed he was a very worthy man and a very clever surgeon indeed we were rather proud of our doctor at cranford as a doctor we often wished when we heard of queen adelaide or the duke of wellington being ill that they would send for mr hoggins but on consideration we were rather glad they did not for if we were ailing what should we do if mr hoggins had been appointed physicianinordinary to the royal family as a surgeon we were proud of him but as a manor rather i should say as a gentlemanwe could only shake our heads over his name and himself and wished that he had read lord chesterfields letters in the days when his manners were susceptible of improvement nevertheless we all regarded his dictum in the signors case as infallible and when he said that with care and attention he might rally we had no more fear for him illustration airing the sedan chair but although we had no more fear everybody did as much as if there was great cause for anxietyas indeed there was until mr hoggins took charge of him miss pole looked out clean and comfortable if homely lodgings miss matty sent the sedanchair for him and martha and i aired it well before it left cranford by holding a warmingpan full of redhot coals in it and then shutting it up close smoke and all until the time when he should get into it at the rising sun lady glenmire undertook the medical department under mr hogginss directions and rummaged up all mrs jamiesons medicine glasses and spoons and bedtables in a freeandeasy way that made miss matty feel a little anxious as to what that lady and mr mulliner might say if they knew mrs forrester made some of the breadjelly for which she was so famous to have ready as a refreshment in the lodgings when he should arrive a present of this breadjelly was the highest mark of favour dear mrs forrester could confer miss pole had once asked her for the receipt but she had met with a very decided rebuff that lady told her that she could not part with it to any one during her life and that after her death it was bequeathed as her executors would find to miss matty what miss matty or as mrs forrester called her remembering the clause in her will and the dignity of the occasion miss matilda jenkynsmight choose to do with the receipt when it came into her possessionwhether to make it public or to hand it down as an heirloomshe did not know nor would she dictate and a mould of this admirable digestible unique breadjelly was sent by mrs forrester to our poor sick conjuror who says that the aristocracy are proud here was a lady by birth a tyrrell and descended from the great sir walter that shot king rufus and in whose veins ran the blood of him who murdered the little princes in the tower going every day to see what dainty dishes she could prepare for samuel brown a mountebank but indeed it was wonderful to see what kind feelings were called out by this poor mans coming amongst us and also wonderful to see how the great cranford panic which had been occasioned by his first coming in his turkish dress melted away into thin air on his second comingpale and feeble and with his heavy filmy eyes that only brightened a very little when they fell upon the countenance of his faithful wife or their pale and sorrowful little girl illustration in darkness lane somehow we all forgot to be afraid i daresay it was that finding out that he who had first excited our love of the marvellous by his unprecedented arts had not sufficient everyday gifts to manage a shying horse made us feel as if we were ourselves again miss pole came with her little basket at all hours of the evening as if her lonely house and the unfrequented road to it had never been infested by that murderous gang mrs forrester said she thought that neither jenny nor she need mind the headless lady who wept and wailed in darkness lane for surely the power was never given to such beings to harm those who went about to try to do what little good was in their power to which jenny tremblingly assented but the mistresss theory had little effect on the maids practice until she had sewn two pieces of red flannel in the shape of a cross on her inner garment i found miss matty covering her penny ballthe ball that she used to roll under her bedwith gaycoloured worsted in rainbow stripes my dear said she my heart is sad for that little careworn child although her father is a conjuror she looks as if she had never had a good game of play in her life i used to make very pretty balls in this way when i was a girl and i thought i would try if i could not make this one smart and take it to phbe this afternoon i think the gang must have left the neighbourhood for one does not hear any more of their violence and robbery now illustration the boys who stole the apples we were all of us far too full of the signors precarious state to talk either about robbers or ghosts indeed lady glenmire said she never had heard of any actual robberies except that two little boys had stolen some apples from farmer bensons orchard and that some eggs had been missed on a marketday off widow haywards stall but that was expecting too much of us we could not acknowledge that we had only had this small foundation for all our panic miss pole drew herself up at this remark of lady glenmires and said that she wished she could agree with her as to the very small reason we had had for alarm but with the recollection of a man disguised as a woman who had endeavoured to force himself into her house while his confederates waited outside with the knowledge gained from lady glenmire herself of the footprints seen on mrs jamiesons flower borders with the fact before her of the audacious robbery committed on mr hoggins at his own door but here lady glenmire broke in with a very strong expression of doubt as to whether this last story was not an entire fabrication founded upon the theft of a cat she grew so red while she was saying all this that i was not surprised at miss poles manner of bridling up and i am certain if lady glenmire had not been her ladyship we should have had a more emphatic contradiction than the well to be sure and similar fragmentary ejaculations which were all that she ventured upon in my ladys presence but when she was gone miss pole began a long congratulation to miss matty that so far they had escaped marriage which she noticed always made people credulous to the last degree indeed she thought it argued great natural credulity in a woman if she could not keep herself from being married and in what lady glenmire had said about mr hogginss robbery we had a specimen of what people came to if they gave way to such a weakness evidently lady glenmire would swallow anything if she could believe the poor vampedup story about a neck of mutton and a pussy with which he had tried to impose on miss pole only she had always been on her guard against believing too much of what men said we were thankful as miss pole desired us to be that we had never been married but i think of the two we were even more thankful that the robbers had left cranford at least i judge so from a speech of miss mattys that evening as we sat over the fire in which she evidently looked upon a husband as a great protector against thieves burglars and ghosts and said that she did not think that she should dare to be always warning young people against matrimony as miss pole did continually to be sure marriage was a risk as she saw now she had had some experience but she remembered the time when she had looked forward to being married as much as any one not to any particular person my dear said she hastily checking herself up as if she were afraid of having admitted too much only the old story you know of ladies always saying when i marry and gentlemen if i marry it was a joke spoken in rather a sad tone and i doubt if either of us smiled but i could not see miss mattys face by the flickering firelight in a little while she continued but after all i have not told you the truth it is so long ago and no one ever knew how much i thought of it at the time unless indeed my dear mother guessed but i may say that there was a time when i did not think i should have been only miss matty jenkyns all my life for even if i did meet with any one who wished to marry me now and as miss pole says one is never too safe i could not take himi hope he would not take it too much to heart but i could not take himor any one but the person i once thought i should be married to and he is dead and gone and he never knew how it all came about that i said no when i had thought many and many a time well its no matter what i thought god ordains it all and i am very happy my dear no one has such kind friends as i continued she taking my hand and holding it in hers if i had never known of mr holbrook i could have said something in this pause but as i had i could not think of anything that would come in naturally and so we both kept silence for a little time illustration a diary in two columns my father once made us she began keep a diary in two columns on one side we were to put down in the morning what we thought would be the course and events of the coming day and at night we were to put down on the other side what really had happened it would be to some people rather a sad way of telling their lives a tear dropped upon my hand at these wordsi dont mean that mine has been sad only so very different to what i expected i remember one winters evening sitting over our bedroom fire with deborahi remember it as if it were yesterdayand we were planning our future lives both of us were planning though only she talked about it she said she should like to marry an archdeacon and write his charges and you know my dear she never was married and for aught i know she never spoke to an unmarried archdeacon in her life i never was ambitious nor could i have written charges but i thought i could manage a house my mother used to call me her right hand and i was always so fond of little childrenthe shyest babies would stretch out their little arms to come to me when i was a girl i was half my leisure time nursing in the neighbouring cottages but i dont know how it was when i grew sad and gravewhich i did a year or two after this timethe little things drew back from me and i am afraid i lost the knack though i am just as fond of children as ever and have a strange yearning at my heart whenever i see a mother with her baby in her arms nay my dear and by a sudden blaze which sprang up from a fall of the unstirred coals i saw that her eyes were full of tearsgazing intently on some vision of what might have been do you know i dream sometimes that i have a little childalways the samea little girl of about two years old she never grows older though i have dreamt about her for many years i dont think i ever dream of any words or sound she makes she is very noiseless and still but she comes to me when she is very sorry or very glad and i have wakened with the clasp of her dear little arms round my neck only last nightperhaps because i had gone to sleep thinking of this ball for phbemy little darling came in my dream and put up her mouth to be kissed just as i have seen real babies do to real mothers before going to bed but all this is nonsense dear only dont be frightened by miss pole from being married i can fancy it may be a very happy state and a little credulity helps one on through life very smoothlybetter than always doubting and doubting and seeing difficulties and disagreeables in everything if i had been inclined to be daunted from matrimony it would not have been miss pole to do it it would have been the lot of poor signor brunoni and his wife and yet again it was an encouragement to see how through all their cares and sorrows they thought of each other and not of themselves and how keen were their joys if they only passed through each other or through the little phbe the signora told me one day a good deal about their lives up to this period it began by my asking her whether miss poles story of the twin brothers was true it sounded so wonderful a likeness that i should have had my doubts if miss pole had not been unmarried but the signora or as we found out she preferred to be called mrs brown said it was quite true that her brotherinlaw was by many taken for her husband which was of great assistance to them in their profession though she continued how people can mistake thomas for the real signor brunoni i cant conceive but he says they do so i suppose i must believe him not but what he is a very good man i am sure i dont know how we should have paid our bill at the rising sun but for the money he sends but people must know very little about art if they can take him for my husband why miss in the ball trick where my husband spreads his fingers wide and throws out his little finger with quite an air and a grace thomas just clumps up his hand like a fist and might have ever so many balls hidden in it besides he has never been in india and knows nothing of the proper sit of a turban have you been in india said i rather astonished oh yes many a year maam sam was a sergeant in the st and when the regiment was ordered to india i drew a lot to go and i was more thankful than i can tell for it seemed as if it would only be a slow death to me to part from my husband but indeed maam if i had known all i dont know whether i would not rather have died there and then than gone through what i have done since to be sure ive been able to comfort sam and to be with him but maam ive lost six children said she looking up at me with those strange eyes that ive never noticed but in mothers of dead childrenwith a kind of wild look in them as if seeking for what they never more might find yes six children died off like little buds nipped untimely in that cruel india i thought as each died i never couldi never wouldlove a child again and when the next came it had not only its own love but the deeper love that came from the thoughts of its little dead brothers and sisters and when phbe was coming i said to my husband sam when the child is born and i am strong i shall leave you it will cut my heart cruel but if this baby dies too i shall go mad the madness is in me now but if you let me go down to calcutta carrying my baby step by step it will maybe work itself off and i will save and i will hoard and i will begand i will die to get a passage home to england where our baby may live god bless him he said i might go and he saved up his pay and i saved every pice i could get for washing or any way and when phbe came and i grew strong again i set off it was very lonely through the thick forests dark again with their heavy treesalong by the rivers side but i had been brought up near the avon in warwickshire so that flowing noise sounded like homefrom station to station from indian village to village i went along carrying my child i had seen one of the officers ladies with a little picture maamdone by a catholic foreigner maamof the virgin and the little saviour maam she had him on her arm and her form was softly curled round him and their cheeks touched well when i went to bid goodbye to this lady for whom i had washed she cried sadly for she too had lost her children but she had not another to save like me and i was bold enough to ask her would she give me that print and she cried the more and said her children were with that little blessed jesus and gave it me and told me she had heard it had been painted on the bottom of a cask which made it have that round shape and when my body was very weary and my heart was sick for there were times when i misdoubted if i could ever reach my home and there were times when i thought of my husband and one time when i thought my baby was dying i took out that picture and looked at it till i could have thought the mother spoke to me and comforted me and the natives were very kind we could not understand one another but they saw my baby on my breast and they came out to me and brought me rice and milk and sometimes flowersi have got some of the flowers dried then the next morning i was so tired and they wanted me to stay with themi could tell thatand tried to frighten me from going into the deep woods which indeed looked very strange and dark but it seemed to me as if death was following me to take my baby away from me and as if i must go on and onand i thought how god had cared for mothers ever since the world was made and would care for me so i bade them goodbye and set off afresh and once when my baby was ill and both she and i needed rest he led me to a place where i found a kind englishman lived right in the midst of the natives and you reached calcutta safely at last yes safely oh when i knew i had only two days journey more before me i could not help it maamit might be idolatry i cannot tellbut i was near one of the native temples and i went into it with my baby to thank god for his great mercy for it seemed to me that where others had prayed before to their god in their joy or in their agony was of itself a sacred place and i got as servant to an invalid lady who grew quite fond of my baby aboardship and in two years time sam earned his discharge and came home to me and to our child then he had to fix on a trade but he knew of none and once once upon a time he had learnt some tricks from an indian juggler so he set up conjuring and it answered so well that he took thomas to help himas his man you know not as another conjuror though thomas has set it up now on his own hook but it has been a great help to us that likeness between the twins and made a good many tricks go off well that they made up together and thomas is a good brother only he has not the fine carriage of my husband so that i cant think how he can be taken for signor brunoni himself as he says he is poor little phbe said i my thoughts going back to the baby she carried all those hundred miles ah you may say so i never thought i should have reared her though when she fell ill at chunderabaddad but that good kind aga jenkyns took us in which i believe was the very saving of her jenkyns said i yes jenkyns i shall think all people of that name are kind for here is that nice old lady who comes every day to take phbe a walk but an idea had flashed through my head could the aga jenkyns be the lost peter true he was reported by many to be dead but equally true some had said that he had arrived at the dignity of great lama of thibet miss matty thought he was alive i would make further inquiry illustration chapter engaged to be married was the poor peter of cranford the aga jenkyns of chunderabaddad or was he not as somebody says that was the question in my own home whenever people had nothing else to do they blamed me for want of discretion indiscretion was my bugbear fault everybody has a bugbear fault a sort of standing characteristica pice de rsistance for their friends to cut at and in general they cut and come again i was tired of being called indiscreet and incautious and i determined for once to prove myself a model of prudence and wisdom i would not even hint my suspicions respecting the aga i would collect evidence and carry it home to lay before my father as the family friend of the two miss jenkynses in my search after facts i was often reminded of a description my father had once given of a ladies committee that he had had to preside over he said he could not help thinking of a passage in dickens which spoke of a chorus in which every man took the tune he knew best and sang it to his own satisfaction so at this charitable committee every lady took the subject uppermost in her mind and talked about it to her own great contentment but not much to the advancement of the subject they had met to discuss but even that committee could have been nothing to the cranford ladies when i attempted to gain some clear and definite information as to poor peters height appearance and when and where he was seen and heard of last for instance i remember asking miss pole and i thought the question was very opportune for i put it when i met her at a call at mrs forresters and both the ladies had known peter and i imagined that they might refresh each others memoriesi asked miss pole what was the very last thing they had ever heard about him and then she named the absurd report to which i have alluded about his having been elected great lama of thibet and this was a signal for each lady to go off on her separate idea mrs forresters start was made on the veiled prophet in lalla rookhwhether i thought he was meant for the great lama though peter was not so ugly indeed rather handsome if he had not been freckled i was thankful to see her double upon peter but in a moment the delusive lady was off upon rowlands kalydor and the merits of cosmetics and hair oils in general and holding forth so fluently that i turned to listen to miss pole who through the llamas the beasts of burden had got to peruvian bonds and the share market and her poor opinion of jointstock banks in general and of that one in particular in which miss mattys money was invested in vain i put in when was itin what year was it that you heard that mr peter was the great lama they only joined issue to dispute whether llamas were carnivorous animals or not in which dispute they were not quite on fair grounds as mrs forrester after they had grown warm and cool again acknowledged that she always confused carnivorous and graminivorous together just as she did horizontal and perpendicular but then she apologised for it very prettily by saying that in her day the only use people made of foursyllabled words was to teach how they should be spelt the only fact i gained from this conversation was that certainly peter had last been heard of in india or that neighbourhood and that this scanty intelligence of his whereabouts had reached cranford in the year when miss pole had bought her indian muslin gown long since worn out we washed it and mended it and traced its decline and fall into a windowblind before we could go on and in a year when wombwell came to cranford because miss matty had wanted to see an elephant in order that she might the better imagine peter riding on one and had seen a boaconstrictor too which was more than she wished to imagine in her fancypictures of peters locality and in a year when miss jenkyns had learnt some piece of poetry off by heart and used to say at all the cranford parties how peter was surveying mankind from china to peru which everybody had thought very grand and rather appropriate because india was between china and peru if you took care to turn the globe to the left instead of the right illustration miss jenkyns used to say i suppose all these inquiries of mine and the consequent curiosity excited in the minds of my friends made us blind and deaf to what was going on around us it seemed to me as if the sun rose and shone and as if the rain rained on cranford just as usual and i did not notice any sign of the times that could be considered as a prognostic of any uncommon event and to the best of my belief not only miss matty and mrs forrester but even miss pole herself whom we looked upon as a kind of prophetess from the knack she had of foreseeing things before they came to passalthough she did not like to disturb her friends by telling them her foreknowledgeeven miss pole herself was breathless with astonishment when she came to tell us of the astounding piece of news but i must recover myself the contemplation of it even at this distance of time has taken away my breath and my grammar and unless i subdue my emotion my spelling will go too illustration it was too big for words we were sittingmiss matty and imuch as usual she in the blue chintz easychair with her back to the light and her knitting in her hand i reading aloud the st jamess chronicle a few minutes more and we should have gone to make the little alterations in dress usual before callingtime twelve oclock in cranford i remember the scene and the date well we had been talking of the signors rapid recovery since the warmer weather had set in and praising mr hogginss skill and lamenting his want of refinement and manner it seems a curious coincidence that this should have been our subject but so it was when a knock was hearda callers knockthree distinct tapsand we were flying that is to say miss matty could not walk very fast having had a touch of rheumatism to our rooms to change cap and collars when miss pole arrested us by calling out as she came up the stairs dont goi cant waitit is not twelve i knowbut never mind your dressi must speak to you we did our best to look as if it was not we who had made the hurried movement the sound of which she had heard for of course we did not like to have it supposed that we had any old clothes that it was convenient to wear out in the sanctuary of home as miss jenkyns once prettily called the back parlour where she was tying up preserves so we threw our gentility with double force into our manners and very genteel we were for two minutes while miss pole recovered breath and excited our curiosity strongly by lifting up her hands in amazement and bringing them down in silence as if what she had to say was too big for words and could only be expressed by pantomime what do you think miss matty what do you think lady glenmire is to marryis to be married i meanlady glenmiremr hogginsmr hoggins is going to marry lady glenmire marry said we marry madness marry said miss pole with the decision that belonged to her character i said marry as you do and i also said what a fool my lady is going to make of herself i could have said madness but i controlled myself for it was in a public shop that i heard of it where feminine delicacy is gone to i dont know you and i miss matty would have been ashamed to have known that our marriage was spoken of in a grocers shop in the hearing of shopmen but said miss matty sighing as one recovering from a blow perhaps it is not true perhaps we are doing her injustice no said miss pole i have taken care to ascertain that i went straight to mrs fitzadam to borrow a cookery book which i knew she had and i introduced my congratulations propos of the difficulty gentlemen must have in housekeeping and mrs fitzadam bridled up and said that she believed it was true though how and where i could have heard it she did not know she said her brother and lady glenmire had come to an understanding at last understanding such a coarse word but my lady will have to come down to many a want of refinement i have reason to believe mr hoggins sups on breadandcheese and beer every night marry said miss matty once again well i never thought of it two people that we know going to be married its coming very near illustration bread and cheese so near that my heart stopped beating when i heard of it while you might have counted twelve said miss pole one does not know whose turn may come next here in cranford poor lady glenmire might have thought herself safe said miss matty with a gentle pity in her tones bah said miss pole with a toss of her head dont you remember poor dear captain browns song tibbie fowler and the line set her on the tintock tap the wind will blaw a man till her that was because tibbie fowler was rich i think well there is a kind of attraction about lady glenmire that i for one should be ashamed to have i put in my wonder but how can she have fancied mr hoggins i am not surprised that mr hoggins has liked her oh i dont know mr hoggins is rich and very pleasantlooking said miss matty and very goodtempered and kindhearted illustration lady glenmire she has married for an establishment thats it i suppose she takes the surgery with it said miss pole with a little dry laugh at her own joke but like many people who think they have made a severe and sarcastic speech which yet is clever of its kind she began to relax in her grimness from the moment when she made this allusion to the surgery and we turned to speculate on the way in which mrs jamieson would receive the news the person whom she had left in charge of her house to keep off followers from her maids to set up a follower of her own and that follower a man whom mrs jamieson had tabooed as vulgar and inadmissible to cranford society not merely on account of his name but because of his voice his complexion his boots smelling of the stable and himself smelling of drugs had he ever been to see lady glenmire at mrs jamiesons chloride of lime would not purify the house in its owners estimation if he had or had their interviews been confined to the occasional meetings in the chamber of the poor sick conjuror to whom with all our sense of the msalliance we could not help allowing that they had both been exceedingly kind and now it turned out that a servant of mrs jamiesons had been ill and mr hoggins had been attending her for some weeks so the wolf had got into the fold and now he was carrying off the shepherdess what would mrs jamieson say we looked into the darkness of futurity as a child gazes after a rocket up in the cloudy sky full of wondering expectation of the rattle the discharge and the brilliant shower of sparks and light then we brought ourselves down to earth and the present time by questioning each other being all equally ignorant and all equally without the slightest data to build any conclusions upon as to when it would take place where how much a year mr hoggins had whether she would drop her title and how martha and the other correct servants in cranford would ever be brought to announce a married couple as lady glenmire and mr hoggins but would they be visited would mrs jamieson let us or must we choose between the honourable mrs jamieson and the degraded lady glenmire we all liked lady glenmire the best she was bright and kind and sociable and agreeable and mrs jamieson was dull and inert and pompous and tiresome but we had acknowledged the sway of the latter so long that it seemed like a kind of disloyalty now even to meditate disobedience to the prohibition we anticipated mrs forrester surprised us in our darned caps and patched collars and we forgot all about them in our eagerness to see how she would bear the information which we honourably left to miss pole to impart although if we had been inclined to take unfair advantage we might have rushed in ourselves for she had a most outofplace fit of coughing for five minutes after mrs forrester entered the room i shall never forget the imploring expression of her eyes as she looked at us over her pockethandkerchief they said as plain as words could speak dont let nature deprive me of the treasure which is mine although for a time i can make no use of it and we did not mrs forresters surprise was equal to ours and her sense of injury rather greater because she had to feel for her order and saw more fully than we could do how such conduct brought stains on the aristocracy when she and miss pole left us we endeavoured to subside into calmness but miss matty was really upset by the intelligence she had heard she reckoned it up and it was more than fifteen years since she had heard of any of her acquaintance going to be married with the one exception of miss jessie brown and as she said it gave her quite a shock and made her feel as if she could not think what would happen next i dont know whether it is a fancy of mine or a real fact but i have noticed that just after the announcement of an engagement in any set the unmarried ladies in that set flutter out in an unusual gaiety and newness of dress as much as to say in a tacit and unconscious manner we also are spinsters miss matty and miss pole talked and thought more about bonnets gowns caps and shawls during the fortnight that succeeded this call than i had known them do for years before but it might be the spring weather for it was a warm and pleasant march and merinoes and beavers and woollen materials of all sorts were but ungracious receptacles of the bright suns glancing rays it had not been lady glenmires dress that had won mr hogginss heart for she went about on her errands of kindness more shabby than ever although in the hurried glimpses i caught of her at church or elsewhere she appeared rather to shun meeting any of her friends her face seemed to have almost something of the flush of youth in it her lips looked redder and more trembling full than in their old compressed state and her eyes dwelt on all things with a lingering light as if she was learning to love cranford and its belongings mr hoggins looked broad and radiant and creaked up the middle aisle at church in a brannew pair of topbootsan audible as well as visible sign of his purposed change of state for the tradition went that the boots he had worn till now were the identical pair in which he first set out on his rounds in cranford twentyfive years ago only they had been newpieced high and low top and bottom heel and sole black leather and brown leather more times than any one could tell illustration mr hoggins looked radiant none of the ladies in cranford chose to sanction the marriage by congratulating either of the parties we wished to ignore the whole affair until our liege lady mrs jamieson returned till she came back to give us our cue we felt that it would be better to consider the engagement in the same light as the queen of spains legsfacts which certainly existed but the less said about the better this restraint upon our tonguesfor you see if we did not speak about it to any of the parties concerned how could we get answers to the questions that we longed to askwas beginning to be irksome and our idea of the dignity of silence was paling before our curiosity when another direction was given to our thoughts by an announcement on the part of the principal shopkeeper of cranford who ranged the trades from grocer and cheesemonger to manmilliner as occasion required that the spring fashions were arrived and would be exhibited on the following tuesday at his rooms in high street now miss matty had been only waiting for this before buying herself a new silk gown i had offered it is true to send to drumble for patterns but she had rejected my proposal gently implying that she had not forgotten her disappointment about the seagreen turban i was thankful that i was on the spot now to counteract the dazzling fascination of any yellow or scarlet silk i must say a word or two here about myself i have spoken of my fathers old friendship for the jenkyns family indeed i am not sure if there was not some distant relationship he had willingly allowed me to remain all the winter at cranford in consideration of a letter which miss matty had written to him about the time of the panic in which i suspect she had exaggerated my powers and my bravery as a defender of the house but now that the days were longer and more cheerful he was beginning to urge the necessity of my return and i only delayed in a sort of odd forlorn hope that if i could obtain any clear information i might make the account given by the signora of the aga jenkyns tally with that of poor peter his appearance and disappearance which i had winnowed out of the conversation of miss pole and mrs forrester illustration chapter tailpiece illustration chapter stopped payment the very tuesday morning on which mr johnson was going to show the fashions the postwoman brought two letters to the house i say the postwoman but i should say the postmans wife he was a lame shoemaker a very clean honest man much respected in the town but he never brought the letters round except on unusual occasions such as christmas day or good friday and on those days the letters which should have been delivered at eight in the morning did not make their appearance until two or three in the afternoon for every one liked poor thomas and gave him a welcome on these festive occasions he used to say he was welly stawed wi eating for there were three or four houses where nowt would serve em but he must share in their breakfast and by the time he had done his last breakfast he came to some other friend who was beginning dinner but come what might in the way of temptation tom was always sober civil and smiling and as miss jenkyns used to say it was a lesson in patience that she doubted not would call out that precious quality in some minds where but for thomas it might have lain dormant and undiscovered patience was certainly very dormant in miss jenkynss mind she was always expecting letters and always drumming on the table till the postwoman had called or gone past on christmas day and good friday she drummed from breakfast till church from churchtime till twooclockunless when the fire wanted stirring when she invariably knocked down the fireirons and scolded miss matty for it but equally certain was the hearty welcome and the good dinner for thomas miss jenkyns standing over him like a bold dragoon questioning him as to his childrenwhat they were doingwhat school they went to upbraiding him if another was likely to make its appearance but sending even the little babies the shilling and the mincepie which was her gift to all the children with halfacrown in addition for both father and mother the post was not half of so much consequence to dear miss matty but not for the world would she have diminished thomass welcome and his dole though i could see that she felt rather shy over the ceremony which had been regarded by miss jenkyns as a glorious opportunity for giving advice and benefiting her fellowcreatures miss matty would steal the money all in a lump into his hand as if she were ashamed of herself miss jenkyns gave him each individual coin separate with a there thats for yourself thats for jenny etc miss matty would even beckon martha out of the kitchen while he ate his food and once to my knowledge winked at its rapid disappearance into a blue cotton pockethandkerchief miss jenkyns almost scolded him if he did not leave a clean plate however heaped it might have been and gave an injunction with every mouthful illustration each individual coin i have wandered a long way from the two letters that awaited us on the breakfasttable that tuesday morning mine was from my father miss mattys was printed my fathers was just a mans letter i mean it was very dull and gave no information beyond that he was well that they had had a good deal of rain that trade was very stagnant and there were many disagreeable rumours afloat he then asked me if i knew whether miss matty still retained her shares in the town and county bank as there were very unpleasant reports about it though nothing more than he had always foreseen and had prophesied to miss jenkyns years ago when she would invest their little property in itthe only unwise step that clever woman had ever taken to his knowledge the only time she ever acted against his advice i knew however if anything had gone wrong of course i was not to think of leaving miss matty while i could be of any use etc who is your letter from my dear mine is a very civil invitation signed edwin wilson asking me to attend an important meeting of the shareholders of the town and county bank to be held in drumble on thursday the twentyfirst i am sure it is very attentive of them to remember me i did not like to hear of this important meeting for though i did not know much about business i feared it confirmed what my father said however i thought ill news always came fast enough so i resolved to say nothing about my alarm and merely told her that my father was well and sent his kind regards to her she kept turning over and admiring her letter at last she spoke i remember their sending one to deborah just like this but that i did not wonder at for everybody knew she was so clearheaded i am afraid i could not help them much indeed if they came to accounts i should be quite in the way for i never could do sums in my head deborah i know rather wished to go and went so far as to order a new bonnet for the occasion but when the time came she had a bad cold so they sent her a very polite account of what they had done chosen a director i think it was do you think they want me to help them to choose a director i am sure i should choose your father at once my father has no shares in the bank said i oh no i remember he objected very much to deborahs buying any i believe but she was quite the woman of business and always judged for herself and here you see they have paid eight per cent all these years it was a very uncomfortable subject to me with my halfknowledge so i thought i would change the conversation and i asked at what time she thought we had better go and see the fashions well my dear she said the thing is this it is not etiquette to go till after twelve but then you see all cranford will be there and one does not like to be too curious about dress and trimmings and caps with all the world looking on it is never genteel to be overcurious on these occasions deborah had the knack of always looking as if the latest fashion was nothing new to her a manner she had caught from lady arley who did see all the new modes in london you know so i thought we would just slip down this morning soon after breakfastfor i do want half a pound of teaand then we could go up and examine the things at our leisure and see exactly how my new silk gown must be made and then after twelve we could go with our minds disengaged and free from thoughts of dress we began to talk of miss mattys new silk gown i discovered that it would be really the first time in her life that she had had to choose anything of consequence for herself for miss jenkyns had always been the more decided character whatever her taste might have been and it is astonishing how such people carry the world before them by the mere force of will miss matty anticipated the sight of the glossy folds with as much delight as if the five sovereigns set apart for the purchase could buy all the silks in the shop and remembering my own loss of two hours in a toyshop before i could tell on what wonder to spend a silver threepence i was very glad that we were going early that dear miss matty might have leisure for the delights of perplexity if a happy seagreen could be met with the gown was to be seagreen if not she inclined to maize and i to silver gray and we discussed the requisite number of breadths until we arrived at the shopdoor we were to buy the tea select the silk and then clamber up the iron corkscrew stairs that led into what was once a loft though now a fashion showroom illustration over the counter the young men at mr johnsons had on their best looks and their best cravats and pivoted themselves over the counter with surprising activity they wanted to show us upstairs at once but on the principle of business first and pleasure afterwards we stayed to purchase the tea here miss mattys absence of mind betrayed itself if she was made aware that she had been drinking green tea at any time she always thought it her duty to lie awake half through the night afterward i have known her take it in ignorance many a time without such effects and consequently green tea was prohibited the house yet today she herself asked for the obnoxious article under the impression that she was talking about the silk however the mistake was soon rectified and then the silks were unrolled in good truth by this time the shop was pretty well filled for it was cranford marketday and many of the farmers and country people from the neighbourhood round came in sleeking down their hair and glancing shyly about from under their eyelids as anxious to take back some notion of the unusual gaiety to the mistress or the lasses at home and yet feeling that they were out of place among the smart shopmen and gay shawls and summer prints one honestlooking man however made his way up to the counter at which we stood and boldly asked to look at a shawl or two the other country folk confined themselves to the grocery side but our neighbour was evidently too full of some kind intention towards mistress wife or daughter to be shy and it soon became a question with me whether he or miss matty would keep their shopman the longest time he thought each shawl more beautiful than the last and as for miss matty she smiled and sighed over each fresh bale that was brought out one colour set off another and the heap together would as she said make even the rainbow look poor illustration the country people came in i am afraid said she hesitating whichever i choose i shall wish i had taken another look at this lovely crimson it would be so warm in winter but spring is coming on you know i wish i could have a gown for every season said she dropping her voiceas we all did in cranford whenever we talked of anything we wished for but could not afford however she continued in a louder and more cheerful tone it would give me a great deal of trouble to take care of them if i had them so i think ill only take one but which must it be my dear illustration our neighbour and now she hovered over a lilac with yellow spots while i pulled out a quiet sagegreen that had faded into insignificance under the more brilliant colours but which was nevertheless a good silk in its humble way our attention was called off to our neighbour he had chosen a shawl of about thirty shillings value and his face looked broadly happy under the anticipation no doubt of the pleasant surprise he should give to some molly or jenny at home he had tugged a leathern purse out of his breechespocket and had offered a fivepound note in payment for the shawl and for some parcels which had been brought round to him from the grocery counter and it was just at this point that he attracted our notice the shopman was examining the note with a puzzled doubtful air town and county bank i am not sure sir but i believe we have received a warning against notes issued by this bank only this morning i will just step and ask mr johnson sir but im afraid i must trouble you for payment in cash or in a note of a different bank i never saw a mans countenance fall so suddenly into dismay and bewilderment it was almost piteous to see the rapid change dang it said he striking his fist down on the table as if to try which was the harder the chap talks as if notes and gold were to be had for the picking up illustration dang it said he miss matty had forgotten her silk gown in her interest for the man i dont think she had caught the name of the bank and in my nervous cowardice i was anxious that she should not and so i began admiring the yellowspotted lilac gown that i had been utterly condemning only a minute before but it was of no use what bank was it i mean what bank did your note belong to town and county bank let me see it said she quietly to the shopman gently taking it out of his hand as he brought it back to return it to the farmer mr johnson was very sorry but from information he had received the notes issued by that bank were little better than waste paper i dont understand it said miss matty to me in a low voice that is our bank is it notthe town and county bank yes said i this lilac silk will just match the ribbons in your new cap i believe i continued holding up the folds so as to catch the light and wishing that the man would make haste and be gone and yet having a new wonder that had only just sprung up how far it was wise or right in me to allow miss matty to make this expensive purchase if the affairs of the bank were really so bad as the refusal of the note implied but miss matty put on the soft dignified manner peculiar to her rarely used and yet which became her so well and laying her hand gently on mine she said never mind the silks for a few minutes dear i dont understand you sir turning now to the shopman who had been attending to the farmer is this a forged note oh no maam it is a true note of its kind but you see maam it is a jointstock bank and there are reports out that it is likely to break mr johnson is only doing his duty maam as i am sure mr dobson knows but mr dobson could not respond to the appealing bow by any answering smile he was turning the note absently over in his fingers looking gloomily enough at the parcel containing the latelychosen shawl its hard upon a poor man said he as earns every farthing with the sweat of his brow however theres no help for it you must take back your shawl my man lizzie must do on with her cloak for a while and yon figs for the little onesi promised them to emill take them but the bacco and the other things i will give you five sovereigns for your note my good man said miss matty i think there is some great mistake about it for i am one of the shareholders and im sure they would have told me if things had not been going on right the shopman whispered a word or two across the table to miss matty she looked at him with a dubious air perhaps so said she but i dont pretend to understand business i only know that if it is going to fail and if honest people are to lose their money because they have taken our notesi cant explain myself said she suddenly becoming aware that she had got into a long sentence with four people for audience only i would rather exchange my gold for the note if you please turning to the farmer and then you can take your wife the shawl it is only going without my gown a few days longer she continued speaking to me then i have no doubt everything will be cleared up but if it is cleared up the wrong way said i why then it will only have been common honesty in me as a shareholder to have given this good man the money i am quite clear about it in my own mind but you know i can never speak quite as comprehensively as others can only you must give me your note mr dobson if you please and go on with your purchases with these sovereigns illustration he hung back the man looked at her with silent gratitudetoo awkward to put his thanks into words but he hung back for a minute or two fumbling with his note im loth to make another one lose instead of me if it is a loss but you see five pounds is a deal of money to a man with a family and as you say ten to one in a day or two the note will be as good as gold again no hope of that my friend said the shopman the more reason why i should take it said miss matty quietly she pushed her sovereigns towards the man who slowly laid his note down in exchange thank you i will wait a day or two before i purchase any of these silks perhaps you will then have a greater choice my dear will you come upstairs we inspected the fashions with as minute and curious an interest as if the gown to be made after them had been bought i could not see that the little event in the shop below had in the least damped miss mattys curiosity as to the make of sleeves or the sit of skirts she once or twice exchanged congratulations with me on our private and leisurely view of the bonnets and shawls but i was all the time not so sure that our examination was so utterly private for i caught glimpses of a figure dodging behind the cloaks and mantles and by a dexterous move i came face to face with miss pole also in morning costume the principal feature of which was her being without teeth and wearing a veil to conceal the deficiency come on the same errand as ourselves but she quickly took her departure because as she said she had a bad headache and did not feel herself up to conversation illustration the civil mr johnson as we came down through the shop the civil mr johnson was awaiting us he had been informed of the exchange of the note for gold and with much good feeling and real kindness but with a little want of tact he wished to condole with miss matty and impress upon her the true state of the case i could only hope that he had heard an exaggerated rumour for he said that her shares were worse than nothing and that the bank could not pay a shilling in the pound i was glad that miss matty seemed still a little incredulous but i could not tell how much of this was real or assumed with that selfcontrol which seemed habitual to ladies of miss mattys standing in cranford who would have thought their dignity compromised by the slightest expression of surprise dismay or any similar feeling to an inferior in station or in a public shop however we walked home very silently i am ashamed to say i believe i was rather vexed and annoyed at miss mattys conduct in taking the note to herself so decidedly i had so set my heart upon her having a new silk gown which she wanted sadly in general she was so undecided anybody might turn her round in this case i had felt that it was no use attempting it but i was not the less put out at the result somehow after twelve oclock we both acknowledged to a sated curiosity about the fashions and to a certain fatigue of body which was in fact depression of mind that indisposed us to go out again but still we never spoke of the note till all at once something possessed me to ask miss matty if she would think it her duty to offer sovereigns for all the notes of the town and county bank she met with i could have bitten my tongue out the minute i had said it she looked up rather sadly and as if i had thrown a new perplexity into her already distressed mind and for a minute or two she did not speak then she saidmy own dear miss mattywithout a shade of reproach in her voice my dear i never feel as if my mind was what people call very strong and its often hard enough work for me to settle what i ought to do with the case right before me i was very thankful toi was very thankful that i saw my duty this morning with the poor man standing by me but its rather a strain upon me to keep thinking and thinking what i should do if such and such a thing happened and i believe i had rather wait and see what really does come and i dont doubt i shall be helped then if i dont fidget myself and get too anxious beforehand you know love im not like deborah if deborah had lived ive no doubt she would have seen after them before they had got themselves into this state illustration the accountbooks we had neither of us much appetite for dinner though we tried to talk cheerfully about indifferent things when we returned into the drawingroom miss matty unlocked her desk and began to look over her accountbooks i was so penitent for what i had said in the morning that i did not choose to take upon myself the presumption to suppose that i could assist her i rather left her alone as with puzzled brow her eye followed her pen up and down the ruled page by and by she shut the book locked her desk and came and drew a chair to mine where i sat in moody sorrow over the fire i stole my hand into hers she clasped it but did not speak a word at last she said with forced composure in her voice if that bank goes wrong i shall lose one hundred and fortynine pounds thirteen shillings and fourpence a year i shall only have thirteen pounds a year left i squeezed her hand hard and tight i did not know what to say presently it was too dark to see her face i felt her fingers work convulsively in my grasp and i knew she was going to speak again i heard the sobs in her voice as she said i hope its not wrongnot wickedbut oh i am so glad poor deborah is spared this she could not have borne to come down in the worldshe had such a noble lofty spirit this was all she said about the sister who had insisted upon investing their little property in that unlucky bank we were later in lighting the candle than usual that night and until that light shamed us into speaking we sat together very silently and sadly however we took to our work after tea with a kind of forced cheerfulness which soon became real as far as it went talking of that neverending wonder lady glenmires engagement miss matty was almost coming round to think it a good thing i dont mean to deny that men are troublesome in a house i dont judge from my own experience for my father was neatness itself and wiped his shoes on coming in as carefully as any woman but still a man has a sort of knowledge of what should be done in difficulties that it is very pleasant to have one at hand ready to lean upon now lady glenmire instead of being tossed about and wondering where she is to settle will be certain of a home among pleasant and kind people such as our good miss pole and mrs forrester and mr hoggins is really a very personable man and as for his manners why if they are not very polished i have known people with very good hearts and very clever minds too who were not what some people reckoned refined but who were both true and tender she fell off into a soft reverie about mr holbrook and i did not interrupt her i was so busy maturing a plan i had had in my mind for some days but which this threatened failure of the bank had brought to a crisis that night after miss matty went to bed i treacherously lighted the candle again and sat down in the drawingroom to compose a letter to the aga jenkyns a letter which should affect him if he were peter and yet seem a mere statement of dry facts if he were a stranger the church clock pealed out two before i had done the next morning news came both official and otherwise that the town and county bank had stopped payment miss matty was ruined she tried to speak quietly to me but when she came to the actual fact that she would have but about five shillings a week to live upon she could not restrain a few tears i am not crying for myself dear said she wiping them away i believe i am crying for the very silly thought of how my mother would grieve if she could know she always cared for us so much more than for herself but many a poor person has less and i am not very extravagant and thank god when the neck of mutton and marthas wages and the rent are paid i have not a farthing owing poor martha i think shell be sorry to leave me miss matty smiled at me through her tears and she would fain have had me see only the smile not the tears chapter friends in need illustration chapter friends in need it was an example to me and i fancy it might be to many others to see how immediately miss matty set about the retrenchment which she knew to be right under her altered circumstances while she went down to speak to martha and break the intelligence to her i stole out with my letter to the aga jenkyns and went to the signors lodgings to obtain the exact address i bound the signora to secrecy and indeed her military manners had a degree of shortness and reserve in them which made her always say as little as possible except when under the pressure of strong excitement moreover which made my secret doubly sure the signor was now so far recovered as to be looking forward to travelling and conjuring again in the space of a few days when he his wife and little phbe would leave cranford indeed i found him looking over a great black and red placard in which the signor brunonis accomplishments were set forth and to which only the name of the town where he would next display them was wanting he and his wife were so much absorbed in deciding where the red letters would come in with most effect it might have been the rubric for that matter that it was some time before i could get my question asked privately and not before i had given several decisions the wisdom of which i questioned afterwards with equal sincerity as soon as the signor threw in his doubts and reasons on the important subject at last i got the address spelt by sound and very queer it looked i dropped it in the post on my way home and then for a minute i stood looking at the wooden pane with a gaping slit which divided me from the letter but a moment ago in my hand it was gone from me like life never to be recalled it would get tossed about on the sea and stained with seawaves perhaps and be carried among palmtrees and scented with all tropical fragrance the little piece of paper but an hour ago so familiar and commonplace had set out on its race to the strange wild countries beyond the ganges but i could not afford to lose much time on this speculation i hastened home that miss matty might not miss me martha opened the door to me her face swollen with crying as soon as she saw me she burst out afresh and taking hold of my arm she pulled me in and banged the door to in order to ask me if indeed it was all true that miss matty had been saying illustration posting the letter ill never leave her no i wont i telled her so and said i could not think how she could find in her heart to give me warning i could not have had the face to do it if id been her i might ha been just as good for nothing as mrs fitzadams rosy who struck for wages after living seven years and a half in one place i said i was not one to go and serve mammon at that rate that i knew when id got a good missus if she didnt know when shed got a good servant but martha said i cutting in while she wiped her eyes dont but martha me she replied to my deprecatory tone listen to reason ill not listen to reason she said now in full possession of her voice which had been rather choked with sobbing reason always means what some one else has got to say now i think what ive got to say is good enough reason but reason or not ill say it and ill stick to it ive money in the savings bank and ive a good stock of clothes and im not going to leave miss matty no not if she gives me warning every hour in the day illustration dont but martha me she put her arms akimbo as much as to say she defied me and indeed i could hardly tell how to begin to remonstrate with her so much did i feel that miss matty in her increasing infirmity needed the attendance of this kind and faithful woman well said i at last im thankful you begin with well if youd ha begun with but as you did afore id not ha listened to you now you may go on i know you would be a great loss to miss matty martha i telled her so a loss shed never cease to be sorry for broke in martha triumphantly still she will have so littleso very littleto live upon that i dont see just now how she could find you foodshe will even be pressed for her own i tell you this martha because i feel you are like a friend to dear miss matty but you know she might not like to have it spoken about apparently this was even a blacker view of the subject than miss matty had presented to her for martha just sat down on the first chair that came to hand and cried out loud we had been standing in the kitchen at last she put her apron down and looking me earnestly in the face asked was that the reason miss matty wouldnt order a pudding today she said she had no great fancy for sweet things and you and she would just have a muttonchop but ill be up to her never you tell but ill make her a pudding and a pudding shell like too and ill pay for it myself so mind you see she eats it many a one has been comforted in their sorrow by seeing a good dish come upon the table i was rather glad that marthas energy had taken the immediate and practical direction of puddingmaking for it staved off the quarrelsome discussion as to whether she should or should not leave miss mattys service she began to tie on a clean apron and otherwise prepare herself for going to the shop for the butter eggs and what else she might require she would not use a scrap of the articles already in the house for her cookery but went to an old teapot in which her private store of money was deposited and took out what she wanted i found miss matty very quiet and not a little sad but by and by she tried to smile for my sake it was settled that i was to write to my father and ask him to come over and hold a consultation and as soon as this letter was despatched we began to talk over future plans miss mattys idea was to take a single room and retain as much of her furniture as would be necessary to fit up this and sell the rest and there to quietly exist upon what would remain after paying the rent for my part i was more ambitious and less contented i thought of all the things by which a woman past middle age and with the education common to ladies fifty years ago could earn or add to a living without materially losing caste but at length i put even this last clause on one side and wondered what in the world miss matty could do teaching was of course the first thing that suggested itself if miss matty could teach children anything it would throw her among the little elves in whom her soul delighted i ran over her accomplishments once upon a time i had heard her say she could play ah vous diraije maman on the piano but that was long long ago that faint shadow of musical acquirement had died out years before she had also once been able to trace out patterns very nicely for muslin embroidery by dint of placing a piece of silverpaper over the design to be copied and holding both against the windowpane while she marked the scollop and eyeletholes but that was her nearest approach to the accomplishment of drawing and i did not think it would go very far then again as to the branches of a solid english educationfancy work and the use of the globessuch as the mistress of the ladies seminary to which all the tradespeople in cranford sent their daughters professed to teach miss mattys eyes were failing her and i doubted if she could discover the number of threads in a worstedwork pattern or rightly appreciate the different shades required for queen adelaides face in the loyal woolwork now fashionable in cranford as for the use of the globes i had never been able to find it out myself so perhaps i was not a good judge of miss mattys capability of instructing in this branch of education but it struck me that equators and tropics and such mystical circles were very imaginary lines indeed to her and that she looked upon the signs of the zodiac as so many remnants of the black art what she piqued herself upon as arts in which she excelled was making candlelighters or spills as she preferred calling them of coloured paper cut so as to resemble feathers and knitting garters in a variety of dainty stitches i had once said on receiving a present of an elaborate pair that i should feel quite tempted to drop one of them in the street in order to have it admired but i found this little joke and it was a very little one was such a distress to her sense of propriety and was taken with such anxious earnest alarm lest the temptation might some day prove too strong for me that i quite regretted having ventured upon it a present of these delicatelywrought garters a bunch of gay spills or a set of cards on which sewingsilk was wound in a mystical manner were the wellknown tokens of miss mattys favour but would any one pay to have their children taught these arts or indeed would miss matty sell for filthy lucre the knack and the skill with which she made trifles of value to those who loved her i had to come down to reading writing and arithmetic and in reading the chapter every morning she always coughed before coming to long words i doubted her power of getting through a genealogical chapter with any number of coughs writing she did well and delicatelybut spelling she seemed to think that the more outoftheway this was and the more trouble it cost her the greater the compliment she paid to her correspondent and words that she would spell quite correctly in her letters to me became perfect enigmas when she wrote to my father no there was nothing she could teach to the rising generation of cranford unless they had been quick learners and ready imitators of her patience her humility her sweetness her quiet contentment with all that she could not do i pondered and pondered until dinner was announced by martha with a face all blubbered and swollen with crying miss matty had a few little peculiarities which martha was apt to regard as whims below her attention and appeared to consider as childish fancies of which an old lady of fiftyeight should try and cure herself but today everything was attended to with the most careful regard the bread was cut to the imaginary pattern of excellence that existed in miss mattys mind as being the way which her mother had preferred the curtain was drawn so as to exclude the dead brickwall of a neighbours stables and yet left so as to show every tender leaf of the poplar which was bursting into spring beauty marthas tone to miss matty was just such as that good roughspoken servant usually kept sacred for little children and which i had never heard her use to any grownup person illustration there i had forgotten to tell miss matty about the pudding and i was afraid she might not do justice to it for she had evidently very little appetite this day so i seized the opportunity of letting her into the secret while martha took away the meat miss mattys eyes filled with tears and she could not speak either to express surprise or delight when martha returned bearing it aloft made in the most wonderful representation of a lion couchant that ever was moulded marthas face gleamed with triumph as she set it down before miss matty with an exultant there miss matty wanted to speak her thanks but could not so she took marthas hand and shook it warmly which set martha off crying and i myself could hardly keep up the necessary composure martha burst out of the room and miss matty had to clear her voice once or twice before she could speak at last she said i should like to keep this pudding under a glass shade my dear and the notion of the lion couchant with his currant eyes being hoisted up to the place of honour on a mantelpiece tickled my hysterical fancy and i began to laugh which rather surprised miss matty i am sure dear i have seen uglier things under a glass shade before now said she so had i many a time and oft and i accordingly composed my countenance and now i could hardly keep from crying and we both fell to upon the pudding which was indeed excellentonly every morsel seemed to choke us our hearts were so full we had too much to think about to talk much that afternoon it passed over very tranquilly but when the teaurn was brought in a new thought came into my head why should not miss matty sell teabe an agent to the east india tea company which then existed i could see no objections to this plan while the advantages were manyalways supposing that miss matty could get over the degradation of condescending to anything like trade tea was neither greasy nor stickygrease and stickiness being two of the qualities which miss matty could not endure no shopwindow would be required a small genteel notification of her being licensed to sell tea would it is true be necessary but i hoped that it could be placed where no one would see it neither was tea a heavy article so as to tax miss mattys fragile strength the only thing against my plan was the buying and selling involved while i was giving but absent answers to the questions miss matty was puttingalmost as absentlywe heard a clumping sound on the stairs and a whispering outside the door which indeed once opened and shut as if by some invisible agency after a little while martha came in dragging after her a great tall young man all crimson with shyness and finding his only relief in perpetually sleeking down his hair please maam hes only jem hearn said martha by way of an introduction and so out of breath was she that i imagine she had had some bodily struggle before she could overcome his reluctance to be presented on the courtly scene of miss matilda jenkynss drawingroom and please maam he wants to marry me offhand and please maam we want to take a lodgerjust one quiet lodger to make our two ends meet and wed take any house conformable and oh dear miss matty if i may be so bold would you have any objections to lodging with us jem wants it as much as i do to jemyou great oaf why cant you back mebut he does want it all the same very baddont you jemonly you see hes dazed at being called on to speak before quality illustration hes only jem hearn its not that broke in jem its that youve taken me all on a sudden and i didnt think for to get married so soonand such quick work does flabbergast a man its not that im against it maam addressing miss matty only martha has such quick ways with her when once she takes a thing into her head and marriage maammarriage nails a man as one may say i daresay i shant mind it after its once over please maam said marthawho had plucked at his sleeve and nudged him with her elbow and otherwise tried to interrupt him all the time he had been speakingdont mind him hell come to twas only last night he was anaxing me and anaxing me and all the more because i said i could not think of it for years to come and now hes only taken aback with the suddenness of the joy but you know jem you are just as full as me about wanting a lodger another great nudge ay if miss matty would lodge with usotherwise ive no mind to be cumbered with strange folk in the house said jem with a want of tact which i could see enraged martha who was trying to represent a lodger as the great object they wished to obtain and that in fact miss matty would be smoothing their path and conferring a favour if she would only come and live with them miss matty herself was bewildered by the pair their or rather marthas sudden resolution in favour of matrimony staggered her and stood between her and the contemplation of the plan which martha had at heart miss matty began marriage is a very solemn thing martha it is indeed maam quoth jem not that ive no objections to martha youve never let me abe for asking me for to fix when i would be married said marthaher face all afire and ready to cry with vexationand now youre shaming me before my missus and all nay now martha dont ee dont ee only a man likes to have breathingtime said jem trying to possess himself of her hand but in vain then seeing that she was more seriously hurt than he had imagined he seemed to try to rally his scattered faculties and with more straightforward dignity than ten minutes before i should have thought it possible for him to assume he turned to miss matty and said i hope maam you know that i am bound to respect every one who has been kind to martha i always looked on her as to be my wifesome time and she has often and often spoken of you as the kindest lady that ever was and though the plain truth is i would not like to be troubled with lodgers of the common run yet if maam youd honour us by living with us im sure martha would do her best to make you comfortable and id keep out of your way as much as i could which i reckon would be the best kindness such an awkward chap as me could do miss matty had been very busy with taking off her spectacles wiping them and replacing them but all she could say was dont let any thought of me hurry you into marriage pray dont marriage is such a very solemn thing but miss matilda will think of your plan martha said i struck with the advantages that it offered and unwilling to lose the opportunity of considering about it and im sure neither she nor i can ever forget your kindness nor yours either jem why yes maam im sure i mean kindly though im a bit fluttered by being pushed straight ahead into matrimony as it were and maynt express myself conformable but im sure im willing enough and give me time to get accustomed so martha wench whats the use of crying so and slapping me if i come near illustration soothed by her lover this last was sotto voce and had the effect of making martha bounce out of the room to be followed and soothed by her lover whereupon miss matty sat down and cried very heartily and accounted for it by saying that the thought of martha being married so soon gave her quite a shock and that she should never forgive herself if she thought she was hurrying the poor creature i think my pity was more for jem of the two but both miss matty and i appreciated to the full the kindness of the honest couple although we said little about this and a good deal about the chances and dangers of matrimony the next morning very early i received a note from miss pole so mysteriously wrapped up and with so many seals on it to secure secrecy that i had to tear the paper before i could unfold it and when i came to the writing i could hardly understand the meaning it was so involved and oracular i made out however that i was to go to miss poles at eleven oclock the number eleven being written in full length as well as in numerals and am twice dashed under as if i were very likely to come at eleven at night when all cranford was usually abed and asleep by ten there was no signature except miss poles initials reversed p e but as martha had given me the note with miss poles kind regards it needed no wizard to find out who sent it and if the writers name was to be kept secret it was very well that i was alone when martha delivered it illustration mrs fitzadam i went as requested to miss poles the door was opened to me by her little maid lizzie in sunday trim as if some grand event was impending over this workday and the drawingroom upstairs was arranged in accordance with this idea the table was set out with the best green cardcloth and writing materials upon it on the little chiffonier was a tray with a newlydecanted bottle of cowslipwine and some ladiesfinger biscuits miss pole herself was in solemn array as if to receive visitors although it was only eleven oclock mrs forrester was there crying quietly and sadly and my arrival seemed only to call forth fresh tears before we had finished our greetings performed with lugubrious mystery of demeanour there was another rattattat and mrs fitzadam appeared crimson with walking and excitement it seemed as if this was all the company expected for now miss pole made several demonstrations of being about to open the business of the meeting by stirring the fire opening and shutting the door and coughing and blowing her nose then she arranged us all round the table taking care to place me opposite to her and last of all she inquired of me if the sad report was true as she feared it was that miss matty had lost all her fortune of course i had but one answer to make and i never saw more unaffected sorrow depicted on any countenances than i did there on the three before me i wish mrs jamieson was here said mrs forrester at last but to judge from mrs fitzadams face she could not second the wish but without mrs jamieson said miss pole with just a sound of offended merit in her voice we the ladies of cranford in my drawingroom assembled can resolve upon something i imagine we are none of us what may be called rich though we all possess a genteel competency sufficient for tastes that are elegant and refined and would not if they could be vulgarly ostentatious here i observed miss pole refer to a small card concealed in her hand on which i imagine she had put down a few notes miss smith she continued addressing me familiarly known as mary to all the company assembled but this was a state occasion i have conversed in privatei made it my business to do so yesterday afternoonwith these ladies on the misfortune which has happened to our friend and one and all of us have agreed that while we have a superfluity it is not only a duty but a pleasurea true pleasure maryher voice was rather choked just here and she had to wipe her spectacles before she could go onto give what we can to assist hermiss matilda jenkyns only in consideration of the feelings of delicate independence existing in the mind of every refined femalei was sure she had got back to the card nowwe wish to contribute our mites in a secret and concealed manner so as not to hurt the feelings i have referred to and our object in requesting you to meet us this morning is that believing you are the daughterthat your father is in fact her confidential adviser in all pecuniary matters we imagined that by consulting with him you might devise some mode in which our contribution could be made to appear the legal due which miss matilda jenkyns ought to receive from probably your father knowing her investments can fill up the blank miss pole concluded her address and looked round for approval and agreement i have expressed your meaning ladies have i not and while miss smith considers what reply to make allow me to offer you some little refreshment i had no great reply to make i had more thankfulness at my heart for their kind thoughts than i cared to put into words and so i only mumbled out something to the effect that i would name what miss pole had said to my father and that if anything could be arranged for dear miss mattyand here i broke down utterly and had to be refreshed with a glass of cowslip wine before i could check the crying which had been repressed for the last two or three days the worst was all the ladies cried in concert even miss pole cried who had said a hundred times that to betray emotion before any one was a sign of weakness and want of selfcontrol she recovered herself into a slight degree of impatient anger directed against me as having set them all off and moreover i think she was vexed that i could not make a speech back in return for hers and if i had known beforehand what was to be said and had a card on which to express the probable feelings that would rise in my heart i would have tried to gratify her as it was mrs forrester was the person to speak when we had recovered our composure i dont mind among friends stating that ino im not poor exactly but i dont think im what you may call rich i wish i were for dear miss mattys sakebut if you please ill write down in a sealed paper what i can give i only wish it was more my dear mary i do indeed now i saw why paper pens and ink were provided every lady wrote down the sum she could give annually signed the paper and sealed it mysteriously if their proposal was acceded to my father was to be allowed to open the papers under pledge of secrecy if not they were to be returned to their writers when this ceremony had been gone through i rose to depart but each lady seemed to wish to have a private conference with me miss pole kept me in the drawingroom to explain why in mrs jamiesons absence she had taken the lead in this movement as she was pleased to call it and also to inform me that she had heard from good sources that mrs jamieson was coming home directly in a state of high displeasure against her sisterinlaw who was forthwith to leave her house and was she believed to return to edinburgh that very afternoon of course this piece of intelligence could not be communicated before mrs fitzadam more especially as miss pole was inclined to think that lady glenmires engagement to mr hoggins could not possibly hold against the blaze of mrs jamiesons displeasure a few hearty inquiries after miss mattys health concluded my interview with miss pole on coming downstairs i found mrs forrester waiting for me at the entrance to the diningparlour she drew me in and when the door was shut she tried two or three times to begin on some subject which was so unapproachable apparently that i began to despair of our ever getting to a clear understanding at last out it came the poor old lady trembling all the time as if it were a great crime which she was exposing to daylight in telling me how very very little she had to live upon a confession which she was brought to make from a dread lest we should think that the small contribution named in her paper bore any proportion to her love and regard for miss matty and yet that sum which she so eagerly relinquished was in truth more than a twentieth part of what she had to live upon and keep house and a little servingmaid all as became one born a tyrrell and when the whole income does not nearly amount to a hundred pounds to give up a twentieth of it will necessitate many careful economies and many pieces of selfdenial small and insignificant in the worlds account but bearing a different value in another accountbook that i have heard of she did so wish she was rich she said and this wish she kept repeating with no thought of herself in it only with a longing yearning desire to be able to heap up miss mattys measure of comforts it was some time before i could console her enough to leave her and then on quitting the house i was waylaid by mrs fitzadam who had also her confidence to make of pretty nearly the opposite description she had not liked to put down all that she could afford and was ready to give she told me she thought she never could look miss matty in the face again if she presumed to be giving her so much as she should like to do miss matty continued she that i thought was such a fine young lady when i was nothing but a country girl coming to market with eggs and butter and such like things for my father though welltodo would always make me go on as my mother had done before me and i had to come into cranford every saturday and see after sales and prices and what not and one day i remember i met miss matty in the lane that leads to combehurst she was walking on the footpath which you know is raised a good way above the road and a gentleman rode beside her and was talking to her and she was looking down at some primroses she had gathered and pulling them all to pieces and i do believe she was crying but after she had passed she turned round and ran after me to askoh so kindlyabout my poor mother who lay on her deathbed and when i cried she took hold of my hand to comfort meand the gentleman waiting for her all the timeand her poor heart very full of something i am sure and i thought it such an honour to be spoken to in that pretty way by the rectors daughter who visited at arley hall i have loved her ever since though perhaps id no right to do it but if you can think of any way in which i might be allowed to give a little more without any one knowing it i should be so much obliged to you my dear and my brother would be delighted to doctor her for nothingmedicines leeches and all i know that he and her ladyship my dear i little thought in the days i was telling you of that i should ever come to be sisterinlaw to a ladyship would do anything for her we all would i told her i was quite sure of it and promised all sorts of things in my anxiety to get home to miss matty who might well be wondering what had become of meabsent from her two hours without being able to account for it she had taken very little note of time however as she had been occupied in numberless little arrangements preparatory to the great step of giving up her house it was evidently a relief to her to be doing something in the way of retrenchment for as she said whenever she paused to think the recollection of the poor fellow with his bad fivepound note came over her and she felt quite dishonest only if it made her so uncomfortable what must it not be doing to the directors of the bank who must know so much more of the misery consequent upon this failure she almost made me angry by dividing her sympathy between these directors whom she imagined overwhelmed by selfreproach for the mismanagement of other peoples affairs and those who were suffering like her indeed of the two she seemed to think poverty a lighter burden than selfreproach but i privately doubted if the directors would agree with her old hoards were taken out and examined as to their money value which luckily was small or else i dont know how miss matty would have prevailed upon herself to part with such things as her mothers weddingring the strange uncouth brooch with which her father had disfigured his shirtfrill etc however we arranged things a little in order as to their pecuniary estimation and were all ready for my father when he came the next morning i am not going to weary you with the details of all the business we went through and one reason for not telling about them is that i did not understand what we were doing at the time and cannot recollect it now miss matty and i sat assenting to accounts and schemes and reports and documents of which i do not believe we either of us understood a word for my father was clearheaded and decisive and a capital man of business and if we made the slightest inquiry or expressed the slightest want of comprehension he had a sharp way of saying eh eh its as clear as daylight whats your objection and as we had not comprehended anything of what he had proposed we found it rather difficult to shape our objections in fact we never were sure if we had any so presently miss matty got into a nervously acquiescent state and said yes and certainly at every pause whether required or not but when i once joined in as chorus to a decidedly pronounced by miss matty in a tremblingly dubious tone my father fired round at me and asked me what there was to decide and i am sure to this day i have never known but in justice to him i must say he had come over from drumble to help miss matty when he could ill spare the time and when his own affairs were in a very anxious state while miss matty was out of the room giving orders for luncheonand sadly perplexed between her desire of honouring my father by a delicate dainty meal and her conviction that she had no right now that all her money was gone to indulge this desirei told him of the meeting of the cranford ladies at miss poles the day before he kept brushing his hand before his eyes as i spokeand when i went back to marthas offer the evening before of receiving miss matty as a lodger he fairly walked away from me to the window and began drumming with his fingers upon it then he turned abruptly round and said see mary how a good innocent life makes friends all around confound it i could make a good lesson out of it if i were a parson but as it is i cant get a tail to my sentencesonly im sure you feel what i want to say you and i will have a walk after lunch and talk a bit more about these plans illustration drumming with his fingers upon it the luncha hot savoury muttonchop and a little of the cold loin sliced and friedwas now brought in every morsel of this last dish was finished to marthas great gratification then my father bluntly told miss matty he wanted to talk to me alone and that he would stroll out and see some of the old places and then i could tell her what plan we thought desirable just before we went out she called me back and said remember dear im the only one lefti mean theres no one to be hurt by what i do im willing to do anything thats right and honest and i dont think if deborah knows where she is shell care so very much if im not genteel because you see shell know all dear only let me see what i can do and pay the poor people as far as im able i gave her a hearty kiss and ran after my father the result of our conversation was this if all parties were agreeable martha and jem were to be married with as little delay as possible and they were to live on in miss mattys present abode the sum which the cranford ladies had agreed to contribute annually being sufficient to meet the greater part of the rent and leaving martha free to appropriate what miss matty should pay for her lodgings to any little extra comforts required about the sale my father was dubious at first he said the old rectory furniture however carefully used and reverently treated would fetch very little and that little would be but as a drop in the sea of the debts of the town and county bank but when i represented how miss mattys tender conscience would be soothed by feeling that she had done what she could he gave way especially after i had told him the fivepound note adventure and he had scolded me well for allowing it i then alluded to my idea that she might add to her small income by selling tea and to my surprise for i had nearly given up the plan my father grasped at it with all the energy of a tradesman i think he reckoned his chickens before they were hatched for he immediately ran up the profits of the sales that she could effect in cranford to more than twenty pounds a year the small diningparlour was to be converted into a shop without any of its degrading characteristics a table was to be the counter one window was to be retained unaltered and the other changed into a glass door i evidently rose in his estimation for having made this bright suggestion i only hoped we should not both fall in miss mattys but she was patient and content with all our arrangements she knew she said that we should do the best we could for her and she only hoped only stipulated that she should pay every farthing that she could be said to owe for her fathers sake who had been so respected in cranford my father and i had agreed to say as little as possible about the bank indeed never to mention it again if it could be helped some of the plans were evidently a little perplexing to her but she had seen me sufficiently snubbed in the morning for want of comprehension to venture on too many inquiries now and all passed over well with a hope on her part that no one would be hurried into marriage on her account when we came to the proposal that she should sell tea i could see it was rather a shock to her not on account of any personal loss of gentility involved but only because she distrusted her own powers of action in a new line of life and would timidly have preferred a little more privation to any exertion for which she feared she was unfitted however when she saw my father was bent upon it she sighed and said she would try and if she did not do well of course she might give it up one good thing about it was she did not think men ever bought tea and it was of men particularly she was afraid they had such sharp loud ways with them and did up accounts and counted their change so quickly now if she might only sell comfits to children she was sure she could please them illustration chapter tailpiece illustration chapter a happy return before i left miss matty at cranford everything had been comfortably arranged for her even mrs jamiesons approval of her selling tea had been gained that oracle had taken a few days to consider whether by so doing miss matty would forfeit her right to the privileges of society in cranford i think she had some little idea of mortifying lady glenmire by the decision she gave at last which was to this effect that whereas a married woman takes her husbands rank by the strict laws of precedence an unmarried woman retains the station her father occupied so cranford was allowed to visit miss matty and whether allowed or not it intended to visit lady glenmire but what was our surpriseour dismaywhen we learnt that mr and mrs hoggins were returning on the following tuesday mrs hoggins had she absolutely dropped her title and so in a spirit of bravado cut the aristocracy to become a hoggins she who might have been called lady glenmire to her dying day mrs jamieson was pleased she said it only convinced her of what she had known from the first that the creature had a low taste but the creature looked very happy on sunday at church nor did we see it necessary to keep our veils down on that side of our bonnets on which mr and mrs hoggins sat as mrs jamieson did thereby missing all the smiling glory of his face and all the becoming blushes of hers i am not sure if martha and jem looked more radiant in the afternoon when they too made their first appearance mrs jamieson soothed the turbulence of her soul by having the blinds of her windows drawn down as if for a funeral on the day when mr and mrs hoggins received callers and it was with some difficulty that she was prevailed upon to continue the st jamess chronicle so indignant was she with its having inserted the announcement of the marriage miss mattys sale went off famously she retained the furniture of her sittingroom and bedroom the former of which she was to occupy till martha could meet with a lodger who might wish to take it and into this sittingroom and bedroom she had to cram all sorts of things which were the auctioneer assured her bought in for her at the sale by an unknown friend i always suspected mrs fitzadam of this but she must have had an accessory who knew what articles were particularly regarded by miss matty on account of their associations with her early days the rest of the house looked rather bare to be sure all except one tiny bedroom of which my father allowed me to purchase the furniture for my occasional use in case of miss mattys illness illustration all the smiling glory of his face i had expended my own small store in buying all manner of comfits and lozenges in order to tempt the little people whom miss matty loved so much to come about her tea in bright green canisters and comfits in tumblersmiss matty and i felt quite proud as we looked round us on the evening before the shop was to be opened martha had scoured the boarded floor to a white cleanness and it was adorned with a brilliant piece of oilcloth on which customers were to stand before the tablecounter the wholesome smell of plaster and whitewash pervaded the apartment a very small matilda jenkyns licensed to sell tea was hidden under the lintel of the new door and two boxes of tea with cabalistic inscriptions all over them stood ready to disgorge their contents into the canisters miss matty as i ought to have mentioned before had had some scruples of conscience at selling tea when there was already mr johnson in the town who included it among his numerous commodities and before she could quite reconcile herself to the adoption of her new business she had trotted down to his shop unknown to me to tell him of the project that was entertained and to inquire if it was likely to injure his business my father called this idea of hers great nonsense and wondered how tradespeople were to get on if there was to be a continual consulting of each others interests which would put a stop to all competition directly and perhaps it would not have done in drumble but in cranford it answered very well for not only did mr johnson kindly put at rest all miss mattys scruples and fear of injuring his business but i have reason to know he repeatedly sent customers to her saying that the teas he kept were of a common kind but that miss jenkyns had all the choice sorts and expensive tea is a very favourite luxury with welltodo tradespeople and rich farmers wives who turn up their noses at the congou and souchong prevalent at many tables of gentility and will have nothing else than gunpowder and pekoe for themselves but to return to miss matty it was really very pleasant to see how her unselfishness and simple sense of justice called out the same good qualities in others she never seemed to think any one would impose upon her because she should be so grieved to do it to them i have heard her put a stop to the asseverations of the man who brought her coals by quietly saying i am sure you would be sorry to bring me wrong weight and if the coals were short measure that time i dont believe they ever were again people would have felt as much ashamed of presuming on her good faith as they would have done on that of a child but my father says such simplicity might be very well in cranford but would never do in the world and i fancy the world must be very bad for with all my fathers suspicion of every one with whom he has dealings and in spite of all his many precautions he lost upwards of a thousand pounds by roguery only last year i just stayed long enough to establish miss matty in her new mode of life and to pack up the library which the rector had purchased he had written a very kind letter to miss matty saying how glad he should be to take a library so well selected as he knew that the late mr jenkynss must have been at any valuation put upon them and when she agreed to this with a touch of sorrowful gladness that they would go back to the rectory and be arranged on the accustomed walls once more he sent word that he feared that he had not room for them all and perhaps miss matty would kindly allow him to leave some volumes on her shelves but miss matty said that she had her bible and johnsons dictionary and should not have much time for reading she was afraid still i retained a few books out of consideration for the rectors kindness the money which he had paid and that produced by the sale was partly expended in the stock of tea and part of it was invested against a rainy dayie old age or illness it was but a small sum it is true and it occasioned a few evasions of truth and white lies all of which i think very wrong indeedin theoryand would rather not put them in practice for we knew miss matty would be perplexed as to her duty if she were aware of any little reservefund being made for her while the debts of the bank remained unpaid moreover she had never been told of the way in which her friends were contributing to pay the rent i should have liked to tell her this but the mystery of the affair gave a piquancy to their deed of kindness which the ladies were unwilling to give up and at first martha had to shirk many a perplexed question as to her ways and means of living in such a house but by and by miss mattys prudent uneasiness sank down into acquiescence with the existing arrangement i left miss matty with a good heart her sales of tea during the first two days had surpassed my most sanguine expectations the whole country round seemed to be all out of tea at once the only alteration i could have desired in miss mattys way of doing business was that she should not have so plaintively entreated some of her customers not to buy green tearunning it down as slow poison sure to destroy the nerves and produce all manner of evil their pertinacity in taking it in spite of all her warnings distressed her so much that i really thought she would relinquish the sale of it and so lose half her custom and i was driven to my wits end for instances of longevity entirely attributable to a persevering use of green tea but the final argument which settled the question was a happy reference of mine to the trainoil and tallow candles which the esquimaux not only enjoy but digest after that she acknowledged that one mans meat might be another mans poison and contented herself thenceforward with an occasional remonstrance when she thought the purchaser was too young and innocent to be acquainted with the evil effects green tea produced on some constitutions and an habitual sigh when people old enough to choose more wisely would prefer it i went over from drumble once a quarter at least to settle the accounts and see after the necessary business letters and speaking of letters i began to be very much ashamed of remembering my letter to the aga jenkyns and very glad i had never named my writing to any one i only hoped the letter was lost no answer came no sign was made about a year after miss matty set up shop i received one of marthas hieroglyphics begging me to come to cranford very soon i was afraid that miss matty was ill and went off that very afternoon and took martha by surprise when she saw me on opening the door we went into the kitchen as usual to have our confidential conference and then martha told me she was expecting her confinement very soonin a week or two and she did not think miss matty was aware of it and she wanted me to break the news to her for indeed miss continued martha crying hysterically im afraid she wont approve of it and im sure i dont know who is to take care of her as she should be taken care of when i am laid up i comforted martha by telling her i would remain till she was about again and only wished she had told me her reason for this sudden summons as then i would have brought the requisite stock of clothes but martha was so tearful and tenderspirited and unlike her usual self that i said as little as possible about myself and endeavoured rather to comfort martha under all the probable and possible misfortunes which came crowding upon her imagination i then stole out of the housedoor and made my appearance as if i were a customer in the shop just to take miss matty by surprise and gain an idea of how she looked in her new situation it was warm may weather so only the little halfdoor was closed and miss matty sat behind her counter knitting an elaborate pair of garters elaborate they seemed to me but the difficult stitch was no weight upon her mind for she was singing in a low voice to herself as her needles went rapidly in and out i call it singing but i daresay a musician would not use that word to the tuneless yet sweet humming of the low worn voice i found out from the words far more than from the attempt at the tune that it was the old hundredth she was crooning to herself but the quiet continuous sound told of content and gave me a pleasant feeling as i stood in the street just outside the door quite in harmony with that soft may morning i went in at first she did not catch who it was and stood up as if to serve me but in another minute watchful pussy had clutched her knitting which was dropped in eager joy at seeing me i found after we had had a little conversation that it was as martha said and that miss matty had no idea of the approaching household event so i thought i would let things take their course secure that when i went to her with the baby in my arms i should obtain that forgiveness for martha which she was needlessly frightening herself into believing that miss matty would withhold under some notion that the new claimant would require attentions from its mother that it would be faithless treason to miss matty to render illustration a complimentary speech but i was right i think that must be an hereditary quality for my father says he is scarcely ever wrong one morning within a week after i arrived i went to call miss matty with a little bundle of flannel in my arms she was very much awestruck when i showed her what it was and asked for her spectacles off the dressingtable and looked at it curiously with a sort of tender wonder at its small perfection of parts she could not banish the thought of the surprise all day but went about on tiptoe and was very silent but she stole up to see martha and they both cried with joy and she got into a complimentary speech to jem and did not know how to get out of it again and was only extricated from her dilemma by the sound of the shopbell which was an equal relief to the shy proud honest jem who shook my hand so vigorously when i congratulated him that i think i feel the pain of it yet i had a busy life while martha was laid up i attended on miss matty and prepared her meals i cast up her accounts and examined into the state of her canisters and tumblers i helped her too occasionally in the shop and it gave me no small amusement and sometimes a little uneasiness to watch her ways there if a little child came in to ask for an ounce of almondcomfits and four of the large kind which miss matty sold weighed that much she always added one more by way of makeweight as she called it although the scale was handsomely turned before and when i remonstrated against this her reply was the little things like it so much there was no use in telling her that the fifth comfit weighed a quarter of an ounce and made every sale into a loss to her pocket so i remembered the green tea and winged my shaft with a feather out of her own plumage i told her how unwholesome almondcomfits were and how ill excess in them might make the little children this argument produced some effect for henceforward instead of the fifth comfit she always told them to hold out their tiny palms into which she shook either peppermint or ginger lozenges as a preventive to the dangers that might arise from the previous sale altogether the lozenge trade conducted on these principles did not promise to be remunerative but i was happy to find she had made more than twenty pounds during the last year by her sales of tea and moreover that now she was accustomed to it she did not dislike the employment which brought her into kindly intercourse with many of the people round about if she gave them good weight they in their turn brought many a little country present to the old rectors daughter a cream cheese a few newlaid eggs a little fresh ripe fruit a bunch of flowers the counter was quite loaded with these offerings sometimes as she told me as for cranford in general it was going on much as usual the jamieson and hoggins feud still raged if a feud it could be called when only one side cared much about it mr and mrs hoggins were very happy together and like most very happy people quite ready to be friendly indeed mrs hoggins was really desirous to be restored to mrs jamiesons good graces because of the former intimacy but mrs jamieson considered their very happiness an insult to the glenmire family to which she had still the honour to belong and she doggedly refused and rejected every advance mr mulliner like a faithful clansman espoused his mistresss side with ardour if he saw either mr or mrs hoggins he would cross the street and appear absorbed in the contemplation of life in general and his own path in particular until he had passed them by miss pole used to amuse herself with wondering what in the world mrs jamieson would do if either she or mr mulliner or any other member of her household was taken ill she could hardly have the face to call in mr hoggins after the way she had behaved to them miss pole grew quite impatient for some indisposition or accident to befall mrs jamieson or her dependants in order that cranford might see how she would act under the perplexing circumstances illustration absorbed in contemplation martha was beginning to go about again and i had already fixed a limit not very far distant to my visit when one afternoon as i was sitting in the shopparlour with miss mattyi remember the weather was colder now than it had been in may three weeks before and we had a fire and kept the door fully closedwe saw a gentleman go slowly past the window and then stand opposite to the door as if looking out for the name which we had so carefully hidden he took out a double eyeglass and peered about for some time before he could discover it then he came in and all on a sudden it flashed across me that it was the aga himself for his clothes had an outoftheway foreign cut about them and his face was deep brown as if tanned and retanned by the sun his complexion contrasted oddly with his plentiful snowwhite hair his eyes were dark and piercing and he had an odd way of contracting them and puckering up his cheeks into innumerable wrinkles when he looked earnestly at objects he did so to miss matty when he first came in his glance had first caught and lingered a little upon me but then turned with the peculiar searching look i have described to miss matty she was a little fluttered and nervous but no more so than she always was when any man came into her shop she thought that he would probably have a note or a sovereign at least for which she would have to give change which was an operation she very much disliked to perform but the present customer stood opposite to her without asking for anything only looking fixedly at her as he drummed upon the table with his fingers just for all the world as miss jenkyns used to do miss matty was on the point of asking him what he wanted as she told me afterwards when he turned sharp to me is your name mary smith yes said i all my doubts as to his identity were set at rest and i only wondered what he would say or do next and how miss matty would stand the joyful shock of what he had to reveal apparently he was at a loss how to announce himself for he looked round at last in search of something to buy so as to gain time and as it happened his eye caught on the almondcomfits and he boldly asked for a pound of those things i doubt if miss matty had a whole pound in the shop and besides the unusual magnitude of the order she was distressed with the idea of the indigestion they would produce taken in such unlimited quantities she looked up to remonstrate something of tender relaxation in his face struck home to her heart she said it isoh sir can you be peter and trembled from head to foot in a moment he was round the table and had her in his arms sobbing the tearless cries of old age i brought her a glass of wine for indeed her colour had changed so as to alarm me and mr peter too he kept saying i have been too sudden for you mattyi have my little girl i proposed that she should go at once up into the drawingroom and lie down on the sofa there she looked wistfully at her brother whose hand she had held tight even when nearly fainting but on his assuring her that he would not leave her she allowed him to carry her upstairs i thought that the best i could do was to run and put the kettle on the fire for early tea and then to attend to the shop leaving the brother and sister to exchange some of the many thousand things they must have to say i had also to break the news to martha who received it with a burst of tears which nearly infected me she kept recovering herself to ask if i was sure it was indeed miss mattys brother for i had mentioned that he had gray hair and she had always heard that he was a very handsome young man something of the same kind perplexed miss matty at teatime when she was installed in the great easychair opposite to mr jenkynss in order to gaze her fill she could hardly drink for looking at him and as for eating that was out of the question i suppose hot climates age people very quickly said she almost to herself when you left cranford you had not a gray hair in your head but how many years ago is that said mr peter smiling ah true yes i suppose you and i are getting old but still i did not think we were so very old but white hair is very becoming to you peter she continueda little afraid lest she had hurt him by revealing how his appearance had impressed her i suppose i forgot dates too matty for what do you think i have brought for you from india i have an indian muslin gown and a pearl necklace for you somewhere in my chest at portsmouth he smiled as if amused at the idea of the incongruity of his presents with the appearance of his sister but this did not strike her all at once while the elegance of the articles did i could see that for a moment her imagination dwelt complacently on the idea of herself thus attired and instinctively she put her hand up to her throatthat little delicate throat which as miss pole had told me had been one of her youthful charms but the hand met the touch of folds of soft muslin in which she was always swathed up to her chin and the sensation recalled a sense of the unsuitableness of a pearl necklace to her age she said im afraid im too old but it was very kind of you to think of it they are just what i should have liked years agowhen i was young so i thought my little matty i remembered your tastes they were so like my dear mothers at the mention of that name the brother and sister clasped each others hands yet more fondly and although they were perfectly silent i fancied they might have something to say if they were unchecked by my presence and i got up to arrange my room for mr peters occupation that night intending myself to share miss mattys bed but at my movement he started up i must go and settle about a room at the george my carpetbag is there too no said miss matty in great distressyou must not go please dear peterpray maryoh you must not go she was so much agitated that we both promised everything she wished peter sat down again and gave her his hand which for better security she held in both of hers and i left the room to accomplish my arrangements long long into the night far far into the morning did miss matty and i talk she had much to tell me of her brothers life and adventures which he had communicated to her as they had sat alone she said all was thoroughly clear to her but i never quite understood the whole story and when in after days i lost my awe of mr peter enough to question him myself he laughed at my curiosity and told me stories that sounded so very much like baron munchausens that i was sure he was making fun of me what i heard from miss matty was that he had been a volunteer at the siege of rangoon had been taken prisoner by the burmese had somehow obtained favour and eventual freedom from knowing how to bleed the chief of the small tribe in some case of dangerous illness that on his release from years of captivity he had had his letters returned from england with the ominous word dead marked upon them and believing himself to be the last of his race he had settled down as an indigo planter and had proposed to spend the remainder of his life in the country to whose inhabitants and modes of life he had become habituated when my letter had reached him and with the odd vehemence which characterised him in age as it had done in youth he had sold his land and all his possessions to the first purchaser and come home to the poor old sister who was more glad and rich than any princess when she looked at him she talked me to sleep at last and then i was awakened by a slight sound at the door for which she begged my pardon as she crept penitently into bed but it seems that when i could no longer confirm her belief that the longlost was really hereunder the same roofshe had begun to fear lest it was only a waking dream of hers that there never had been a peter sitting by her all that blessed eveningbut that the real peter lay dead far away beneath some wild seawave or under some strange eastern tree and so strong had this nervous feeling of hers become that she was fain to get up and go and convince herself that he was really there by listening through the door to his even regular breathingi dont like to call it snoring but i heard it myself through two closed doorsand by and by it soothed miss matty to sleep illustration gleefully awaited the shower of comfits and lozenges i dont believe mr peter came home from india as rich as a nabob he even considered himself poor but neither he nor miss matty cared much about that at any rate he had enough to live upon very genteelly at cranford he and miss matty together and a day or two after his arrival the shop was closed while troops of little urchins gleefully awaited the shower of comfits and lozenges that came from time to time down upon their faces as they stood upgazing at miss mattys drawingroom windows occasionally miss matty would say to them halfhidden behind the curtains my dear children dont make yourselves ill but a strong arm pulled her back and a more rattling shower than ever succeeded a part of the tea was sent in presents to the cranford ladies and some of it was distributed among the old people who remembered mr peter in the days of his frolicsome youth the india muslin gown was reserved for darling flora gordon miss jessie browns daughter the gordons had been on the continent for the last few years but were now expected to return very soon and miss matty in her sisterly pride anticipated great delight in the joy of showing them mr peter the pearl necklace disappeared and about that time many handsome and useful presents made their appearance in the households of miss pole and mrs forrester and some rare and delicate indian ornaments graced the drawingrooms of mrs jamieson and mrs fitzadam i myself was not forgotten among other things i had the handsomest bound and best edition of dr johnsons works that could be procured and dear miss matty with tears in her eyes begged me to consider it as a present from her sister as well as herself in short no one was forgotten and what was more every one however insignificant who had shown kindness to miss matty at any time was sure of mr peters cordial regard illustration chapter tailpiece illustration chapter peace to cranford it was not surprising that mr peter became such a favourite at cranford the ladies vied with each other who should admire him most and no wonder for their quiet lives were astonishingly stirred up by the arrival from indiaespecially as the person arrived told more wonderful stories than sindbad the sailor and as miss pole said was quite as good as an arabian night any evening for my own part i had vibrated all my life between drumble and cranford and i thought it was quite possible that all mr peters stories might be true although wonderful but when i found that if we swallowed an anecdote of tolerable magnitude one week we had the dose considerably increased the next i began to have my doubts especially as i noticed that when his sister was present the accounts of indian life were comparatively tame not that she knew more than we did perhaps less i noticed also that when the rector came to call mr peter talked in a different way about the countries he had been in but i dont think the ladies in cranford would have considered him such a wonderful traveller if they had only heard him talk in the quiet way he did to him they liked him the better indeed for being what they called so very oriental one day at a select party in his honour which miss pole gave and from which as mrs jamieson honoured it with her presence and had even offered to send mr mulliner to wait mr and mrs hoggins and mrs fitzadam were necessarily excludedone day at miss poles mr peter said he was tired of sitting upright against the hardbacked uneasy chairs and asked if he might not indulge himself in sitting crosslegged miss poles consent was eagerly given and down he went with the utmost gravity but when miss pole asked me in an audible whisper if he did not remind me of the father of the faithful i could not help thinking of poor simon jones the lame tailor and while mrs jamieson slowly commented on the elegance and convenience of the attitude i remembered how we had all followed that ladys lead in condemning mr hoggins for vulgarity because he simply crossed his legs as he sat still on his chair many of mr peters ways of eating were a little strange amongst such ladies as miss pole and miss matty and mrs jamieson especially when i recollected the untasted green peas and twopronged forks at poor mr holbrooks dinner illustration the father of the faithful the mention of that gentlemans name recalls to my mind a conversation between mr peter and miss matty one evening in the summer after he returned to cranford the day had been very hot and miss matty had been much oppressed by the weather in the heat of which her brother revelled i remember that she had been unable to nurse marthas baby which had become her favourite employment of late and which was as much at home in her arms as in its mothers as long as it remained a lightweight portable by one so fragile as miss matty this day to which i refer miss matty had seemed more than usually feeble and languid and only revived when the sun went down and her sofa was wheeled to the open window through which although it looked into the principal street of cranford the fragrant smell of the neighbouring hayfields came in every now and then borne by the soft breezes that stirred the dull air of the summer twilight and then died away the silence of the sultry atmosphere was lost in the murmuring noises which came in from many an open window and door even the children were abroad in the street late as it was between ten and eleven enjoying the game of play for which they had not had spirits during the heat of the day it was a source of satisfaction to miss matty to see how few candles were lighted even in the apartments of those houses from which issued the greatest signs of life mr peter miss matty and i had all been quiet each with a separate reverie for some little time when mr peter broke in do you know little matty i could have sworn you were on the high road to matrimony when i left england that last time if anybody had told me you would have lived and died an old maid then i should have laughed in their faces miss matty made no reply and i tried in vain to think of some subject which should effectually turn the conversation but i was very stupid and before i spoke he went on it was holbrook that fine manly fellow who lived at woodley that i used to think would carry off my little matty you would not think it now i daresay mary but this sister of mine was once a very pretty girlat least i thought so and so ive a notion did poor holbrook what business had he to die before i came home to thank him for all his kindness to a goodfornothing cub as i was it was that that made me first think he cared for you for in all our fishing expeditions it was matty matty we talked about poor deborah what a lecture she read me on having asked him home to lunch one day when she had seen the arley carriage in the town and thought that my lady might call well thats long years ago more than half a lifetime and yet it seems like yesterday i dont know a fellow i should have liked better as a brotherinlaw you must have played your cards badly my little matty somehow or anotherwanted your brother to be a good gobetween eh little one said he putting out his hand to take hold of hers as she lay on the sofa why whats this youre shivering and shaking matty with that confounded open window shut it mary this minute i did so and then stooped down to kiss miss matty and see if she really were chilled she caught at my hand and gave it a hard squeezebut unconsciously i thinkfor in a minute or two she spoke to us quite in her usual voice and smiled our uneasiness away although she patiently submitted to the prescriptions we enforced of a warm bed and a glass of weak negus i was to leave cranford the next day and before i went i saw that all the effects of the open window had quite vanished i had superintended most of the alterations necessary in the house and household during the latter weeks of my stay the shop was once more a parlour the empty resounding rooms again furnished up to the very garrets there has been some talk of establishing martha and jem in another house but miss matty would not hear of this indeed i never saw her so much roused as when miss pole had assumed it to be the most desirable arrangement as long as martha would remain with miss matty miss matty was only too thankful to have her about her yes and jem too who was a very pleasant man to have in the house for she never saw him from weeks end to weeks end and as for the probable children if they would all turn out such little darlings as her goddaughter matilda she should not mind the number if martha didnt besides the next was to be called deboraha point which miss matty had reluctantly yielded to marthas stubborn determination that her firstborn was to be matilda so miss pole had to lower her colours and even her voice as she said to me that as mr and mrs hearn were still to go on living in the same house with miss matty we had certainly done a wise thing in hiring marthas niece as an auxiliary i left miss matty and mr peter most comfortable and contented the only subject for regret to the tender heart of the one and the social friendly nature of the other being the unfortunate quarrel between mrs jamieson and the plebeian hogginses and their following in joke i prophesied one day that this would only last until mrs jamieson or mr mulliner were ill in which case they would only be too glad to be friends with mr hoggins but miss matty did not like my looking forward to anything like illness in so light a manner and before the year was out all had come round in a far more satisfactory way i received two cranford letters on one auspicious october morning both miss pole and miss matty wrote to ask me to come over and meet the gordons who had returned to england alive and well with their two children now almost grown up dear jessie brown had kept her old kind nature although she had changed her name and station and she wrote to say that she and major gordon expected to be in cranford on the fourteenth and she hoped and begged to be remembered to mrs jamieson named first as became her honourable station miss pole and miss mattycould she ever forget their kindness to her poor father and sistermrs forrester mr hoggins and here again came in an allusion to kindness shown to the dead long ago his new wife who as such must allow mrs gordon to desire to make her acquaintance and who was moreover an old scotch friend of her husbands in short every one was named from the rectorwho had been appointed to cranford in the interim between captain browns death and miss jessies marriage and was now associated with the latter eventdown to miss betsy barker all were asked to the luncheon all except mrs fitzadam who had come to live in cranford since miss jessie browns days and whom i found rather moping on account of the omission people wondered at miss betty barkers being included in the honourable list but then as miss pole said we must remember the disregard of the genteel proprieties of life in which the poor captain had educated his girls and for his sake we swallowed our pride indeed mrs jamieson rather took it as a compliment as putting miss betty formerly her maid on a level with those hogginses but when i arrived in cranford nothing was as yet ascertained of mrs jamiesons own intentions would the honourable lady go or would she not mr peter declared that she should and she would miss pole shook her head and desponded but mr peter was a man of resources in the first place he persuaded miss matty to write to mrs gordon and to tell her of mrs fitzadams existence and to beg that one so kind and cordial and generous might be included in the pleasant invitation an answer came back by return of post with a pretty little note for mrs fitzadam and a request that miss matty would deliver it herself and explain the previous omission mrs fitzadam was as pleased as could be and thanked miss matty over and over again mr peter had said leave mrs jamieson to me so we did especially as we knew nothing that we could do to alter her determination if once formed i did not know nor did miss matty how things were going on until miss pole asked me just the day before mrs gordon came if i thought there was anything between mr peter and mrs jamieson in the matrimonial line for that mrs jamieson was really going to the lunch at the george she had sent mr mulliner down to desire that there might be a footstool put to the warmest seat in the room as she meant to come and knew that their chairs were very high miss pole had picked this piece of news up and from it she conjectured all sorts of things and bemoaned yet more if peter should marry what would become of poor dear miss matty and mrs jamieson of all people miss pole seemed to think there were other ladies in cranford who would have done more credit to his choice and i think she must have had some one who was unmarried in her head for she kept saying it was so wanting in delicacy in a widow to think of such a thing illustration the proof sheet of a great placard when i got back to miss mattys i really did begin to think that mr peter might be thinking of mrs jamieson for a wife and i was as unhappy as miss pole about it he had the proof sheet of a great placard in his hand signor brunoni magician to the king of delhi the rajah of oude and the great lama of thibet etc etc was going to perform in cranford for one night only the very next night and miss matty exultant showed me a letter from the gordons promising to remain over this gaiety which miss matty said was entirely peters doing he had written to ask the signor to come and was to be at all the expenses of the affair tickets were to be sent gratis to as many as the room would hold in short miss matty was charmed with the plan and said that tomorrow cranford would remind her of the preston guild to which she had been in her youtha luncheon at the george with the dear gordons and the signor in the assembly room in the evening but ii looked only at the fatal words under the patronage of the honourable mrs jamieson she then was chosen to preside over this entertainment of mr peters she was perhaps going to displace my dear miss matty in his heart and make her life lonely once more i could not look forward to the morrow with any pleasure and every innocent anticipation of miss mattys only served to add to my annoyance so angry and irritated and exaggerating every little incident which could add to my irritation i went on till we were all assembled in the great parlour at the george major and mrs gordon and pretty flora and mr ludovic were all as bright and handsome and friendly as could be but i could hardly attend to them for watching mr peter and i saw that miss pole was equally busy i had never seen mrs jamieson so roused and animated before her face looked full of interest in what mr peter was saying i drew near to listen my relief was great when i caught that his words were not words of love but that for all his grave face he was at his old tricks he was telling her of his travels in india and describing the wonderful height of the himalaya mountains one touch after another added to their size and each exceeded the former in absurdity but mrs jamieson really enjoyed all in perfect good faith i suppose she required strong stimulants to excite her to come out of her apathy mr peter wound up his account by saying that of course at that altitude there were none of the animals to be found that existed in the lower regions the gameeverything was different firing one day at some flying creature he was very much dismayed when it fell to find that he had shot a cherubim mr peter caught my eye at this moment and gave me such a funny twinkle that i felt sure he had no thoughts of mrs jamieson as a wife from that time she looked uncomfortably amazed but mr peter shooting a cherubimdont you thinki am afraid that was sacrilege illustration he had shot a cherubim mr peter composed his countenance in a moment and appeared shocked at the idea which as he said truly enough was now presented to him for the first time but then mrs jamieson must remember that he had been living for a long time among savagesall of whom were heathenssome of them he was afraid were downright dissenters then seeing miss matty draw near he hastily changed the conversation and after a little while turning to me he said dont be shocked prim little mary at all my wonderful stories i consider mrs jamieson fair game and besides i am bent on propitiating her and the first step towards it is keeping her well awake i bribed her here by asking her to let me have her name as patroness for my poor conjuror this evening and i dont want to give her time enough to get up her rancour against the hogginses who are just coming in i want everybody to be friends for it harasses matty so much to hear of these quarrels i shall go at it again by and by so you need not look shocked i intend to enter the assembly room tonight with mrs jamieson on one side and my lady mrs hoggins on the other you see if i dont somehow or another he did and fairly got them into conversation together major and mrs gordon helped at the good work with their perfect ignorance of any existing coolness between any of the inhabitants of cranford ever since that day there has been the old friendly sociability in cranford society which i am thankful for because of my dear miss mattys love of peace and kindliness we all love miss matty and i somehow think we are all of us better when she is near us illustration mrs jamieson on one side and my lady mrs hoggins on

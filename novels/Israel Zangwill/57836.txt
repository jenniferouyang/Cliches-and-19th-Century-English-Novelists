london william heinemann epistle dedicatory dear mistress of bassetts you and audrey have so often proclaimed the needin our world of sorrow and careof a bland novel defining it as one to be read when in bed with a sore throat that as an adventurer in letters i have frequently felt tempted to write one for you but the spirit bloweth where it listeth and seemed perversely to have turned against novels altogether perhaps because i had been labelled novelist as though one had set up a factory two a year is i believe the correct output however here is a novel at lastmy first this centuryand there is a further reason for presuming to associate you with it because it is largely from the vantagepoint of your essex homestead that i have during the past twenty years absorbed the landscape character and dialect which finally insisted on finding expression first in a little play and now in this elaborate canvas how often have i passed over high field and seen the opulent valleytilth and pasture and ancient country seatsstretching before me like a great poem with its glint of winding water and the exquisite blue of its distances and bassetts awaiting me below snuggling under its mellow mossstained tiles a true english home of plain living and high thinking and latterly of the rural muse i can only hope that some breath of the inspiration which has emanated from bassetts in these latter days and which has set its picturesquely clad poetesses turning rhymes as enthusiastically as clods and weaving rondels as happily as they bound the sheaves has been wafted over these more prosaic pagessomething of that woodmagic which your granddaughtersoul of the idyllic bandhas got into her song of your surroundings the glint of blue where the estuary flows or a shimmering mist oer the vales green and gold a little grey church which mid willowtrees shows a house on the hillside so good to behold with its yellow plaster and red tiles old the clematis climbing in purple and green and down in the garden mid hollyhocks bold sit kathleen ursula helen and jean and yet it must not be thought that either bassetts or little baddow figures in the little bradmarsh of my story the artist cannot be tied down he creates a composite landscape to his needs moreover in these last four or five years a zealous constabulary can testify out of what odds and ends the strange inquiring figure who walked cycled or rode in carriers carts to forgotten hamlets or seamarshes has composed his background nor have i followed photographic realism even in my dialect deeming the cockneyish forms except when unconsciously amusing too ugly to the eye in a long sustained narrative though enjoyable enough in those humorous sketches which my friend bensusan the true conquistador of essex pours forth so amazingly from his inexhaustible cornucopia i differin all diffidencefrom his transcription on the sole point that the essex rustic changes i into oi in words like while though why on the other hand boil should go back to bile can be explained only by the perversity which insists on taking aspirates off the right words and clapping them on the wrong much as cockney youths and girls exchange hats on bank holiday i have limited my own employment of this local vowelling mainly to the first person singular as sufficiently indicative of the rest in the old vexed question of the use of dialect my feeling is that its value is simply as colour and that the rich old words obsolete or unknown elsewhere contribute this more effectively and far more beautifully than vagaries of pronunciation itself a very shifting factor of language even in the best circles it is not even necessary for the artistic effect that the reader should understand the provincial words though the context should be so contrived as to make them fairly intelligible in short art is never nature though it should conceal the fact even the slowness and minuteness of my methodimposed as it is by the attempt to seize the essence of essexare immeasurable velocity and breadth compared with the scale of reality in bringing this rustic complex under the category of comedy i clash i am aware with literary fashion which demands that country folk should appear like toiling insects caught in the landscape as in a giant web of fate though why the inhabitants of belgravia or clapham escape this tragic convention i cannot understand but i do not think that you dear aunt by adoption see the life around you like that even however had you and i seen more gloomily the fashionable fatalistic framework would have been clearly inconsistent with the blandness of your novel such a novel must i conceive begin with once upon a time and end with they all lived happy ever after so that my task was simply to fill in the lacuna between these two points and supply the earlyvictorian mottoes while even the material was marked out for me by dr johnsons definition of a novel as a story mainly about love i am hopeful that when you come to read it not i trust with a sore throat you will admit that i have at least tried to make my dear jinny really live happy ever after even thoughin the fierce struggle for literary survivalshe is far from likely to do so but at any rate if only for the moment i should be glad if i had succeeded in expressing through her my grateful appreciation of the beautiful country in which my lot like jinnys has been cast with its many lovable customs and simple kindly people your affectionate nephew the author sussex new year contents chap page preamble i

more than once it was in fact every tuesday and fridayjinny the carrier of blackwater hall little bradmarsh went the round with her tiltcart from that torpid essex village on the brad through long bradmarsh over the brick bridge to worldly bustling chipstone and thence home again through the series of droughty hamlets with public pumps that curved backif one did not take the wrong turning at the four wantz wayto her too aqueous birthplace baiting her horse methusalem at the black sheep in chipstone like the other carters and wagoners sporting a dog with a wicked eye and a smart collar and even blowing a horn as if she had been the redcoated guard of the chelmsford coach sweeping grandly to his goal down the high street of chipstone do you question more precisely when this brazen female flourished the answer may be given with the empty exactitude of science and scholarship her climacteric was to the globe at large the annus mirabilis of the great exhibition when the lion and the lamb lay down together in hyde park in a crystal cage but though the advent of the worldtrumpeted millennium could not wholly fail to percolate even to little bradmarsh a more veracious chronology a history truer to local tradition would date the climax of jinnys unmaidenly career as before the flood not of courseas the mention of methusalem might mislead you into thinkingthe flood which is still commemorated in toyshops and babylonian tablets and anent which german scholars miraculously contrive to be dry but the more momentous local deluge when the brad perversely swollen washed away cattle mangold clamps and the holy sabbath in one fell surge leaving the odd wooden gable of frog farm looming above the waste of waters as nautically as noahs ark in those antediluvian days and in that sequestered hundred farmhorses were the ruling fauna and set the pace the average of which methusalem with his jub or cross between a lazy trot and a funeral procession did little to elevate it was not till the pride of life brought a giddier motion that the floodbut we anticipate both moral and story let us go rather at the arcadian amble of the days before the deluge when the bicycleeven of the early giant orderhad not yet arisen to terrorize the countryside with its rotiferous mobility still less the motormammoth swirling through the leafy lanes in a dustfog and smelling like a superskunk or the airmonster outsoaring and outsataning the broomsticked witch it is true that bundock her majestys postman had once brought word of a bigbellied creature like a bloated easteregg hovering over the old maypole as if meditating to impale itself thereon like a bladder on a stick but normally not even the mail or a postchaise divided the road with master bundock while as for the snorting steamhorse that bore off the young bradmarshians once they had ventured as far as roaring railhead it touched the postmans imagination no more than the thousandton seamonsters with flapping membranes or cloudspitting gullets that rapt them to the lands of barbarism and gold blessd bundock genial mercury of those days before the flood if the rubbered wheel of the postdiluvian age might have better winged thy feet yet thy susceptible eyethat rested allembracingly on female gleanerswas never darkened by the sight of the soulless steel reaper cropping close like a giant goose and thou wast equally spared that mechanic flailofallwork that drones through the dogdays like a brobdingnagian bumblebee for thine happier ear the cottages yet hummed with the last faint strains of the folksong unknown in thy sylvan perambulations that queer metallic parrot hoarser even than the raucous reality which now wakens and disenchants every sleepy hollow with echoes of the london musichall rural essex was long the unchanging east and there are still ploughmen who watch the airmen thunder by then plunge into their prog again the shepherds who pour their fleecy streams between its hedgerows are still as primitive as the herdsmen of chaldea and there are yokels who dangle sideways from their slow beasts as broodingly as the bedouins of palestine even today the spacious elmbordered landscapes through which jinnys cart rolled and her dog circumambiently darted lie ignored of the picture postcard and on the red spinal chimneyshaft of frog farm the doves settle with no air of perching for their photographs little bradmarsh is still little still the most reclusive village of all that delectable champaign the brad still glides between its willows unruffled by picnic parties and soothed rather than disturbed by rusty ancient barges but when granfer quarles first brought little jinny to these plashy bottoms the region it waterednot always with discretionwas unknown even to the gipsy caravans and strolling showmen and quite outside the circuit of the patterers and chaunters who stumped the country singing or declaiming lampoons on the early victoria not a days hard tramp from seven dials where they bought their ribald broadsheets yet as remote as arabia felix chapter i bundock on his beat he comes the herald of a noisy world with spattered boots cowper the task i it had rained that april more continuously than capriciously but this morning april showed at last her fairer face the sunshine held as yet no sense of heat only the bracingness of a glad salt wave across the spacious blue of the essex sky clouds floated and met and parted in a restful restlessness the great valley swam in a blue sea of vapour men trod as on buoyant sunshine that bore them along the buds were peeping out from every hedge and tree the blackthorn was bursting into white the whole world seemed like a child tiptoeing towards some delightful future primroses nestled in every hollow the gorse lay golden on the commons the little leaves of the trees seemed shy scarcely grown familiar with the fluttering of the birds all the misery pain and sadness had faded from creation like a bad dream the stains and pollutions were washed out leaving only the young clean beauty of the first day it was a virgin planet fresh from the hands of its maker trembling with morning dewan earth that had never seen its own blossoming and the pan of all this peace and innocence throbbed exultingly in birdmusic through all the great landscape over the orchard of frog farm there were only two larks but you would have thought a whole orchestra a blot against this background seemed the bloodred shirt of caleb flynt in that same orchard a wild undulating piece of primeval woodland where plumtrees and peartrees indeed flourished but not more so than oaks and chestnuts briars and brambles or fairy mists of bluebells the task of regenerating it had been annually postponed but now that caleb was no longer the frog farm looker it formed like his vegetable garden his wheat patch or his wifes piggery a pleasant potteringground he worked without coat or smock chastening the ranker grass while the dew was still on itor in his own idiom while the dag was on the herb whitebearded and scythebearing he suggestedalthough the beard was short and round and he wore a shapeless grey hata figure of father time incarnadined from all his wars but in sooth no creature breathed more at one with the earths mood that morning than this ancient peculiar whose parlour bore as its text of honourin white letters on a lozenge of brown paper when he giveth quietness who then can make trouble quietness was indeed all around him in this morning freshness the swish of the scythe the murmurous lapse of shorn grass the drone of insects the cooing of pigeons from the cote the elusive cry of the newcome cuckoo seemed forms of silence rather than of sound and his inner peace matched his outer for as his arms automatically wielded the scythe his soul was actually in heavenor at least in the new jerusalem which according to his wifes novel christadelphian creed was to be let down from heaven for the virtuous remnant of earthand at no distant date not that he definitely believed in her descending city though he felt a certain proprietary interest in it oi dont belong to marthas church he reassured his brethren of the peculiar faith but oi belongs to she and she belongs to me in this mutual belonging he felt himself the brake and martha the spirited mare who could never stand still no doubt her argument that we were here to learn and to move forward was plausible enoughhow could he traverse it he who had himself changed from churchman to peculiar but her rider we dont leave the doctrine we carry it with us struck him as somewhat shifty and her move from sprinkling to total immersioneven if the submergence did in a sense include the sprinklingwas surely enough progression for one lifetime he did not like this gospel of gooin forrard an obstinate instinct warned him to hold back though with an uneasy recognition that her ceaseless explorations of her capacious bibleto him a sealed bookmust naturally yield discoveries denied to his less saintly and altogether illiterate self discoveries indeed had not been spared him ever since she had joined those newfangled christadelphianschristy dolphins as he called themshe had abounded in texts as crushing as they were unfamiliar and even the glib biblical patter he had picked up from the peculiars was shown to imply at bottom the new teaching curtain lectures are none the less tedious when they are theological and after a course of many monthseach with its twentyeight to thirtyone nightscaleb flynt was grown wearisomely learned in the bold doctrine launched by the great john thomas that the kingdom of god on earth actually meant on earth and must be brought about there and nowhere else and that immortality enjoyed except in ones terrestrial bodyhowever spiritualizedwas as absurd a notion as that it was lavished indiscriminately upon tom giles and jerry the worst of it was he could never be sure martha was not in the rightshe had certainly modified his belief in sprinklingand he fluttered around her new jerusalem like a moth around a lighthouse had anybody given a penny for his thoughts as he stooped now over his scythe the fortunate investor would have come into possession of the street of pure gold as it were transparent glass not to mention the sapphires and emeralds the beryls and chrysolites and all the other shining swarms of precious stones catalogued in revelation if he had kept from her the rumour that had reached his own ears of such a treasurecity of glass actually arising in london at this very moment it was not because he believed this was veritably her celestial city but because it might possibly excite her credulity to the pitch of wishing to see it and the thought of a journey was torture already martha had dropped hints about the difficulties of upbuilding in the lack of local christadelphians to institute a lightstand the wild dream of some day breaking bread in an ecclesia in london had been adumbrated it was possible the restless female mind even contemplated london itself as a place to be seen before one died but surely the new jerusalem if it descended at all wouldhe feltdescend here at little bradmarsh a heaven that meant girding up ones loins and wrenching out ones roots was a very problematic paradise for all the splendour with which his inward eye was now despite himself dazzled ii from this jewelled jerusalem caleb was suddenly brought back to the breathing beauty of our imperfect earth to pearblossom and plumblossom to the sunglinted shadows under his trees and the mellow tiles of his roof the sound of his own name fell from on highlike the city of his daydreamaccompanied by a great skirring of wings and looking up dazedly the pearly gates still shimmering his eye followed the tarred sidewall of the farmhouse till near the roof it lit upon his wifes nightcapped head protruded from the tiny diamondpaned casement that alone broke the sheer black surface of the wood a sense of the unusual quickened his pulses it stole upon him not mainly from marthas face which despite its excited distension woreover wrinkles he never sawthe same russet complexion and was crowned by the same glory of unblanched brown hair that had gladdened his faithful eyes since the beginning of the century but more subtly and subconsciously through the open lattice which framed this everenchanting vision in the flynt tradition windowsrestricted at best by the window tax still in forcewere for light not air had folks wanted air they would have poked a hole in the wall not built a section of it of transparent glass people so much under the sky as caleb and martha flynt had no need to invite colds by artificial draughts they were getting a change of air all day long but their roomstheir small lowceiled roomswere not thus vivified even in their absence the groundfloor windows were indeed immovable and an immemorial mustiness made a sort of slum atmosphere in this spacious sunwashed solitude hence calebs sense of a jar in his universe at the familiar flat pattern of the wall dislocated into a third dimension by the outflung casement a prodigy which he was not surprised to find fluttering the dovecot and which presaged he felt still vaster cataclysms and to add to the auspices of change he observed another piebald pigeon among his snowy flock yes dear heart he called up disguising his uneasiness and shearing on martha pointed a fateful finger towards the highhedged oozy path meandering beyond the orchard gate and dividing the sown land from the pastures sloping to the brad theres bundock coming up the green lane bundock gasped caleb the scythe stopping short youre adreamin that brother bundock who had been prayed over for a decade by himself and every peculiar in the vicinity should at last have taken up his bed and walked was too sudden a proof of their tenets and the natural man blurted out his disbelief but i see his red jacket martha protested his bag on his shoulder ow his tone was divided between relief and disappointment you mean bundocks buoyoy he drew out the word even longer than usual and it rose even beyond the high pitch his essex twang habitually gave to his culminating phrases whatever can posty be doin in these paarts he went on with a new wonder and the chace that squashy said martha who from her coign of vantage could see the elderly figure labouring in the remoter windings hes sinking into it at every step ay the muds only hazeled over whatever brings the silly youth when the roads be in that state itll be the census again groaned martha calebs brow gloomed he feared martha was right and anything official must have to do with that terrible paperfilling which had at last by the aid of jinny been they had hoped finally accomplished some weeks before ever since the first english census had been taken in the first year of the century martha had been expecting a plague to fall upon the people as it had upon the israelites when king david numbered them but although she had been disappointed there was no doubt of the plague of the census itself haps its a letter for the shepherd hazarded caleb to comfort her whod be writing master peartree a letter he cant read noa he answered complacently for his wifes learning seemed part of their mutual belonging the drawbacks of this vicarious erudition were however revealed by his next remark for on martha crying out that poor bundock had sunk up to his knees caleb bade her be easy he wont be swallowed up like that minx cora but marthas motherly heart was too agitated to recognize the korah of her biblical allusionsshe vaguely assumed it was some scarlet woman englutted in the slimy saltings of calebs birthplace run and lead him into the right path she exhorted but calebs brain was not one for quick reactions inured for nigh seventy years to a world in which nothing happened too suddenly even thunderbolts giving reasonable notice and bogs getting boggier by due degrees he stood dazedly his hands paralysed on the nibs of his arrested scythe happen the logs oi put have sunk down he soliloquized slowly if i wasnt in my nightgown id go myself said martha impatiently tis a lesson from the lord not to lay abed the lord allows for rheumaties dear heart said caleb soothingly hell be up to his neck if you dont stir your stumps not he martha unless he stands on his head caleb meant this as a literal contribution to the discussion there was no wilful topsyturveydom he was as unconscious of his own humour as of other peoples but hell spoil his breeches anyways retorted martha with equal gravity and the lord just sending his wife a new baby bundocks breeches be the queens said caleb reassuringly but laying down his scythe he began to move mazedly adown the orchard and before the postmans mudcased leggings had floundered many more rods the veteran was sitting astride his stile dangling his topboots over a rottenplanked brook and waving in his hairy mahogany hand his vast red handkerchief like a danger signal ahoy posty bundock responded with a cheerful blast on his bugle ahoy uncle flynt turn back dont yell strike a boghole i never go back cried the dauntless bundock and even as he spoke his stature shrank till his bag rested on the ooze the missus was afeared youd spoil the queens breeches said caleb sympathetically catch hold of yon crabapple branch better spoil her breeches than be unfaithful to her uniform said the slimy hero struggling up as directed ive got a letter for you calebs flag fell into the brook and startled a waterrat a letter for us he splashed into the water still dazedly to rescue his handkerchief avoiding the plank as a superfluous preliminary to the wetting and standing statuesque in midstream more like father neptune now than father time he continued incredulously whod be sendin us a letter thats not my business cried bundock sternly he came on heroically disregarding a posterior consciousness of damp clay and picking his way along the grassy squashy strip that was starred treacherously with peaceful daisies and buttercups overhung by wild appletrees and hedged from the fields on either hand by a tall prickly tangle and congestionas of a vegetable slumin which gorse holly speedwell mustard and lily of the valley still in green sheaths strove for breathing space at the edge of a palpable mudhole he paused perforce caleb who when he recovered from his daze at the news of the letter had advanced with dripping boots to meet him was equally arrested at the opposite frontier and the two men now faced each other across some fifteen feet of flowery ooze two studies in red caleb biglimbed and stolid in his crimson shirt and bundock dapper and peart in his scarlet jacket the postmans face was lightly pockmarked but found by females fascinating especially under the quasimilitary cap hairlessness was part of its open charm his suntanned cheek kept him juvenile despite his halfcentury and preserved from rust his consciousness of a worshipping womanhood caleb on the contrary was all hair little bushes growing even out of his ears and whiskers and beard and the silvergrey mop at his crown running into one another without frontiersthe nonconformist fringe in a ragged edition sow sorry to give ye sow much illconvenience he called apologetically oi count he added having had time for reflection one of our buoyoys has written from furrin parts and he wouldnt be knowing the weather here taint any of your boys said bundock crossly because it comes from london thats a pity the missusll get sterical when she hears its for us and its cruel hard to disappoint her there aint nobody else as we want letters from cant you send it back not if i can deliver it said bundock stiffly but ye cantunless you chuck it over the slave of duty shook his head i darent risk the queens mail like that but its my letter not yet uncle flynt when it reaches your hand it may be considered safely legally and constitutionally delivered but till then tis the queens letter and dont you forget it caleb scratched his head if twas the queens letter she could read it he urged obstinately and so she can rejoined bundock she has the right to open any letter smelling of high treason so to speak and nobody can say her nay but my letter aint high treasony said caleb indignantly and if wictoria wants to read it why god bless her says oi bundock sighed before the bovinity of the illiterate mind the queen has got better things to do than read every scribble her heads stuck on to happen oi could ha retched it with a rake caleb mused what a pity you aint got spladges like when oi was a buoyoy and gatherin pinpatches on the sands and fine and fat they was too when ye got em on the pin his tongue clucked bundock looked his contempt a pretty sight her majestys uniform lumbering along like a winklepicker bide a bit then said caleb and oill thrash through the hedge and work through agen in your rear it was a chivalrous offer for a deep ditch barred the way to the freshly ploughed land and a tough and prickly chaos to the pasture land but bundock declined churlishly if not unheroically declaring there was a letter for frog cottage too and when caleb recovering from this vindication of his wifes prophesyings offered to transmit it to the shepherd what guarantee have i asked bundock that it reaches him safely legally and constitutionally nay nay uncle a man must do his own jobs then work through the bushes yourself dont yell be fit to grow crops on lord how i hate going roundcircumbendibus groaned bundock i might as well be driving a postcart theres a mort of worser things than gooin round said caleb and oi do be marvelling a young chap like you should mind a bit of extra legwork bein as how yeve got naught else to do but to put one leg afore the tother indeed snapped bundock this ignorant summary of his duties aggravating the moist clayey consciousness that resided at the seat of her majestys trousers ef ye wont keep to the high roads you ought to git a hoss what can clear everything caleb went on to advise and break my neck posty always had a hoss when i was a cad or lay in the road with a broken back and her majestys mail at the mercy of every tramp pursued bundock no no one cripple in a family is enough caleb looked pained you dednt ought to talk o your feyther like that and him pinchin hisself and maybe injurin his spinal collar to keep you at school till you was a large buoyoy iii bundocks irritation at his botian critic was suddenly diverted by the spectacle of a female figure bearing down upon him literally by leaps and boundsit seemed as if the steeplechase method recommended by caleb was already in action the postman felt for his spectacles discarded normally in the interests of manly fascination lord he cried has your missus joined the jumpers caleb turned his head not unalarmed with so skittish a theologian anything was possible but his agitation subsided into a smile of admiration she thinks of everything he said the practical martha was in fact advancing with an improvised leapingpole that had already carried her neatly over the brook and would obviously bring bundock over the boglet but whycaleb wonderedwas she risking her bettermost skirt his own mother he remembered had not hesitated to tuck up her petticoats when winkles had to be gathered and why was marthas hair massed in its black net cap with a sunday stylishness morning mrs flynt cried bundock becoming as genial as the weather females even sexagenarian so long as not utterly uncomely turned him from an official into a man morning mr bundock martha called back across the mudhole i hope your fathers no worse bundocks brow clouded still harping on his father hes not so active as you he replied a bit testily thank the lord said caleb fervently then colouring under bundocks stare for the missuss legs he explained and to cover his confusion he snatched the pole from her and hurled it towards bundock who had barely time to jump aside into a still squidgier patch but in another instant the dauntless postman secured it and with one brave boundlike sir walter scotts staghad cleared the slimiest section and his staggering sliding form was safely locked in calebs sanguineous shirtsleeves safely but not contentedly for at heart he was deeply piqued at this inglorious position of her majestys envoy the dignified newsbearer the beguiler of loneliness the gossip welcomed alike in the kitchens of the great and the parlours of the humble morbidly conscious of his unpresentable rear he kept carefully behind the couple while caleb explained the situation to martha breaking and blunting the news at one hammerblow theres a letter for us from lunnon martha was wonderful what a piece what a master he thought one might live with a woman for half a century yet never fathom her depths not a gasp not a cry not a sigh of vain yearning merely then itll be from cousin caroline when she went back to london at michaelmas she promised to let us know if she reached home safe and if your brother george was better ay ay he assented happily oid disremembered cousin caroline it was a merciful oblivion for his cockney cousin had come from limehouse in august and stayed two months protesting that it was impossible to bide a day in a place where there wasnt a neighbour to speak to except a silly shepherd who was never at home where water was scooped filthily from a greenscummy pond instead of flowing naturally from a tap where on moonless nights you could break your leg at your own doorstep where frogs croaked and cocks crowed and pigeons moaned and foxes barked at the unholiest hours where disgusting vermin were nailed on the trees and where you broke out in itching blotches which folks might ascribe to harvesters but which were susceptible of a more domestic explanation moreover cousin caroline had brought a profuse and uninvited progeny whose unexpected appearance in jinnys cart though vaguely comforting as recalling the days when the house resounded with childlife was in truth at disturbing discord with the quakerish calm into which frog farm had subsided after the flight of its teeming chicks as caleb came along now convoying bundock through the lush orchard grass the echo of cousin carolines querulous voice rasped his brain and made him wish she had pretermitted her promise to write as for his ailing brother george information about whom she was probably sending it was obvious that he was no worse else one would assuredly have heard of his funeral had not george carefully let him know when he got married caroline was a churchwomanhe remembered suddenlyshe had compromised frog farm by eking out parson fallows miserable congregation and now she had sent her letter just at a season to plague and muddy a worthy dissenter sow sorry to give ye sow much illconvenience mr bundock he repeated as they reached the farmhouse iv frog farm before which bundock stood fumbling in his bag wasas its name impliessituated in a batrachian region croakily cheerless under a sullen sky a region revealed under the plough as ancient sedgeland black with rotted flags and rushes but the scene was redeemed at its worst by the misty magnificence of great spaces whose gentle undulations could not counteract a sublime flatness not to mention the beauty of the brad gliding like the snake in the grass it sometimes proved the pasture land behind the farmhouse and sloping softly down to the riveracross which protected by a dyke and drained by little black mills working turbine wheels lay the still lower long bradmarshwas the salvage of a swamp roughly provided with a few farparted drains by some pioneer squatter contenton the higher ground where a farmhouse was possibleto fell and slice his own timber and bake his own tiles at the topmost rim on a road artificially raised to take its wagons to the higher ground or ridge of the village rose this farmhouse with its buildings all dyked off from the converted marsh by a threefoot wall of trunkfragments and uncouth stones bordered by bushes the house turned its back on the brad and had not even hind eyes to see itanother effect of the window taxand had the rear of the house not been relieved by the quaint red chimney bisecting it the blankness would have been unbearable but if little of good could have been said of its architecture behind its back and if even in front it ended abruptly at one extremity like a sheer cliff or a halved haystack with one gable crying for another to make both ends meet it was as a whole picturesque enough with all that charm of rough wood which still seems to keep its lifesap and beside which your marble hall is a mere petrifaction weatherboarded and tarred it faced you with a black beauty of its own amid which its diamondpaned little lattices gleamed like an ethiopians eyes in the foreground haystacks cornricks and strawstacks gave grace and colour fusing with the spacious landscape as naturally as the barns and byres and storehouses the troughs and stables and cartsheds and the mellow immemorial dung but what surprised the stranger more than its lopsidedness was the duplication of its front door for there were two little doors with twin sills and latches it had in fact been partitioned to allow a couple of rooms to the shepherdcowman when that lone widowers cottage was needed for an extra horseman master peartrees new home became known as frog cottage the property was what was here called an offhand farm the owner being in parts or engaged in other enterprises and for more than a generation caleb flynt had lived there as looker to old farmer gale the cute cornish invader who had discovered the fatness of the oozy soil and who had been glad to install a son of it as a reconciling link between little bradmarsh and the furriner caleb belonged to that almost extinct species of managers who can dispense with reading and writing and his semiabsentee employer found his honesty as meticulous as his memory while the flynt nestlings were growing up the parent birds had found the nest a tight fit but with the gradual flight of the brood to every quarter of the compass the old pair had receded into its snugger recessesliving mainly by the kitchen fire under the hanging hams thus when last year farmer gales son succeeding to the property and foolishly desiring a more scientific and literate bailiff delicately intimated that having bought all the adjoining land he had been compelled to acquire therewith the rival looker the old flynts were glad enough to be allowed for a small rent the lifeuse of the farmhouse and the bits of waste land around it subject to their providing living room for old master peartree who was to pasture his flock of sheep and a few kine in the near meadows martha indeed always maintained that caleb had made a bad bargain with the new masterdid not the whole neighbourhood pronounce the young widower a skinflintbut caleb who had magisterially negotiated with the new bailiff the swapping of his woodashes for straw for her pet pig maria limited his discussions with her to theology when one talks law and high business he maintained we must goo back to the days afore eve was dug out of adam v bundock restored to his superiority by the deprecatory expectancy of the old couple observed graciously that there was no need to apologize anybody was liable to have a letter indeed he added generously with nine boys dotted about the world frog farm might have been far more troublesome eleven mr bundock corrected martha with a quiver in her voice i dont reckon the dead and buried mrs flynt they dont writenot even to the deadletter office he cut short a chuckle remembering this was no laughing matter and the other nine might as well be dead for all the letters you bring me martha retorted bitterly no news is good news dear heart caleb put in as though to shield the postman he was not so sure now that this unfortunate letter had not disturbed her slowly won resignation weve always yeared of anything unpleasantlike when daniel married the kaffir lady that was christopher said martha ow ay christopher tis a wonder he could take to a thicklipped lady oi couldnt fancy a blackskinned woman even if she was the queen of sheba oi shook hands with one once though and it felt soft they rub theirselves with oil to keep theirselves lithe martha replied only with a sigh the kaffir lady for all her coloured and heathen horror at least supplied a nucleus for visualization whereas all her other stalwart sons together with one married daughter had vanished into the four corners of the empirebuilding it up with an unconsciousness mightier than the swordand only the children who had died youngtwo girls and a boyremained securely hers fixed against the flux of life and adventure occasionally indeed an indirect rumour of her live sons doings came to her but correspondence was not the habit of those days when even amid the wealthier classes a boy might go out to india and his safe arrival remain unknown for a semestrium or more the foreign postage too was no inconsiderable check to the literary impulse or encouragement to the lazy indeed postage stamps were still confined to half a dozen countries it was but a decade since they had come in at all and letters with envelopes or an extra sheet had ceased to be double postcards were still unknown and in many parts postmen came as infrequently as carriers people often hastening to scrawl replies which the same men might convey to the mailbags kaffirs aint black corrected bundock theyre coffeecoloured thats what the name means martha sighed again so far had her brooding fantasy gone that she sometimes pictured baby grandchildren as innocently dusky as the hybrid young fantails which no solicitude could keep out of her dovecot and which were a reminder that heaven knew no colourboundaries dont be nervous bundock reassured her ill find it oh no hurry no hurry said caleb beginning to perspire distressingly under the postmans exertions and to mop his hairy brow with his brooksopped handkerchief how these youngsters grew up he was thinking brats one had seen spanked waxed into mighty officers of state shall i brush your breeches posty he inquired tactlessly whats the use till theyre dry snapped bundock come in and dry them before the kitchen fire said martha this sunll dry them he said coldly not so slick as the fire caleb blundered on taint like you was a serpent walking on your belly bundock flushed angrily and rightwheeled to hide the seat of his trousers why you should go and catch your letter when the roads are in that state he muttered you could ha waited till they dried caleb said deprecatingly i did wait a postday or so said bundock with undiminished resentment but theres such a thing uncle as duty to my queen things might have got damper instead of drier like the time the floods were out beyond long bradmarsh and i might have had to swim out to you caleb was impressed but can you swim he inquired thats not the point growled bundock i dont say id ha faced the elements for you but if somebody with real traffic and entanglement were living here eg the duke of wellington i should have come through fire and water the dook at a farm caleb smiled incredulously in the battle of waterloo said bundock icily the whole fight was whether he or boney should hold a farm you dont say cried caleb excitedly and who got it well it wasnt froggys farm and bundock roared with glee and renewed selfrespect caleb guffawed too but merely for elation at the frenchys defeat the calm and piping voice of martha broke in upon this robustious duet pointing out that there was no duke in residence and no need for natation but that since jinny called for orders every friday he might have given her the letter give the queens mail to a girl bundock looked apoplectic jinny never loses anything said martha unimpressed shell lose her character if she aint careful he said viciously driving of a sunday with farmer gale thats onny to chapel said caleb a man that richll never take her there sneered bundock why jinnys only a child said martha roused at last and the best girl breathing look how she slaves for her grandfather jinny jinny bundock muttered nothing but jinny all the day and all the way how often indeed had she snatched the gossip from his mouth staled his earthshaking tidings even as the bellman anticipated his jokes let me catch her carrying letters thats all ill have the law on her child or no child i expect she blows that horn to make the old folks think shes got postal rights he did not mention that in his vendetta against the girl it was he who never hesitated to poach on the rival preserves and that he was even now carrying a certain packet of tracts which he had found at the black sheep awaiting jinnys day and which he had bagged on the ground that he had a letter for the same address jinny would have saved your legs said martha dryly caleb turned on her ay and his leggings too he burst forth with savage sarcasm but at great moments deep calls to deep women dont understand a mans duty and postys every inch a man bundock tried to look his full manhood fortunately the discovery of the letter at this instant enabled him to gain an inch or two by throwing back his shoulders so long bent under the royal yoke mrs flynt he announced majestically for me gasped martha for you said bundock implacably mrs flynt frog farm swash end little bradmarsh near chipstone essex not that i hold its proper to write to a mans wife while hes alivebut my feelings dont count and he tendered her the letter it does seem more becoming for flynt to have his cousin carolines letter admitted martha shrinking back meekly bundock relaxed in beams im wonderfully pleased with you mrs flynt he said handing caleb the letter youre a shining example for all you stand up for that chit when i think of deacon mawhoods wife and how she defies him with that bonnet of hers what sort of bonnet said martha pricking up her ears you havent heard bundocks satisfaction increased its like the queensdrat her i mean drat mrs mawhoodmade with that new plaitbrilliants the name they turn the border of one edge of the straw inwards and that makes it all splendiferous pomps and wanities groaned caleb and she a deacons wife bundock sniggered his sympathy with the husband was deeper and older than theology i told you martha reminded caleb what would come of electing a ratcatcher a deacon a righteous ratcatcher maintained caleb sturdily be higher than a hungodly emperor you havent got any emperors said the practical martha and how many kings have joined your ecclesia put in bundock all the kings of righteousness answered martha in trumpettones bundock was quelled well i cant stop gammicking he said shouldering his bag wont you have a glass of pagles wine said martha relapsing to earth no thank you ive got a letter for frog cottage too for master peartree cried martha and all in one morning well if thats not a miracle you and your miracles he said with a tom paine brutality why i saved up yours till another came for swash end and so ive managed to kill his face suddenly changed the brutal look turned beatific but his sentence was frozen the good couple regarded him dubiously whats amiss cried martha bundock gasped for expression like a salmon on a slab to kill burst from his lips again but the rest was choked in a spasm of cachinnation youll kill yourself laughin said caleb bundock mastered himself with a mighty effort so as to killha ha hato killha ha hatwo frogsha ha hawith one stone martha corrected him coldly two birds you mean ay corroborated caleb the proverb be two birds but here bundock explained between two convulsions its two frogs caleb shook his head oive lived here or by the saltings afore you was born and brought up a mort o childer here two birds sonny two birds bundocks closing chuckles died into ineffable contempt good morning he said firmly youre sure you wont have a sip o pagles wine repeated martha he shook his head sternly if i had time for drinking id have time to tell you all the news he turned on his heel presenting the postbag at them like a symbol of duty anything fresh murmured martha bundock veered round viciously dyou suppose all bradmarsh is as sleepy as the froggeries fresh why theres things as fresh as the thatch on farmer gales barn or the paint on elijah skindles new doghospital or the black band on the chimneysweeps sunday hat is mrs whitefoot dead inquired martha anxiously no twas only his motherinlaw in london and when he went up to the funeral he had his pocket picked quite spoilt his day i reckonha ha ha buryin aint a laughin matter rebuked caleb stolidly it depends whos buried said bundock i shouldnt cry over mrs mawhood which reminds me that the deacon sent out the bellman to say he couldnt be responsible for her debts good cried caleb martha paled but was silent only the bellman spoilt it as usual with his silly old jokes proclaimed that the deacon had put his foot down on his wifes bonnet he he he laughed the old couple bundock turned a hopeless hump good morning and thank you kindly for the letter called martha dont mention it said bundock and besides i killedho ho hotwo frogs they heard his explosions on the quiet air long after he and his royal hump had vanished along the bradmarsh road vi calebs eyes followed the heaving mailbag bundocks buoyoy fares to be jolly this mornin he does be lively sometimes agreed martha suddenly caleb became aware of the letter in his hand dash my buttons martha we disremembered to ask him to read it it can no longer be concealed that despite her erudition martha could not read writing nor write save by imitating print the cursive alphabet was phnician to her i didnt forget she answered with her masterly calm bundocks too leaky you heard him tell all the gossip and scandal and it aint true about jinny for master peartree saw them riding in the other sunday and farmer gales little boy sat between them besides bundocks a man and i dont want a man to read my letter from caroline the point seemed arguable but caleb meekly suggested the little boy she had just mentionedonly a mile and a half away he would be at school martha pointed out caleb looked at the letter as a knifeless cook at an oyster whats the clocktime he asked not quite certain i set the clock by jinny last friday but it stopped suddenly yesterday when i was reading you st pauls epistle to the corinthians havent you heard it not striking caleb shook his head afeared oim gooin deafish dear heart but well know the clocktime on friday he added philosophically and when jinny comes she can read the letter likewise but martha was blushing no no not jinny shes a young girl thank the lord for her lively face agreed caleb maybe she oughtnt to read a letter to a married woman explained martha shyly being a girl without mother or sisters brought up by her grandfather but cousin caroline wouldnt write naught improper of course notbut it mightnt be proper for an orphan girl to read maybe its not even proper for you and thats why she addressed it to me caleb felt as bemused as before a bundock witticism joulterhead said martha with a loving smile and youve had fourteen the letter fell from his nerveless fingers cousin caroline confined again and the clacking of all those innumerable infants filled the airlike the barking of the black geese on the wintry mudflats but he recovered himself why shes a widow not a pair widows can be repaired said martha must have been a middlin bold man to goo courtin a family that size caleb reflected he picked up the letter and poised it in his hand dont feel as weighty as st pauls letters he said the text doesnt mean his letters were heavy explained martha his letters say they are weighty and powerfulthats what i was reading you when the clock stopped any fool can write a heavy letterhes only got to write on a slate thats a true word said caleb admiring her whereas pursued martha the whole bible has been got inside a nutshell lord said caleb i suppose it was a cokernut not at all only a walnut fancy but was there walnuts in the holy land i didnt say twas done in palestine then there wasnt walnuts there his face fell i dont rememberoh yessolomon asked his love to come into the garden of nuts but it dont say walnuts he inquired wistfully i cant say it does then maybe there wont be pickled walnuts in the new jerusalem not all the righteous have your carnal appetite said martha severely you just said solomons sweetheart liked nuts said caleb stoutly and dednt the holy land flow with milk and honey he had a vision of it seamed and riddled like his native mudflat but with lacteal creeks and mellifluous pools you put me out so snapped bundock suddenly reappearing before the engrossed couple that i forgot to kill my two frogs after all and going to the frog cottage doorway he knocked officially before opening it and committing the letter to the empty interior youll be witness that i delivered it constitutionally he said for i cant be expected to come a third time tis a windfall your coming a second cried caleb eagerly bein as we cant read the letter martha made facial contortions to remind him that bundock was barred taint you we want to read it he hurriedly added but when a letter comes all of an onplunge time a mans peacefully trimmin the werges he aint prepared like you havent got a momentdid oid be glad o your counsel on the matter well since ive wasted so much of the queens time said bundock flattered they adjourned to the parlour to give him a rest and denuding himself of both cap and bag of office he occupied oracularly the longunused armchair while caleb uncomfortably perched on a seat of slippery horsehair started to unfold the situation take off your hat broke in martha mr bundock will be thinking youve no manners oill be soon gooin outside again said caleb obstinately and restarted his story do let me explain interrupted martha at last do let me get a word in cried caleb well take off your hat oill be gooin outside soon oi tell ye then you can put it on again oi shall never make bundock sensible ef you keep interruptin me you see mr bundock its this way began martha oive told him all that said caleb let me speak well take off your hat said martha oill be gooin outside agen wont oi bundock was examining the letter which had been laid on the table as for an operation but it dont look like a womans writing he interrupted that would be spidery taint likely she could write herself in that condition began caleb but marthas face again hushed him down theres neither seal nor sticking envelope pursued the expert nothing but a wafer comes from a poor man her new husband said caleb and set martha grimacing again oill be soon gooin outside he protested misunderstanding what you want summed up bundock judicially is a mixture of discretion with matrimony seasoned with a sprinkle of learning he talks like the book said caleb admiringly but where is this mixture inquired martha eagerly she dont exist said bundock but miss gentry is the nearest lady that can read and fate is just sending me with a letter and a packet to her the couple looked doubtful she aint matrimony said caleb no admitted bundock but i guess shes old enough to be though i havent seen her census paperhe he and besides shes a dressmaker whats that to do with it asked caleb i see your missus understands said bundock mysteriously but she wont walk five miles to read my letter urged the blushing martha caleb had one of the great inspirations of his life and aint it time you got a new gownd martha flushed up oh caleb dont let us run to vanity wanity mother it aint tinkling ornaments nor cauls nor nosejewels protested caleb with a vague reminiscence of her biblical readings and yeve had naught since the suckingpig oi bought ye for your sixtieth birthday but martha shook her head quoting firmly let me be dressed fine as i will birds flowers and worms exceed me still then why not a bonnet suggested bundock that would be cheaper than a gown ay a bonnet agreed caleb though he sounded it a boarnt martha flashed a resentful glance which however bundock took for but another thrust at calebs obstinate hat i dont want a new bonnet she cried indignantly it neednt be new said bundock helpfully just have your old bonnet whitened thats on her billpaper bonnets bleached as good as new thats a good notion said caleb you dont want it branspannew postyll tell her to come over here to get your old boarnt and then well spring cousin carolines letter on her for her to read he chuckled bundock chuckled too swelling at the adoption of his advice and now that ive stopped gammicking so long i may as well sample that cowslip wine mrs flynt he observed graciously but martha had vanished vii miss gentry had apartments in one of the most elegant cottages to be found in little bradmarsh protected by palings it stood all alone on the high road painted a vivid green with three pollarded limetrees in front like sentinel mops at the base of the trim little garden the front door rose above two wooden steps with a little porch and ostentated a brass plate with the inscription miss gentry late of colchester practical dressmaker and milliner in proof of which from the cottage window whose green shutters lay folded back a visite or jacket of black silk and a polka jacket and a trio of straw bonnets tuscan or leghorn appealed to the passing eye one of them a bonnet cap with a quilting of net and broad blue strings another resplendent with purple ribbons and the newtreated straw plait that the queen and mrs mawhood favoured and the third of drawn silk on little wires the pictures of the period with a wonderful unanimity and monotony display a single style of bonnet but artists in those days were men and miss gentry could have told you better ive looked down from a pew in the gallery of my colchester church on easter sunday she told jinny once and tried in vain to find two fellowbonnets but her professional door with its immaculate paint and shining brass was so forbiddingly respectable that clients mostly preferred to seek access through her landladys back door where the flutter of washing from the clothesline on its green square poles in the little orchard was reassuring not to mention her chickens practical was the unfailing adjective in those parts miss gentry was not undeserving of it for her dresses were cheap without being vulgar while her knack of whitening the straw enabled the poorest in the succession of new bonnets to keep pace with victoria on the throne a stranger might have thought another species of dressmaker existed whose confections though exquisite would never fit or who designed but could not execute whereas the only other person for miles round at all in the sartorial line was an equally practical breechesmaker placarding from a flowerpotted cottage window his strong stylish pantaloons but the thought of unpractical pantaloonssay without buttons or beltsor of theoretical trousers was simple compared with the image evoked by mr henry whitefoots doorplate proclaiming that victim of the london pickpocket a practical chimneysweep as by contrast with some exquisite dream ethiopian only platonically black darkly revolving flues and fireplaces sweeping shadowchimneys with fleckless brushes and carrying off ideal bags of the soot that never was on sea or land but perhaps in miss gentrys case the word practical was necessary to offset the businessdamage of the tradition that had followed her from her native colchester for miss gentry had had a revelation it had occurred in her girlhood but the halo of it still circled round her chignon seated in church full of worldly thoughtspossibly studying the infinite variety of bonnetsshe had seen the stainedglass angel move what this flutter of wing and lifting of leg revealed had never been clear unlessas a wag maintainedit portended the flight of miss gentry herself that hegira of hers from colchester to bradmarsh had not alas increased her prophetic prestige what right has a furriner to come with revelations even her fellowchurchfolkshe was one of the few bradmarshians that clung to the establishmentlooked askance on the miracle feeling it indeed as reprehensibly papish and as lending colour to the suspicion that she was a french dressmaker a suspicion strengthened at once by her elegant handiwork and by her fullbosomed plenitude swarthy complexion and more than embryonic moustache it was forgotten that if these did imply gallic blood it would have been not the papish but that huguenot strain whose inpour into the county had at one time carried the french liturgy into essex churches as a matter of fact miss gentry was so fanatical a church woman that she supplemented all her bills and receipts by tracts in defence of the establishment purchased at her own expense from a mysterious reservoir in colchester nevertheless such is the contrariety of mankind the large accession she represented to the parish churchwhere on wet sundays only the apostles two or three were gathered togetherwas discounted by her felt queerness and it was still more oddly from the peculiars that she received the bulk of her custom and this despite her toplofty airs towards them and the tracts suggesting that souls no less than bonnets could be bleached as good as new possibly their more elastic spirituality vibrated more readily to the moving angel perhaps the real bond of sympathy was that they knew her unpopular with the church like themselves a butt of legend and lacking even their advantage of bradmarsh birth but even the churchwomen did not utterly deny patronage to this talented needlewoman nor refuse her the deference due to weekday gloves a parasol and bills with printed headlines they did not even discountenance her crusade against dissent though her copious allusions to providence moving in a mysterious way were felt to be too broadly autobiographic moreover in view of the caustic remarks upon cardinals puseyites blackrobed priests and winking pictures by which her tracts began to diversify the attack upon dissentfor john bull was getting alarmed at the new roman invasionit was a source of surprise that she failed to see the beam in her own eye for if virgins could not wink in rimini why should angels wobble in colchester to add to her oddity her brain was full of ancient maggots of astrology and medicine crept in from culpepers herbal her one bedside book that bundock should be bringing a bonnet commission to this excellent and industrious if freakish female was the more laudable inasmuch as he nourished a prejudice against her and her tracts not that he held with catholic or evangelical dissenters any more than with the church proper as a follower of tom paine whose age of reason he read piously in bed every sunday morningthe passage asserting that to make a true miracle jonah should have swallowed the whale was a regular lessonhe regarded himself as a great free spirit in an illiterate and priestridden world one whose god was everywhere except in church not that he could follow the masters excursions into trigonometry or astronomy or knew anything of his idols rights of man being indeed singularly free from the contemporary unrest of the industrial townsman and combining like greater men a crusty conservatism for the old order with a radical rejection of its spinal creed possibly his devotion to the still youthful queen was part of his softness for the sex for the only part of the age of reason that left him unconvinced was its impugnment of the wisdom of solomon its contention that seven hundred wives and three hundred concubines are worse than none but it was not tom paine nor even bob taylors the devils chaplain it was the long years of his fathers paralysis that had first sapped his faith in the pharmacopian aspects of prayer though he considerately concealed his defection from his bedridden parent and even the visiting elders withheld the racking information the old bundock was not however to be deceived on this point at least my son is moral only moral he would say with a sigh to such a temperament miss gentry must needs be antipathetic and to mark his distaste bundock was wont to leave the colchester packets of tracts as well as the practical correspondence at the side door shedding the light of his countenance only on the landlady but on this occasion having a message to deliver as well as a missive and a packet he performed resoundingly on the green knocker and miss gentry herself attended by squibs her ebony cat appeared in the narrow little passage frenziedly stitching at a feminine fabric behind her through the open back door was a gleam of blossoming orchard and dangling chemises good morning bundock she said graciously lovely weather its all right overhead he grumbled but underfoot especially at frog farmwhew you had to go to frog farm she inquired sympathetically yes but there was a letter for frog cottage too so ihe hei killed two frogs with one stone two birds you mean said miss gentry embosoming her letter with a romantic air and laying her packet on a chair she added in alarm would you like a glass of water i dont need drink said bundock mastering the apoplectic assault its other folks that need brains my were the old flynts unusually trying she asked sympathetically they want you to clean the gammers bonnet he answered brusquely thats not so foolish her needle was moving busily again have you brought it no that does seem foolish im not a bonnetbearer they want you to fetch it me five miles to clean a bonnet when im so busy and in all that mud it aint so muddy this side o swash end and its not two miles each way by the fields yes with horrid cows bundock felt protective cows aint bulls well i wont go you tell mrs flynt she must come to me how can i tell her i shant likely be going that way for months thank my stars miss gentry quivered a little at the expression wondering under what planet he was born well ill write to her she said conclusively what and me take the letter in his indignation he almost blurted out that the same difficulty of reading it would arise then ill tell jinny to bring the bonnet bundock felt baffled instead of cunningly helping the flynts to get their letter read he had only secured that minx of a carrier a commission he scowled at the dressmaker seeing her moustache as big as a guardsmans and believing the worst of the legends about it even that the real reason she left colchester was that the bristlybearded oysterman to whom she was engaged had refused to shave unless she did ill be wishing you a good morning he said icily hitching up his bag good morning said miss gentry but she omitted to slam the door in his face as he expected indeed she had gradually advanced into the porch stitching unrelaxingly and bundock now became acutely aware that he could not turn his back on her without revealing the stain on her majestys uniform that even by lowering the mailbag he had just hitched up he could not cover up what certain rude ploughboys had already commented on he understood it was green in this dreadful situation he began backing slowly as from the presence of royalty making desperate conversation to cover his retreat i did give you your tracts didnt i he babbled if you mean the packet said miss gentry in stern rebuke there it lies i havent opened it do you mean that i have he asked indignantly gaining another yard in this rearguard action we dont have to open an oyster to know whats inside miss gentrys brow grew as swarthy as her moustacheat the reminder of her lost oysterman bundock supposed in dismay dont you always send out tracts after i bring you packets he explained hastily still retreating with his face to the foe not when theyre patterns said miss gentry crushingly and how do you know its not the englishwomens magazine she turned back into the passage and he hoped she would slam the door on her triumph but she took up the packet instead we shall soon see and snipping the string with mysteriously produced scissors she read out unctuously ishmael and the wilderness bundock did not know which way to turn why in the name of propriety did she not go back to her workroom and close her door miss gentry without the clue to his lingering attitude observed invitingly tapping the packet if this wont make you see the beauties of the establishment nothing will he grinned uncomfortably always willing to see the beauties of any establishment it was very strange give him a female even with a moustache even tepefied by tracts and something from the deeps rose up to philander not that there wanted a lurid fascination in this exotic and literate lady his very loathing was a tribute to a vivid personality miss gentry however was shocked she put down the tracts she knew herself born under venus but romance and respectability were never disjoined in her daydreams and as the channel of a revelation she felt profaned dont talk like that she said sharply youre a married man tis a married man knows how to appreciate beauty he replied receding farther nevertheless as in ironic commentary for shame her needle stabbed on and you setting up to be holy me surprise brought his strategic retreat to a standstill i never set up to be a stainedglass saint again he had blundered the black eyes flashed fire you who move mountains she cried angrily me move mountains bundock was bewildered a little grain of mustardseed he heard her saying more tremulously and if a sycaminetree could move surely you dont hold with the unbelievers it was precisely whom bundock did hold with but the big black eyes seemed suddenly tearful and appealing her needle seemed entering his breast and she swam before him as a fine voluptuous female through the passage he saw the appletrees in bridal bloom and the white feminine washing and the masters remark on the apparent miracle of the extraction of electric flashes from the human body thrilled in his memory of course not he heard himself saying soothingly while his legs felt going forward losing all the ground so laboriously won then you do believe the angel moved she asked eagerly dont i see her moving he replied miss gentry looked down from her doorstep more in sorrow than in anger youre a married man she reminded him again and does marriage pick out a mans eyeslike a goatsucker he felt too near her now to back out and he put forth his hand for hers not without nervousness at the needle could his father have seen him now he might have thought his son not even moral but miss gentry dexterously met the amorous palm with a tract thatll open your eyes she said to feel a flabby piece of paper instead of a warm hand is not conducive to theological persuasion all bundocks dissenting blood rushed to his head theres two opinions about that he snorted there are two opinions miss gentry assented placidly one wrong and the other mine oh of course he sneered the church is always infallible were eighteen and a half centuries old said miss gentry freezingly did you put that in your census paper retorted the humorist miss gentry winced she was weary of the jokes that had desolated bradmarsh yet she was conscious of having let her landladys estimate of her age go by default i had no paper to fill up she reminded him frigidly but if there was a census of religions youd certainly be among the mushrooms better than being among the mummies bundocks father might have clapped his palsied hands to hear this defender of the faith but miss gentry mistook this fair retort in kind for another allusion to the personal census i thought you could discuss like a gentleman it was a cunning shaft and squibs seizing this moment to rub herself against the postmans leggings he replied more mildly whats the use of going by ageexcept the age of reason then be guided by reason miss gentry stitched implacably if the almighty meant prayer to be medicine why did he create castoroil bundock was dumbfounded or epsom salts she added triumphantly theyre for cattle which cant pray he answered with an inspiration miss gentrys needle stabbed the air but she recovered herself then why do you eat rhubarb pie because its nice he grinned but rhubarbs a medicine he countered cleverly we dont mind taking medicineso long as were well we he was identifying himself with his despised brethren such is human nature under attack but miss gentry was not at the end of her resources well what do you do when you break your legs pray the bones straight but we dont break our legs i never heard of a peculiar breaking his leg but why shouldnt a peculiar break his leg thats not my affair he dont ive got peculiars all over my beat and never have i known one to break a leg a broken heart now but if he did break a leg persisted miss gentry if any one could break a leg it would be me he said crossly well then what would you doif you broke your leg bundock was worn out whats the good of meeting troubles halfway he snapped turning on his heel yours seem to have come more than halfway scoffed miss gentry bundock clapped his hand to the mudpatch stung in his tenderest part he wheeled round prestissimo raging with repartee but the door had closedtoo late solitary the sable squibs dominated the doorsteplike a sardonic spirit bundock was turning away angrily though now fearlessly when with a sudden thought he caught up the cat and plucked out one of her hairs it was not revengeit was merely that his youngest daughter had a sty for which he believed the black hair an infallible remedy chapter ii jinny on her rounds give me simple labouring folk who love their work whose virtue is a song to cheer god along thoreau i thus it was that the days passed without any literate and discreet female descending on frog farm or any rejuvenation appearing in marthas bonnet and the unread letter layguarded by two china dogson the parlour mantelpiece awaiting the carrier for it had been decided after nightly discussions that were a change for caleb from the christadelphian curtainlectures to fall back on jinny after all she was to read it to martha in calebs careful absence and was to be stopped if the improper seemed looming alas the bestlaid schemes of mice and marthas gang agley and by the day that jinnys horn resounded along the raised road that led to the farm the world was changed for caleb and martha there was in factfor the first time in jinnys experienceneither of the twain to meet her as methusalem ambled under the drooping witchelms towards the twin doors it was a tiltcartwith two tall wheels and although jinny steered it and packed it and unpacked it and scoured it and hitched methusalem to it its weatherbeaten canvas blazoned in fading black letters the legend daniel quarles carrier little bradmarsh you gather that she operated under the shadow of a great name greatest as being masculine selfstanding careers for women had not yet dawned on the world if the first faint cloud of feminism had appeared that very year in new york no bigger than a mans pants the bloomerites had but added to the gaiety of mankind and in rural essex with the exception of dressmaking wherein man appeared unnatural women were the recognized practitioners only of witchcraft or fortunetelling or the concoction of philters professions that were the peculiar province of crones scarcely to be considered sexed though women earned money by plaiting straw they had husbands on the premises widows of course for whom there was no provision outside the chipstone poorhouse were allowed to maintain themselves more manfully than spinsters but then they were relicts of the masculine had servedso to speakan apprenticeship under it but the business of plying between chipstone and bradmarsh was a peculiarly male occupation and even the venerable name of daniel quarles would not have sufficed to shield or install jinny had she jumped into his place as abruptly as nip was apt to jump into the cart no rome was not built in a day nor could jinny have become the carrier all of an onplunge as caleb would have put it that would have shocked the manners and morals of bradmarsh both little and long and upset the decorum of chipstone a gradual preparation had been necessary a transition by which jinny changed into the carrier as imperceptibly as she had ripened into the girl at first the small furrinerthe carried and not the carrierreposing in the cart because after smallpox had snatched away both her parents in the same week her grandfather who had imported her had nowhere else to put her playing in the great canvascovered playground that held as many heights depths and obstacles as a steeplechase course petted by every client for her helplessness before her helpfulness gave her a second lease of favour bearing a literally larger and larger hand in granfers transactions as he grew older and older correcting with cautious tact his memories his accounts his muddled bookings and deliveries in due course ousting the octogenarian even from his place on the drivingboard and carrying him first by her side and then inside in his second childhood just as he had carried her in her firsta stage in which his cackle with the customers carried on the continuity of the male tradition leaving him at home on bad dayswhether his own or naturesand then altogether in the winter and then altogether in the spring and then altogether in the autumn and finallywhen he reached his ninetiesaltogether in the summer jinny the carrier wasit will be seena shock so subtly prepared and so long discounted as to have been practically imperceptible she might crack daniels heavy whip but nobody felt the flourish as other than vicarious if not indeed a sort of playacting evoking the pleasure a more sophisticated audience finds in rosalinds swashbucklings not that she made any brazen pretences to equality in lifting boxes she sat with due feminine humility while male muscles swelled and contracted under her presiding smile and the rippling music of her thanks here was in fact the prosaic purpose of the little horn slung at her sideher one apparent embellishment of the tradition it summoned her slavish superiors so that she might be spared alighting and reclimbing with goods in face of the accuracy of her operations this display of helplessness probably helped to remove the sting of an otherwise intolerable feminine sufficiency it was perhaps the secret of her popularity even with the most lilliputian packets nobody expected jinny to descend and knock at their doorsone blast and old and young tumbled over one another to greet the coming or speed the parting parcel it was indeed as if a good fairy should condescend to do your marketing a fairy in a straw bonnet piquantly tied under the chin in a bow with drooping ends a fairy whose brilliant smile and teeth and flowing ringlets could convert even an order for jalap into poetry nay induce in the eternal masculine a craving for more in fine so topsyturvily had this snailpaced transition worked so slowly had jinnys freedom broadened down from precedent to precedent that when strangers expressed disapproval at these mannish courses little bradmarsh was shocked long bradmarsh surprised and chipstone scornful not that they were at all prepared to argue the question in the abstract their prejudice against carrying as a profession for women remained as rooted and unshaken as the critics women who was speaking of women jinny was jinnya being unique and irreplaceable bless her bonny fice it contributed to her unquestionability that the quarleses had been carriers for a hundred yearsand more ii nor did jinny for her part generalize on the other side or take any conscious interest in the emancipation of her sex her horn blew no challenge to the world it did not even occur to her that she was doing anything out of the commonthe tiltcart had been her nursery it was now her place of business she had come into its foreground so unconsciously that it was not as a good fairy that she saw herself nor even as an attractive asset of the quarles concern but as a busy toilerdriven from morning to night rather than drivingand handicapped not only by her household and garden work her goats and poultry but by a nonagenarian grandfather shaky in health and immovable in opinion fortunately for her temperand for the chastening of a tongue only too atingle with rustic witjinny regarded the cantankerous patriarch as no more an object for backtalk than a suckling it had become second nature to soothe and humour him and she knew him as she knew the highways and byways in the dark or the snow where to turn and where to go round where to skirt a swamp and where to shave a ditch by way of compensation there was his affectionas primitive as nips or methusalemsand evoking as primitive a response for jinny was none of your genteel heroines with ethereal emotions and complex aspirations it was not that nature had not cast her for a poetic partshe was small and slender enough and her light grey eyes behind dark lashes sufficiently subtilized her expression and when she was hesitating between two wordsnot two opinions for she always had oneher little mouth would purse itself enchantingly there was gentility too about her toes as her grandfather remarked with his archaic pronouns and plurals that has the smallest fitten i ever saw to a wench she certainly did not dress the part for despite the witchery of the bonnet her workaday skirt and stout shoes proclaimed the village girl as her hands proclaimed the drudge who scoured and scrubbed and baked and dug and manured indeed what with her own goats and her farmyard commissions she was almost as familiar with the grosser aspects of animal life as that strangely romanticized modern figure the hospital nurse the delicate solicitude of martha on her behalf was thus a pure morbidity for in going to and fro like a weavers shuttle jinny could scarcely remain ignorant that women were as liable to offspring as any other females though it seemed a part of natures order that had no more to do with herself than the strange hirsute growths on the masculine faceor for the matter of that on miss gentrys mr fallow the old pastor of little bradmarsh who though despised and rejected of dissent requiredbeing humancomestibles candles and shoestrings from chipstone as well as the disposal of his honey and his smaller tithes was among jinnys favourite clients her original horror of bradmarsh church having been early modified by an accidental peep one weekday morning which revealed its priest as its sole occupant yet standing in his place in his white surplice he was going through the service with such devout selfforgetfulness that the confused child wondered whether the satan of worldliness had him so entirely gripped as she had been given to understand she did not know that this very praying all to himself would have shocked miss gentry as savouring of the abhorred high churchmanship indeed little better than a papist the chipstone curate had pronounced the harmless old widower he for his part had long admired the little carrier and perceiving the fine shape of her calloused fingers no less than the smallness of her sturdy shoes and enjoying the tang of her tonguefor the cottage women though nimbler than their lords were not wittyhe had indulged his antiquarian vein and the abundant leisure due to the ravages of dissent by tracing for her a less plebeian and more churchy pedigree foiled in the hope of connecting her with francis quarles of emblems fame he found in nordens list of the ancient halls of essex a spring elm manor appertaining to one jonathan quarles the flockless pastor had even journeyed in quest of this hall and found illogical confirmation in the fact of its continued existence in all the pride of mullioned windows and lilystrewn if muddy moat though with its private chapel turned into a stable and its piscina bricked over henceforward he saw in the exuberant vitality and imperious obstinacy of daniel quarles only an impoverished reincarnation of hardliving but ecclesiastically correct squiredom while in jinny with her generous visits to the ailing and bedridden on her route he elected to behold a reembodied lady bountiful pride of a feudal parish what was prosaically certain however was that jinny had not even the education of bundocks bunch of girls the only school she had ever attended being the peculiars sundayschool held at a house adjoining the chapel in an interval between the services thither as to the servicesher grandfather being a wesleyanshe had been convoyed regularly by caleb packed into a cart with as many of the flynt boys as had not yet flown off but the business itself forced reading and writing upon her though when its sole responsibility devolved on her and it was no longer necessary to confute the old mans memory by the written word or figure she found herself agreeably able to dispense with the learned arts welcomed at lonely farmyards where fierce dogs sometimes broke their chains for the joy of licking her hand or of flying at nips throat not less welcome in village high streets where every other house would ply her fussily with orders that she took coolly and without a single note her bosom knowledge of everybodys business and her dramatic interpretation of any abnormal commission infusing life into her work that saved her from slips of memory adored by all the swains and yokels who hauled her goods and chattels up and down but radiating only a frosty sunshine in return for none had ever been able to pass the icebarrier that separated her private self from her professional geniality jumping down herself only to give christian burial to hapless moles rats shrews leverets and bloodstained feathers or to glean for lonely old women or the numerous and impoverished pennymole family the unconscious largesse of more careless driversturnips lumps of coal wisps of hay chaffering with beaming shopkeepers on behalf of her clients and hailfellowwellmet with her fellowcarriers encountered at crossroads or the black sheep jinny pursued her unmaidenly career in fine weather or foul sometimes wayworn windwhipped raindrenched and with aching forehead but more often with a vital joy that was not least keen when methusalemcloudexhaling and clogged by snow that sometimes raised the road as high as the hedgeshad to plough his way along a track hewn out by labourers with here and there a siding cut in the glittering mass for carts to pass each other by those were days not devoid of danger road hedge ditch and field obliterated in one snowy expanse once jinnys cart had to be dug out like a crusted fossil of the ice ageand only the agonized howling of nip had brought rescue iii it was the first time he had justified his air of managing the whole concern round which he barked and bounded and scurried as though methusalem and jinny were his minions he had indeed commandeered themjumping originally out of nowhere on to the tailboardand however he strayed from the path of their duty in his numberless tangential excursions and expeditions they knew he would never abandon them like many other great characters nip was a mongrel his foundation was foxterrier and he had preserved the cleverness of the strain without its pluck to strangers indeed he seemed a very david among dogs attacking as he sometimes did canine goliaths but no dog is a hero to his mistress and after he had adopted her jinny discovered that these resounding assaults on the bulkier were but bravado passages based on his flair that the bigger dog was also the bigger coward that was where his brains came in as well as his baser breed a sniff at a real fighter and nip would evade combat sauntering off with a nonchalant air a splash of brown on his brainpan and about his ears and a dab of black on his snout werewith his leathern collarthe sole touches of relief in his sleek whiteness his headbeautifully poised and shapedwith its bright darkbrown eye eloquently expressive and passing easily from love to greediness from shyness to shame invited many a pat from lovers of the soulful yet to hear him bolt a rabbit was to imagine a demon on the warpath in a flash the cart would be left a furlong behind or athwart his raucous staccato yells filled the meadows with echoes of bloodlust and revenge but long experience had dulled jinnys solicitude for bunny never once was there a sign of a kill sometimes indeed when nip was hunting a rat the creature would run across the path under his very nose but that nose pushing eagerly for faroff game never seemed able to readjust itself to what was under it all the which maladroitness was probably artfulness nip scenting shrewdly that a successful sportsdog would have been hounded out he knew well the foolish treacherous heart of his mistress who actually misled the hunt those autumn mornings that brought the highmettled hares across their path with ears taut and every muscle tragically astrain up would come the beagles with a long processional flutter of waving white tails nosing forlornly and barking dismally while hepanting to put them rightwas tied paw and paw how they set him quivering those horntootlings of the gorgeous master though they did not go to his bowels as much as those staccato chivies that suggested that the greenandwhite gentleman was one of themselves rather than a biped or as those more elaborately contorted cries and rousing thongcracks of the whipperin a fellowfeeling makes us wondrous kind and when all these huntersfourfooted or twofootedincluding the draggletail of fat breathless farmers and wheezing females were remorselessly sent the wrong way by his brutal mistress the poor dog could not refrain from wailing even when the hare did not cross her path her horn imitating the professional toot would allure and misguide the distant dogs nips own relatives the foxhounds more rarely came his way but though his mistresss sympathies with the quarry were less markedher chickens being preciousnip was still held in but amid all his disgust the cunning dog remembered that his days of foraging for himselfbefore he had picked up jinnyhad not been rosy and replete caterers like jinny he realized did not grow on every cart not to mention the cushioned basket from which he could bark at everything on the road or within which with a huge grunt of satisfaction he could curl into an odorous dream a contrast in all save colour was the stolid methusalem though he too was of hybrid stock while his hairy fetlocks proclaimed a kinship with the draughtbreed of the shire he lacked that gross spirit and while his flying mane and tail flaunted an affinity with the fiery arab he was equally deficient in that high mettle by what romantic episode he had come into being whether through the wild oats of an arabian ancestor or the indiscretion of a mere circushorse or whether his tossing hair and tail were the heritage from a shetland ponyas his moderate stature suggestedis not recorded in any studbook but it was impossible to see him without the word steed coming into the mind and equally impossible to sit behind him without thinking of a ploughhorse when oi first see that rollin in the brook afore twas broke in gaffer quarles would relate oi was minded of the posters of mazeppa at the fair and christened that accordin it was only when he discovered that this blonde beast was a whited sepulchre that mazeppa was exchanged for methusalem as though that antediluvian worthy had always been a doddering millenarian and not at one time in the prime of his hundreds the name had at least the effect of banishing expectation his mere amble was an agreeable surprise as a matter of fact methusalem had still his mazeppa moments they came on tuesday and friday evenings when he was loosed from the shafts at which moments he would roll on his back kick up his heels and gallop madly round the goatpasture to the alarm of the tethered browsers and even at his professional pace he always kept his mane flying one accomplishment however methusalem had which no mazeppa steed could have bettered nay which made a circus pedigree plausible he could lift the latch of gates with his nose and walk through it was a trick which jinny with her habit of not alighting had fostered in him if the gate did not swing to she could usually close it with the buttend of her whipthrough the cartrear at the worsta procedure which with her further habit of using short cuts and even private tracks like that at bellropes park saved not a little time and was some compensation for methusalems general crawl if the local carrying business had grown indistinguishable from jinny it seemed no less bound up with her fourfooted companions whose ghostly figures seen looming through the wintry dusk sent a glow of warmth through the bleak countryside iv but today jinnys horn nips yap and methusalems pseudospirited pawing were alike powerless to evoke the familiar forthbustling of caleb and martha only cocks crowed and doves moaned while from the riverslope came the lowing of cattle alarmed for the lonely and aged couple jinny jumped down and tapped at the door nobody replying she lifted the latch and came from the joyous spring sunshine on a chill silent piece of hallway in which even the tall clock had stopped dead she peeped perfunctorily into the musty parlour on her way to the kitchenthe lozengeshaped motto when he giveth quietness who then can make trouble seemed to have taken on a strange and solemn significance but she knew that the kitchen was the likeliest lair so not pausing to examine the ominously unopened letter addressed to mrs flynt which she espied on the mantelpiece she pressed on to the rear the kitchen however was still more desolate not only of the couple but of the habitual glow on the cavernous hearth what wonder if nip who had followed her set up an uncanny whining she halloaed up the staircase but that only aggravated the silence she dashed next door to the shepherds sectionsimilar solitude with a feeling of lead at her heart she rushed back into the ironic sunshine and towards the orchardnow unbearably beautiful in its blossomingand as she was approaching a remote corner that harboured the pigsty in which marthas pet sow carried on a lucrative maternity she was half relieved to collide with caleb who was moving houseward with haggard eyes and carpet slippers is anything the matter she gasped sow glad youve come the missus keeps arxing for you weve been up all night with her with your wife he looked astonished noa maria jinnys full relief found vent in a peal of laughter its no laughin matterthe missus wants ye to tell the wet to come at once but whats the matter with her inquired jinny still unable to rise to his seriousness a snoutache shes a goner said caleb solemnly weve reared up nine boys but marias been more trouble than the lot the missus would bring her up by hand and oi always prophesied she wouldnt live amusedly aware that marias progeny had already exceeded sixty jinny offered to visit the patient dothatll comfort the missus and yell know better what to tell jorrow oill hold your hoss you know the waybehind the red maytree jinny smiled again the idea of methusalem needing restraint amused her but she did not dispel calebs romantic illusion the sick sty was visible through a halfdoor that gave at once air and view and over which nip at once bounded on to the startled marthas back as she hung over the prostrate pig on its bed of dirty straw maria belonged to the society of large black pigs and snuffed the world through a long fine snout but life had evidently lost its savour for the poor sow was turning restlessly oh jinny moaned martha she had thirteen last time and i knew it was an unlucky number nonsense quoth jinny gaily twelve would have been less luckyat the price i got you yes dearie but im not thinking of prices she was a birthday present for my loneliness i know said jinny gently no you dont she wrung her hands the selfpossession caleb had admired when the letter broke on their lives was no longer hers youve got lots of brethren and sisters but ive got nobody to break bread with no fraternal gatherings to go to and even flynt wont be immersed though hes in his sixtynine and we must all fall asleep some day so it was a comfort to have maria following me about everywhere like nip does you and i do believe shes got more sense than the socalled christians here and would be the first to pray for the peace of jerusalem with me if she could only speak but now even maria may be taken from me youll send jorrow at once wont you dearie but whats the matter with her cant you see all night she kept rooting up the ground oh i hope it isnt fever rubbish look at the skin of her ears and she isnt coughing at all whats she been overeating nothingonly the grass flynt has been cutting why dont you give her a dose of castoroil she wont take it she knows weve covered it upi told you shes got as much brains as a christian let me try and get it down it is down the piglets ate the mess up oh dear laughed jinny that will need jorrow anything else mrs flynt i cant think this morning ask flynt caleb however proved equally distraught there was summat extra special oi know he said his redshirted arm clinging heroically to methusalems bridle for heres the knot in my hankercher but what it singafies lord onny knows it wasnt a new shirt she suggested slyly he shook his head noa noa this keeps her colour as good as new but the missus did make a talk about my sunday neckercher ill get you a new one plain or speckled oi leaves that to you jinnyyou know more about stoylish things v on her winding and muchhalting way to chipstone jinny took advantage of the absence of the noble family and the complaisance of her customer the lodgekeeper to smuggle her plebeian vehicle through bellropes park which was not only a mile shorter but dodged the turnpike with its aproned harpy of a tollman she loved the great avenues of oaks and the shining lake the game of swans and the sense of historic splendour and nip as if with a sense of stolen sweets sniffed never more happily though when they got within view of the water he had to be summoned back to his headquartersbasket by a stern military note a combat between himself and the swans not commending itself to his mistress some of these irascible graces floated now on the margin meticulously picking their tailfeathers contorting their necks but vastly more exciting were those of the flock far out on that spacious sparkle of brown water they seemed to be going springmad and threshing the scintillating water with their wings oaring themselves thus along each one infecting the other till the water itself seemed to be leaping in a shimmering frenzy of froth even the ducks reared up or stood on their heads in a sort of intoxication and this sense of the joy and beauty of the spring communicated itself to the girl not in jubilance but in some exquisite wistfulness some craving of the blood for mysterious adventure something seemed calling at once out of the past and out of the future and then her thoughts wandered back to frog farm and the flynts and the farscattered youths with whom she had formerly ridden to sundayschool and suddenly by a flash from her subconsciousness she recognized the writing of the unopened letter on marthas mantelpiece of the letter she had scarcely looked at surely though the curves were bolder it was the work of the very same male hand that had written on the flyleaf of a peculiar hymnbook the inspired quatrainwhich she had admired from her childhoodbeginning steal not this book for fear of shame an admonition she thought peculiarly appropriate to the holy book it guarded and with the memory of the flyleaf surged up also the facethe longforgotten freckled face of the youngest and most headstrong of the flynt boys the will flouted as carrots but in her opinion the handsomest of the batch who had always loomed over her with such grownup if genial grandeur and had given her his bullroarer and threaded birds eggs for her before she had come to think their collection wicked what a hullabaloo when the boy disappearedhe must have been hardly thirteen she began computingand she the child of nine or so who could have comforted the distracted martha had dared say no word because he had made her swear on that very hymnbook to keep his flight silent just as she was permeated by the solemnity of the book and the oath on it he had thrown it away she remembered thrown it into the bushes from the wagon in which he was driving her home from chapel the details of that forgotten summer sunday began to come back most vividly of all the boy struggling and sobbing when his buttons were cut off he had been so proud of his new velvet jacket with its manifold rows of blue buttons and lo after sundayschool his father had appeared with a somewhat crestfallen look and a pair of scissors saying you dont want all this flummery while elder mawhoodevidently the admonishing angelhad stood grimly by intoning pride is abominable wanity must be rooted out the boy had choked back his sobs and apparently found solace in the evening hymns and was further soothed by being allowed at his own request to drive the party home it was feltespecially by marthasome compensation for the buttons was due to him thus when the wagon had reached swash end and the bulk of the flynt family got off according to custommud and weather permittingand walked up to frog farm leaving jinny to be driven round the long detour to her home at blackwater hall she was left alone with will it was then that having asked her if she could keep a secret and being assured she could he informed her to her admiring horror that the moment he had safely delivered her on the road by the common he would turn his horses head for harwich where stabling the horse and wagon so that his parents might trace his intention he would take ship as a cabinboy or a stowaway for america where he was sure to come across his brother ben and never would she see him again in bradmarsh till he had made his fortune she could see him now under a late sunset that was like his hair with his flashing freckled face his blazing blue eyes and his poor defaced jacket the thready stubs of the big buttons showing like scars their quaint dialogue came back vividly to her oh will but cant you make your fortune here no thank youno more chapel for me i know its hardand you did look beautiful with the buttonsbut isnt it more beautiful to please god rubbish what does god care about my buttons hes pleased just as i like your giving me birds eggs but i didnt give my buttonsthey were snatched from methrough that beastly old mawhood but elder mawhood knows what god wants let him cut off his own nose and not go smelling into everybodys business the other day he made poor old sister tarbox get riddy of her cat that was kindness because it had to be shut up alone all sunday while she was at chapel i believe it was only to make more rats for him to kill thats not true will you know sister tarbox is too poor to have her cottage cleared well let him look after his rats and catsnot me an elder must do his duty i hate elders and deacons and hymnbooks yah im done with religion thank god oh will you mustnt speak like that fancy stewing in chapel in weather like this isnt this just the weather to thank god for noits all silliness oh will yes it is you ask brother bundocki dont mean old mr bundock i asked him once who wrote our hymnbook and he said twixt you and i the village idiot you are talking wickedly willthere were tears in the voice now you mustnt run away thats more wicked ohi was an idiot myself to tell you you are going to peach on me i suppose peach tell your grandfather about my running away not if you dont do it but i shall do it and you promised to keep the secret to tell would be more wicked than me i wont tell but you mustnt go i must swear not to betray me kiss my hymnbook it was with some soothed sense of restored sanctities that she had pressed her lips to the holy covershe still remembered its smell and taste salted with a tear of her ownbut what a fresh and mightier shock that throwing of the book into the bushes stop stop she heard the little girls horrorstruck cry over the years remembered how as he laughed and drove on furiously with her the phrase drive like the devil had come to her mind charged for the first time with meaning wilful boy had had his way he had escaped from england and evendespite his diabolismby the aid of the ninepence she had insisted on bringing down from her moneybox while he waited trustfully outside her grandfathers domain but she had not responded in kind to the lordly kiss he had blown her as he drove off to america goodbye little jinny goodbye will say your prayers not me then i shall pray for you when the hue and cry was out and bellmen were busy with his carroty head and velvet jacket with the buttons cut off little jinny had also gone ahuntingbut for the outraged hymnbook it lay now still hidden in a drawerthe one secret of her lifeunmentioned even when by the bulky clue of the horse and cart the fugitive had been traced as he designed yes she must disinter this hymnbook of his from its hidingplace compare the inscriptionshe knew by now the rhyme was not originalwith her memory of marthas letter what was its postmark she wondered well she would find that out indeed the whole contents on her return to frog farm perhaps he was coming backhis fortune already made and the revived sense of his wickedness was mixed with a sense of her own soonforgotten resolveor threatto pray for him and was blurred in some strange emotion in which the glamorous freshness of childfeeling mingled with a leaping of the heart that was like the springjoy of the swans vi but jorrow could not make the journey that day to that remote farm there were more important animals more expensively endangered and more easily accessible old sows were so fussy and to judge by the symptoms it was a mere case for castoroil but precisely because jinny had herself recommended this drugofallwork she felt unconvinced it seemed a mere glib formula for being riddy of her there was another resource elijah skindle who having settled in chipstone only five years ago practised only among parvenus like himself it was not because he was a furriner nor even because he had started as a knacker and still had a nondescript status that jinny shrank from calling him in now she had more than once deposited damaged dogs with him or deported them mended but she objected to the appraising gaze he fixed upon her on these occasions though to be sure her objection to these jaunts was not so strong as nips who seeing in every canine cooccupant of the cart a possible supplanter bristled and whined and barked till the rival was safely discharged but on her way home overcoming her repugnancefor marthas sake if not marias or dutysshe stopped her cart outside his pretentious black gauze blind and blew a rousing blast a tall blackeyed greyhaired woman issuing from the office door with a broom who appeared to be mr skindles mother informed her that lijah was full up however he could be found at the kennels if jinny insisted on seeing him she pointed vaguely to a field behind the house visible through an unpaved alley yawning between the sober skindle window and its flamboyant neighbour the chemists but it was in vain that jinny clucked to methusalem to thread the alley the beast refused absolutely alighting with some dim understanding of his instinct she walked to the fieldgate over which a horse was gazing at her lifting the latch she wandered among other happily scampering horses in search of the kennels finding at first only a barnlike structure a glance through whose doors at the flagstoned paving that sloped to a centre turned her sick for a pyramid of horses feet was the least repulsive indication though even the homely skewers so agreeable to squibs took on a sinister hue the spectacle however served to make the kennels when at last discovered a lesser horror but it was the first time she had seen dogs so far gone in distemper and these rheumyeyed skeletons each chained in its niche sullied the springtide and haunted her for days she caught up nip who had come to heel as though he too might pine suddenly into skin and bone nip himself it must be confessed regarded these shadows of his species with indifference if not with satisfaction as negligible competitors elijah skindle discovered on his knees in the act of feeding a pathetic poodle was as unstrung by the sight of jinny as jinny by the sight of the dogs his black cutty pipe fell from his lips and he nearly stuck the dogs spoon into his own open mouth but mastering himself and without raising his cap or his pipe or changing his attitude he gasped out hullo nip ill jinny replied curtlyfor there was a familiarity that repelled her in his calling nip by his right name no a sow at frog farmlittle bradmarsh you know his heart leapt frog farm meant an old inhabitant local prejudice was then beginning to melt at last but rather out of my radius he said with pretended indifference besides as he reached for his pipe my nags gone lame i could give you a lift said jinny outwitted for once since it never struck her that this was precisely what elijah had fished for and why he had lamed his beast the spoon trembled in his hand but he replied grumblingly but then i should have to come at once im afraid so said jinny mr skindle rose and brushed his knees anything to oblige a lady he said it isnt me its maria said jinny icily vii but jinny was not altogether outmanuvred for while mr skindle was getting his case of utensils she filled up the rest of her seatit was a stuffed seat covered with sackingby means of a peculiarly precious parcel needing a vigilant eye no new device this but her habitual protection against bores or adorers and skindle she feared was both this swainchaser or maidprotector was kept in a corner of the cart ready for emergencies being an elongated package of stones marked fragile the stones had to be jagged and uncouth or nip would have squatted on it and roused suspicion this was the only parcel she lifted herself and it figured in her own mind as the scarecrow and so despite mr skindles offer to nurse it on his knees she put him behind hernot as a satan for his seductiveness was small he had it is true a good styside manner and his slim figure outlined by a trimly cut pepperandsalt suit effused a sense of vitality but his strawcoloured moustache which was not without its female votaries was for jinny more of a puzzle than a decoration for she could not reconcile its flowingness with the desolating baldness that any shifting of his cap revealed his cranium was in fact like the advertisement of a hairrestorer in the picture preceding the application thereof as fixed a feature of his face as the grey cap which concealed his calvity was the black cutty pipe stuck in his stained teeth nor had jinny ever seen him without a large pearl horseshoe pin in his tie please dont smoke she said as he climbed in by the tailboard granfer would smell it and why shouldnt he hes a wesleyan oh he laughed without comprehension a shade scoffingly and the smell might get into peoples parcels she added bestowing himself under the tilt as well as he could on a box grazed at his side by a ledge he considered too narrow to sit on and threatened with decapitation through a plank holding the smaller parcels that ran athwart the cart just above his head mr skindle gazed up over this shelf at the glorious view of the back of jinnys bonnet and feasted his eyes on her graceful dorsal curves and the more variegated motions of her driving arm not to mention the succession of lovely rural backgrounds made for her figure by the arch of the awning and his illhumour melted and though his pipe grew cold his heart began to glow but jinny took no more notice of him than if he had been himself a box no wonder he began to feel closed and corded up bursting though he knew himself to be with soulriches for a full mile his extinct pipe in his teeth he heard only the monotonous snap of methusalems hoofs as if everything along the road was snapping in a frost the unjaded steed had actually started off at almost a trot and as the gaffer explained once a hoss what has long lopes knocks his fitten together thenas if to mark how completely her passenger was forgottenone of her grandfathers songs began to steal from her lips it was not high barbary nor admiral benbow nor yet his favourite oim seventeen come sunday which the nonagenarian sang daily with growing conviction it wasand nip would have been the first to be surprised had he understood itthe old english air the hunt is up the hunt is up and it is wellnigh day and harry our king has gone huntynge to bring the deer to bay perhaps it was the influence of her horn perhaps she was an artist who could enjoy in song what she could not suffer in life or perhaps she loved the lilt of the old song and never thought of the meaning or only of the bravery of the spectacle and the gay coming of the dawn for all untrained as she was she vibrated peculiarly to music and one of the wonderful moments of her young life was when she first heard a hymn sung in parts at the sundayschool to her ear accustomed only to the solo quavering of the gaffer was revealed harmony a starry new universe and a bloodtickling enchantment in one almost at the first outbreak of the hunting song nip appeared at a run and with two bounds he established himself in his mistresss lapinvidiously enough in elijahs eyes for that silvery little voice rippling along the lonely road with the unconscious joyance of a blackbirds completed the spell which the spring landscapeseen in that series of pictures framed by the arch of the tiltwas weaving on the doomed veterinary surgeon there were sheep big and little lying in the wide fields and great newly ploughed spaces of red freshly turned earthfor the first time elijah felt the scarecrows as a degradation of all this primeval beauty appletrees flowered in the cottage gardens and in the hedges was early mayblossom and on the brinks primroses anemones and even a few precocious bluebells rioted in an intoxicating fertility of beauty larks rose palpitating with song bumblebees boomed butterflies flittered and ever and anon came the haunting cry of the cuckoo and when jinnys voice soared up too elijah skindles heart seemed melting down his spine viii thats a lucky dog of yours he said desperately when the music ceased thats what i thought at your place she replied through the back of her head not had distemper yet he saw her shoulders shudder there was an awkward silence you know id gladly look after him gratis he blundered on and you too then in a horrible consciousness of the pathological implication he awaited the lash of her tongue but she must have been abstracted for she only said politely thanks very much but i always go to jorrows yes he reflected bitterly and always went there for other people unless skindles was expressly stipulated but they were now approaching the first village after chipstone and the outside world intruded on the idyll a dozen times he vaulted up and down to prevent interloping young mensometimes armed with nosegaysreceiving parcels too proximately and he had a proud and malicious pleasure in their disconcerted unspoken surmise as to his privileged situation the small coin of conversation appertaining to these deliveries jinny did not refuse him and every cluck she gave to methusalem every ripple of laughter on her busy way deepened the spell the unexpected faces the quaint cottage interiors the cheerfulsmiling women in high green aprons who received staylaces or bobbins sugar or teapackets in bare doughpowdered or soapfrothed arms the panting figures that tolled after the cart with forgotten bundles the dogsthe fiercer in their barrels and boxes the milder waving free and friendly tails the quaint commissions and monitions the salutations and farewellsill remember the twopence and tell my brother wont you about the christening i dont want any more of her puddings they put the millers eye outall this fascinating bustle and chatter spiced with friendly laughter seemed to belong to an enchanted earth of which gaiety was the groundnote not animal groaning the windings of her horn completed his sense of fairyland in the remoter woodland regions he was possessed alternately with a disapprobation of her recklessness in trusting herself thus alone with a male far from help and a surprise at his own passivity in so provoking and romantic a situation of course he was going to behave like the gentleman he was but why was she so irritatingly sure of it did she think he wasnt flesh and blood she might at least show some consciousness of his chivalry but his resentment at her professional nonchalance only served to confirm his longstanding suspicion that here at last was the girl for him that he was choosing well if not wisely doubtless chipstone and his mother would say he was marrying too much beneath him but look at the farmers daughterswhat lumps beside her he admitted of course that the blanche of foxearth farm to whom his mother mainly aspired was an exception but then this purley minx was hopelessly out of reach stuck up on her pedestal of beauty conceit and culture and throwing over even her affianced wooers as for his neighbour the chemists girlwhat could his mother see in her except that annuity which would not even survive her and she not looking particularly strong no with the present satisfactory amount of sheeprot glanders and distemper he could afford to please himself and if jinny couldnt play the piano like the landsurveyors widow why one must content oneself with the horn pending initiation into the higher life together they would work up the business with jinnys connexionthough of course she must give up carrying and become a ladythere would surely be a trail of sick beasts in her wake jorrow would soon be outdistanced they would live away from his office that could all be turned into doghospital such were the kennels in the air built by the enamoured elijah as he sat on boxes or hampers or panted under their weight in his officious deliveries an officiousness which drove out of her head the keg of oil destined for uckford manor oh dear she murmured suddenly a mile later forcing the explanation from her he cried joyfully lets go back jinny shook her head no time she said and flicked at methusalem but i dont mind being late im not thinking of youbut of the pig bother the pig is that the way you study your patients ive got better things to study he could only say it to her back but he threw enough intensity into it to come out on the other side of her indeed the back seemed impenetrable you going into another business why ever should i when im getting on so famouslyten pound a week if a penny it was an opportunity made to his hand i know he went on as the back remained rigid that folks pretend its not as highclass as real doctoring but believe me it needs more brains does it stands to reason a human being can tell you what he feels and where the pain lays but with a dumb beast youve got only your own sense and skill to go on its us vets that should really be at the top of the profession but sick babies are dumb too jinny reminded him sick babies have talking mammas he replied genteelly jinny did not imitate them and silence fell again tempered by methusalems snappings really it was very awkward elijah felt thus proposing to a girl behind her back but he struggled gallantly take stomach staggers nowif those horses you saw waiting to be killed this evening had been treated in time the horses in your field cried jinny shocked but they looked so lively theyre all like that he explained once out of harness they get a bit jaunty again but theyre worth more dead than alive its dreadful killing off a horse that has served one jinny burst out just for a few shillings a few shillings why theres horses over twofifty pounds flesh i mean he explained with a chuckle not to mention the skin hair and bones why theres eighty pounds of intestines for sausageskins oh do hold your tongue cried jinny feeling sick again yes and what about his tongue retorted elijah triumphantly it aint only frenchies that get that and his tail waving for funerals and his hoofs in your own shoebuttons jinny felt indeed as though hoofs had descended on her feet and she could almost have sacrificed methusalems highwaving tail to adorn her passengers obsequies my neighbour the chemisthe buys the blood continued the ghoulish elijah he makes it into but just here at a crossroad jinnys horn signalled to a smart young man in a velvet waistcoat who was driving a trap and brought him to a standstill would barnaby deliver a keg of oil at uckford manor if he was passing that way that manor was it transpired the one goal and purpose of barnabys journey jinnywell aware young purley was homeward bound for foxearth farmgave him a radiant smile and elijah threw him the keg and a furious look a reliable fellowfeeling informing him that the velvety liar was going at least two miles out of his way downright dishonest he felt it seeing that neither the young mans time nor his trap was his own but belonged to his father the hurdlemaker but what could you expect of blanches brother let jinny beware of the family fickleness let her lean on a less showy but manlier breast i wonder you dont arrange your things village by village instead of letting em lay all over the vehicle he observed as she drove on i shant forget where to drop you came the answer over her cold shoulder then silence fell more painfully than ever and the monotonous ticktack of methusalem maddened his conscious ear the monstrous possibility began to loom up that jinnys affections were preengaged to some one of these numerous young men his eye fell upon a coil of rope hung round a loose hoop of the tilt and morbid thoughts of using itwhether on the young men or himself was not clearfloated vaguely in his usually serene soul presently he noted other coils on other ribs and their plurality suggested it was for the young men not himself that rope was appropriate what else were they there for he wondered dully yes let her fiancs go hang engagements could always be broken offnothing venture nothing have to nerve himself for the great question he took advantage of the pause at long bradmarsh while methusalem was drinking at the trough of the king of prussia but this imitation of methusalem on a stronger fluid was fatal for in jinnys persistent silence the animals ticktacks now grew soothing he settled himself more comfortably on the emptier floor of the cart with his head on a soft bundle and watched the nape of jinnys neck till it faded into a great white sea of floating ice he was struggling in it for hours but at last the cold waves passed over his head and jinny turning to throw out a parcel saw that his cap had fallen off in his writhings leaving his baldness almost indecently glaring so deep was he in his daymare that he was quite unaware of jinnys colloquy with another male whom her horn had hailed as they passed over the bridge to little bradmarsh not that there was anything in ephraim bidlake to excite apprehension for he was a stalwart peculiar safely married and residing with his family and two twinnieces of his wifessophy and sallyon board the billyboy whose great boomless black sail jinny had espied darkening the water with its shadow bidlakes barge was a cross between a norfolk wherry and a ferryboat and plied up and down the brad loading at the wharves with its halflowered mast for crane or carrying man and cattle across the bridgeless sections when it had nothing better to do there was not much money coming in at the best and it was often jinnys privilege to eke out the barges larder under pretence of presents for the motherless sophy and sally so tragically fathered for ephraim bidlake a shaggy giant with doglike eyes had brought the little furriners from hampshire when their mother died after their fathermrs bidlakes brotherhad been transported to botany bay for burning a rick in some old agricultural riot against the introduction of machinery the blot on their scutcheon had been concealed from the new neighbourhood but had been gradually confided by mrs bidlake to jinny with protestations of her brothers innocencehad he not been made a constable in the very convict ship by degrees too she had conveyed to the girl a vivid picture of the trial and deportation for the devoted sister had walked the bulk of the way to winchester in the hope of proving his innocence by collecting testimonies to his character and had joined the mob of weeping women who hung round the gaol gates night and day or crowded the court only to witness the sanctimonious cruelty of the bewigged judges and the tragic exodus of the damned in the prison coach guarded by a file of soldiers to lie in the hulks at southampton till they were shipped to savage australia there to be assigned to brutal stockowners it was an experience which had cost mrs bidlake dear her next child had been stillborn and to this day she had never reared but one more infant and that a still delicate one but for the comfort of the peculiar faith it would have been a cheerless household she was now again brought to bed it was to inquire about her that jinny had hailed the barge and very sad she was to learn from brother bidlakewhen he had punted within earshotthat the new baby had succumbed after a few hours though the missus thank god was recovering and the twins were wunnerful good and helpful she was not sorry however that the undoctored infant had departed with a precipitation which rendered an inquest unlikely for inquests were the bane of the brotherhood ix it was twilight when methusalem drew up again before the twin doors this time caleb did not fail sow glad you aint brought the wet but i havehes snoring inside jinny called down lord said caleb taking another look oi did see his head but by this owllight oi thought twas a cheese jinnys laugh rippled out and elijah skindle started up and sneezed he looked round dazedly for his cap weve arrived he asked shamefacedly clapping it on yes said jinny but the pigs all right i fear youve had a wasted journey she jumped down wasted he sat up ardently dont say wasted a good nap is a comfort she agreed i may have dozed offyour singing rocked me to sleep i reckon but all the while ive been trying to tell you his voice broke i know she said softly i heard you did i talk in my sleep he asked innocently through your nose he winced as at a blow on it thatsthats nature he stammered i dont suppose even females are free from snoring maria isnt observed jinny patting methusalem martha hurried out happily with a piece of sugar for the same favoured beast marias been walking with me she cried rapturously and eating hearty added caleb if you ask me she was drunk oh flynt cried martha arent you ashamed to speak like that about your own pig and before strangers but that rolled and kicked last night same as a sow oi seen once that swallowed a thick wine happen maria got swillin at old peartrees beerbarrel how could she do that jinny protested turned on the tap like a christian same as your methusalem opens our gate elijah picked up his pipe and his cap and scrambled down appears to me ive been brought here under false pretences well pay you all the same said caleb with dignity but how am i to get back to chipstone he had followed maria in reckless abandonment and now came the prose of life with its questions if were going to pay the gentleman put in martha he may as well have a look at maria mr skindle agreed it was as well to make a possible future patients acquaintance but repeated his inquiry theres shankss mare said jinny blandly caleb pointed towards the brook its onny seven miles by swash end through plashy walk plashy hall has a dog objected elijah well youre used to dogs said jinny my instrumentcase is too heavy youll have to give me a lift to your house with pleasure she said but blackwater hall is still farther from chipstone anyhow i can get a trap from the village he said firmly no you cant and even if you walk to long bradmarsh its a tossup if youll get anything at the king of prussia well take me as far as the bridgeill pay extra i cant guarantee methusalem will go back thats all right he said cheerfully horses know i stand no nonsense and now uncle as soon as ive lit my pipe ill be ready for the pig got a match to his disgust caleb produced a lucifer and a phial of sulphuric acid for dipping it in the now wellestablished friction matchesthat boon to the idle and extravaganthad not yet reached frog farm where even flint and steel had been dispossessed but slowly but the relit pipe was comforting wait a moment mr flynt said jinny tendering a packet as he started convoying the vet your neckerchief neckerchief cried martha and what about my new bonnet twas only to be cleaned caleb reminded her and by the same token mother dont forget we settled the wet was to read the letter elijah raised his eyebrows ah yesill get it and martha hurried within you see jinny caleb explained the missus got a letter from cousin caroline and we thought the gentleman here could make one job of it with the pig but why cant i read it you aint married no more is mr skindle elijah flushed furiously noabut ef its tootoo womanish oill arx him kindly to break it to me sow oi can break it to the missus when hes gone is this the letter asked jinny as martha reappeared with it thats hercame all of an onplunge he repeated but thats not from your cousin caroline said jinny with a thrill of excitement as she took it noa gasped caleb as if the world was tumbling about his ears then he smiled youre making gameyou aint opened her yet but who else is it from cried martha catching her excitement cant you see its from will will martha gave a great cry and clutched at the letter my baby will caleb scratched his head now which would be will will was the freckled goodlooking one said jinny oh jinny said martha they were all goodlookingtook after flynt dear heart you cant ha forgotten our tot after all that flurry tis only seven or eight years since he ay ay cried caleb him what mowed the cats whiskers no dear heart that was ben to be sure bens the barber in new yorkor some such place no caleb thats isaac isaac then will ud be the one what married the coffeecoloured lady i told you the other day that was christopher ay him in australia africa surely put in elijah puffing at his pipe with superior amusement they furrin places be much of a muchness said caleb and my buoyoys were as like as a bakers dozen there were girls in the batch corrected martha but how you can forget that dreadful sunday night you who snipped the darlings buttons if i dont see the pig soon interrupted elijah losing patience the lightll be gone altogether oill git a lantern said caleb placidly oi often used to set and wonder how they lads knowed theirselves the one from the tother well the lord bless em all says oi wherever they goo and whichever they be so you see said jinny with a faint blush hardly visible by owllight theres no need to waste mr skindles time over the letter no more there aint said caleb dazedly come along sir x but martha still clung strangely to the letter she had snatched back you mustnt strain your eyes jinny she said ill light the lamp and youll take a cup of tea first you must be tired out but i can see quite well said jinny indeed the sky despite the risen moon remained blue and splashes of dying sunset burned magically through the yet empty branches of the quiet trees there was a great sense of space and peace and beauty a subtle waft from the stacks the note of the thrush was full of evening restfulness jinny took the letter from the reluctant martha he must be back in england she cried look at the stamp martha staggered against the cart its very good of god she said simply her emotion communicated itself to jinny through misty eyes the girl watched a solitary heron winging on high through the great spaces its legs sticking out like a tail ah dearie said martha recovering herself never forget to say your prayers i dont said jinny with equal simplicity but she remembered with fresh remorse that she had forgotten those for the runaway ever since i was a little girl said martha ive wanted to please god but of late jinny i fear ive wanted him to please me well now he has said jinny youll have will as well as maria and plucking out a hairpin she inserted it to rip open the loose waferclosed envelope stop cried martha suppose its bad news nonsense mrs flynt look how firm the writing is firmyes he always was firmeven before he drove off with the cart dont you remember that nightno twas before your grandfather fetched you to these partshe wasnt seven but that pigheaded he sulked in the wood all nightroosted up a tree like a bird and never a move or a word when we came halloaing with torches well hes not hiding now for the postmarks london and no dont open it yet jinnysuppose he should be married like christopher jinny laughed uneasily two black daughtersinlaw arent very likely much more likely shell be blonde no he cant be married said martha on reflection he never could abide girls i dont mean you dearie you scarcely had your second teeth had you jinny began to rip the envelope we shall soon see but martha snatched away the letter again im sure youll spoil your pretty eyes she persisted daystars will called em once jinny laughed still more uneasily then i ought to be able to read by em but ill light my nightstar and she moved towards the cartlamp it isnt your lightingup time yet is it you dont want to be wasteful well come in and light me a candle a moment you seem in a great hurry to read it said martha fretfully me jinny flushed furiously i thought youd want to hear what he says dont i know what he says that he is in england again and coming to see his old mother isnt that enough for one night its a great deal certainly but supposehe wants something ah thats true martha was visibly perplexed she did not herself understand the suddenly awakened jealous instinct that resented jinnys superior acquaintance with wills handwriting that was subconsciously urging her to hug this letter to her bosom and not share its sacred contents with a girl she at lastespecially after bundocks recent innuendorealized as grownup and who seemed moreover to be claiming a coproprietorship and so it was difficult for her to frame an objection satisfactory to her conscious intelligence but the letter was now in her possession and that was a strong asset for her subconsciousness tis a pity to tear open such a beautiful envelope she said you have your cup o tea ill steam it over the kettle im afraid i havent time for tea especially having to take mr skindle a bit back said jinny almost as mystified as martha herself im late already and granfer will be roaring for his supper i must read it now or never if it was anything unpleasant wavered martha flynt would be very upset and after sitting up all night with mariano he must have a good sleepbetter put it off till the morning tomorrow i wont be here no not till next friday but ive got to go tomorrow to miss gentry and she can read it oh said jinny yes flynt wants to have my bonnet cleanedvanity and waste i call it but wont that tire yousuch a long walk why cant i take the bonnet tonight ill be passing her house we havent finished talking it over yet flynt and me parried martha i might be having a new bonnet you see dearie well of course its just as you wish but suppose it rains tomorrow rains repeated martha feelingshe knew not whylike an animal at bay then she drew a great breath of relief footsteps and voices were borne towards them caleb she cried joyfully wills in londonhes coming to see his old mother good buoyoy cried caleb jovially it was only what he had expected the letter would say but at heart he shrank from the changehe had finally equated himself to the dual solitude and the homecoming prodigal loomed as menacing as cousin caroline good boy echoed martha i should think he isnever cared for girls and still unmarried theres a chance for you jinny chaffed caleb oh how can you talk such nonsense jinny was furiously angry basket nip she called sharply and climbed up to her seat almost as swiftly as he leapt into his are you coming mr skindle in her abstraction and to busy herself about something she automatically removed the parcel of stones from the drivingseat in a jiffy elijah did not bound as obediently as niphe could not lose the chance to pontificate before her not at all so well as you think mrs flynt we experts can see what even the breeder cant keep her upon corn and peasgive her just soft stuff and he vaulted not ungracefully to jinnys side thank you sir said martha impressed have you paid him she inquired of caleb in a formidable whisper dednt oi say oid pay him for nawthen he answered still more audibly well take off your hat for goodbye but oi aint inside said the obstinate if confused caleb jinny cracked her whip fiercely and methusalem joyously turned his nose for home good night jinny thankee for reading cousin carolines letter caleb called after the receding vehicle xi it was symptomatic of jinnys new mood that she scarcely noticed that mr skindle now shared her sacking her mind was wandering again over the ground covered by the sundayschool wagon and certain birds eggs losing their later cloud of guiltiness lay suffused with childhoods holy light methusalem went unguided through quiet ways the large low moon a pink clowns face peered through leafless elms and gradually grew golden to the right of the winding road rooks cawed persistently and once a small flight flew towards the cart to the left more melodious birds whistled slow high notes or thrilled and gurgled plaintively or scurried off startled as the cart passed one kept on crying quick quick quick with a metallic sound as of shears snipping the grass but methusalem was not to be hurried there was time to admire wherever a thatched cottage made a picturesque point or a pond mirrored the dying sunset time to savour the subtle balm where hayricks stood at the far margin of fields sometimes a little pig would run round terrified and finally squeeze itself under the fence or a big gander would stand and hiss sometimes the road narrowed to a gothic nave but for the most part there was nothing but a fardiffused sense of keen air and great flat spaces the dark blue circle of sky with rolling white clouds the large green fields with their distant border of thin trees a view unclosed and unbounded save by the horizon though impalpably veiling itself as they journeyed elijah skindles mood had changed no less than jinnys though he now sat in the coveted proximity to her and could propose to her profile instead of her napeand her bonnet was of the narrowflanked pattern condemned by the more prudish of her sex that left the profile visiblehe was subtly conscious that he was really farther from her than before even when the delivery of the few remaining parcels necessitated a slight thawing on jinnys part the whole spirit seemed to have gone out of the adventure it was grown tasteless as a thricewarmed dish the very horn had lost its thrill even if he found a vehicle at the king of prussia he was thinking it would be an expensive trip they might charge him all calebs halfcrown he found himself morbidly counting the coils of cordthere were five in all he made out and when the rooks he called crows sailed towards him they gave a still more sable hue to his thoughts he counted them too remembering how his peasant mothernow installed as his womanofallworkused to curtsy to a solitary magpie and the rhyme she taught him about the crows ones unlucky two lucky three is health four is wealth five is sickness and six is death odd that matrimony was not mentioned unless it was included in two there were certainly five crows he thought dismallya sinister coincidence with the coils of cord then cheering up he interpreted the omened sickness as that of the local livestock a sickness greater than jorrow could cope with and he reflected that after all jinnys was a hard and toilsome life and her frigidity was perhaps due to its never occurring to her that he was willing to raise her to his status perhaps she thought he was just itching to take liberties well he could understand her coyness other men might indeed exploit such a chance but he he assured himself again was a gentleman thats a slow couple he said boldly breaking the long silence seems to me they fly as fast as the other rooks said jinny i mean the flynts he said oh said jinny there was resentment in her tone she had not liked his calling caleb uncle understanding well the urban contempt that lurked in declaring oneself a rustics nephew and feeling too that however slow in the uptake caleb might be his wealth of homely crafts knacks instincts lifewisdom and natureknowledge gave him a richer and deeper quality than this pert townsman but elijah persisted in his urban appraisal no go in them dear old turtles sighed jinny but so long as they go at the same pace ah he said eagerly you believe in like to like well fancy a turtle married to a hare but a pair of hares now he seized his opportunity you and me eh speak for yourself mrbunny im paying you a compliment jinny classing you with me for smartness there isnt a girl from bradmarsh to chipstone that can hold a candle to you so thats why seeing a man must marry somebody sometime and looking around as becomes a man whos getting a bita bit bald prompted jinny blandly and what does that matter he said too intent now to be fobbed off by raillery the point is that with the practice and position im getting now it would be a good lift for you i thought i was giving you a lift said jinny icily so you wereso you arein that sense but i didnt need even that my nag wasnt really lame i only made an excuse to talk this over see a very lame excuse flashed jinny there was never any way of talking to youyou always so busy with parcels and me with patients im not one of your flirting kind with fancy waistcoats i want to settle down and ive taken a favour to you even jinnys ready tongue had no repartee to this massive complacency she could only articulate have you now yes i have and id like to see you driving of a sunday in my smart trap come what do you say thank you she said coldly id rather stay in my old cart but its such a shameyou so spruce and sprytied to this ramshackle cart when you might be adorning a higher sphere and sitting in my parlour instead of being at everybodys beck and call he had chosen precisely the worst form of appeal confronted with this picture of parlourstodginess her rle of jinny the carrierjinny the pet and friendinneed of the countrysideseemed infinitely dear and desirable and what subtly added to her anger was some dim presentiment in herself of other forces coming into her life forces threatening to emerge from their picturepast and to trouble the placid current of her career like caleb she shrank from change to shuttle for ever twixt bradmarsh and chipstone with her grandfather nip methusalem all immortal and unchanging as herselfthis was all she asked of heaven this and not too much rain and wind you want me to sit in your parlour she cried in white revolt he took off his cap and bowed gallantly in silks and satins then suddenly realizing his baldness he clapped it on again and give up my work there was an ominous light in jinnys eyes but love is blind even the bats now beginning to swoop in the dusk could see more clearly than elijah i promise you you shant do a stroke said the fatuous young man as the wife of a veterinary surgeon youd be a lady and what would become of granfer hed have warm corduroys and plenty of gruel in the chipstone poorhouse you heartless knacker get off my cart whoa methusalem whoa how you fly at a man ive already got my mother living with me and she and your grandfather wouldnt get on being of a different class but id be willing to pay his rent and get a woman to look after him nobody shall look after him but me and his businesswho is to look after that dont worry some other carrierll crop up there isnt going to be any other carrier here but daniel quarles understand that well if you think youll find anybody to marry your grandfather he said sullenly who wants to marry i shall never give up the road if youre so fond of driving theres always my trap no good setting traps for me ill hang in a cage in no mans parlour i must fly about in the woods like nowfree birds in the woods are sometimes hungry her wooer reminded her suppose your business falls offor things go to famine prices like five or six years ago the gallon loaf aint always a shilling ten years ago i remember flour was two and ten the stone and that only seconds and tea was five shillings with me youd be sure of the fat of the land alwaystheres no difference with me twixt sundays and weekdays oh its a stuffed bird you want for your parlour rubbish ive got six stuffed birds in my parlourin the loveliest glass cases but they dont sing and jinny burst mockingly into a song that had hitherto been a mere tune to her ill be no submissive wife no not i he lost his temper oh you neednt make such a fuss over yourself i dare say i can find plenty of wiveswith my connexion among pigs she said sweetly she jumped down and began to light the lamp this is your gettingout place its nothing of the sorti go on to the bridge impossible my horse is lame i know all about that and snatching up the reins she had dropped geeup he called suddenly but methusalem knew better youll never get home that way said jinny smiling then how the hell he began furiously shankss mare she reminded him again thats not lame he gave her a long nasty look as though meditating the law of the stronger but he tried pleading first by the time i walk home my motherll have locked up thinking im sitting up with a patient theres the poorhouse he winced youve got to carry me he said sullenly or ill have the law on you theres no law to make me carry aught save goods and she sang on carelessly should a humdrum husband say that at home i ought to stay the little voice rippling through those demure lips wellnigh stung him to close her mouth with the masterful gag of kisses but a remnant of sanity warned him not to spoil a fine animal practice by a scandal besides jinny had her whip and what was still more formidable her horn ill be even with you for this and jumping down he strode off furiously hullo mr skindle hullo keep away from me it was at once an appeal and a warning dont you want your case of instruments not that youll be in time to kill those poor horses tonight with an unsmothered oath he turned back and clambered into the interior upsetting nips basket in his fury the result of which neglect to let sleeping dogs lie was that the unsagacious animal mounted growling guard over the instrumentcase as before a burglar youd best get it for me he said sullenly and by the way how much do i owe you never mind she said blandly handing him his burden you promised to be even with me the little vixen he thought as he trudged towards a farm where he remembered doctoring a horse she ought to be put in the duckingpond what a lucky escape chapter iii jinny at her homes i remember the black wharves and the slips and the seatides tossing free and spanish sailors with bearded lips and the beauty and mystery of the ships and the magic of the sea longfellow my lost youth i blackwater hall the home of daniel quarles and his granddaughter was none of your old manorhouses with mullioned windows and carven musicgalleries fallen in grandeur and rent it had barely done yeomans service being just a low whitewashed and thatched cottage whose upper windows under the overhanging eaves seemed deepset eyes under jutting brows nor was it near the blackwater though from its comparatively high ground the broadening river first began to glimmer on the view when you came to the edge of bradmarsh common and looked across its brown expanse towards the bluish haze of the background it was in reality nearer the brad which as seen foreshortened from it seemed to lave the roof of frog farm and sentinel it with its willows blackwater hall should in factjinny would jesthave been called common cottage for it was just a way of living on the common protected from the elements yet sucked up into them a sort of transparent transpirable shell amid this universal flying fluttering hopping creeping crawling soaring swooping scampering twisting droning humming buzzing barking chirping croaking cawing and singing a human nest niched on the edge of a chaos of twigs roots old amorphous trunks tangled faded fernbranches mossy patches gorse ferruginousleaved oaks shrubs antheaps innumerable rabbitwarrens wild apple wild plum black heather and endless stubs to catch the feet or branches to whip the face or thorns to prick the fingers a garden path to the hall lay between homely flowers periwinkle and marigold and the like behind the hall lay the quarles estate of an acre and a lug or two with its poultryrun its tethered goats its vegetables its clotheslines its thatched stables its odd sheds and little barn and its well if daniel quarles was not nidnodding over his big bible or on the bench in the front porch or pruning the vine over the kitchen door or exercising his lopping and topping rights on the common it was here the nonagenarian was to be found pottering planting hoeing watering or weeding he would usually groom methusalem of a morningit was his way of asserting his hold over the businessand on tuesday and friday evenings when the wayworn jinny drove up along the grassy path twixt cottage and common rutted only from her own wheels he would generally rub down methusalem after high tea otherwise the multiform labour of house and land of cooking and breadbaking and goatmilking and scrubbing and washing all fell upon the little carrier and even the work the gaffer did was far outbalanced by the work he made and yet it was daniels personality not jinnys that was impressed on the house even as his name remained on the cart her own exiguous claim upon life combined with piety and affection to leave everything as she had found it when he brought her here not only in the big attic where eight had once huddled and which he now occupied in solitary state sadly conscious of the great snoreless silences but in both the groundfloor rooms over which it stretched the one with the window was the livingroom and the otheron which the front door opened and where a dutch clock with hanging weights greeted the visitor with a cheery tick that relieved its deadnesswas piled pellmell with old cypress chests and otherlitter of the progeny he had outlived as well as with a few boxes or parcels left by neighbouring clients or as yet undelivered to them these two rooms communicating the boxroom served both as a business office and a passage to the livingroom from the rear of which you ascended by a door the wriggling staircase to the patriarchs big bedroom or tumbled down two steps from another doorway to a combination of kitchen larder woodcellar and scullery lit up and aired by one small swinging pane a den which even jinny could not keep free of cobwebs and smells here was the gaffers beerbarrel and the thumbhole tray painted with tigers on which she brought in his morning draught from it here also were the jug and basin of her toilette for bedroom jinny had none the need of disturbing the ancient chests or the officewhich would have been a sad blow to her grandfatherbeing avoided through the fortunate talent of the chest of drawers in the livingroom for turning into a bed its drawers in which the bedding was concealed would come out and hook on to one another while legs would swivel out from beneath them it was not gaythis roomofallworkdespite its overpopulation of china shepherdesses with their swains and hounds and its rank growth of dried grass in vasesall doubled and distorted by the cracked fustily gilt mirror on the mantelpiecefor the oaken beams of the ceiling from which hung a gigantic rusty key had been plastered over and the wallsin a similar quest of gentilitydulled with a grey paper sedulously rematched when it fell to pieces far livelier was the staircase paperall hearts and rosesif only you could have seen it in the dusky windings and under the menacing bulge of the plaster ceiling apart from the shepherdesses and vases among which jinny was not sorry to see a growing mortality as the gaffer fumbled for his spectacles the room was not overfurnished a small carved wooden settle by the cavernous hearth a small square central table without flaps two squat and cushioned armchairs with one prim wooden chair and a little lamp with a monstrous fat globe constituting almost the minimum of necessaries even their united libraries the gaffers family bible and jinnys peculiar hymnbook and universal spellingbook being constrained to repose like the shepherdesses on top of the chest of drawersthat shifty piece of furniture whose mysterious recesses secreted also the hymnbook recovered from the bushes that article of bigotry and virtue hurled from him by the angry boy laylongforgottenin the top drawer behind the rolledup wire mattress that uncoiled by a spring yet this shabby room with its drab paper and squat furniturevivified most of the year only by that tireless tick of the dutch clock from the office or the purring of the kettle from the kitchenmade for jinny the holy conception of home the very cracks in the mirror had become second nature a glass that looked one squarely in the face would have put her eye out and if in an utterly impossible moment the gaffer had considerately replaced the old one the tresses she tamed into seemliness by it would have been a sorry sight here without books or friends mere living was a happiness especially at night after granfer whose big bible invariably turned from a tablebook into a pillow had woke up and remarked he was getting sleepy and been steered up the corkscrew staircase to his bed then in a silence broken by no human soundsave the snoring of the gaffer from aboveand in a security symbolized by the unlocked gates and doors jinny would sit in delicious relaxation with her sewing or knitting or bonnettrimming finding compensation for the long laborious day listening in summer to the late singing birds or gazing in winter at the glowing logs with their delicate flicker of blue while nip in his virtuous basket snored in harmony with the gaffer or uttered joyous yells in his dreamhunting in those hours jinny demanded nothing of man or god though when she had produced her bed like a conjurer out of its mahogany recesses prayers came automatically to the sleepy little figure kneeling beside it with the dark hair flowing over the white shoulders that was a pretty sight but only the cracked mirror saw it ii yet back deep back in jinnys baby consciousness lay another home altogether a home richer in comfort and love giving not on a tumbling common but on a strange flat watersidewith stately dreamships in swelling white and black barges and little boats with ochre or orange sails and a pervading savour of salt and mud the real blackwater hall she felt dimly though its name escaped her in this overlaid life there was a filmy female figure that fed and bathed and rocked one and kissed the place one had banged and sometimes held one as passionately as if against some monster that was trying to tear ones face from that flowersoft cheek it could scarcely be that burly figure spasmodically appearing and disappearing for that too was kind in its different way and had a knee less cumbered by clothes across which one could ride astride and pullable hair on its face and curling smoke issuing from its mouth more profusely than from the kettles out of this general background like mountains from a plain stood out a few episodes of peculiar vividness but of no apparent significancein one she sat on a rough seawall playing with innumerable tiny white shells while a bird hovered over her crying as if trying to induce her to follow it seaward but before she could do so the female figure had appeared frantically scolding and caressing and had carried her struggling and kicking back to a cot in another she was carried by the burly being to a little room with a strange little bulbous window and a queer smell where she was kissed by an elderly figure with a cocked hat and a fixed eye that had a strange affinity to the window later she seemed to be living in the strange building that held this room it had a canvas roof a flag at one end and a mast with ropes at the other yet puzzlingly was not a ship for she saw herself running down the stairs to pat methusalem in the road but these shadowy and usually submerged images all leapt into renewed vitality one delectable wednesday when clad in a new black dress hurriedly stitched together by miss gentry she divided the drivingboard with her grandfather looking odd in his white funeral smock beside her blackness while methusalem equally refreshed and exhilarated by the novel roads almost hurried them by squaretowered hamlets and dear little bridges spanning crawling streams to the quaint cemetery where the old mans sister was to lie how nip would have loved the expedition she thought in after days but he had not yet adopted her it was on this trip that she began to hear things that solidified the filmy figuresbut it was only from the gaffers spasms of imprecation tailing off into anecdote that she was able in the course of years to piece together her parental history boldero she learnt incidentally was her real name not quarles a correction that mattered less since nobody had ever called her anything but jinny she gathered that the gaffer had purposely neglected to perpetuate her fathers name he was cancelled and annulled roger boldero she came gradually to understand was one of those superior souls of uncertain status who having got command of a little sailing vessel were wafted joyously to and fro exchanging the silks and spirits of france and the tobacco of holland for the coins of england without any regard for the benighted principles handicapping human intercourse by taxation although her father finally came to own the cargoes he ran he was at first the mere carrier for speculative capitalists under cover moreover of an honest freight of nondutiable articles carrying was thus in jinnys blood both by land and sea and it is no marvel she made a success of it but the conjuncture of the two bloods came by the queerest of accidents the tommy devilthe fearsome name of roger bolderos boat was only the essex name for the swift that flew gigantically in gay wood over its cutwaterbeing caught one night in a sudden gale at a season of high tides found herself driven towards a lee shore of her native county it was a perilous situation and rather than be dashed on the beach broadside on skipper boldero put his helm up and daringly essayed to land nose first on the mud but the lugger whose lightness was so admirable against the kings cutters and which had been still further lightened of her ankers of brandy and stone bottles of schiedamthese through an interruption by the blockade men waiting to be called for in certain fleets and ditches farther along the coastcould not keep her head against the veering welter with desperate resourcefulness boldero improvised a drogue by lashing spars and a spare sail to a rope and trailing it at the stern and thus steadied before the wind the tommy devil escaped broaching to and despite the following sea that tilted her figurehead into the depths she was finally dumped high and wet on the beach on the very verge of the seawallboth uninjured it was a fine piece of seamanship though aided by the rare steepness of this bit of beach and the high water and the storm beginning to abate and the water to recede the sails were lowered and the skipper and crew turned thankfully in they were not wanting in mencarrying of this kind needed large and ableminded crewsyet all hands being worn out by hours of battling with wind and wavedilvered as old daniel put ita watch was deemed superfluous for a vessel no longer at sea and the tommy devil reposed from stem to stern with all the soundness of conscious virtue watched over by providence now it happened that lieutenant dap commander of his majestys revenue cutter then prowling in the offing in quest of gintubshe had been pressed as a youth served under nelson and had exchanged to the preventive service when he married that rustic beauty susannah quarles sister of danielwas returning with a lantern at the first peep of dawn to the leather bottel to knock up his boats crew his anxious day in brandy hole creekas everybody called the little placehad ended happily susannahs seventh baby had been safely and punctually launchedand the proud and prolific father was anxious to be back sweeping up the prizes that led to preferment it being a high occasion and to impress mrs daps neighbours he had come ashore in a cocked hat and he felt almost knocked into one when he beheld towering over the seawall the great masts of a vessel that loomed gigantic in that place and light he rubbed his one eyethe other he had lost in his original struggle against the pressgangbut the mysterious jetsam remained and a closer inspection showed it the kind of longish craft whose huge lugsails his clumsier manowar could rarely overtake despite his square sail yards but boldly as befitted a man with a nelsonic eye and without waiting even to summon his men he hailed the stranded stranger no reply nor did even a shower of such small stones as the muddy beach afforded have any effect on the uncanny bark there was nothing left but to board herwhich the hero achieved singlehanded clambering over the sagging bulwark and standing alone on the slanting deck roger boldero aroused to find himself challenged by the cocked hat and stony eye of the law displayed though blinking at the lantern as great a sangfroid as in the presence of the elements there was in fact far less danger of the forbidden articles only lace was left on board and lace has been designed by the said watchful providence to occupy small space and be easily invisible a wink to his second in command and two of the crew who were in excess of the legal number for that small tonnage smuggled themselves overboardhere being one of the advantages of terra firma the few odd kegs flagons and cigarboxes were the ships own stores boldero maintained and he would be very glad if the commodore would join him in sampling them now softened by the title the bold dap nevertheless declined the vessel was his prize he declared and what is to prevent us taking you as our prize asked roger blandly having by now discovered that dap was alone you cant move an inch said dap but we shall float off as soon as the tide rises precisely but it wont come as high again not till the next spring tide meanwhiles ive a gigs crew ashore and a cutter within gunshot boldero was taken aback he realized that he wasin nautical parlanceneaped what a miserable misadventure what a reward for his seamanship but masking his consternation he rejoined with a smile then you cant take your prize in tow either he proceeded to point out laughingly that there was no question of capture on either side that there was not a tittle of evidence against him that he was an honest trader as his manifest and cargo would showand that even if his majesty through his admirable if overzealous representative insisted on taxing his own little modicum of alcohol and tobacco it had not been technically landed the nice point whether a cargo which lands inside its ship instead of outside can be said to have landed sidetracked the question of the status of the ship herself and entailed so great a consumption of the cheroots and liquordespite the unearthly hourthat their fiscal value must have been considerably reduced but the obdurate dap still insisting they were dutiable roger boldero invited him to seal them up till he sailed as he had certainly no intention of landing them here he pointed out however that though the tide like time waited for no man he would have to wait for the tide and that during this disagreeable interval the hope of again offering the commodore the cordial if lopsided hospitality of his cabin must disappear if the fomenters of friendship were put in bond even this argument might have shattered itself against daps fuddled sense of duty had not the twice aforesaid providence now sent on board a rival cocked hat with a feather salient with the growing light the local excisemanof the shoregoing branch of the servicehad likewise discovered the strange quarry but the gleam in the hunters eye died when lieutenant dap introduced him to his friend boldero who was celebrating with him the birth of his seventh baby and whose society for the next month would he was sure add to the amenities of life in brandy hole creek and my friend boldero did not fail to become it for lieutenant daps cruising was confined to the waters on whose border he had built his nest and he was frequently hove to and during those tedious four weeks made still more tedious by rain boldero had himself rowed out more than once to the channel groper whose black hull copious white boats formidable guns and flamingflannelled redcapped crew were plainly visible from the beached lugger and he moved genially among the bluetrousered tars and did full justice to the lieutenants gintoddy and had his fingers often in the lieutenants snuffbox and lent a sympathetic ear to his methods and devices against those rascally smugglers with their manuvre of rowing dead to windward their spiritcasks were slung with ropes the lieutenant explained so that their confederates on shore could load them easily on their horses but only the other night the blockademen had discomfited a formidable shoregang of fifty who despite their stout ashpoles had been unable to carry off anything except their wounded he would have caught the lugger too had she not kept doubling the commander of the amphibious tommy devil even shared in an exciting if unsuccessful chase after a suspicious landingparty going out with a galleycrew in a rainstorm in a borrowed tarpaulin petticoat and once the oneeyed herowho felt himself none the less a nelson because his eye had been lost in resisting entry into the navyreturned roger bolderos visit and after broaching sundry of the happily unsealed kegs the two skippers repaired arm in armthe attitude was necessaryto see the seventh baby and present the fond mother with material for a lace cap now while daniel quarless sister had been lying as helpless as the lugger his last unmarried daughter emma a beauty still more engaging was housekeeping for aunt susannah and minding the other four children two were dead she had come in daniel quarless cart and her father was to fetch her again as soon as susannah was up or down he should already have come for her but the rains had made such glue of the roads that a queerly spelt letter came instead saying he would wait till they hardened this delay brief as it was sufficed to bring the neaped mariner under the spell of the landlocked village maid so sweet to look on so serviceable about a house and so motherly with a baby that the novel thought of matrimony was popped into a rovers head she for her part was still more swiftly subjugated by the jolly roger and the tommy devil and the mutual confession was precipitated by the opposite menaces of tide and cart each threatening to bear them apart it was a race between these and the course of true love which must flow rapid to flow at all but it did not flow smooth for when daniel quarles arrived to convey his daughter home and found a rival vehicle waiting uncouthly on the beach to bear her off he roundly damned the furriner who aspired to be his soninlaw and he included in his maledictions the preventive service and all its works especially the new baby not to mention the times and the tides for though he had long ago found grace and become a wesleyan he had embraced the new doctrine with the old robustiousness the natural man was no more to be mitigated than a hedgehog had he become a quaker he would have turned the other cheek in a violent collision with the strikers jaw he enjoyed being angry and that his wrath was righteous only added to its zest and righteous it now was the trouble was not that captain boldero was a churchman the fellow was flippantly ready to embrace anything on earth that included emma it was not even that daniel suspicioned him a smuggler smugglingeven if you had a brotherinlaw in the governmentwas quite as respectable as poaching and in days when the rural labourer could not have lived had he not eked out his obolus by occasional rabbits with the necessary vegetables only an obtuse squirearchy could hold that sinful but even the squire had no opprobrium for the smuggler gentry and peasantry were at one in backing up the manly patriot who thwarted a wicked government supplied britons with the cup that cheers and their country with a fine naval reserve and early information of froggys movements the shores of essex as of all britain were honeycombedapart from their large natural resources and their ruins and haunted houseswith artificial hidingplaces cellars vaults and secret passages and every mans hand was against the ishmael of the customs house farmers left their gates open at night to facilitate the cavalcades and coachesandsix and were but little surprised to find tea or tobacco coming up overnight on their fields like mushrooms even parsons were disposed to regard such treasures as drifted their way as heavensent flotsam and government circles themselvesin that era of purchasable votes and votable purchaseshad not the ethical toploftiness which characterizes all governments today no it was not boldero the smuggler but boldero the smoker that found himself hurled into outer darkness the day poor shrinking emma was borne off in her fathers cart no puffing pirate shall cross my threshold swore daniel but the accent was on the puffing not the pirate for tobacco had become tabu in the wesleyan ranks the godless practice of smoking was formally forbidden to the ministers swiss protestantism indeed had once included its prohibition in the ten commandments if methodism did not thus reedit the decalogue its horror of the abomination was no less keen and a change of practice being always easier than a change of heart daniel quarles had poured a deal of spiritual energy into the sacrifice of his pipe the rapscallion boldero he declared not only sinned himself but was the cause of sin in others trafficking as he did in the unholy weed if emma insisted on a smoker wasnt there the miller at long bradmarsh he inquired with grim facetiousness meaning that the grotesque griggs had a vote by living in a house with a chimney but emma for all her gentle airs had proved obstropolus she had discovered that susannahs husband smoked as prodigally as rogerthough it had been hidden from the old man on his rare visitsand that so far from bedevilling men tobacco tended to angelicize them would indeed that her father haloed himself with these clouds besides she shrewdly suspected that even a wesleyan archangel appearing suddenly as a suitor would have fared similarly and that the smoke was only a cover for a wish to keep his last girl and so though the lover was left lamenting and the tommy devil duly floated off without the lass it was not long that emma was left stranded in blackwater hall with a parent removed by providence every tuesday and friday even the flabbiest female may be stiffened and the end was smuggled matrimony though very soon the blessing of a minister brought methodism into their madness roger boldero not only became a wesleyan like his wife and her father but was one of the first dissenters to be married in their own chapel by their own clergy under the new act the odd union had turned out happy but with one dismal drawbackthe bolderos could not rear children they fared worse even than the bidlakes and with no such obvious reason one hapless infant after another died and when at last in their late middle years little jinny was safely steered through three winters it was they who were taken as if in lieu of their progeny the pair had finally settled down by the same waterside that had united themthe attractions of brandy hole creek having been enhanced by the perpetual presence of their relative by marriage commander dap who with the subsidence of spirit duties and smuggling had found his mobile cutter replaced by the moored watch vessel here with susannah and his children and five satellites and their wives and families the veteran lived in domestic beatitude under the title of chief coast guard officer high on the beach and boarded by a commodious staircase the houseboat seemed a standing reminder of the adventure of the tommy devil under its challenging eye that adventurous bark had sailed out and home till that last fatal voyage when the lugger foundered almost within sight of a little sussex port which for weeks after was mysteriously littered with washedup tobaccobales though roger boldero was rescued it had been the beginning of the end of his prosperity already undermined by the diminution of duties and a few years later both he and emma were dead simultaneously of smallpox again the carriers cart must fare to the creek to fetch the penniless little orphan and theresoon after will flynts flightdaniel brought her back for the burial of his sister susannah it was what buried wills memory too and replaced him in her prayers by a new being conceived as her angel mother iii the moment she saw and smelt the creek she knew she had carried it in her soul all along the white hut with its flagged mast the great watch vessel the tumble of cottages sheds barrels pecking fowls grubbing black pigs recumbent ladders discoloured boats with their keels upwards black rotting barges and rigged smacks stranded on hard steep mud the sea came in sluggishly through a broad green chine half slime half green water spitted with gaunt encrusted poles to mark the channel the water seemed even wider than she remembered and yet not so wide for it was split by an island or a promontory that gave a second saildotted expanse between her and the farther shore she yearned now towards that ultimate hump of hazy woodland and it was to remain for ever bathed in the quiet beauty which wrapped it around as methusalem toiled up to the leather bottel they were to stay the night there for daniel would have none of the commanders hospitality he being still unforgiven besides the child might be afraid of the corpse it was while sitting on that seawall with the octogenarian that evening her great grownup fingers toying once again with tiny white shells that strewed its top and pewits again trying to lead her from their young that she first heard in broken outlines how these waters had washed her into being something too she gleaned from her refound relativeinlaw the chief mourner whose cocked hat tattooed arm and genial senescencenot to mention his houseboatwere one of the pleasantest impressions or reimpressions of the funeral and whose fascinating trick of rolling one eye while the other was fixed in a glassy stare almost made the child lose the sense of what he was saying the death of his wife had reminded the veteran of the death of nelsonnearly forty years beforeand his tremulous tones grew still shakier as he recalled how the flags over the hut and the watch vessel and every other flag in england had flown at halfmast though of course there were more joyous aspects of trafalgar to be celebrated in bottles of bonys own brandy he frankly admitted he had himself been three sheets in the windan image of bedlinen fluttering on a clothesline that long puzzled her he took her abaft the watch vesselit was a way of leaving daniel quarles alone with his dead sisterand recounted his astonishment at seeing her fathers boat spued up like jonah out of the whale a handsome man he told her to her pleasure but he spoilt it all by adding though he would talk the hind leg off a dog but wasnt that cruel the little girl faltered dap laughed he never did it really dearie and if the leg had come off hed have helped the lame dog over a stile and so many lingosparleyvooing in french and swearing in double dutch i dont wonder your angel mother fell in love with him my angel mother echoed jinny excitedly was my mother an angel the veteran was taken aback for a child who must be past nine such primitiveness was startling he had spoken loosely hardly knowing whether he alluded to emmas present heavenly abode or to her sweettemperedness on earth he did not know that little jinny read nothing but literature in which angels were a common feature of the landscape and that miss gentry had not measured her for her blacks without dwelling on her own stainedglass specimen she was as pretty as one said the commander after an instant and now she is one thus it was that jinnys mother already felt as a hovering sweetness took on definite wings and even when jinnys maturer experience amputated them from her earthly existence they were what she still hovered over her child with susannah and shell make a pair now he added feeling suddenly disloyal to the corpse at home susannah queried jinny for her grandfather had been calling his sister pegspoor pegs your mothers aunt it was a new idea an angels aunt she saw the twain flying susannah sailing with more sweeping pinions her mother softly rustling the funeral was in style and jinny helped to set out the refreshments in the saloon there was some dispute as to whether her grandfather could join the grand procession in his tiltcart but though he urged that squires were proud to be buried from farmwagons he consented to ridelike a fish out of waterinside a mourningcoach and not even on the box the commander and jinny shared his dismal grandeur she sitting bodkin though there was an empty seat opposite which the seventh baby had been expected to occupy but toby had not arrived from his shiphe was a gunnerin time and the earlier progeny were still more scattered the widower held his handkerchief in his fist but owing to the heat of a discussion on the manner the navy had gone to the dogsor returned from themsince the admiralty had set up a gunnery school on a portsmouth ship he used it only to mop his brow excellent indeed he was mocking at the ships name the ruination of the sarvice i tell you it all comes from doing away with the pressgangstands to reason they picked out the finest chaps here the gaffer snortedoh you may sniff but for fighting you want guts and muscle look what england was in them days and what she is coming to now to my lookinatitanthinkinottoothe gaffer made one breathless word of ittis a blessin to be riddy of all them gaolbirds swearers drinkers smokers and fornicators hush the commander tried to wink his glass eye towards jinny she dont understand oi remember the year my goodfornawthen gabriel smashed up a threshinmachine and the poor farmer dednt git no compensation neither though ef his furniture had been smashed twould have come on the hundred that wery same year ebenezer wagstafffor twas the coronation year of king william oi remember just afore my emma desarted me that was a sailor king interrupted dap half to stave off fulminations against jinnys dead mother began as middy under capn digby in the unlucky royal georgea ninetyeight gun ship she was ye put me off the track drat ye aldoe it leads back to ebenezer wagstaff all the same seein as the prince might ha rubbed showlders with a thief as was sentenced for stealin halfasuvran from a barge on the brad he could ha been hanged for it in them days mind youthe case bein as clear as day or rather as black as night but they marcifully brought him in guilty to stealin nine and levenpence and that saved his neck being a navigable river and the judge give him the option of gaol or jinin the navy and a proper thing too set a thief to catch a frenchy and him used to taking prizes by water nowadays before the captain hoists his pennant hes got a crew dumped on him thats no choice of hismealymouthed lubbers full of booklarnin who dont know a brigantine from a topsail schooner its the red ensign that gets all the good stuff not the white you mark me itll be the downfall of england englandll never fall down while shes got godfearin congregations maintained daniel quarles and jinnys devout little heart thrilled to hear it in the pleasant sunny graveyard there were apiaries and a dismantled tower almost smothered by blackberrybushes and the tombs and gravestones passed imperceptibly into a garden of monkeytrees and weeping willows these wrought in her no stirring of memories but as she had got off the coach the standing church tower square and ivywrapped had composed beautifully with ricks of all sorts with trees old tiles and thatch into a picture that seemed as much hers as the waterside the parsonsusannah had remained a churchwomanwas some minutes late and jinny was gratified to note how strong her grandfather was how pillarlike he stood in his long black mourners cloak under the weight of the coffin at the churchyard gate while all the other bearers his obvious juniors shifted and sweated nor did he blubber either like the commander whose weakness considering how often she had been adjured to be spunky and notnow that she was grown upto cry was as disconcerting as the double existence of his wife in the coffin and the empyrean however dap grew good again when the thrilling if still more disconcerting episode of lowering his susannah as far as possible from the skies and banking her safely against ascent was over anddaniel quarles having gone vaguely roving over the churchyardthe widower led her stealthily in his absence to a stone behind the ruined towerin the unconsecrated or dissenting areaand read to her the inscription following it for her confirmation with his blackgloved forefinger here lies roger boldero after many stormy voyages safely neaped in christ he arrested himself suddenly and whisked her round the tower but we didnt read it all she protested oh it only says and also emma boldero wife of the above but dont tell your grandfather the child wondered why she was to keep emmas relationship to the above a secretshe had already gathered from her grandfather that he knew itand she was distressed as well as puzzled at the strange quarrel that broke out in the homeward coach it aint at all a proper word said daniel quarles you might as well put carted to christ on mine thatll be your affair persisted the widower but this aint and how you came to see it gets over me the gaffer flushed uneasily oive got two eyes i suppose he jerked the naval veteran glared glassily them that pay the piper call the tune he retorted defensively besides he added more gently emma always said shed have it somehow on her tombstone emma was a silly hush dap again indicated the child with his glassy eye now trickling without the other as in halfmourning oi wont hush it up thats got to goo the masons got to cut another for me who arxed you to pay pipers such a handsome stone to be torn up its a desecration its unlawful unlawful whose darter is she mine or yourn not yours you cut her off she cut me off and ef poor pegs and you had done your duty by my gal hed ha never crossed your doorstep hed ha met her on the seawall i couldnt help his beholding her looks any more than you could help having a handsome daughteror for the matter of that a handsome sister his handkerchief came out again oim not denying their looksa man with half an eye could see that tis just the handsome gals as seems to throw theirselves away he added musingly maybe they are unhappy at home suggested the widower with equal philosophic aloofness or in the housen they stays at assented the gaffer but let bygones by bygones it may be the lord dumped him down for our good all oi say is that words got to goo a churchman may not see the blasphemy but think o what john wesley would ha said to it hed ha said twas a wicked extravagance to waste such a fine stone the masonll take it back happen therell be another roger boldero dead and neaped some day very likely sneered the veteran and also an emma wife of the above hush the little maid nudged him wondering he should forget his own monition that has more sense than you cried the gaffer in high glee out of the mouths of babes and sucklings and drawing the astonished jinny to his bristly beard he kissed her lips with a hearty smack despite these halfunderstood discords jinny was very sorry to leave the stonyeyed veteran and the motley waterside sometimes she confided to the more sympathetic swivel eye as her grandfather was harnessing methusalem for their return i wish i had never come to earth at all again dap was startled by her simplicityhad not daniel been telling him what a useful little body she was in the business but then youd never have had your grandfatheror me he said stroking her cheek i should have had godand my angel mother iv noa arter she run away with her boldero oid never cross her doorstep never confessed the old carrier picking up the story later as she rode beside him on their days work he was getting so old now that he preferred to talk of twenty rather than of two years before and the veneer of bookeducation which his unexpected inheritance of the business had necessitated had fallen away and he was speaking more and more in the idioms of his illiterate youth curiously tempered at times by the magnificent english of his bible but that was wicked said jinny decisively she felt it wrong indeed that a father should thus cut off his daughter but to have done this when that daughter was an angel even if only in the making still more when that daughter was her own mother seemed to her confused consciousness the climax of iniquity wicked the contrairy oid taken my bible oath never to set foot over her doorstep so oi dednt have no chance you see jinny was silenced she herself had succumbed to an oath and that indeed on a less awful book arter she had lost two childer he went on and the third got measles she sent a man on hossback to beg me to take off the spell thought dye see dearie that for her frowardness and disobedience oid laid a curse on em all like one of our methody preachers the chap seemed with all the texts to his tongues tip and pleaded that wunnerful he most made me believe oi did have the evil eye but though of course oi hadnt no more to do wi the deaths of your little brothers and sisters than a babe unbornor you yourself for the matter o that as was a babe unbornoi couldnt break my oath and goo and pretend to cure the wean and so when the measles turned to pneumonia and it died she got woundily distracted and writ me two sheets sayin as oi was a

again and says shed been layin paralysedlike for a month and wouldnt oi come and forgive her afore she kicked the bucket oh granfer jinny protested oim givin you his words said the gaffer defensively at least that was the meanin though haps he put it different me not havin his gift o the gab but bein never a man to nuss rancour when folks own up oi said that even ef oi could forgive my darter never could oi enter a house harbourin that rascal boldero oh granfer she protested again theres no call to bristle uphe wasnt your father yet but boldero aint at home hes off on a jarney says the

aforeoill take my oath no never before granfer there was a pause of peace jinny was afraid to stir up the subject for weeks but her little brain had been busy with the story and finally taking advantage of a not unfriendly reference to roger boldero she asked and was that the last time you saw father when he was eating lobster with my angel mother in the dead of night nay nay oi seen lots of em both afore oi was shet out agen by molloncholy circumstances ah jinny brightened up and did you always go in by the window twasnt in the house twas on board the tommy devil and that aint got no

nigh once a month then what a pity they didnt invite you on board years before ay twas a pity only none of us ad never thought o that way out or that way in added jinny excitedly why you might have

picked up by the revenue cutter bein the onny toime he was took at seahe he he thussins there wasnt no place to meet in and to goo over emmas windowsill was too risky for pegs and her friends was

in my oath too never shall they cross my doorstep neitheroid sworn it on the book but why didnt they come in through our window theres hardly ever anybody on the common we never thought o that neither he heaved a deeper sigh ay twas a pity he repeated that night jinny caught his eye resting more than once on the vases of dried grass before their casement he was a bonkka man your feyther he observed at last wery bigbuilt and its a middlin weeny window v though jinny winced at her grandfathers attacks on the peculiar faith of her angel mother she grew in time to understand the odd magnanimity he had evinced in letting her go to sundayschool with the flynt family and pick up the doctrine that her one surviving child should be brought up of the sect that had saved it was it transpired poor emmas dying request as conveyed by his sister susannah dap to the unforgiving father whose oath never to cross his daughters doorstep still held when he drew up methusalem at it after the double funeral and found the house empty even of jinny childstealin thats what it is oi told pegs when oi boarded the watch wessel he recounted once to his granddaughter in the cart aint you got enough o your own says oi twas through your havin one too many that jinnys here at all oi says then says she sharp as a needle the more reason shes mine you cut off her mother says she and now daniel jinny cuts you off not so fast sister says oi whatever my conduct to emmaand folks with stone eyes dont allus see through stone wallsthe poor little brat havent enough sense to cut me off and oi dont cut

though oid never clapped eyes on you afore youd never seen me before cried jinny amazed how could oi see youyou came arter the tommy devil was at the bottom and your feyther never got the dubs from the insurance company bein a flaw in the articles as swallered up all the rest of his cash in the lawsuit but youd got his ways and your mothers looksjinny flushed with pleasureand steddy cuttin me off youha ha hamade straight for my great ole beard and pulled out a great ole fistful ought i to have cut it off laughed jinny happily dye see that pegs says oi bloods thicker than water will you come along o your granfer liddle maid says oi and what did i say asked jinny breathlessly you dednt say naughtyou bust into tears bein as you thought oi was the auctioneerer and youd been sold with everything else poor liddle ole orphan and then pegs catches hold o you and says you was clinging to her but oi soon stopped that lobloll for oi holds you over the rail and shows you methusalem all prancin in his pride and wont you go with your granfers hoss liddle maid says oi and what did i say then you dednt say naught but in a twinklin you jumps out o susannahs arms scrambles down the accommodation ladder and was rubbin noses with methusalem and oi count his was as damp as yourn bein as hed come without a stop dear old methusalem and nothing would content jinny but she must jump down and rub noses with him now and again both noses were damp but as methusalem had seized the opportunity to come to a standstill and jinny lost in shadowy memories continued the caress ten seconds too long the old carrier declared with sudden querulousness that he hadnt got time for foolishness and that since he had burdened himself with jinny his business had gone to rack and ruination peculiar pegs warned me oid have to bring you up he added as jinny hastily clambered back to his side and peculiars the word for your gooins on not that methusalems got more sense nor you oi count ef there was churches for cattle hed astoyled hisself brother methusalem and kicked over his drench it was the gaffers instinctive conviction that faith went with the father in thus yielding to emmas dying breath he may apart from the pressure of deathbed wishes have found vent for a lingering resentment against the seductive boldero or was it that he had a lurking apprehension that the one child of emmas which had at least survived prayer might really be a testimony to the teaching and as such entitled to share it jinny at any rate had absolute faith in the doctrine it rested on the fifth chapter of james as clearly as the big bible containing that chapter rested on the chest of drawers once indeed when the gaffer was unbearably mocking she had been goaded to read him the basal verses is any sick among you let him call for the elders of the church and let them pray over him anointing him with oil in the name of the lord and the prayer of faith shall save the sick and the lord shall raise him up and if he have committed sins they shall be forgiven him but the gaffer had not collapsed as she expected it only meant a spiritual saving in case he died daniel quarles maintained unruffled otherwise why speak of his sins being forgiven moreover it didnt say you couldnt have a doctor too crestfallen the child wept in a corner and did not recover her spirits till at sundayschool elder mawhood had supplied her for the first part of the gaffers contention with mark xvi they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover while martha who was still at that date a peculiar comforted and equipped her against the second part with asa king of judah who ii chronicles xvi was diseased in his feet yet sought not to the lord but to the physicians the lords wishes in the matter were thus seen to be clearly indicated and the lords the same now as then isnt he martha wound up crushingly you ask your grandfather that the courage to launch this counterattack never came to her however and henceforward she and her grandfather lived in that kindly toleration of each others folly which comes from holding the proofs of it yet letting sleeping dogmas lie what after all was the old mans obduracy jinny told herself but part of the perverseness and obstinacy of age the fact that she now never needed either doctors or elders saved her from any personal problem such waverings as she had felt at fifteen were not towards wesleyanism but towards marthas mushroom doctrine the texts of this convert to the latest thing in creeds were certainly staggering and her scorn for the still unconverted sublime we dont take some bits o the word and leave others that was an argument not easy to answer and the bits now exhumed in support of christadelphianism by the tireless discoverer of king asa were ever accumulating fortunately jinny was far too busy for religious discussions or doubts and the angel mother softly hovering made a restful background for the one true faith vi and a sensational episode in the history of the local brethren came to strengthen the sect as well as to add to the number of jinnys homes came too at the very crisis when the impossibility of carrying the carrier with her through the coming winter threatened to leave her stranded alone at the black sheep during the midday rest at chipstone it would have been easy enough in summer to sit in her cart in the courtyard munching her bread and cheese while methusalem was lost in his nosebag and clients were coming with commissions but the parcelshed had no stove and to wait in the bar or taproom or even the parlourall alike masculine haunts where one could hardly dump the scarecrow or swainchaser beside onewas not a pleasant prospect jinnys and the brotherhoods good fortune begansuch are the ways of providencewith the death of the landlord mother ganderso everybody called jeff ganders buxom spousehad fought like a lioness to save him not a doctor for miles around as the paralysed old bundock put it triumphantly from his bedofallnews but she carted him over and set em all consulting and quarrelling there was two from london one of em a bart and all wasted charlie the potboy as he was then feelingly told my boy the postman that he could ha set up a publichouse with the fees not that i approve o publichouses but leastways they give you more waluable drinks than doctors does and when poor jeff was gone and mother gander was carrying on like crazy comes the parson and tells her tis the lords will then if its the lords will says she like lightning for she was always quick in the uptake why do you run down the peculiars as just begs the lord to alter his will instead o throwing their hardearned gold to the doctors that was the way her eyes opened to the truth and she learnt how to save her soul as well as her money the peculiars they often lamented were not strong enough in chipstone they looked yearningly over the waterto rochford where the great banyard himself was prophesying or to woodham where no less than five hundred brethren and sisters fevered themselves in a hall too small for the throngs that sought admission but their own meetings though if we may trust caleb noice things were brought out were numerically disheartening the capture of the black sheepa hostelry to which all social roads radiatedwas thus an event of considerable importance nevertheless the dismay of the congregationalists of whose community mother gander was a fallen pillar was not counterpoised in jubilation by the brethren for if a stronghold had been captured the devil had not been dispossessed mother gander doffed her gold chain but sister gander gave no sign of emptying her liquor into the gutters and to be proud of a convert against whose establishment you have to admonish one another is not simple the peculiars managed it however after some heartsearching it was true old bundock had been wont to make great play with banyards declarationuniversally admired as a gem of humourif you want to get me to a publichouse youll have to take a horse and hook me but after all elder mawhood pointed out the black sheep was far more than a publichouse as the headquarters for the mailcoach it was part of the constitution of the country and it was better for the farmers to eat their ordinary under a godfearing roofeven if they would drink with itthan for the profits of their custom to go to a rival house which would contribute no farthing to the brethrens treasury it was brother flynt however who supplied the finest soothingpowder oi used to condemn myself he said but twasnt no good you must drink when youre harvestin dont youll be drippin as you goo if he did not drink now that his harvesting days were over that did not prove other drinkers were wicked you had to consider circumstances and playing the sancho panza still more unexpectedly he hinted that there was such a thing as overzeal they used to call me a banyard as a revilin word them as made fun of us but to tell the truth oive never got out o my warm bed in the middle o the noight to pray as he exhortedleastways not in winter weve got to be thankful for sister gander and not expect her to goo all the way at the start she dont want to lose her business as well as her husband but it appeared that mother gander did not want to go without a husband either she suddenly and before her year of mourning was up married charley mott the aforesaid potboy not half her age and this was a fresh upset for the brethren modified only by the conversion of charley the congregationalists took the opportunity to give the couple rough music and the whole neighbourhood joined in with kettles and pokers brother bundock from his omniscient bed at first proclaimed the scandal as a divine chastisement on his brethren for having failed to admonish her to give up purveying beer and baccahe himself would have dared it he declared without fear of contradiction had he only had his legsbut finally when the storm blew over he would relate with gusto how she had weathered it what with hating us and hating her marriage and hating the new landlord with his jackanips airs they quit her nearly all her customers and them as was faithful looked askance at her between the drinks so she offs with her silks and on with her apron and up with her sleeves and back to the kitchen shed been poor jeffs cook you know in the long long ago and twas her steak and kidney puddens and her gravies and sauces that he married and now she was back at the old game whether twas partly to escape the sour looks that she burrowed in her kitchen or whether the whole thing was female artfulness i dont pretend to say but in two months shed cooked em all back again dont come in good time you couldnt get a chair at the ordinary for all the tips at chipstone and my boy the postman he told me he hears everybody joking over the rhubarb tart and saying as the lords will is best and she never come out o that kitchen till shed cooked it all down it was during the dark interval that jinny and sister mott alias mother gander were first drawn together the girl being summoned to the kitchen to receive instructions for such purchases from local tradesmen as the ladyhermit found indispensable yet dreaded to make in person the fact that the little carrier was of the despised sect cemented the relationship jinny passed her midday respite in the warm kitchen even sharing the cooks meal and when at last sister mott resumed her blue silk bodice and faced her tradesmen and her customers new and old the run of the kitchen and the freedom of the joint remained gratuitous to the lucky jinny here under the great baconhung oak beams of the ancient apartment before a huge fire mirroring itself rosily in the copper pans and skillets she could sit thawing her toes beside the clanking smokejack while the wind howled through the arch of the sleety courtyard chapter iv will on his way permit me of these unknown lands tinquire lands never tilld where thou hast wandering been and all the marvels thou hast heard and seen do tell me something of the miseries felt in climes where travellers freeze and where they melt crabbe tales of the hall i the coach from railhead to chipstone was an hour and a half late and not all the flourish of its horn as it thundered into the courtyard of the black sheep could disguise the fact not that it was the fault of the coach it had waited for the mail train and this for those parts parvenu monster had found an obstruction on the line and was helpless to go round it as the driver and the guard complacently pointed out their glory and their tips were shrunk like their circuitunchanged along the short route they could no longer prod the slumbering traveller with insinuatory farewells they knew themselves these chipstone worthies a last lingering outoftheway survival of the old order doomed like the broad coaching road and the old hostelries to decay already they had seen the horned guard decline in places to the omnibus cad even as the ancient shooter of highwaymen had sunk to the keybugler yet they preserved the grand manner before the revolution that was deposing themthe tom pratt and dick burrage of a generation of travellersand while dispensing their conversation like decorations and drinking your health as a concession they retailed with gloomy satisfaction every railway collision and holocaust as though coaches never overturned and declared the english breed of horses would be ruined and when certain lines set up thirdclass carriages they denounced the cruelty of packing the poor in roofless seatless trucks as though they themselves had never brought into port frostbitten peers or dames sodden through their oilskin umbrellas but today powerful warrum was the grumble of the passengers even of those on the roof the majority beingthus early in maystill smothered in boxcoats as for the unfortunates compressed inside who had likewise not yet cast a clout and had similarly mistrusted the sunshiny spell with which that pouring april had ended they mopped their brows and cursed the fickle british climate but though the sun had suddenly become hot enough to sour milk it could not sour the temper of the bronzed young manhis face nigh as ruddy as his hairwho sat on the boxseat and conversed with tom pratt almost as an equal even the long delay on the line had left him unruffled thanks largely to the blueeyed girl in the train who before his cleanshaven cosmopolitan air had shown signs of tenderness and whose address his purse now heldmore precious than a fiver verily a pleasant change after the eveless backblocks of canada and the idea of calling this warrum he smiled to think of the hells he had knownmontreal with mosquitoes new york in a damp heat why this couldnt even melt a mans collar and how refreshing was the trimness of the essex countrysidethe comfortable air of immemorial cultivationafter the giant untidiness of the new world how soothing these long green whitesprinkled hedgerows with their ancient elms this old historic highway with thatch and tile steeple and tower after the corduroy roads of round logs or the muddy dusty sandy tracks how adorable these creepercovered cottages after logcabins in backwoods rotting floors on rotten sleepers and the mud paste fallen out of the walls he forgot that it was precisely this that he had fled from nearly a decade agothis dead walledin life so petty and pietisticand he congratulated himself afresh on the wisdom of that abrupt resolution to sell his clearing to a secondhand pioneer and to farm at home with the profits his clothes alone would have kept him in good humour not only were the heavier in what he had learned to call his trunk but those on his back were the first he had ever had made to measure and they were made toolike the neckcloth and shawl and fallals he was bringing to his parents from americaby the worldfamous firm of moses son opposite aldgate church whose imposingness was enhanced in his eyes by finding iton the saturday he first hied thitherhaughtily aloof a blank wilderness of shutters in a roaring world with no gleam through their chinks from the seven hundred gasburners but he had finally stormed the private hall toilingas invited by rhymeup the stairs of solid oak and had gained the heights where orders were bespoke and therein that richcarpeted showroom with the giant chandelier in a setting of corinthian columns sculptured panels and arabesque ceilingsdark enchanters with tapemeasures like serpents over their shoulders had made obeisance to him and enfolded him with their coils even his billycock hat verified the bardic boast theres not another hatmart in the town which casts such lustre on the human crown left to himself he would have liked a wideawake but that arbiter elegantiarum the small boy he was warned had not quite acquiesced in that if it was not a coat of many buttons that he now sported it was scrimp enough to show off the fine lines of his figure for the movement towards ample waistcoats and wide trousers was not yet encouraged by his aldgate mentors and pockets on the hips had been conceded him with reluctance in his large american trunk reposed a still grander suit of sunday sable though he had shied at a frock coat and was glad to learn from these hierophants of the mode that morning jackets were no longer confined to the stableyard or the barrackroom but were permissible even in the country houseand there was no question but frog farm was that he had already worn his blacks once on his visit to the great exhibition and they made he found a distinct difference to the policemen in tophats whose guidance he sought in the labyrinths of the metropolis the delay in this visit to the exhibitionthe goal of his journey to londonhad turned out an advantage he felt giving him time for these measured elegancies if he had been unable to be in at the opening as he had grandly designed in canada when ignorant that this involved guineas and seasontickets he had managed to squeeze for a glimpse of the queen outside if not inside the park and the first fiveshilling dayafter all only the fourthwas grandeur enough for a whilom ploughboy and cabinboy although nine tenpound notes made a warm waistcoatlining he was not under the illusion that he had returned with more than a competence one would have thought london itself a greater exhibition to a young man who had never seen it before especially london at carnival with its colossal crowds swollen by visitors from all countries in all complexions and costumes london with its numberless gay buses plying mostly to hyde park its swifter gliding cabriolets of the new pattern invented by mr hansom and the more stolid procession of fourwheeled clarences not to mention the fashionable and civic carriages with the scarletandgold pomp of flunkeys and outriders london with its countless curious streetcriers costermongers balladmongers watercress sellers muffin and hotpie men birdcage dealers tractpeddling lascars in white robes and vendors of everything from cornsalves to speeches on the scaffold blowsy rowdy london that turned into a dreamcity when those strange figures with rods glided through the twilight flecking the long grey streets with points of fire but though will flynt was not insensitive to these fascinating phenomena and even rode about recklessly in the cabriolets at eightpence a mile yet london had not the spell to hold him only the great exhibition had drawn him across the atlantic while awaiting impatiently for the fiveshilling day he duly did the tower and the zoo sixpence extra for mr goulds hummingbirds in the twentyfive glass cases paid twopence to go into st pauls and a shilling to see the great globe in leicester square patronized phelps at sadlers wells and the horses at astleys had a peep at vauxhall enjoyed rush the norwich murderer at madame tussauds and submitted the boots these operations begrimed to the redcoated shoeblacks of the ragged schoolslondons new word in philanthropy but though he liked the quarter in which his quaint galleried hotel the flower pot was situated with the spitalfields market and the tall old houses of the silkweavers whose vast casements with their little panes rose story on story he was no sooner through with the visit to the exhibition than without a days delayas promised in that letter to marthahe took train and coach to little bradmarsh beholding him thus on the county flyer hurrying towards frog farm after only a single visit to the stupendous spectacle one may suspect that he did not know his own heart as well as he imagined but he himself had no doubt of the magnet he obeyed and he had found on his boat not a few rich canadiansand the dominion already boasted four thousand carriagefolkwho confessed to have yielded to the same irresistible attraction there was indeed little else talked of on the voyage even the wonders of the boat itselfa new yankee iron and screw steamer of nearly two thousand tons and quite five hundred horsepower that brought them to liverpool in eleven days from halifax and had spittoons and weddingberths like the yankee riversteamers and to see which the liverpudlians had flocked with their sixpencespaling before the worldmarvel awaiting them in london and london itself was talking of it no less for once london was staggered and if london was thus shaken how much more the provinces and the world at large did not indeed the flags of all nations wave over the great glass building whose mere material would have been enough to set the globe agog even if it had not contained contributions from every corner of civilization except germany which in that antediluvian age figured in the catalogue only as the states of the zollverein what wonder if with all the excursions and alarums and millennial visions that attended its birth the press reeking with paragraphs poems discussions wrangles skits prophecies and forebodings crowds equal to the population of provincial towns gathered at the park to watch it rise and to stare at the endlessly inrolling vans and the sappers and miners at work in their uniforms one mpmilitary and moustachiodwon the immortality of the comic prints by fulminating against the invasion of freethinking foreigners who would pillage london and ruin the honour of british womanhood more sober minds feared the chartist mobs and the red republicans even the catholics already flaunting their cardinals and ringing their unhallowed church bells would profit by the continental wave the house of lords resounded with protests and petitions against the profanation of the park and apprehensions as to the fate of the building erected therein were equally rife the great glass roof would be splintered by hailstones the walls would be overturned by the wind the galleries would collapse under the swarming multitudes and anarchism would seize its opportunity amid the dismantled treasures of the globe but one unfailing factor was on the exhibitions side the scheme was attacked by the times and so paxtons building rose steadily till the great day when through an avenue of threequarters of a million spectators the queen and that queens indefatigable husbandas a panegyrist of the period put itdrove to declare it open to the elect thirty thousand who had already found it so while through glittering nave and transept with their fountains trees flowers and statues the hallelujah chorus thundered from a thousand voices two hundred orchestral instruments and a dozen giant organs and the millennial hope welled up in a grand climax of universal emotion and hoary grandsires should hereafter tellproclaimed the poet of the great cataloguewhat in this famous century befell grey time should chronicle the victories gained since mercy oer the world and justice reigned what time the crystal hall sent forth her dove and signed the league of universal love but although our canadian pioneer had thus ample excuse for the unrest that forbade him to miss this messianic spectacle it was noteven he would have admittedthe great exhibition which had first unsettled his stolid labours that oscillation had been communicated some two years earlier and by a shock that had set the new world rattling even more noisily than the old was shaken by the great exhibition the discovery of gold in california was a seismic vibration that depopulated eastern towns shot sober lawyers into wagons sent clergymen flying along muletrails swept timid tradesmen across the foodless and robberhaunted rocky mountains whirled schoolmasters fifteen thousand miles round cape horn and dumped them all waisthigh in auriferous mud and shimmering water to be fed by indian squaws it was under the lure of the californian legend that will had originally looked about for a purchaser of his cleared acres but by the time the farm was off his hands the glamour of easy gold had faded and with a sum in his pockets sufficient for a little respite life seemed suddenly larger than lucre and he found himself possessed by a strange craving not to be away from the old country in that year of yearsthe year of the great exhibition ii chipstone had seemed strangely shrivelled as the county flyer tore through it the high street unexpectedly narrow and the great gorgeous shops against whose panes he had flattened his youthful nose curiously small and drab with diminutive sunblinds yet the quaint blistered bulge of the old timbered houses was fascinatingly as he remembered it and when the spirited quartet of tinkling steeds slackened under the archway crowned by the ironwork sign of the black sheep he saw through a warm dimness that the ancient inn still gave on the stableyard with this same tudor bulge and that the courtyard itself was little less rambling than the picture he carried in his memory there was the same massmeeting of cocks crowing on the same golden dunghill the same litter of barrels boxes baskets and parcels of laundrywork while the gardens of the whitewashed old cottages backing the blacktarred stables and cartsheds seemed caught up as incongruously as ever in the horsey medley why there was the very shed which had sheltered the farmwagon the sunday he was to drive it to harwich and thereyes actually there on the same doorstep under the same hanging ironwork lamp was ostler joe the shambling bottlenosed hunchback whose figurein its reassurance of stabilitystruck him as positively beautiful and whose head seemed aureoled by the mist but where was that more expected face where was the hairswathed visage of caleb flynt brushing the mist from his eyes he looked anxiously round the seething sundrenched courtyard hullo joey he said at last wouldnt my dad wait it was a pleasant voice with something of a twang but the twang was no longer local oi dunno your feyther from adam said joe cheerfully mopping his face with his shirtsleeve yes you doold mr flyntfrog farm joe shook his headit seemed no longer a saints oi never heerd nobody mention frog farm nowadays its a dead place he shambled off on his many tasks with an aliveness that tightened the contraction will felt at his heart his father dead but look here joe he pursued the factotum you remember melittle will flynt cant say as oi doesmoind that box now its my boxand i wrote to dad to meet me with a trap guess he got tired of fooling around theres warious traps the hunchback waved a busy hand nohes not here and how am i to get my trunk home bradmarsh carrier goos at threeyoure in luck he heaved a parcel now into a driverless tiltcart where a little white dog boisterously mounted guard thats er he said take you too if youre smart daniel quarles a fresh wave of reassurance radiated from that old household word on the familiar tilt so the venerable carrier was still plying how then could the comparatively juvenile caleb be extinct the may day ribbons not removed from daniels horse and making it a snowwhite steed from fairyland dispelled the last funereal images surely had caleb flynt really died old quarles would never have left so lively a topic untapped with joey but here wills meditations were agreeably cut short by another vision from auld lang synethe laced mobcap and blonde kisscurls of mother gander to whom dick burrage was gloating over the trains misadventure there were pouches under the blue eyes and no gold chain now heaved with her blue silk bosom otherwise she was her old comely self but fresh from his grand hotel in spital square will no longer regarded her as an awful and aristocratic personage able to eat meat at every meal an easy accost and inquiry about the old flynts of frog farm brought him soothing information lord bless his soul people living a healthy life like that never diedunless they took medicine she couldnt say they had been to chapel latelyindeed she had gathered from the postman that the old wife had taken up with some new jerusalem crankiness but youll find the bradmarsh carrier in the parcelshedthat black one you ask her and with a wave towards the arch she turned again to the beaming dick burrage will thought the her referred to a chambermaid who was just passing but he saw no need of such guidancethe parcelshed was obvious enough his mind was occupied with the odd fact that mother gander had apparently become a sister in the spirit to his own father while his mother had moved on to another eccentric doctrine ah well changes were bound to come not everybody could be of the same immutable granite as himself he found the parcelshed deserted save for a young girl who busily heaping up parcels into the willing arms of joey did not even look up somewhat depressed by the chapelmemories the landlady had conjured up he stood a moment absently watching the operation and wondering why the agreeably pretty creature should be dispatching so many parcelsweddingcake came into his mind though the oddly varying shape of the parcels was not consistent with the hypothesis he would willingly have loiteredthe chapelcloud was dissipatingbut the carrier was clearly not here and as the church clock opposite was booming three he was afraid old daniel might be starting off without him so he hurried back to the pranked and pawing steed only to find himself derided and defied by the little dog which he now observed was also adorned with a may day bow and then he remembered he was hungry the block on the line had robbed him of his dinner and he wondered whether to go off with that grim gaffer quarles would be so enjoyable as walkingafter a square meal no why should he be thus whisked off why not a leisurely spread at the black sheep preceded by another glimpse of the girl in the shed and then a long stroll home by the dear old fieldpaths through plashy walk and swash end dry enough doubtless under this sun besides his slow old parent might be on the way after allthere was no certainty the carrier with his compulsory windings and detours would not miss him yes it would be kinder to his father to give him another hour or so the may queen he murmured to the air brooding over methusalems belated ribbons yes they would surely have made her that though perhaps the old custom was no longer kept up true she hadnt the blue eyes or the plumpness of the girl in the train and was not stately enough for a queenthough of course you couldnt really tell how victoria looked outside her royal carriage but then you couldnt imagine the blueeyed minx in a royal carriage at all you placed her smiling behind bars manipulating beerhandles its all right joey startled him by announcing toppling his tower of parcels into the cart oive made inquirations the old flynt chap be aloive and kickin oh thank you wills last shade of uneasiness vanished he slipped a sixpence into joeys palm put my box inim not going myselfsay its for frog farm and he jostled back to the parcelshed through the bustle of boxes and jangling of bells barging into other carriers from other circuits stumbling over dogs that yelped tangling himself in the whip of a postboy who was frantically buttoning his waistcoat and nearly run over by the great coach just wheeling round he was more disappointed than surprised when he at last reached the shed to find it empty though far fuller than before of mere people still there was always dinner iii but dinner was not always no im afraid its all gone said mother gander she was blocking the way at the foot of the stairs where a painted hand under pendent staghorns directed you upwards to the parlourthe black sheep would have none of your newfangled coffee roomsand will flynt sniffing up the odours of beer sand tobacco gin snuff and tallow like an ambrosial air felt a further elation in the thought of its being now a beckoning not a monitory hand to ascend to those unexplored heights mysteriously grand to the boy seemed symbolic of his rise in life but havent you got anything his face fell nothing fit to offer said the landlady but im hungryand ive got to wait here youre not staying for the night she queried i may he said to encourage her to produce some food oh but we havent a room empty he reddened was it possible she recognized the hobnailed lad of yore refused to serve him or to allow him up her aristocratic stairs you havent a room empty he repeated incredulously theres a poky garret she said and another man would have to go through it to his bedroom and he goes to bed very late and gets up very early but even our best rooms are stuffy and our corridors are that dingy people are always tumbling against the brooms the maids leave about when theyre not tumbling down the stairs look how steep they are the whole house is badly builtit was never meant for an hoteland the service is disgraceful will overwhelmed stammered out deprecation of her abuse the inn was most picturesque he urged and it was not the fault of the house if the coach was late as for himself a crust of bread and cheese would suffice to stay his pangs well go up and see what you can get she rejoined sceptically moving aside relieved to find the barrier raised he ascended the doglegged staircase his boyish awe resurging alas even the landladys disparagement had not prepared him for this dishevelled scenedirty plates and greasy knives and forks and tobaccostoppers and sloppy pewter pots that had stamped bleary rims on the flyhaunted tablecloth and a waiter in his shirtsleeves dining like a gentleman off the ruins wegetables and pastry is hoff murmured this disturbed gentleman will was retreatingbread and cheese at the bar amid the glinting bottles and shining beerhandles seemed more appetizingbut the waiter had sprung up his mouth still masticating but his coat conjured on and had him fixed instanter on a windsor chair at a clean little sunsplashed table by a side window that was refreshingly open and gave on the cheery courtyard a cut of the devastated joint strong mustard pickles a hunch of good bread a pint of porter and the freedom of the cheese to follow soon dispelled the dismalness of the room an effect to which the attendant magician contributed more literally by his great trick of vanishing crumbs and disappearing plates including his own halfeaten meal how good it was this cold roast beef of old england how equally redolent of the dear old country those hunting pictures on the low wainscoted walls with all their gay bravado there were four of them the meet breaking cover full cry the death all populous with spirited pink gentlemen and violently animated dogs and horses culminating in the leading dog tearing the fox and the leading gentleman waving his tall hat in rapture he quaffed voluptuously at his frothing pewter pot to the queen of the mayay why not drink to her hows mr gander he asked irrelevantly with a sudden image of the bullnecked landlord and his massive gold scarfpin the waiteron the point of disappearingmaterialized himself again and stared at the questioner he aint anyhow he gasped at last at least thats a secret twixt him and his maker dead it was wills turn to gasp could so much gross vitality be extinct or even rarefied dead and married over shes mrs mott now though the old customers will keep on with the mother gander just as i have to bite my tongue not to call her husband charley he lowered his voice he was the potboy once will whistled what women are was in that knowing note how pleasant it was thus to discusswith beer and pickleslife and death and the sex yes sirthe potboy and busting with pride if i let him hand up the plates at the bowling club dinner a sigh accented the cruel change youve been away sir i presoom half round the world said will with airy inaccuracy but why didnt you go in for her me with my old woman besides i wasnt going to turn peculiarno not for ten black sheep youve heard o peculiars sir yees a cayenne pod in the pickles made him cough thick as blackberries about these partsand as full of texts as the bush of prickles the waiters voice sank again she made poor charley into one of em hes got to go to chapel three times every sunday and once on wednesday poor chap there was sympathy as well as mockery in wills tone but can you tell mehe had a sudden remembrancewhy she runs down this place so is it her peculiar conscience ah ive heard others arx that too my opinion aint worth a womans tip but i cant help fancying its more defiance than conscience time was you see sir folks kept away and it sort o soured her i dont want your rotten custom she as good as says to all and sundry take it to landladies whove arxed your permission to marry and so they come all the more sir yes and cringing to have rooms and pays her whatever she asks there was lots o grumbling in the old days now you never hear a complaint except from herself my stars the money shes making but i cant say i envy charleynot even when he bullies me although in marriage if its not one cross its another aint it sir or perhaps youre one o the lucky ones im not married at all thats what i mean and the waiter sighed again got all you want sir everything thank younot wanting a wife his laugh gurgling away into his pewter pot evoked only a deeper sigh on which the waiter seemed wafted without iv simultaneouslythrough the opening or closing doorsomething was wafted within our complacent young man at his place in the sun with the glow of freedom at his heart and of porter at his throat was startled by something leaping on his knees which automatically fended and thrust away was felt as clinging claws scraping down his new trousers coughing and spluttering and with the beery glow changing to a choke he perceived that it was the carriers little white dog the very same that had warned him off its masters goods unmistakable by its pink bow so the doddering patriarch had not yet started he thought lazily though he must now be back in his cart or his canine sentry would not have gone off for a farewell prowl he helped himself to another cut of beef and his thoughts wandered from mother gander to a builders widow he had known in a montreal boardinghouse a widow to whom he could certainly have played the charley had he cared to go so far he seemed to hear her foolish whimpering the day he left for the backwoods but he became aware that it was only the carriers dog whining it was begging so prettily on its hind legs looking so appealing in its pink bow that he was soon feeding it rather than himself and morsel after morsel fell to it each gulped down with such celerity that from the creatures instantly renewed and unchangingly pathetic posture of supplication an absentminded man would have doubted if he had fed the brute at all but finally the young man pushed away his cheeseplate and dropping with plenary satisfaction upon a horsehair and mahogany armchair that stood by the empty grate he lit his cherrywood pipe with a brimstone match and followed his springtide fancies in clouds of his own making thus the second pounce of the dog on to his knees found him acquiescent even caressing and with a beatific grunt the animal curled itself up as to an on of repose then a horn sounded and with a convulsive start the creature was off his lap and scratching and yapping at the closed door will too had a moment of wild wishing he had engaged a seat in the cartthe thought of walking in this heat was no longer alluringbut it was equally unimaginable to get up now and rush like the animal besides he hadnt paid his bill he remembered not discontentedly meanwhile the distracted little dog had darted back to the window and leapt on the sill but it was obviously cowering before the depth of the jump he was feeling he really must get up and do its will when to the satisfaction of the slothful man and the bliss of the active beast the door opened and like a streak of lightning the white figure had forked across the room and vanished he turned his head lazily to the window to see if it would catch its cart but was only in time to see the tailboard with his own box disappearing through the archway pursued by joe with a belated bundle then the newcomers claimed his languorous attention v strictly speaking there was only one newcomer and he was hanging back at the sight of the londontailored guest being himself in moleskins and bent and fusty though mother gander was clearly beckoning him forward the gentlemans just going she said sweetly will knew not whether to be drowsily pleased at the status he had achieved in his own neighbourhood or sluggishly wrathful at this renewed attempt to be rid of him plenty left he observed encouragingly puffing immovably oi reckon sister oill feed in the taproom the voice sent strange vibrations of resentment through wills being and particularly through his nostrils where a mysterious smell of aniseed was called up whether from memory or the actual moleskins he could not make out youll do no such thing said mother gander sharply its less trouble here remember what james says who was jameswas her husband not charleywill was wondering dreamily chapter two warse twooi take your pint answered this odd figure whose wizened face with the straggling whiskers seemed loathsomely familiar but though the beady eyes under the moleskin cap were turned for a moment full on his remembrance stirred but feebly through his afterdinner lethargy and it was not till the intruder had sinuously and softly skirted the great diningtable and begun solemnly turning the faces of the hunting pictures to the wall like naughty schoolchildren that he was dully conscious of the secret of his abhorrence thereon the very first day of his returnwas joshua mawhood the buttonsnipping villain of his story mother gander stood by silent as one properly censured neither did she protest when slashing a giant gobbet off the beef he carried it on the point of the carvingknife to wills mustardstrewn meatplate and bearing the same with its dirty knife and fork to the remotest corner of the table fell to with audible enjoyment ill send you your milk deacon she said turning to leave the room dont copy jael too far he answered with a grimace copy who asked mother gander mystified jael the wife of heber the keniteher as killed sisera like me he asked for water and like you she gave him milk but she meant to nail him like a stoat me murder you said mother gander with a scandalized air but she was clearly impressed by his erudition tis onny my fun but you look up judges chapter fower theyre beacons to usthey old hebrews and hebrewessesbeacons would you rather not have the milk mother gander was still a little puzzled taint for me to refuse a sisters kindness and the best way to repay her is to take it with rum bein as theres a wisitor the leetlest drop o rum in it to show oi dont howd with your rebukers in that regard send the bottle separate to be plain to all beholders and send me another pint of porter please added will he felt he must justify his stay even as the deacon must justify his drink the ecclesiastical preferment that had come to elder mawhood amused himhis boyish resentment faded suddenly and the respectable ratcatcherafter all the motorimpulse of his fortunesnow loomed through a cloud of kindly indulgence even touched with the glamour of early memories with the magic of those faroff winters whose approach had brought the expert to frog farm as surely as it brought in from the hedges the creatures against whom he waged cunning battle in the warzone of the barns and outbuildings how thrilled the boy had been by the great traps and the pack of ferretsnay had not the strange old man seemed himself a larger ferret with his tightfitting moleskins sidling motions and curiously small shining eyes what a joy his annual visitwith what fearful interest the bunch of children had listened to the annual contract made for gross sums or for particular buildings sometimes calculated per tail of rats the elder had always made a point of the cost of the shoeleather involved in the isolation of frog farm aniseed will suddenly remembered had played a considerable part in beguiling the victims and the scent of it coming up againdreamwhiff or realitywas now incongruously mingled with a flavour of youth and innocence touching our rustic ulysses almost to tears he wheeled his armchair windowwards to hide his emotion and puffed into the courtyard oi dont object to your smokin mumbled the deacon thank you said will you dont remember me im afraid mr mawhood deacon he could not bring his tongue to im will flynt the lookers boy you were always so kind to you let me set your traps and dose the bait the deacon shot a beady look at him but shook his head why you let me smell your ferret once dont you remember when it came out of the hole by the brad and you said that though i hadnt heard a squeak or a scamper your nose could tell there had been rats in the run there was swarms of boys at frog farm all bad uns oi never knew em by tailbut oi dessay oi do remember ye in the rough will was strangely disappointed dont you remember i lent you my slate to hide the trap from that cute old rascal ay warmints allus runs to cover said the deacon vaguely and when caught he wouldnt eat the bait surely you remember they never does rats has more sperrit than lions said the deacon with enthusiasm the abortive attempt to recall himself to the ratcatcher was ended by the return of the waiter whose delicate balance of rumbottle milkglass and pewter pot on the tiniest of trays was almost upset by the sight of the blank backs of the hunting pictures he seemed as startled as though he was not in the conjuring line himself depositing the drinks with his usual sleight of hand at both ends of the room simultaneously he made as if to reverse the pictures but the deacon emitted a sibilance so terrifying that he did the vanishing trick instead the old man then produced from either pocket a paleyellow pinkeyed creature and emptied the milkglass into a saucer how thirsty they gets this weather he observed as they lapped greedily at the milk pore thingstheir need is greater than mine vi will was sipping his porter piano and the deacon his rum strepitosothe ferrets back in his pocketswhen the door opened afresh and a new figure protruded through it likewise drawing back when the room which should have been empty at that hour was seen to be in occupation this was however a very different figure from the deacons a figure jovial and ponderous sporting a floral dressinggown and carpet slippers and with all the air of having just left an adjacent bedroom come indont mind me called will cheerfully the smokers invitation not being negatived by the muncher and bibber the massive visitor padded forwards revealing more clearly his heavyjowled hairless rubicund face and the motley multitude of stains on his gay dressinggown and waving a roll of clammysmelling posters just come by the coachand in the nick o time he observed genially and espying in the reversed pictures a favourable background for his operations he circumvented the table not without surprise and disgust at the corner where the moleskinned man grunted guzzled and guttled and hung up two of the bills on the nails without any observable astonishment at the state of the pictures or any apparent attention to anything but his own interests stepping backwards to survey the effect with such absorption of mind that through the girdle of his dressinggown his spine collided with the table no my boy he addressed will they cant print like that in chipstone from his armchair will could easily read the more glaring headlines tonight at sevenlifesize dukes marionettes hamlet and the ghost margaret catchpole pantomimeballet the mistletoe bough the beggar of bethnal green edmund orphan of the castle the high road to marriage as performed before all the crowned heads of europe america and australia nbmiss arabella flippance at the piano sounds bully he observed politely bullys the word my young american friend said the showman what a pity the mailcoach was latewe might have had em stuck up for the ordinary and caught some shilling patrons youre staying here for the night i hope noive got to go on what a pity i was about to offer you a front seat me why must fill up somehow said the showman frankly people never go to a play unless they think they cant get in and as we only open tonight

but the next thing to ita tent by squinting out of that window youll see the whole caboodle rising on the meadows like a giant mushroom why not stop here and pick up a young lady ill give you two seats dont want more than one seat when ive got a girl laughed will then the face of the girl in the parcelshed came up at once alluring and rebuking and he repeated that seriously he must be off never mindbetter luck next act said the showman and tugged furiously at the bellpull and the waiter appeared with a glass of brandy and water as though he added thoughtreading to his conjuring accomplishments well heres to our better began the showman his eye raised towards will at the window caught suddenly something in the courtyard and setting down his untasted glass and snatching up his posters he disappeared almost as frantically as the dog hes forgot he aint dressed chuckled the waiter seems to be a merry gent said will lives here all the while the show is on said the waiter not without pride pays me a shilling every time i go in i hope on the same principle mother gander will pay me said will laughing and ordered his bill which he found as unreasonable as the food was excellent he did not however mulct the waiter of the handsome tip designed to show him not a woman but a man and a gentleman at that and the waiter finally disappeared with congees instead of with conjurings i know you will excuse me old fellow said the showman reentering but business before pleasure fact is i got up too late to catch the carriers but now ive got the postman to leave my bills at all the publichouses on his next round good fellow bundock though why he should boast so over killing two frogs with one stone i dont understand it seems an operation as cruel as it is simple here he swigged at his neglected glass he made a point too of my not employing the bellman youd have done better with the bellman here in chipstone and over at latchem volunteered will where bundock mostly goes youll never get em to come thats what bundock said but dont you believe it sonny he held up a huge hairy forefinger half gilded with a great ring theyre only a canting lot o sons of slowcoaches theyve never had the chance of knowing what they like temptations the thing the diaconal sibilance that greeted this sinister sentiment fell unheeded on the showmans ear or rather he did not distinguish it from the worthy mawhoods general medley of guttural and nasal noises theres no greater temptation added the showman than shakespeare and the ballet will shook his head they dont know one from tother didi mean if they didhe had slipped into the old idiomtheyd be scandalized why i went to see a piece of shakespeare at sadlers wells myself last week and im bound to say twas a bit thickthough splendidly acted mind you you neednt tell me that phelps he smacked his fleshy lips voluptuously lord what a job that man had to clear out the beersellers babies and filthymouthed roughs and now its the quietest show in london what was the piece cant remember the nameabout a nigger othello thats itsounded a rather irish name for a nigger i thought irish ah yesha ha ha you had me there by jove thats a new wheeze and he roared genially while the innocent and it is to be feared sadly illiterate will tried to look like a successful humorist anyhow he said you wont get em from little bradmarsh no nor long bradmarsh either they think all actors are wicked and so they be burst forth the deacon at last hobs and jills ought to be kept apart he stuck his knife towards the poster the high road to marriage indeed high road to hell hear hear agreed the showman surprisingly rattling his glass well put old cock but these aint actors only puppets you cant be wicked in wood im afraid i must be off said will rising then heres luck to you he finished his glass and may you die before youre buried thanks i hope i shant do either mr duke he took his hat and stick not duke old man flippance anthony flippance universally docked to tony flip duke only goes with the marionettes i bought em lock stock and barrelthe oldest circuit in east anglia and the name going well with the crowned heads but there are no crowned heads in america said will smiling pardon me sonny contradicted mr flippance but ive just come from there said will crushingly and how about the emperor of brazil oh said will blankly he seemed really to have heard of this personage then recovering he said but have you played before him thats not my affair said mr flippance it aint my responsibility what dukes done or left undoneif duke was his name which i take leave to question twixt you and i i doubt if it would pay to work brazil but as i said i bought it as a going concern lock stock and lies snapped the deacon mr flippance turned his large red face benevolently towards the moleskins lies is a harsh word legends old cock legends oi baint a bird rasped the deacon stick to the truth lord love us a quaker mr flippance winked at will who smiledman of the world to man of the world as if anybody would take a thing that size and smell for a rooster the deacon reached for the rumbottle in deadly silence will with a fearsoon proved superfluousthat he meant it for a missile hastened to remark that anyhow there were no crowned heads in australia where were you educated sonny retorted mr flippance and he began whistling the then favourite air the king of the cannibal islands he broke off to point out that kings and queens were as thick in the maneating islands round australia as old cocks in essex though they didnt wear moleskins or indeed anything but their own skins besides he added as an afterthought wasnt queen victoria monarch of australia too will taken aback again had to admit it but you havent played before victoria he murmured mr flippance winked more widely as he explained that a study of the posters would show that the marionettes themselves never claimed to have performed before crowned heads it was the plays that had been performed he turned suddenly upon the rumsoothed deacon youre not denying my quaker friend that queen victorias seen hamlet you leave me and the queen out of it growled the deacon ha then you admit shes seen hamlet oi dont know nawthen about it why should she see hamlet because he was the prince of denmark said tony winking again at his now bosom friend but you methody quaker deadalive gotomeeting sons of sundayfied slugs crawl about thinking yourselves holier than victoria god bless her even when its wood never having seen society or ever had a drink outside chipstone the deacon was roused at last never had a drink outside chipstone his breast heaved with a sinister movementwas it a wheeze of wrath or of laughter oill goo bail my round is bigger nor yourn there aint scarce a barn in east anglia what dont know me tonys great jaw fell a barnstormer you rats what do you play it aint playits work yes i knowbut whats your repertory my what your pieces oi baint onny a pieceworker in what in what you said it aint always per tail retail do you mean said the puzzled tony will who had listened to the conversation with an everexpanding grin here burst into a guffaw tony turned on him is he kidding me he asked half angrily half amicably the answerlike wills departure from this enthralling parlourwas staved off by the advent of yet another head popped into the doorway this time it was a heavily greased head with scrupulously parted hair and was attached to a spruce young man with a spring posy in his buttonhole but his bearsgrease out smelt his primroses hullo tony cried the aromatic apparition up already ive got to work for my living mr flippance retorted the dormouse season is over you coming in charley to see the show tonight me ive got better things to do old boy the young landlord turned to the deacon can you let me have five or six live uns the deacon shook his head oi dont want to disoblige brother oi do my duty according to peternatral brute beasts made to be taken and destroyedbut they baint meant by the almoighty to be taken for sport and oi dont howd with foxhunting neither so i see mr charles mott glanced glumly at the backs of the pictures ef you want to be riddy o warmints shoot em says oi or nip their brushes in traps oh oh came involuntarily from will at this blasphemy the deacon transfixed him with his glittering eye but went on without pausing and ef you want to be riddy o rats come to me dont set aworshippin your prizeterriers like ephraim jined to his idols i did come to you to be rid o the warmints and now i want halfadozen spunky uns make your own price but if you wont supply em ill get em from bill nutbone thats doubly sinfulto goo to the heathen he turned to will ef youre so fond o ferrets young man oi could spare you this paircheaper than youll get em from nutbone he let their pink eyes protrude from his pockets will eagerly closed with the offer if frog farm proved as dull as he was now beginning to fearafter this contrast of anthony flippance and joshua mawhoodratting or rabbiting might be a providential diversion but i cant carry them in my pockets he said impressively just made by moses son london and ive got a long walk besides id like them in cages oill send em by the carrier on friday promised the ratcatcher frog farm you said good day to you brother mott good day deacon sorry we cant do business queer old cuss he said winking at will as the door closed belongs to the peculiars iive heard of them will coloured a bit tony who had listened to the dialogue with enlightenment here stalked out in halfgenuine horror holy moses son the publican and sinner prefers rats to shakespeare stow it tony called the landlord after him one preachers enough and smiling he changed the blanks into hunting pictures almost as deftly as his waiter would have done it he had scarcely effected the transformation however before the deacon popped his head in again mr mott looked like a caught schoolboy but though the beady eyes looked straight at the flamboyant hunters mr mawhood only said oi forgot to lend a lawbook what sort of a lawbook dye want miss gentrys got a counterclaim ef oi wont pay for my wifes silk dress as oi never ordered she says my ferrets killed her chickens thats not a counterclaim mr mawhood advised will its a lyin claim anyways what killed her chickens was her own black devil squibs her and her angels you go down to the bar and see if the missus can find you a bookbut wouldnt a lawyer be better the good lord forbid oid sooner goo to a doctor well thank you kindly brotherone good turn desarves another foive oi think you said or six first thing in the morning spunky uns remember the deacon sighed and disappeared again poor old chap sure of his rats mr mott was now touched to sympathy his missus is a tartar no mistake still with them rounds of his he dodges her a good deal and he sighed like the deacon and followed himbearsgrease after aniseedand will alone at last followed too though without a sigh being stillas the waiter saidone of the lucky ones in the corridor he turned the wrong way finding bedroom doors instead of the staircase he paused a moment to gaze at a stuffed specimen of the sacred animal that stood with brush rampant against a scenic background under a glass case and a stuffed trout that swam movelessly through a mimic stream then he became aware to his surprise that tony flip still in his dressinggown and still hugging the balance of his posters was pacing the corridor restlessly like a caged lion though it turned out to be really like a tame creature denied his cage they wont let me in he said miserably and he indicated an open bedroom door opposite the fox with a view of housemaids at work angry at the hour one was making his bed thumping it viciously another raised swirls of dust with a broom slops stood blatantly around they wont even take free seats he groaned vii what did i tell you said will oh it aint because they think it wicked the hussies they turn up their noses at it just because its under their noses if they had to go to greenwich fair to see it theyd fight to get in candidly cocky have you ever seen a better bill it seems only too much ventured will it dont say all at the same performance in practice it all comes down to the mistletoe bough the silliest of the lot a bride who shuts herself in a chest for fun you know and moulders into a spirit but think of richardsonswhat they cram into twentyfive minutes you saw that at greenwich i suppose easter time no i only got to london in time for the great exhibition youve been to that the showmans eyes sparkled what i came back for thats a show and a note of immeasurable envy mixed with the rapture of the rival impresario but what a chance missed how so no drinks i got lemonade thats not a drinkthats a gas lord i thought looking at that bumper house with a proper christian bar they could pay off the national debt youve seen it then was there at the opening stood so near the royal party i patted the head of little wales and the goldstick and chamberlain walking backwards from the presence nearly shoved me into the chinese ambassador just as he was salaaming on his stomach didnt little albert edward look sweet in his highland costume i wasnt inside then confessed will and i only had eyes for the queen and her creamcoloured horses youve got a season ticket i suppose with the prince consorts compliments the fact is i supplied the elephant for the queens howdah did you yes didnt you see it in the indian compartment they wanted to show off the magnificent trappings she got from the rajah and they thought of getting a real live elephant which would have been no end of trouble amid all those precious vases but i happened to know of a stuffed elephant at a show down here in essex so i entered into correspondence with buckingham palace and loaned the beast for the seasonbuying him up first of courseand sent him up in my caravan that had to be roused from its winter sleep and completely unpacked yes trouble enough but talk of the kohinoor that elephantll be worth his weight in gold when he comes backqueen victorias elephant as visited by the nobility and gentry of the world i annex the great exhibition see i wish id noticed him said will wistfully i only saw her statue in zinc seven yards high but theres so much to seemachinery and jewels and mexican figures it makes your head ache and i couldnt even get a look at that kohinoor such a crush round it but did you see the preserved pig the showmans eyes twinkled mr woods dye mean mr woods the chancellor of the exchequer havent you noticed how theyve left off abusing the income tax now theyve got the show to talk about by jove he chuckled what a haul for the exchequer if they bring the crystal palace under the window tax no no best berkshire breed the real marvel of the exhibition none o your stuffed creatures but a natural pig cured whole weighs three and a half hundredweight five foot and a half from tail to snout twas done by a provision merchant in dublinsmithi took note of the name that name will be immortal said mr flippance gravely yes and there was a monster pigeonpie said will with the same unsuspicious enthusiasm the church clock striking four at this point made the showman bound frantically to his doorway not done yet you snails and sluts when am i to get these bills to the tent do you realize we open tonight youll ruin the show ill take them volunteered will my road lays by the field a friend in need is a friend indeed tony thrust the heavy roll effusively into wills hands ask for my daughtershell help you to stick em up on the billboards your daughter murmured will he would have resented his sudden reduction to a billposter but for the romantic vision of the bohemian petticoat i cant pull the strings on both sides of the stage at once can i not to mention the womens and boys voices and the piping gaffers lord shes got a head on her has polly and pops in and out to play the piano too with pleasant flutterings of the springtide fancy the young man lightly strode with his roll under his arm to the field where a long chocolatecoloured caravanapparently the vehicle that had transported the elephantstood horseless at an aperture in the mammoth mushroom described by tony flip labourers in shirtsleeves were carrying in ropes and rough benches small boys and large dogs stood around and there was a litter of straw cardboard shivered packingcases and dirty paper two trucks covered with tarpaulin and a vast box with a highpitched roof marked dukes marionettes completed the confusion will peeping in saw a stage already set at the border of which a girl on her knees was tacking a row of tin footlightholders the rear was already roped off and the benches seemed to rise like a gallery evidently the thing was done in stylecrowned heads or no crowned heads not without a thrill he walked in and across the grassy floor but romance fled when the girl raising her head presented a face almost as massive as her fathers and ravaged by smallpox to boot polly had indeed a head on her he thought though long pendent earrings preserved its femininity politely concealing his chill he murmured miss flippance and explained he had been instructed to deliver the bills to her she received them and him with an indifference that would have been galling had she been prettier and was not gratifying even from a massive brain silly nonsense she grumbled unrolling them to open before youve done your posting and circularizing there wont be a soul oh surelythis weather he murmured miss flippance threw him an annihilating glance if dad once gets an idea into his head you cant get it out with a forceps will stared at this vigorous young lady who with a poster unfurled in her hand proceeded to yell directions and rebukes at the bencharranging clodhoppers it was an insult to his sex he felt resentfully no woman however ugly had the right to order men about men who were not even married to her nincompoops theyll never be ready for tonight said miss flippance acknowledging his existence again would to heaven dad had gone up to london to see the exhibitionand not hustled us like this but he was there at the opening miss flippance stared at him were you with him no such luck i didnt even see the stuffed elephant has he stuffed you with that miss flippance emitted a mirthless laugh and will looked at once angry and sheepish not that way you hulking brutes turn em round and besides its ridiculous to give hamlet high art dont take south of scarborough well i saw othello in london last week he contradicted sharplyshe should see he was no mere gull and the pit was packed yesin april but try it in the dogdays too warm eh he sniggered she turned away as from an idiot that hurt him more than having swallowed her fathers royal rodomontade did she then think the plot of othello glacial or had she no sense of humour yes that was itthe sex had been denied the sense of humour true it shrieked with laughter if you tickled it but the tickling must be physical ah she was at it again bustling and bullying the superior sex well he wasnt going to paste bills under her let that lazy liar of a showman do his own dirty work good afternoon he called out huffily and walked out of the great tent in a far less romantic mood than when he had entered it and then as he came through the opening in the canvas his eyes nearly started out of their sockets daniel quarless cart stood outside the tent and there perched on the drivingboard holding the reins and calmly instructing the shirtsleeved yokels to deliver the big drum to miss flippance was the girl of the parcelshed viii before his eyes could return normally to their orbits or his breath to his windpipe the incredible vision had vanished jinny had in fact had an overdose of commissions in the other purlieus of chipstone and having fetched the drum from its winter quarters as directed by miss polly flippance that noonit had in fact been pawned and the piano was still irredeemableshe was hastening on her homeward circuit as fast as methusalem could be induced to go who was that will gasped the rustic who had received the drum looked at him with unconcealed contempt a man who did not know that that war jinny he said it was as if he had given his drum a terrific bang jinnyjinny quarles then who else in the boom of that name reverberated a clamour of memories and of emotions old and new images of a solemneyed mite of a merry little maid of a sedate sunday scholar and of the amazing creature of today went all interflashing with one another yes the little jinny who had shared the wagon and his secret with him that fateful sunday and who if ever by a rare chance she had flitted across his thoughts figured always as this same little girl in her grand pink sunday pelisse trimmed with pink velvet and fringes was now grown up bonneted bewitching incredible but wherewhere was her grandfather he stammered asleep inside asleep the rustic grinned a long sleep oi should reckon whoy we aint seen the gaffer for years dont stand there gossiping it was the female martinet at her sternest its not his fault said will i was asking about old daniel quarles is he really dead dead not to my knowledge at least i have never noticed jinny in black then where is he why isnt he looking after jinny eh but he must be a hundred you dont mean to say he lets jinny go out and do his job the most natural person i should think said miss flippance really i havent time to discuss village carriers if the show is to open tonight do be careful of that drum no not inside blockhead come back as the tambourladen slave did not seem to hear his affrighted fellowserfs yelled to him to bring the drum outside again and when he was come the despots skirts rustled majestically back into the tentthey were long and hunched out quite fashionably which accentuated the humiliation of the male element but will remained at the tent door like abraham after an angels visit thunderstruck and dumbfounded but with consternation not reverence it was he thought the grossest carelessness that had ever occurred in the history of the globe a respectable girl like thatwhy what was the world coming to sent gadding about the country like a trollop perched up horsily behind a carters whipthis was what little jinny had been allowed to grow up into and that girl at the black sheepshe who had looked so innocent whom he had mentally seen as a may queen crowned with garlands dancing girlishly round a maypolethis was what lay under her poetic semblance and at the same timepleasing and perturbing thoughtboth the unsexed carrier and the maidenly may queen were in reality little jinny no standoffish stranger needing deferential approach butin a wayhis very own the meek poppet whose cheek he had always pinched patronizingly in whose eyes he had always seen himself as a grownup god miss flippance sweeping out again and finding him still hanging about immovable had a new thought pardon mehas my father engaged you he coloured up in anger i brought his bills in passingthats all oh i thought you might be looking for a job theres this drum you know he could have knocked her down but she was evidently quite in earnest this outrageous humourless female only second in selfsufficiency to jinny the carrier the world seemed suddenly emasculated im no musician he said surlily but you look a strong young man and its muscle we want not music youd only have to stand here about half an hour a day this afternoon of course you might join the bellman round the townive ordered him for five miss flippance said will mastering himself and speaking with crushing dignity have you observed my clothes they dont matter she assured him we provide the uniform do i look he snorted like a drummer at a dime show if youve come as a walking gentleman replied miss flippance simply youve come to the wrong shop were only wires oh i know all about that and he slashed savagely with his stick at the insulting tambour which uttered a bass roar of agony splendid but you might have smashed it cried miss flippance wheres the drumstick am i the drumsticks keeper he answered with an odd biblical reminiscence nincompoops thickheads zanies wheres the drumstick but nobody had seen the drumstick jinny hadnt brought it the slaves assured her she assured them still more emphatically that they had dropped it off the drum in taking it out and no inch of it being visible where the cart had stood she drew the deduction that it was now speeding towards long bradmarsh she turned to will do run after herthe men are so busyshe cant be far and she has to stop every now and again he glared at her then something inside him whispered that that was the obvious thing to doimpishly to pretend to obey her and then to keep her waiting for the drumsticketernally yes he would be revenged on behalf of his sex yoicks tallyho he cried with an advent of glee that he felt justifiably malicious and waving his own stick wildly he bounded with mock frenzy towards the field gate by which the cart had gone off you wont catch her like that bawled miss flippance after him across the fields head her off but he would not take orders from any woman he told himself so feigning deafness he ran doggedly into the long bradmarsh road and turning a sharp elbow felt his heart leap up to see the now familiar cart at a standstill before a wayside cottage but even as he gazed it started afresh he tore on madly the back of the tilt vanished round another bend following a drumstick passed grotesquely across his mind what an odd homecoming what a queer renewal of acquaintance with jinnyafter that solemn oathtaking in the wagon presently he heard a wild scampering through the bushes on his right and his canine friend of the inn was leaping and frisking and joyously barking beside him they ran togetherowing to the dogs leisurely tangents and curvatures he could just keep up with it but with the sweat now pouring from his forehead the inner imp began asking what he was running for since he had already deceived and chastised miss flippance left her eternally expectant why not now drop into the pleasant saunter home he had planned but the poor dog was panting in this heathe answered the impit must have run miles since its meal in the parlour apoplexy threatened perhaps hydrophobia even look at its lolling tongue he snatched it up it must be restored to its inconsiderate mistress to whom at the same time a still more important rebuke could be administered if indeed any vestiges of decency yet remained in the minx but the little terrier struggled spasmodically in his armsthe ungrateful brute he must save it from itself then just as he must save its mistress from herself clamping it to his breast with iron muscles he toiled frenziedly forwards then the far faint sound of a horn came like elfin mocking laughter on the sultry air and with a sudden convulsion the animal wrested itself free and will was left hopelessly pursuing not the cart but the dog he had indeed the pleasure of seeing the former slacken to receive the latter but the vehicle was wafted away again so smoothly that to the poor perspiring pedestrian methusalem appeared in his original mazeppa rle the chase ran along wide horizonsgreat ploughed lands or meadows with grazing cattlethe level broken only by ricks roofs and trees mainly witchelms with a few poplars sometimes these elms clustered in groves sometimes a few helped to make the hedgeline as often they rose solitary in arrogant individualism to the right was a delicious sense of the saltings and of mewing seabirds and mysteriously as in the heart of the fields redbrown barge sails or the tall bare poles of vessels could be seen upstanding and once where the road mounted will caught a glimpse of the blackwater and ships floating and the dim blue shore beyond but at the top of this hill he was too breathed to continue he sat down wiped his forehead and surveyed the view far from soothed however by its simple restfulness if only his father had come to meet him as his letter had requested he thought savagely all this wouldnt have happened ix anyhow there was no need to follow the glaring high road any longer on the left he could see the clump of steeples wood and he knew that once he had cut through that he could find the swift fieldpath through hoppits that would save miles of the high road and not bring him out on it till the silverlane pump he strolled with a sense of relief towards the wood but hardly had its green groves closed refreshingly upon him when reminding himself he was a trespasser he quickened his pace again and hurried through the oak plantations and over the wonderful carpet of bluebells with but a slight eye to the sylvan beauty even when he reached the fieldpath bounded by the ditch and the dogrose hedge he did not relax his speed having bethought himself that the poor horse would surely be given drink at the trough of the silverlane pump and that there would probably be a delay at the silverlane arms even if he should not have succeeded in heading the carrier off altogether and from that point she would surely need his protection so lonely was the road till you sighted long bradmarsh with the drainage windmills and the bridge and the no less necessary sermon could be combined with the protection he found the wheel of the village pump chained up evidently the water was running scarce it looked not unlike a gibbet this tall pump and he could imagine a criminal dangling from the spout there was little water in the trough and the waterbutt of the inn was almost equally dry a wayside mudhole haunted by geese represented a pool he remembered these arid villages in such strange juxtaposition with his own oozy birthplacewas it here or at kelcott that he had made a boyish fortune bringing water at a halfpenny a pint his mother he recalled with a faint smile had been against the business because jesus had said to the woman of samaria give me to drink though he had trumped her text with the injunction to the israelites ye shall also buy water of them for money it all made him superconscious of thirst and he went into the inn and ordering a pint of ale inquired if the carrier had passed by which way be you agooin said the tapster it irritated him to be questioned and he replied tartly that he was going home he gulped down his liquor and put his question to a group of children playing around the pump they scratched their heads and gaped at him and the youngest put shy chubby hands to its smeary face the white horse and the girl he explained and the shy child started screaming and a woman burst from a cottage door and dragged it within glaring suspiciously at the furriner a labourer riding a ploughhorse barebacked and leading another came from the bradmarsh direction has the carrier passed you he asked dye want a lift was the reply he lost his temper havent you got enough business o your own not much said the labourer navely ground be as ard as the road curous baint it arter all that soakin he replied more civilly glad his rudeness was misunderstood yes its always either too little or too much and ye cant sow unless tis noneorboth added the philosophic ploughman plodding on gimme a followin toime the rustic meant a season in which rain and sunshine came in rapid alternation but will ruefully reflected that the followin toime in the sense he was having it was far from satisfactory but at that moment there was a cheerful bark and that inconsistent dog was curveting around him its tall thumping wildly against his trousers in an ecstasy of recognition so he was too late he thought with a strange heartsinking knowing its rearguard habit he pushed it away with his foot if the beast thought he was going to carry it again it was jolly well mistaken no more cartchasing for him his following time was over and as the creature persisted in gambolling round his legs he made a swish in the air with his stick to drive it on its way and it uttered a fearsome yell it being part of nips slyness to cry before he was hurt but for once nip was not a laggard but an advance courier and fate brought methusalem round the corner at the exact instant of his yell how dare you strike my dog it was an inauspicious reunion jinny had checked methusalem and her grey eyes were blazing down from their dark lashes her face framed in its bonnet glowed like a dark flower and he was confusedly aware that that lonely hamlets highstreet was suddenly pullulating with peoplethe tapster and gapers at the inn door the ploughman looking backwards excited at last the little children mysteriously out again with their mother and other mothers and infants in arms or at skirt surging agitatedly from nowhere whether at nips cry or jinnys even the pump seemed to have spouted an old man while an old lady arose like an ancient venus from the pond and every eye he felt was stabbing at the maltreator of jinnys animal the cackle seemed a sinister clamour as of vengeance mounting from that swarm of sympathizers i didnt strike him he answered sulkily clearly she had not recognized hima position not without its advantages doubtless the raw youth of her childish memories was effectually buried beneath this manly form set off by the elegant london suit this wellbarbered head and the face that had exchanged freckles for the stamp of experience as a matter of fact he added i fed the brute at the inn which brute retorted jinny sharply but at this moment nip who had been calmly lapping the dregs of the pool intervened by leaping up to lick wills hand i beg your pardon she murmured coming to a standstill granted he said not to be outdone in graciousness and beginning to enjoy the advantage her ignorance of his identity gave him but thats no proof i havent beaten him you remember the saying a woman a dog and a walnuttree the more you beat them the better they be thats all nonsense said jinny bridling up again he changed the subject quickly have you got a drumstick gracious do you want to try he laughed its for the drum at the show miss flippance thinks you didnt deliver it why it was tied on the drum the fool of a man must have dropped itif he hasnt poked it inside the drum did you look under the benches no thats it i remember now seeing the man take the drum inside by mistake he must have dropped it on the way back dont you think it would have been more sensible to look before you leapedespecially such a long leap and what a pace you must have come in this heat he flushed faintly im a good walker i know the cuts well if you get back as quick as you came there wont be much time lost she clucked up methusalem good afternoonhope youll find your stick and that youll drumin a good house what she too thought him capable of being a drumbanger a minion of marionettes had women then no eyeno perception of clothesas well as no humour the mob was melting away under their amiable parley but he now rallied it afresh stop he called desperately after jinny stop but nips joyous bark at the resumption of the journey drowned all lesser remarks and again the cart receded on the horizonan horizon he knew houseless and arid no region for a lonely goodlooking girl let poor pockmarked polly flippance brave the wild if female carriers there must be not his jinny no he must reveal himself at the next stop he must remonstrate protest but the trouble was that the thing would not stop and that there would be no stop nowhe knewfor several miles perspiring panting hallooing and waving his stick and utterly oblivious of the scandalized street he pursued at his swiftest and methusalem being no serious competitor in the long run jinny heard him at last and looking back through the tilt over the dwindled packages saw the pitiful gesturing figure and to his infinite relief the cart drew up what have you lost now she called your sandwichboards im not going back to miss flippance he panted im going bradmarsh way then why ever didnt you say so she replied calmly jump up jump up she asked a strange young man to jump up then what else could she have done if he had said who he wasa fact of which he had indeed been just about to make royal proclamation you take passengers he gasped he remembered now that joey had told him the cart would take him but then he had had no idea that her was not the vehicle she was equally surprised why else did you run after me run after her he did not like the phrase girls ran after mengirls of a sortto some extent girls of every sort that was the doctrine in his set and yet he had run after herit called for explanation i wasnt running after you he said slowly it was only thatthat i couldnt believe my eyes to see you like that like what she was frankly puzzled driving about alone in this godforsaken part its scandalous he was about to say but before the glimmering fire in her eyes he altered the wordits dangerous dangerous her little laugh rippled out i thought you said you knew these parts so i doim an essex man even though i maynt look it having been half round the world have you now well its the big cities that are dangerous granfer says maybe hes right he admitted wincing a little before the candid grey eyes but dont you understand that a woman carrier is again he toned down his wordoutlandish her amusement danced in her eyes inlandish i suppose you mean dont laugh he said forgetting that the unrevealed will had no right to that tone you know its an unwomanly occupation laughing you know what i mean for one thing a woman cant know much about horsesand she oughtnt to have to do with em anyhowits not natural may she have to do with donkeys jinny inquired sweetly he frowned chaffs no good but i never give my horse anydo i methusalem dear such wordmockery was bewildering to his simpler brain he opened his mouth but nothing came and his vexation only increased for finding no vent may she have to do with pigs queried jinny again pigs are at home he conceded not always she said demurely i meet lots on this very road and you might meet worse than pigs on a lonely road like thisyou might meet men like ive met one now yes but it happens to be me he said again all but forgetting her ignorance of his identity usually it would be dangerous well but wouldnt it be just as dangerous for a male carrier not at all he can fight and if he met a woman she said slyly theres no danger in a woman then why are you running away from miss flippance miss flippance he cried in angry astonishment who says im running away from miss flippance well youve run from her to me and if you say you werent running after me you must have been running away from her dont you try to bamboozle me i tell you ive been half round the world and nowhere have i seen a woman carrier if youd ha stayed at home you would have said jinny so it seems and in america there are those bloomeritescome over here too i hear nowadays the hussies want to wear the breeches do they inquired jinny with genuine interest ive often thought it would be more convenient for me jumping up and down and there would be yards of stuff less some of those chipstone ladies quite scavenge the streets with their long skirts padded out by all those petticoats dont you think he grew almost as auburn as his hair such secrets of the toilette babbled by a young girl he still thought good at heart outraged his sense of decorum no i dont think he answered angrily well try she suggested sweetly put yourself into our place its you putting yourselves into our place thats the trouble he retorted what will women be up to next i wonder here it was jinnys turn to flare up she had neverit has been already remarkedthought of herself as up to anything rarely even thought of herself as a woman least of all as a representative of her sex but challenged now to her face for the first time she felt she must hold the pass for all womanhood we women will be up to whatever we please not if you want to please the men jinnys young face flashed fire and roses and who wants to please the men he laughed complacently i never met a woman who didnt the girls fire died into cold contempt i dont think you know much about women me why ive knocked about since you were in pinaforesand pelisses i shouldnt be surprised mr drummer said jinny with judicial frigidity if you knew less about women than i know about horses ive seen half the world i tell you she flicked up methusalem but not the better half he winced again fiddlesticks was all he could find to answer drumsticks rejoined jinny gaily and with a mocking flourish of her horn she receded afresh something stronger than his will now shot him forward crying i say jinny he meant by crying that old familiar name to disclose himself and then to have it out with her side by side on the drivingboard she turned her head do you want to jump on or dont you she called it was the last straw jinnyhe had forgottenwas not a name privileged for the friend of her pelisse and pinafore days any male might use it just as any wayside rough might abuse its owner i dont he shouted savagely ill never patronize a woman carrier a dashing young lad from buckingham she had started singing whether to herself or at him he could not tell and he strode behind the cart almost as rapidly as methusalem before it to find out whether she was still answering back but apparently she had forgotten himthat was the most pungent repartee of alland the gaiety of the chorus only added salt to the smart still hed sing fol de rol iddle ol still hed sing fol de rol lay the thin silver treble reminded him incongruously of her sundayschool singing and the revival of that longfaded picture of himself driving her home only emphasized the jarring present he turned furiously down plashy walk where the rollick of the chorus soon ceased to penetrate and the white fragrance of the wonderful hawthorn avenue made a soothing passageway his tongue felt acrid with anger ale and running and frog farm with the faces of his parents now began to loom more emotionally before him because of the tea as well as the tenderness awaiting him for neither of these luxuries was likely to be absent even if his letteror his fatherhad gone astray let her protect herself this minx of a carrier times odd changeling for his sober little jinny serve her right if some horrid instrument of fate should take down her pride by the time he had come through the mile of hawthorn and defied the plashy hall dog with his stick she had passed out of his thoughts and his indignation against her had changed to indignation against the impudent attemptobvious from the noticeboardsto deny him and the public this oldestablished rightofway things would not have got even thus far had he remained in little bradmarsh he was thinking and he was already brooding over a plan of campaign as he was climbing over the stile back into the high road and then his vaulting leg remained suspended an instant in air in sheer astonishment jinny was facing him from her perch of vantage smiling sweetly from her witching bonnet her cart athwart the road in fact he could hardly step off the stile without treading on methusalems toes relaxing his motion he sat down on the stile staring at her x why will exclaimed jinny and there was now a strange softness in her face and voice how stupid of me not to recognize you when ive got your box all the time his mind still perturbed about the rightofway and bent now upon home could not adjust itself so suddenly to the new situation again his mouth opened without issue her smile faded im daniel quarless granddaughter she said with a little quaver little jinny of blackwater hall so youve remembered me at last his voice came out harsh though inwardly he was melted by this new sweetness then did you know me all the time of coursethe moment i clapped eyes on you he was not consciously romanticizing thats what ive been thinking as i waited here for you im so glad because that shows you were only teasing me saying all those horrid things then a new thought struck her to selfmockery of courseim getting sillyit wasnt so wonderful of you recognizing me with the name of daniel quarles on the cart and she laughed merrily do you know why i didnt recognize you it wasnt only miss flippance put me off and that i couldnt connect you with drums and marionettesit was you yourself that blocked the way i dont understand the old you i meani was thinking about him all the time we were talking and that funny new you wasnt like him one bit thinking of me he was touched whatever made you think of me didnt i just tell you ive got your box and of course i knew you were coming back weve been expecting you for days oh then mother did get my letter his latent illhumour flowed into the new channel of course then why didnt dad come to meet me her mouth twitched humorously at the corners with the suspicion the letter was still unread but she replied i suppose because hes old and hasnt got a trap any more and he knew that tuesday was my day jump up im ever so late he shook his head i cant jump up why whats the matter will her voice was anxious and tender have you hurt your ankle running no no he said petulantly didnt you hear me say id never patronize a woman carrier she smiled in relief yesi heard you say it but that was the silly you his face hardened silly or sensible i stick to my word drumsticks she mocked again jump up and tell me all about your affair with miss flippance dont be saucy jinny it dont become you for the life of him he could not accept her as grown up much less as an equal though she sat on high dominating the situation whip in hand and horn at girdle spick and span and cool while he astride the stile was a forlorn figure with dusty shoes and hot lowering look it becomes me as much as silliness does you said jinny i dont see the silliness why you cant live a week at frog farm without patronizing me who else is there there isnt hardly a trap to be had even miles around why there was a young man i drove out to frog farm last week and a fine todo he had getting home it was not calculated to soothe him and what need had you to drive a young man it was for mariayour mothers pig she was ill her whole litter might have been lost he frowned more darkly pigs he had but just admitted might reasonably come into the feminine ambit still if girls did get to know coarse facts they might at least have the decency not to talk about them and did he call you jinny he grunted he didnt call me maria well traps or no traps he said sullenly youll get no orders from me ive fended for myself in the canadian backwoods where there wasnt even a woman to sew on buttons and i certainly dont need one now but she was still smiling do you know the song of the dashing young lad from buckingham i know you do but whats that to do with it she restarted the merry tune but markedly altered the words a dashing young lad fromcanada once a great wager did lay that hed never use jinny the carrier buthe gave her an order straightway no he wont dont interrupt youve already given it but still hed sing fol de rol iddle ol what order have i given you to carry your box of course still hed sing fol derol lay but that was before i had the ghost of an idea do join in the chorus still hed sing fol de rol iddle ol ill have my trunk at once he cried furiously and sprang off the stile fol de rol arilol lay she wound up with easy enjoyment give me my trunk he commanded again whaton this lonely roadin this weather thats my business no it isntits mine she touched up methusalem and turned his eager nose homewards will ran round with the turning animal give me my trunk he was white with determination and dont you call that an order she cracked her great whip he sprang to the tailboard hanging on by one arm and clutched at the trunk with the other dragging it out but he had forgotten to reckon with the faithful guardian nip excited as at a rabbit sprang from the basket in which he had been resting his four weary limbs and growled ominously and as the burglarious arm did not draw back the terriero almost human ingratitudesprang at it and made his beautiful white teeth meet in its fleshy middle you little beast alarmed more for his finery than his flesh he snatched back the elegant london sleeve and dropped off the cart which soon disappeared down a grim and lonely lane xi he examined the wound in his coat and finding to his relief that it could be neatly patched up he stripped off the garment and surveyed his abraded skin toothmarked and redflecked nips signature in blood then the horrible thought of hydrophobiahe had witnessed a dreadful case in montrealpopped again into his mind after all it was as hot as july and no sane dog would have behaved so disgracefully and then pricked up by the sound of the horn which came vaunting and taunting from the lane he started running after the cart yet once more he must find out if the dog would drink but even the rumbling of the vehicle could no longer be heard and he was slackening hopelessly when he became aware how involuted was this lane and that by trespassing across a ploughed field he could gain several furlongs bounding over the ditch with his coat slung over his arm and nearly tearing it afresh in breaking through the blackberry hedge he ran as recklessly as a foxhunter across the furrows breaking out again like a footpad when he heard methusalems leisurely trot and catching that unreluctant animal by the beribboned headstall jinny manifested no surprise i thought youd get over your silliness she said smiling jump up then im not jumping up he was angrier and hotter than ever ive come to give your dog a drink eh but weve passed the silverlane arms this is no joking matter he must have water he doesnt need any surely i can look after my own dogthats not a mans place too is it its not a question of thatbut if he doesnt drink it may be fatal nonsense a kind cottager offered him water only a mile backhe didnt want it whats the matter youre looking so strange have you had a sunstroke the alarm in her voice reflected the alarm in his face and his alarm was in turn augmented by hers he had a weird vision of that man in montreal thrown into convulsions by the sound of a splash and trying to bite his attendants and a ghastly memory came to him of a bradmarsh woman who had frizzled for her foaming child the liver of the dog that had bitten it suppose your dog should be mad he asked with white lips that already felt frothy nip nonsense he bit me oh im so sorry where let me see i wont but nip never bites all the more suspicious try him with some water please where can i get water nip finds his own you mean to say you dont carry water im not a watercarrier how can you laugh its a question of life and death surely there must be a pond somewhere you know theres nothing hereabouts why you used to come to kelcott to sell water at a halfpenny a pint dont you remember you bought me a monkeyonastick out of the profits how you babble then i must go in suspense drumsticks here nip the dog was in her lap in a twinkling she pulled off her drivingglove and thrust her fingers into its mouth bite nip bite will felt his first conscious flash of romance in all that fagging chase it was like dying together but nips teeth refused to close on his mistresss fingersinstead he growled ominously at will bite you naughty dog and she pressed his reluctant teeth together there she held down towards will two fingers faintly ridged in red and white but instead of feeling a reassuring sanity an impulse he felt really mad streamed through his veins to seize the little fingers in his strong hands and to pull her down from the seat of the mighty down towards the inner breast pocket that held his banknotes but his stick and his coat and methusalems bridle all of which he was holding simultaneously cluttered up his hands sufficiently to clog the impulse that proves nothing he said sulkily and wasnt he lapping at the pool after you struck him ah thats true his face lit up then you did strike him dont tease yes id forgotten he lapped then or rather i scarcely noticed it i suppose you shut your eyes when going for him just like a bull does i didnt go for him i tell you i just swished my stick well if youd kept your eyes open youd have seen him drinking and saved your fright he was disappointed as well as irritated then when you let him bite you you knew there was no danger theres never any danger on these roadsdidnt i tell you so why there was more danger in that monkey you gave me for i sucked the paint off i dont remember giving you any monkey i didnt want a monkey but you made me take itlike that oath in the wagon perhaps youve forgotten that too i can remember giving you a kiss he jerked defiantly that i cant remember said jinny quietly suppose youve had so many since lots said jinny goodbye again if youre so silly gee up methusalem but he clung to the bridle and was dragged along to nips shrilled agitation let go said jinny dont be silly not till i have my trunk thats sillier still give me my trunk i think you have gone mad will thats not your affair miss quarles i want my trunk i was ordered to deliver it at frog farm and i order you to deliver it to me let go she cracked her whip in his direction you little spitfire if you touch me with that whip ill have an action against youas well as against your dog let go my horse then im within my legal rights as any male carrier would know i demand my trunk and i demand my horse let go i wont he was running along with it now keeping pace with the mystified methusalem oh will she cried and you said that on a lonely road i might meet a man wellyou have now he said viciously yesthe first in all my life to give me trouble that hurt worse than any whip he loosed the festive bridle staggering a little and the cart rolled past him only what was that little object in the road ah in the altercation she had forgotten to put on her glove again after that dramatic offer of her fingers to the dogit had tumbled down twould pay her out to lose it he thought savagely however he thrust it into the inner waistcoat pocket where his paper fortune reposed so comfortingly but as again he saw the tailboard with his now protruding box vanishing round a corner a blind rage began to possess him surely he was not thus entirely to be thwarted and overridden surely at least he would not endure her actual delivery of his box at frog farm no he must head her off again if only outside his own gate across his border a woman carrier must in no circumstances be countenanced and once more the unfortunate will flynt ploughed through the hedges and meadows not always remembering the prickly places and finally chased by a bull on which he had to turn several times with his coat and his stick just like a toreador though remembering what jinny had just said about the bull shutting its eyes he dodged it at the charging crises and thus saved both coat and skin but he was forced to scramble ignominiously over a fence into the high road still a good mile from bradmarsh bridge at the very moment the cart came clattering up but if jinny had observed the spanish bullfight she gave no sign what she said as she reined in methusalem was much more surprising ive been thinking you were within your legal right will im sorry a carrier must deliver goods as ordered so if youre still silly if she had stopped before the final clause he might have been touched by the unexpected surrender as it was he only said icily how much do i owe you sixpence she said as frigidly unless youd like a reduction for my not taking it all the way no thank you he passed the coin grazing her warm fingers by the way you didnt happen to see my glove she said your glove he repeated why indeed should he fetch and carry for her let her be punished for her negligence he moved towards his box oh welli suppose itll be there on friday she said im the only person who ever goes that cut drumsticks arent the only things that are dropped he observed maliciously no she agreed simply she did not even seem to remember how she had trounced that fool of a man no sense of humour in the sex he reflected again do hold the brute he cried for nip was again showing his teeth in defence of the box if you kept off a bull you dont need protection against a terrier she replied and to his further amazement there was a note of admiration in her voice the weaker the thing the harder it is to fight he rejoined significantly he had his back now to the cart and he hoisted his trunk upon it youre not going to carry it there was incredulity in her voice for it was a box that looked nearly as long as himself who else he shifted the box to his right shoulder which he had padded with his coat i thought youd go home and get a truck or something and leave it on the road its just as safe as my glove theres no safety for either he said oracularly if a man like me comes along and he swaggered forwards with his huge load why youre as strong as the bull said jinny i am he was flattered and as obstinate as a mule he increased his pace goodbye will he did not answer methusalem caught him up since you are going to frog farm said the carrier why not take your folks groceries too i dont usually get em till friday but when i got your order to go there today why should i do your jobs just what i told you you cant live a week at frog farm without me give me the parcel his forehead was already beaded with perspiration but his left hand heroically held out his stick slide the string on this she shook her head still hed sing fol de rol lay she trilled and in a minute he was hopelessly left behind the road had already begun the ascent towards long bradmarsh but he heard her goading methusalem to greater efforts as though in fear lest he should repent under the burden of his obstinacy xii as soon as she was safely out of sight will breathing heavily slackened his showy pace and very soon lowered his load altogether and sat down upon it while he wiped his streaming countenance the physical relief was great a lark was singing overhead and his eyes followed it restfully till he couldnt tell whether the throb was singing or the song throbbing he must smoke his pipe by this wayside grass after all that scurrying and squabbling fumbling for his matches he felt the bulge of the glove and softened still more anyhow he had been victorious over the vixen and he was resting on his laurels so to speak now that she realized he would never recognize her as a carrier he could afford to give her one of the canadian fallals he had bought at moses sons for his mother and which now reposed in the box arching beneath him that would make her think he had not forgotten her even in canada and anyhow it would show her he bore no malice for the bite or even for her bark surveying the landscape he recognized that by going on a little he would strike the turning to the bridge and the king of prussia where he might possibly find a trap the hussy need never know he had broken down but as he sat there lazily smoking and evoking his boyhood and her part therein the best part of an hour sped glamorously and suddenly he saw red caleb flynt equally coatless was hastening from the bradmarsh direction as fast as his aged limbs could carry him hullo dad he cried startled same old shirt caleb grinned keeps her colour dont she but why didnt you come to meet me said will recalling his grievance oi didsoon as jinny come and told us shed passed you carrying your chest and you might want a hand is that the hutch dash my buttons you must ha growed up like samson fancy carryin that all the way from chipstone in the strong sun will did not deny the featthe explanation would really have been too complicated in his embarrassment he overlooked that his father had not really answered his question and hows mother he said mothers in a great old state nation mad with jinny why whats jinny done sow neglectful bein as you passed him by says mother to she why dednt you stop and pick up the chest he looked uncomfortable and what did jinny say she said she dednt reckonize the old you when she dreft by and besides she was singinglike he winced at the reminder of the song but was grateful to her for telling so truthful a lie instinctively he felt that his folks having accepted a woman carrier with such brainless acquiescence would fail to enter into the fine shades of his feeling mother hadnt a right to make a noise with jinny he said she only kitched of a fire for a moment twas more over you than over jinny oi should reckon bust into tears she did and when oi said maybe as jinny was mistook she nearly bit my head off too lazyboned to goo and give a hand to your own buoyoy says she aint he shifted for hisself nigh ten years says oi cant you wait ten minutes more oi count hell be here before the new jerusalem says oi that dednt pacify her much bein a female cowldbloodedshe called me theres feythers

likewise says oi for tis a poor heart that never rejoices but thats your passion not mine thats what mother said but baint oi to get no compensation says oi and why dednt you write to her all these years willie his face darkened again im no great shakes with a quill and there wasnt anything to say i did write once to tell you i was safe across the atlantic and was gone to make my fortune we dednt never get no letter noit came back months after i forgot to put england on it thinking maybe essex was enough but it seems theres a mount essex in the states down wyoming way and the yanks always think everything is for them so i thought id best let things be being on the go in those days caleb fully sympathized with the plea and have ye made your fortune will he inquired meekly that depends on your idea of a fortune will parried but he had a complacent consciousness of those banknotes behind the glove my idea of a fortune be faith in god said caleb yes yes i know the young man got off the box impatiently caleb tugged at one of its handles lord thats lugsome he said letting the long heavy chest subside ef you aint come back rich youve come back middlin powerful all the way from chipstone he clucked his tongue admiringly having once left the miracle undenied and feeling the situation now altogether beyond explanation to the bucolic intellect will again silently acquiesced in the herculean imputation and took the other handle but why didnt you bring a cart or a truck he asked as they began walking cumbrously towards the bridge aint got nowt but a wheelbarrow caleb explained times is changedoi aint looker no more and theres two housen now old peartree got to have a separate door but twas a good bargain oi put my cross to with the son o the cornish furriner what oi warked for these thirtynine year mother will have it shed ha made a cuter deal she bein a dapster in figgers and reckonin out to a day when the new jerusalem will be droppin down but oi dont howd with women doin mens business bein as your rib cant be your head i quite agree said will surprised to find such enlightened sentiments in his queer old parent but tell me about ben and isaac and the others they dont write neither we was lookin to you to tell us about the others as went furrin ben should be a barber in america and they say as christophers got a woife colour o coffee nonsense dad well maybe twas isaac no flynt would marry a nigger woman said will decisively oim right glad to hear it said caleb for oi count the young uns ud come out streaky and spotty like pigeons or cattle and though they likely turn white when they die and their souls be white all the time oi could never be comfortable along o finchbacked granchilder with such discourse they beguiled the heavy way trudging behind their tall shadows till at the gate of the drive of frog farm they saw martha peering eagerly along the avenue of witchelms in another instant will letting go his boxhandle was choked in her hug and wetted by her tears i can smell those sausages right here mother he said with a smile and a half sob how do ye howd and he emphasized the homely old idiom by patting her wrinkled cheek she caught his hand in hers and he was touched by the thin worn weddingring on the gnarled and freckled hand his eyes roved round but surely this aint the house i was born in why that was a giants castle caleb looked a bit uneasy youre sure this be will he asked martha in one of his thundrous whispers why id know him in a hundred well theres onny nine or ten and he laughed gleefully do be easy caleb youre getting as unrestful as bundock im will right enough will intervened only everything seems to have got so small come along dad he took up his side of the box gracious goodness cried martha perceiving it at last my poor will lugging that from chipstone why didnt you call to jinny to stop and take it how was i to know that that was jinnys cart dashing by he said moving forward quickly i suppose you didnt ask her to stay for the sausages he added lightly i couldnt ask her dearie said martha she was terrible late she said and i know how crotched her wicked old grandfather gets at feedingtime how big shes grown he observed carelessly big they both repeated the word but from a different surprise you said you didnt see her said martha sharply i saw a big young woman flying by in the carti didnt know then it was jinny but you just said everythings growed so little chuckled caleb so it hasall except jinny and she isnt so very big said martha rather undersized some folks would say well im not so oversized myself said will wills seen her toplofty over methusalem explained caleb wait till he sees her on her pegs but i did see her on her pegs said will at the black sheep then why did you goo and carry that little old box inquired caleb she wasnt in the cart thenhow was i to guess she was the carrier he answered crossly but you could ha ast for the bradmarsh carrier the coach was late he snapped but jinny hadnt started yet persisted caleb bein as you seen her there legends my boy legends tony flips euphemism for lies rang in wills brain but legends he was finding are not easy to sustain one lie breeds many and he was sorry now he had allowed himself to be made a champion weightlifter i thought being so late twas no use asking for the carriertwas you i expected he said turning the war back into the enemys country but they had now lumbered up with the box to the twin doors and the task of dumping down the subject of discussion in a convenient place stayed the crossexamination the feast for the prodigal son had been laid in the parlour and the scent of the fried sausages came appetizingly on the evening air more poetic than any of natures competing odours why theres my letter cried will at the parlour door beholding it on the mantelpiece you might have let me know you couldnt meet me he went in and took it down not opened he cried crossly the muggy atmosphere of the sealed chamber adding to his irritation and i told you exactly the day and hour i was coming we havent had time to get it read yet dearie said martha mildly i was going to take it to the dressmaker but saturdays im so busy and sunday was sunday and yesterday i felt as if my ribs were grating together and today was too hot well i shant write again in a hurry he said peevishly and was about to tear the letter in twain but martha snatched it from him with a cry and slipped it into her bosom sit down will she pleaded your sausages are spoiling but the prodigal son would not batten at once upon the fatted calf he felt too dusty he said and then imperiously pushing at the diamondpaned casement and realizing with disgust it would not open vanished in search of soap he cant be well whimpered martha dont worrit dear heart caleb consoled her oi count even samson wanted a wash arter hed lugged that little old gate up the hill from gazy chapter v will at home is not this the merry month of may when lovelads masken in fresh array how falls it then we no merrier ben like as others girt in gaudy green spenser the shepheards calendar i time hung heavy on wills hands the first few days of his return as heavy as the meals heaped before him by the adoring martha there was as much for bever as for breakfast yet quantity did not suffice him he became almost as finnicking and fractious as cousin caroline not content for example to strain the pondwater through muslin for the larger insects but insisting on its being boiled indeed hinting preposterously that the mortality among his unknown brothers and sisters might have been connected with potations on which caleb and martha had patently flourished he held views on the houserefuse ignoring calebs plea that the best drain be a pig and by making hinges the very first evening for the lower windows to open by he had raised such a draught in the house that it was all they could do to keep their bedroom and their kitchen airtight and even martha was glad when on the wednesday afternoon he went off to get some fishing in the brad and the windows could all be closed up again but the few dace and bullheads that rewarded his rod left too many intervals for reflection and in the unsettlement of his thoughts before settling down to a judicious expenditure of his ninety pounds he felt he needed more deadening exertion he tried poling against the stream to that ancient faery islandsomebodys halfdecked shooting punt was doing no good rusting on the bank in the offseason he thoughtbut the process soon became automatic and his mind was still restless while after the islands of the st lawrence this enchanted playground of his youth seemed tame and its prettiness trivial he fed his fancy on a saltwater expedition for the thursday recalled the great catches of flatfish he and his brothers had made the sport to be got out of the voracious if inedible bullrout but it would be a very long walk and what if when one arrived the tide should be too low so he walked inland around bradmarsh common but though it was he told himself the old haunts that he went out for to see he omitted to revisit that venerable landmark gaffer quarles conscience adjured him he ought to look up the old carrier whether for respect or reproofand he actually did hover around blackwater hallbut pride forbade his entering lest he stumble upon the new carrier the hall appeared even more dwindled to him than frog farm as he stood surlily surveying it even the commonafter the canadian prairieseemed no longer to roll towards the blue infinities he had a strong impulse to burst in on that careless old daniel and give him a piece of his mind even at the risk of meeting his gadabout granddaughter but the bleating of the goats sounded forbidding and as he was hesitating he found himself under the gaze of another gaffer the crown of whose battered beaver tied on to its brim with coloured strings gave him a festal grotesquerie will remembered this ancient though despite his gay headgear he now seemed inexpressibly grimy in his patched corduroys his two ragged coats and the dirty towel wound round his throat it was the quarless nearest neighbour uncle lilliwhyte who lived in a cottage also on the common trading in cress cherries and mushrooms driving home obstreperous cows and doing other odd jobs this worthy was now exercising his equal right of gathering sticks on the common and the sordid association seemed to reduce jinny to the same shrunken proportions as her cottage buy a nadder sir sir yes after all his father had been a looker not a mere labourer he himself had a waistcoat lined with banknotes and cut by moses son why should he expect a sense of dignity from a girl of so lowly a status let her earn her livelihood as she wishedit was not his affair except in so far as she should have none of his custom a cock crew lustily and it subtly heartened him up yes he would go in now give her back her glove professing to have just picked it up and wash his hands of her for ever no thank you uncle he said with an irrelevant memory of the ancients blind mother what should i do with an adder but thats a real loive nadder just kitched sir he cautiously displayed its hissing head and darting tongue theres many a slowworm killed for a woiper pore things onny fowrpence sir well heres sixpence said will graciously no no he explained hastily as the ancient began handing over the wriggling reptile kill the beggar and he hurried homewards on second thoughtsinspired perhaps by some dim impression of a female figure flitting among the clotheslines behind the hallhe would not risk an encounter with jinny but make a special call upon poor lonely old daniel on the morrow jinny would then be out on her rounds and if he took care to go at about the hour she was due at frog farm he could avoid her at both places yes that were tactics worthy of a man of the world casual conversation with his elders reminded him however that jinny was not expected that friday she had already left the parcel of groceries on the tuesday he was thus safe from her for eight dayshe had only to remain at home but the discovery that the whole of friday was free from any possibility of her appearance at frog farm and that blackwater hall was equally immune from her presence seemed to remove the zest of his diplomacy neighbour quarles remained unvisited his solitude unmitigated and will wandered aimlessly on the high road between bradmarsh and chipstone the year was at its most beautiful moment the hedges were white with hawthorn and the fresh young leaves on the trees gave an exquisite sense of greenness without blurring the structural grace of the branches while the unspoiled cadence of the cuckoos cry came magically over the sunny meadows but will could only swish viciously with his stick at the hedges and litter the lanes with ruined blossom it was with no little surprise that as he and his elders sat at high tea on this same evening they heard the windings of jinnys horn the three sprang up then will sat down again aint you comin out to see jinny asked caleb let the boy drink his tea said martha but you aint never spoke to her yet persisted caleb and you used to give her eggs let the boy eat his eggs himself said martha sternly oi dednt mean they eggs laughed caleb do go and see what jinny can want martha commanded him i shouldnt be surprised if it is eggsnow that mr flippance has opened his show hell be wanting them regularly whatever for asked will he sucks em raw like weasels him and his darter explained caleb they should say its good for the woice and by all accounts showmen fares to have a mort o pieces to speak but why doesnt jinny sell him her own eggs asked will how do you know she has them asked martha quickly hasnt she he said lightly reddening like the comb of the cock he had heard crowing not enough that old sinner eats her out of house and home mr flippance murmured will no no her grandfather why dont you go caleb will sat on stolidly helping himself to more tea and pouring the milk into the slopbasin presently caleb returned announcing that jinny had brought something for willshe could only legally deliver it to mr flynt junior she said will turned redder than at the eggtalk but i never ordered anything he said you cant prewent folks sendin you presents same as theyre foolish enough caleb reminded him a fantastic fear that the blueeyed girl of the train was discharging some proof of devotion at him made him drum nervously with his teaspoon but who knows im back home he answered caleb through the open housedoor came the gay strains of a fresh young voice but still hed sing fol de rol iddle ol dont she sing pritty sighed caleb id sooner hear her singing about zion said martha shes rather flighty to my thinking thats the first time oi heard ye say a word agen jinny said caleb leastways behind her back will tingling between the two torturesthe song without and the tabletalk withinsprang up brusquely drat the girlmy teall get cold sit down dad ill see what shes brought ii jinny sat stiffly on her seat nip clasped in her arms the singing had ceased despite himself will felt an odd pleasure in the sight of the trim figure so competently poised above methusalem and he was touched to note nips tail agitating itself amicably at the sight of him good evening she said politely i am glad to see it has not developed what hasnt developed your hydrophobia and i am keeping the dog tight you notice he winced oh im not afraid of him but i amhes already bitten you once get the cages please while i hold him the cages he had a confused idea that nip was to be caged was dangerous after all theyre near the tailboard nothing to pay he went behind the cart wondering semiincredulous did indeed perceive a couple of cages in the dusk and reaching for one drew back his hand in a hurry from some darting snapping creamy pinkeyed yellowness oh he cried involuntarily whats the matter oh i had forgotten they bite too what is this practical joke he cried angrily eh said jinny didnt you order a pair of ferrets to be sent by the carrier his eyes grew wide i beg your pardonid quite forgotten i thought deacon mawhood wasnt a likely joker polecats he said have you got the cages she asked not looking back imim getting them he stammered and began cautiously haling them towards him the deacon asked me to say the hob and the jill must be kept apart i know he grunted almost as shocked as over her mention of marias litter the impudicity of her calling was again borne in on him anything else burst from him sardonically noexcept theres no need to cope them i dont know what coping is its what you want he said brutally muzzling afraid of my bite too asked jinny and turning towards the interior shelf that held the smaller parcels she began to sing softly to herself a dashing young lad from buckingham he had been expecting canada at the end and felt somehow disappointed at its absence but when i gave the order he rejoined notwithstanding i didnt know that the bradmarsh carrier was a girl that didnt prevent you using her when you did know she said quietly when have i used her he cried hotly well what about this she produced from the shelf in the cart a long parcel half enclosed by a string in broken dirty paper within which showed a layer of grimy straw but what is it thats not my business she tendered it downwards i never ordered this hadnt you better open it she asked with a twinkle he dumped down the cages violently to the alarm of the ferrets and tore it open only to shudder back before the clammylooking coils an adder as well said jinny you going to open a menagerie its dead he said did you want a live one i didnt want one at alli never ordered it why uncle lilliwhyte told me he sold it to you for fourpence and you gave him twopence extra to kill it i beg your pardonhe misunderstood it was his second apology but what a dirty way to deliver it did you expect me to nurse a viper in my bosom again this indelicate speech hardly atoned for by its wit the old ragamuffin he muttered furiously how did the idiot know it was me fellowfeeling i suppose said jinny now youre saucy again you must have told him it was me right for once honest uncle was upset at your forgetting to tell him where to send your purchase i was milking my goats and saw you hanging about again he flushed uneasily and how much do i owe you he asked hurriedly twopence for the viper being only a short way the deacon says he prefers to pay the freightage on the ferrets and to collect it from you himself he put down the strawentangled snake on top of one of the cages and pulled out a coin have you got change for sixpence not unless i loose nip she fumbled with one hand in her pocket he glowered oh next time will do he said angrily oh then there is to be a next time not so far as i am concerned sure you dont want any more wild animals no he shouted dont be so fierce the drumstick is found you will be glad to hear he grunted and the show is doing big business mr flippance tells me he was so set up he gave me a pair of new gloves that old braggart what business had he to give you gloves didnt i lose one through his drumstick but then tis me ought to pay for them he protested you what nonsense why it was on my account you lost the glovethrough trying to get a bite she smiled you talk as if i were an angler i wish you were anything but a carrier dont say that would you like me to buy another pair of gloveson your account if you would he said eagerly thank you but still hedsing fol de rol iddle ol what size do you take stow that folderiddlingyou know i dont mean gloves for me are you taking back the order she said with feigned disappointment i never gave you an order he said goaded id cut my tongue out sooner keep your tongue between your teeth youll want it to give me an order with before youre a week older never id as soon shoe a horse with a hairpin he snatched up his cages decisively one in each hand and the adder rolled on to the ground bursting its strawy cerements the girls grey eyes flashed steellike and cant i drive as well as granfer and dont i know the roads and she uplifted her horn from her girdle and blew a resounding blast of defiance it set all the cocks crowing behind the house and brought caleb bustling from within it did you summon me jinny he asked gracious will whatever you got there his eyes expanded to see the sinuous animals swirling fiercely against their wires in coming nearer to peer at them he stumbled over the snake and uttered a cry its all right called jinny its dead you killed it willie he asked with a drumstick said jinny gravely fiddlesticks father said will angrily oi dont care what sort o stick you killed that with said caleb so long as its a dead corpse but do ye come in nowmothers grousin about the tea gittin cold i like cold tea go in father im just coming he harked back to her blast of rebellion you may be able to drive and you may know the roads but cant you see how unnatural it is you perched up there and blowing a horn like dick burrage of the county flyer and do i blow it as fine as he she asked eagerly anybody can blow a horn he answered curtly can they now she was piqued again id like to see anybody do it why granfer cant granfer hasnt got much breath left im not talking of men in their eighties he is in his nineties she corrected exactly i meant anybody with proper lungs can you blow it why shouldnt i be able to blow it all right blow it said jinny gravely she unslung it with one arm and held it down he gazed at it taken aback sandwiched between his cages its no good opening your mouth she said im not going to stick it in youll have to put down those horrible beasts and do that yourself why dont they keep still they make my head ache he moved to the back of the house to place the ferrets out of the way kicking the poor adder before himit was a needed relief to his feelings returning thus purged he took the proffered hornit was not a professional coachhorn or posthorn but just the little instrument of a master of foxhounds curling into a circle aboveand with but scant misgiving put it to his mouth and blew but the silence remained unbroken he puffed on and on with solemn pertinacity not a sound issued his cheeks swelled to burstingpoint and grew redder and redder with shame and vexation but silence still reigned you mustnt put it inside your lips corrected jinny think youre tumtumming into a comb he readjusted it sullenly but the music within was still coy slacken your lip she advised try to splutter brrrrr into it but whatever he spluttered into it nothing came out i never realized it was quite so difficult even the lipping said jinny simply of course i didnt expect you to do the double or treble tonguing at once what do you mean tonguing he inquired morosely dividing the notes say tucker tucker tucker into it but its blowing not saying said will obstinately but secretly he modified his methods and at last a ghostly plangency or a staccato squeak began to reward his apoplectic agonizings and the still prisoned nip who had been yawning in utter boredom now accompanied the music with a critical and lugubrious howling upon this spectacle and situation reissued the guileless caleb and had the crystal city itself come down upon earth his eyes could scarcely have orbed themselves more spaciously he didnt summon you observed the merciless jinny go away father what are you staring at yapped the tortured young man you do be a fine musicianer and caleb grinned but do ye dont play nowmothers gittin into her tantarums over your tea the instrument must be out of order said will handing it up crossly to jinny remorselessly she drew from it a clarion call that made the welkin ring and the poultryyard respond in kind how the cocks crow she observed artlessly thinks because she blows a horn shes a devil of a fellow will remarked witheringly to his receding father say jinny why dont you wear the breeches like those bloomerites you told me of i will she responded sweetly if you think it more becoming me you dont suppose i notice what you wear then how do you know im not wearing em now you have me there and he smiled despite himself the smile lit up the face under the aureole of red hairit seemed to jinny a sudden glimpse through a rift of time of the boy she had known all the same he protested if i had a horn i could learn it in an hour well get one said jinny where can i get one he retorted fretfully dearie your tea it was martha herself now oh id get you one said jinny carelessly but ill wager you wont blow it properly in a week much less an hour a week what nonsense in a moment in a moment i was speaking to mother whatll you wager a pair of gloves said jinny done said will she clucked to methusalem goodbye she called to the couple as the cart moved off ill deliver your order next friday willwithout fail dearie whatever are you running after her for cried martha he came back sheepishly i thought the gate wasnt open from the bradmarsh road the sound of the folderol refrain came sweetly on the quiet air i wish she would sing of zion repeated martha wistfully iii the pair of polecat ferretscreamy white albinos pink of eye and black of bellyhung in the cages on the back wall of the farmhouse with a spare cage beside them as a retiringplace when a hutch was turned out but only onceon the saturday in the first ardour of possessionhad will taken them out ahunting on which occasion they had refused to rat or rabbit indeed their leaps and gambols persuaded will that they pursuedas he remembered the deacon once maintaining sympathetically about ratstheir private sports why indeed should sensible creatures comfortably fed on chickenhead and blackbirds and provided with straw to cocoon themselves against cold go squeezing into holes or drains restored to captivity these fainant ferrets spent most of their day in squirming with desperate restlessness from one end of the cage to the other and perking their quivering noses and little black claws through the wires and their masters own plight was much the same for after the prairie frog farm was only a hutch to him his father too being so unexpectedly on the shelf there was nothing that really needed him nor was there any land for sale in the vicinity on which he might commence operations like his ferrets if with a larger run he swayed restlessly to and fro from farm to river from river to common from common to steeples wood from steeples wood to frog farm when he was not thus oscillating on the landscape he was sweating in intellectual indecision in the parlour trying to write a little note to jinny to inform her that she was to come to frog farm no more inasmuch as he intended to go into chipstone himself once or twice a fortnight and could easily bring home whatever was necessary he had thought that when he had found a feather dropped by a green goose cut his quill concocted an ink out of soot and water and discovered a piece of white paper wrapped round his banknotes that his difficulties were over but the worst now remained for he could not satisfy himself as to the phraseology of this note being as he had truly pleaded no great shakes at letterwriting such glibness as he could muster in conversation was paralysed in fact by a pen there was not even one of those wordbooks he had seen scholarly people use to ensure the spelling and one must not unnecessarily afford material to a minx whohaving obviously to do with bills and accountsmight conceivably be literate he had a vague remembrance of her reading texts quite easily at the sundayschool young as she was even if she could spell no better than he she might possess one of these spellingprotectors the only book at frog farm being his mothers bible he tried to secure accuracy by limiting himself to its words but its vocabulary seemed strangely lacking he had decided for example to begin with maddam one could not call such a stranger as the new jinny dear miss he thought and miss alone sounded thin and abrupt no maddam was the mouthfilling resonance necessary it struck a note of massive dignity but did it really have two ds and to his amazement and anguish neither maddam nor madam was to be discovered from genesis to revelation adam the nearest analogue who came in his reference volume with welcome promptitude even precipitateness had he found only one d but was he a sure guide to the orthography of the creature formed out of his spare rib this and the many other curious and amazing passages that beguiled him on his routepresented thus to a fresh and worldexperienced eyeran away with so much time that martha would be summoning him to the next of his many meals before he had even dipped his quill into the soot mr william flynt presents his complements was another promising starthe had got a debtdemanding letter once at a boardinghouse with this austerely courteous overturebut alasmarvel on marvelthere did not appear to be a single complement whether in the old testament or the new not a very courteous people the jews he thought under either dispensation this happygolucky hunt for wordsan exciting steeplechase in which one skipped over spacious histories and major prophets with the chance of tumbling on the very wordbegan to be an absorbing substitute for ratting the epistles of james suddenly caught his eye ah here was a complete guide to letterwriting he felt hopefully what was good enough for james would do for william but when written out william the son of caleb of frog farm to jinny quarles of blackwater hall little bradmarsh greeting did not seem quite the correct opening an epistle of john was even more misguiding the elder to the elect or wellbeloved clearly inappropriate to the point of absurdity still with modifications epistles must surely be valid models so he started writing and rewriting wrestling and hunting and polishing but the wordchase had now to be supplemented by a paperchase how keep pace in paper with this orgy of penmanship every corner of the house was ransacked with meagre results he even meditated stealing back his own letter from his mother knowing it had a blank flysheet but it was always jealously guarded it was not till he came on farmer gales boyschoolward boundand paid him twopence for the remains of a penny copybook that he could surrender himself freely to the labours of the file an hour before this large layingin of material he had gone through a curious crisis he had found in his purse in a last desperate quest a piece of paper which unfolded afforded a welcome white surface he was composing quite a successful letter upon it when on turning it over he came upon the address of the forgotten blueeyed charmer of the chelmsford train with frowning brow he tore it into small pieces it was not merely that the letter was spoilt for sending it was the juxtaposition with jinnyback to backthat seemed suddenly profane iv after several days gestation many words and turns of expression having to be rejected and replaced by phrases whose spelling could be ascertained from the bible the letter emerged as hereunder in a pale and aqueous ink william flynt to the damsel of blackwater hall greeting this epistle doth proclaim in the name of the generations of frog farm that methuselah shall not come to pass here henceforward inasmuch as behold here am i to purchase whatsoever is verily to be desired from chipstone be it candles or oil or spice or any manner of thing whatsoever nor shall you carry forth aught hence for lo we will make no further covenant with you or aught that is yours peace be with you as thank god it leaves me at present yours truly william flynt pslet not your horn be exalted nor speak with a stiff neck for surely this is not the way to find grace in the eyes of the discerning but even this exalted effusion did not survive the first glow of satisfaction for although it was treasured up as too good to destroy and did not sound unlike the language that the brothers and sisters held in the meetinghouse he could not remember ever seeing a letter thus couched it was succeeded by a homelier version in which the word epistle stood out as the only connectinglink with a composition playing now for safety and mainly monosyllabic it would be a poor diplomacy not to work in one highclass word of whose spelling he was sure this epistle is to say the new version began abruptly that we dont need you to call on frydays good heavens even friday was not to be found in the bible pursuing this astonishing line of investigation he realized that sunday itself was absent from its pages the bible without sunday o incredible discoveries of the illuminated he altered it following genesis to the sixth day but then came a paralysing doubt whether it was not the fifth for how could you rest on sunday if that was not the seventh he casually remarked to his mother that it was odd they did not rest on the seventh day as commanded in genesis she explained to him that sunday was the lords day but he seemed dissatisfied with the argument perhaps moses son were not so wrong he remarked repenting of his resentment against them for being closed that saturday he woke up the next morning with the solution of dodging the mention of the day and merely relieving jinny of the duty of markiting for them he felt sure that this word could be found remembering a text about two sparrows being sold for a farthing but to his chagrin it was not in the markit that they were sold in steeplechasing for the word he tumbled on a text in hosea blow ye the cornet in gibeah and the trumpet in ramah and that seemed like an omen yes he would blow it in bradmarsh if not in ramah let him wait till she came with the horn then after whelming her with the wonder of his execution he could face to face and free of orthography bid her trouble frog farm no more and the postscript of his great letter let not your horn be exalted nor speak with a stiff neck rang through his mind again like a prophetic warning against overweening damsels hes come back a new soul martha reported to caleb with shining eyes hes found god caleb shook his head sceptically hes too boxed up for thathe dont open his heart enough but he opens the bible urged martha and he wont close it even for meals i can never get it for myself nowadays dednt you read me as the devil can spout scripture said caleb shrewdly for shame caleb anybody can see how changed the boy isthe only thing that makes me anxious is his sabbatarian leanings suppose he should go and join the seventhday baptists dip hisself o saturdays no notis those that keep sunday on saturday theres two in long bradmarsh but i hope will wont go straying into strange paths you better enlighten him said caleb them as is powerful enough to carry boxes from chipstone aint allus bright in the brainpan oi count it ud be aukard if he fared to keep sunday on saturday bein as hed want the sunday dishes fust and wed get em cold theres higher considerations than the stomach said martha severely the stomach aint low and it aint high maintained caleb the lord put the stomach in the middle so as we shouldnt neither worship it nor forgit it the only sunday meal that matters persisted martha is the bread and the wine and though theres no lords table nigh such as i could find dozens of in london nor nobody to worship with except you yet if you go on scoffing my duty to my brethren and sisters of the synagogue will be to withdraw from you and where will you goo he asked in alarm i wont go anywherewithdraw only means that it is forbidden to break bread with you he was relieved oi dont mind so long as you dont goo away and what will you do in the day of ezekiel thirtyeight when gog and magog dash themselves to pieces against israel and when the eighth of daniel comes to pass and the great horn is broken and the little horn stamps upon the host of heaven oi count it wont be just yet he said uneasily you count wrong to my reckoning the two thousand three hundred days of daniel are nigh up in the great day of isaiah four when the tabernacle rises again with the cloud and smoke and the flaming fire the people of god shall rise too from their graves while the others sleep then you can wake me up dear heart he said bein as youre sure to be up she shook her head you were always up first sweetheart but that day youll sleep on and ill have no power to rouse youunless says isaiah you look unto me and be saved dust to dustthat shows were not immortal by nature but ef its comin so soon oi shant be in my grave at all he urged anxiously and oi can push into the tabernacle no more easy than for wasps to push into the hive youve seen the bees push em back but one or two does get in and oi reckon oill take hold o your skirt same as you been readin me i read you therell be ten men to take hold of it she said nine other men he cried angrily but they wont have no right to take hold o my wifes skirt thats what zechariah saysten men of all languages calebs gloom relaxed he was thinkin o chemsford and sechlike great places full o furriners he said decisively here theres onny master peartree and the shepherd aint a goloiath oill soon get riddy o him happen he dont hook hisself to you with his crook but ill pull in will too said martha v but jinny did not appear on friday with the musical instrument only the unexpected arrivedin the shape of bundock that royal messenger was visibly hipped as he delivered the letter to will a womans writing he observed reproachfully that means dragging me here time and again but will had broken open the highclass adhesive envelope and was already absorbed in the letter sirmr quarles thanks mr william flynt for his esteemed order but regrets to inform him that a coachhorn of suitable size for a man is not to be had in chipstone they have not even got a little huntinghorn like mine i will however superscribe to chelmsford and get you one without fail trusting for your further patronage yours truly daniel quarles nball orders carried outor inwith punctuality and dispatch goods sent off without fail to any part of europe america and australia psplease inform your hond parents that as she brought qf of groceries that tuesday i shall not call again till i deliver your instrument so jinny had got in first in the penfight and her letter bowled him over not only by its bland assumption that she was already established as his carrier but by the fluency and scholarship of its style with its incomprehensible superscribe and qf he felt baffled too and even snubbed by the signature which gave her a businesslike remoteness and even a legitimate status as a mere representative of the masculine besides making him feel he had lost a chance by not sending off one of his many scrawls to the address of this same daniel quarles his answer would now require the profoundest excogitation he felt as he adjusted her missive between the banknotes and the glove there was moreover the material problem of vying with this real and fashionable correspondence paper ultimately he became conscious that bundock was still standing at attention do you want anything he asked tartly im waiting for the answer said bundock nobly or you wont catch a post till tomorrow night unless you trudge to long bradmarsh oh theres no answernone at all thank you all the same thank you said bundock its not often folks consider me nowadaysespecially when theres a woman in the case they just go on shuttlecocking letters till my feet are sore but it isnt a woman said will stiffly its just a business letter from gaffer quarles and he pulled it out and the little glove fell out with it which did not lessen his annoyance daniel quarles never put his fist to a pen this ten year asserted bundock he was glad to be done with writing says my father for daniel was never brought up to be a carrier his parents never dreaming hed inherit the business why not isnt he the eldest the contrairy blackwater hall and the bit of land is one of those queer properties that go to the youngest if you die without a will the youngest ay and thats what daniel was borough english tis called by scholars said bundock impressively however he picked up a little from his brother sidrach who had already set up as a carrier on his own account round about harwich and a pretty business he did old sidrach says my father before he was discovered to be an owler and had to fly to america were they so persecuted murmured will and didnt they deserve itsmuggling our good english wool into france packhorses they loaded with it the rascals oh i thought they were a sect bundock laughed thats with an aitch though i dare say many a man owled all the week and howled on sundayhe he he do you knowbetween you and iwho it is writes the hymns the village idiot answered will smartly you told me so when i was a boy he added seeing the postmans disconcerted expression bundock brightened up ah i thought twas too clever for you but as for this letter o yours its clearly a womans handwriting and if jinny once begins writing to her customers its a bad lookout for me bundock might well feel a grievance for this was the first letter jinny had ever written to a client indeed to anybody with the exception of old commander dap who clinging to the friendship struck up at his wifes funeral sent her birthday presents and the gossip of the watch vessel to him she had written as her heart and her illiteracy prompted but the elegant epistle received by will flynt was not achieved without considerable pains she had the advantage however of not being limited to the bible for her vocabulary possessing as she did an almost modern guide in the shape of an olla podrida of a spellingbook whose first edition dated no further back than the year of the lisbon earthquake the universal spellingbook had originally belonged to the owler and it was from the almost limitless resources of this quaint reservoir that with a pardonable desire not to be outshone by her muchtravelled neighbour she culled both the superscribe defined as to write over and the qf given in the list of abbreviations as standing for the latin of a sufficient quantity except that she misread the long s for an f the immaculate spelling was however no mean feat for the books vocabulary was very incomplete and devoid of order so that she had almost as much steeplechasing to do as her rival letterwriter moreover she must fain study whole columns of traps for the unwary where the terms of her own occupation appeared with disconcerting frequency if there was not in the letter any necessity for distinguishing between glutinous and gluttonous rheum and rome or any risk of confusing a widow with a relic still seller fare dueany of which she might have neededall had their dangerous doubles and she did not write call without carefully discriminating it from cawl of a wig or bowels punctuality and dispatch was lifted bodily from miss gentrys billheads and if she did not offer to send off goods to asia and africa it was because only europe america and australia figured on mr flippances posters the recipient of this impressive communication was staggered by the strides in female education made since his boyhood he betook himself at onceto his mothers joyto the bible like a cromwell before a great battle martha had stolen the book back to the kitchen and was pondering texts anxiously when he wandered in to hunt for it who sent you a letter she inquired uneasily old quarles he answered readily its about an order he cant supply and he asks me to tell you his granddaughter wont be coming today marthas face lit up what a pity she cried she might have taken my bonnet to miss gentry to be retrimmed martha had become reconciled to this minor vanity now it was strategically unnecessary however your young legs can do that dearie now theyre back cant they with pleasure mother he said all unconscious of the lapsed plan why waste money on carriers she kissed him passionately but seeing his anxiety to be at the bible she released him i should look at revelation one ten willie she advised and youll understand why the sabbath yes yes he interrupted soothingly also colossians two sixteen and seventeenthe seventh day is but a shadow of things to come i see he said escaping it took hours of hard theological studyindeed till saturday morningbefore the reply to jinny shaped itself sirmr william flynt thanks mr daniel quarles for his esteemed epistle and regrets to learn that a coachhorn of suitable size for a gentelman is not to be had in chipstone i beseech you however not to superscribe to chelmsford as methuselah cannot fetch such a compass and the righteous man regardeth his beast neither do i require a horn at her hand now or henceforwards yours truly william flynt psdo you think that a maiden of your years aught to superscribe alone to chelmsford a city full of lewdness and abominations where men use deceit with their tongues and the poison of asps is under their lips what are you writing will said his mother coming in to sun herself in his holy studies nothing he put his hand over the page of the copybook forgetting she could not read it are you writing to jinny she inquired suspiciously no noits daniel he corrected daniel she said in amaze about the sabbath no about the horn he blurted out petulantly the horn she was wildly excited is it the little horn or the great horn he was amazed well it began with the little horn martha was radiant she poured forth her own theory of the beast in daniel and emboldened by his silent agreementwhen his daze changed into comprehension of her misunderstandingshe proceeded to elaborate her interpretation of the two thousand three hundred days of sacrifice he meantime was finally deciding to turn daniel into miss except in the address vi but wills letter could not be postedfor many reasons he possessed neither an envelope to vie with jinnys nor one that was closed with outside devices nor any sealingwax to make his letter its own envelope he could only fold it into a cockedhat and deliver it himself apart from these material reasons he could not well let bundock carry an answer when he had denied there would be any and he shrank from conducting his affairs under that official inquisition moreover haste was imperative if he was to save the girl from that difficult and dangerous journey for superscribe conveyed to him a sense of precipitation and he saw her cart almost stampeding to chelmsford at any moment she might set out in quest of the great horn that was why he abandoned the idea of toiling to chipstone to emulate her refined writing materials he must hie to blackwater hall that very afternoon and play postman he would not of course enter the house but would find a way of slipping the letter in the surreptitious deed he meditated gave him almost a skulking air as he neared the common and he shrank from the observation of all he met though with the exception of uncle lilliwhyte in a corduroy sleeved waistcoat driving cows with a weedhook and an old crone who stopped and muttered with twisted head he saw only frightened partridges whirring above or rabbits and fieldmice scurrying at his feet near blackwater hall he encountered two of jinnys milchgoats tethered pasturing on the hedgerows and their bleat had a cynical ring the common itself seemed almost to meet the sky for clouds had gathered as suddenly as the crowd by the silverlane pump he was feeling dispirited as he stole towards the house but as he caught sight of the stables and barn at the rear it seemed a happy idea to plant his note in some obtrusive coign his heart beat like a raw burglars as he stood surveying from afar the primitive sheds whose roofs were thatch whose gates palings whose sides faggots and in one of which he could see methusalems head in a trough of oats the stableshed would be the surest place he thought or perhaps he could pin the note on to the harness he saw hanging in an adjoining shed from nails in the beams coming nearer to peer at methusalems manger he was startled by the sight of a brown smockfrocked figure crouched on the littered dungy floor and belatedly brushing methusalems fetlocks before he could escape he saw the wizened snowbearded hornspectacled face turned up at him and heard himself recognized in a weakened but unmistakable voice why bless my soul ef that baint little willie flynt daniel quarles rose and straightened himself to his full height but nothing in little bradmarsh had seemed to will so pitifully shrunken little willie flynt indeed towered over the patriarch who had once seemed herculean to him yet if the robustiousness that the old carrier had preserved in his eighties had vanished at last there was still fire in his eye and a fang or two in his mouth hope you are well mr quarles said will recovering from the double shock of discovering and being discovered no you dont my lad piped the gaffer did youd a come sooner seein as time is gettin away from me did jindid your granddaughter tell you i was back she aint scarcely told me nawthen else wills cheeks burned you aint come back improved says she wills flush grew redder but oi dont agree with heryouve growed like a prize marrow come into the house and she shall make you a dish o tayoi dont drink it myself bein as oi promised john wesley no thank youid rather talk where we are well oi cant inwoite you in heretis too mucky he gave methusalems tail a final flick with the brush and its blowin up for rine well goo into the barn and he led the way imperiously round by a great and ramifying appletree that hid a little black door secured by a padlock and infinite knots of string one has to be witty he commented patiently undoing the complications with so many thieves about to steal my dole hay will had not heard of these thieves and thought little bradmarsh must be changed indeed but he waited silently wondering what to do with his note and as he stood thus there came from the cottage the sound of a girls singing fortunately it was not satirical so will could hear it with pleasure of all the horses in the merry greenwood the bobtailed mare bears the bells away always jolly my little mavis said the patriarch fumbling on and unable to resist the infection his sepulchral bass voice took up the carters chorus there is hey there is ree there is hoo there is gee oi wouldnt unlock the barn he broke off to explain as the door swung open ef oi hadnt such good company he stood peering suspiciously into the tall raftered and beamed glooms redolent of old hay and punctuated with a few cobwebbed and rusty instruments amid the endless litter wills eye was fascinated by an old winebarrel flanked by a chaffcutter and a turnipcutter and covered with boards and weights he divined it held corn and was thus closed against rats and a whiff of aniseed came up in memory and in a flash he saw the faces of tony flip and the deaconand himself flying after a carriers cart theyve stole my flail cried the gaffer why there it is under that straw said will oh ay but there was more logs oill goo bail drat em cant they chop for theirselves itll be that uncle lilliwhyte oh but hes only too honest said will incautiously there aint nobody honest barked the gaffer but he sent me an adder he began not he twas jinny told him to send the adder hed ha kept your sixpence and let you whistle for your sarpint but next time you want an adder you come to me do you sell em too he murmured surprised oi be an adder what do you mean his spectacles glowed strangely read your bible young mandan is an adder in the path what biteth the horses heels so that the rider should fall backwardsthats the blessing of jacoband let no man try to ride roughshod over the likes o me will shrank back before the passion of his words indeed in that gloomy old barn he began to feel a bit nervous ive brought a note for jinny he said hastily will you give it to her the old man took the cockedhat mr daniel quarles he read slowly but its for me wills blush was now papaverous nono he stammered it was a conjuncture he had not foreseen the fire in the old eye leapt up at the contradiction shot through the spectacles plain as a pikestaffmr daniel quarles and then you has the imperence to say there aint no thieves but ye cant bamboozle me oi could read afore you could woipe your nose with a muckinger ay and my feyther afore me carriers ha we been for over a hundred year and my big brother sidrach he had his own packhorses loaded up with waluable stuff and writ me a piece ten year ago come haysel sayin as he hoped oi should jarney to see him and please god oi will he gittin old but where is he asked will glad that the gaffers monologue had drifted from its angry beginning in babylon babylon gasped will whose recent theological excursions had made him almost at home in that purpureal city thats my nickname for chemsford chuckfull o lewdness and churchfolk but oive been meanin to goo and look sidrach up and hear all about his travels he bein a rare one for adwentures but somehow what with my carryin work and one thing and the tother my days fly bylike the

whether oi ever clap eyes on my beloved brother agen a nation cowld day it was he had to goo awaythe brad all ice and they should be tellin of the chemsford coach as come in without the driver and he fallen down on the road frozen stiff as a sparrow what year was that asked will to keep the conversation on this more agreeable level it was the year my brother sidrach went away said daniel quarles simply nation cowld we heerd that in lunnon the river was as froze as ourn and fluefull o sportsbooths and turnabouts and pigs roasted whole and great crowds to see a young bear baited but feythers

in nay this was but a bonfire to be lit when bony landed all along blackwater we was ready for the inwasion and when the beacon was fired that was to be the signal the soldiers was to goo to the coast and the ciwilians inland but bony never come and twas a great waste and sidrach never come neither nation cowld the day he went awayoi moind me gooin through a foot o snow across chipstone poorpiece to the church to see the knight templar what was dug up in the north aisle pickled inside three coffins but theyd put him back in the outer lead time oi arrived they should say it was a sort o mushroom ketchup as kept him together for the resurrection daya bit blackish but wellnigh as sound and goodlookin as you it was a compliment that made the young man shudder again ah there is the rain he exclaimed with relief at the hearty patter on the appletree but the old man would not be fobbed off so enjoyable a topic three coffinslead ellum and a shelltwas a witty way agin them bodysnatchersyou aint safe agin thieves even in your tomb and when youre above ground they tries to steal your wery letters he pulled open the note its merely addressed to you as head of the business

quarles i dont like journeying to chelmsford look at the ps it was imprudent counsel for as the gaffer followed it his face became a black cloud the fire in his eye was lightning the odd fangs in his mouth showed like tigers tusks and his beard seemed like a tempestuous besom sweeping all before it lewdness and abominations you call my jinny a jezebel git out o my house im only in your barn will reminded him and its raining and you just said yourself that chelmsford is a babylon chockfull of abominations and youd let a young girl superscribe there all alone jinny shall superscroibe where she

lettershe dont want to read about lewdness and abomination except in the howly book and oi count she has enough o that on sunday with you peculiars it is better she should read about it than scutter

oi made inquirations among the tradespeople and paid em to the last farden aldoe soon as my back was turned my own sister plots with her oneeyed little ships monkey to pay for a stone as ef oid neglected my own darter and all spiled with wicked wordsdid you ever see such words in a christian churchyard no of course not soothingly murmured will to whom the long rigmarole conveyed nothing except a sense of pathetic and loquacious senility ha said the gaffer with satisfaction oi says to dap says oi a churchman like you may not see the blarsphemy but think what john wesley would ha said to it sir oi says to the old gentleman you jump into my cart says oi and not a sowl here shall harm a hair o your wig and with that oi wheeled round my whip and bein then an ablebodied young man twas

as ud bear lookin at he made me sing a hume with him and we was singin it as we come into babylon oi the chief of sinners am but jesus died for me as the sepulchral bass quavered out the tune jinnys fresh voice could be heard from the back door calling granfer granfer where are you she thinks oim out in the rine chuckled the old man but let her come and find me his blessin he gave me at partin

shouted glory glory dancinlike with the tears for my sins runnin down my cheeks that was more joy to me than annie and the prizering and cockfoightin rolled into one and oi aint never backslided praise the lord bein as annie married a sedanchair man and was hiked away to cowchester and oi hope for your immortal sowls sake my lad you baint like what oi was at your age i hope so said will not without uneasiness the patriarch shook his head theres the old adam in you plain to discern ye wont be safe till yere married but do ye dont marry an old gander of a widow like that potboy they should be tellin ofhe began to cacklethatll onny lead to wuss mischief wait till you happen on a clean little lass rosy and untapped a girl like your granddaughter you mean will heard himself saying the

chapel sundays should be wantin her all the week oi dont say oi wouldnt goo with her to the big house but that aint likely and she cant have nawthen to say to a rollin stone as mebbe left a pack o wives among they mormons will was nettled and who asked for your granddaughter he retorted besides youre quite right i married dozens of wives in americaall widows too the veteran chuckled afresh dash my buttons how you do mind me o your feyther when he was your agealways had his little joke not that oi count him growed up yet he havin never cut his wisdom teeth but gooin off as skittish as a colt arter peculiar doctrines and seducin sperrits oh there you are granfer and pat as to a cue a most seducin sperrit flashed like a shaft of sunshine through the halfopen door into the gloomy old barn but she was aproned and barearmed to the elbow and rainspotted and a ringlet of hair was blown almost across her mouth and the instant she perceived will she drew back in confusion patting her hair tidy sorry granfer i didnt know you had visitors but will to whom the sense she conveyed of brooms and dusters was sweetly reassuring of a still unsubmerged femininity cried out as hastily no i was just going youll get drowned and he tried to pass her but the old man dramatically extended the uncocked hat howd hard sonny will disconcerted found his feet sticking to the floor hes writ me a letter imperent little willie and brought it hisself then a flash of amusement toned down the asperity aldoe he had his tongue with him and the old man chuckled shall i read it murmured jinny putting forth her hand nay nay he snatched the note back and tore it into careful pieces aint fit to be seen no more am i said jinny with an uneasy laugh and again she essayed to escape stop commanded the ancient kindled afresh willies got to tell you whats in they scraps will was silent dont stand gawmin out with the abomination but no sound issued from the young mans lips it was not merely that this new housemaidenly figure seemed safe enough even in chelmsford wrapped in its own sweet domesticity and that adjurations designed for the minx bade fair to blunt themselves against this sober angelhood but that the girls radiance against the littered gloom within and the rainfall without robbed him literally of breath speak out willie said the gaffer softened to contempt by his obvious confusion perhaps he hasnt brought his tongue suggested jinny recovering herself then oill lend him mine you aint to goo to chemsford he says but i dont want to go to chelmsford granfer why should i go to chelmsford to get his horn you baggage and he dont be wantin it oh but he ordered itits too late now ay said daniel quarles and goo you shall to git it ef the adder has to bite methusalems heels but i dont have to go to chelmsford for it you said youd go to chelmsford burst out will at last nothing of the sort but ive got your letter he pulled it out and again that awkward glove fell out ah theres your glove ive found on the road he said crimsoning furiously thank you she took both letter and glove placidly now i shall have two pairs but where do i say anything about going to chelmsford thus invited he came and looked down at the paper she held and gripped an end of it himself very conscious of her near fingers and her bared arm and her bending head he was about to cry why there when a horrible doubt lest superscribe did not mean dashing away or stampeding or scurrying or driving or even going checked the exclamation i must ha misread it he said i beg your pardon spoken like a christian said the gaffer and oi count john wesley ud a said let bygones be bygones sow bring out the beer jinny thank youim afraid i cant stay said will he had a sullen sense of defeat which the loss of the glove seemed to accentuate and symbolize my folksll expect me home to tea your mormon wives ay jinny you may well blush the gaffer chuckled willies been and married a pack o widows in america and left them there said will permitting himself a faint smile left all those widows laughed jinny how deadly dead you must be but despite the merriment in which the episode had so unexpectedly ended and despite the rain which had now grown torrential he tore himself obstinately away even refusing the umberella which the old man suggested and jinny offered to fetch though as he stepped under the plashing appleboughs he felt himself doubly foolish to refuse what would have been a literal handle for a return visit and now that he had caught a glimpse of what he told himself was the real jinny not the tuesday and friday swashbuckler but the saturdaycleaningupforsunday houseangel he did not despair of inducing her to shed these husks of bravado but he had said no and no to his great annoyance it must be when do you propose to superscribe he asked with crafty lightness as he raised his hat oh but i have superscribed said jinny but of course if it doesnt come soon i shall write over to chelmsford again vii the first sunday of wills homecoming nothing had been said about chapel that his elders thought might be still a sore subject with the boy whose resentment at sacrificing his buttons on the altar had driven him furrin still more delicate was the theological position into which the couple themselves had gradually drifted and of which they nowbefore a spectator and criticgrew uneasily conscious marthas ecclesia in long bradmarsh having collapsed almost as soon as she had been converted to it she had no meetinghouse to go to and almost simultaneously caleb whose farmwagons had recently been shifted to the new lookers headquarters ceased to attend his chipstone chapel this was partly to keep his wife company of a sunday partly because so many miles there and back was getting too much for his legs in consequence the pair had arrived by compromise at a sunday ritual of their own a sort of peculiar christadelphianism and uncle lilliwhyte who never entered any of the many houses of godit was popularly supposed he would not or could not remove his gaystringed beaverwould often loiter outside frog farm in church hours listening to their loudly trolled and hybrid hymnology in a sort of pious eavesdropping that was uncle lilliwhytes individual contribution to the chaos of creeds that reigned in bradmarsh but even this minimum of religion was denied the honest snakeseller when will returned the first sunday caleb and martha held their services furtively in their hermetically sealed bedroom hardly daring to hum what they had so lustily intoned by a common instinct they shrank from obtruding their departure from that straitness of doctrine in which will had been reared they were indeed secretly relieved that he made no reference to religion nor seemed to expect them to go to the old chapel nor even noted the sundayness of the dishes that martha served up with the same careful everyday air with which caleb consumed them they were equally relieved however that he did not go out rabbiting on the holy day with his new pet ferrets oive known some as dednt consider that work said caleb as they discussed this dread possibility but to my thinkin if ye goo out with a spade ye might as well be ploughin that was what they said in bed on the first saturday night very different was their conversation on the eve of the next sunday the problems all came now from wills overinterest in religion true the sabbatarian peril had not yet materialized he had neither worn his best clothes on the saturday nor demanded priority in the sabbath dishes but he had dropped more than one perturbing remark old quarles he supposed was now too old to worship at his wesleyan chapel in long bradmarsh to which caleb had replied navely ay he sleeps at home sunday mornings presumably then jinny would not leave the old man alone on sunday as well as on tuesday and friday to which caleb had answered cautiouslyand without admitting that his observations were not up to datethat doubtless jinny could only worship occasionally with the peculiars and it depended on her getting a lift methusalem being a strict sunday observer yes he had heard farmer gale sometimes gave her a liftwho had told willie he wonderedbut he supposed it was because the farmer like her grandfather was a wesleyan later will had remarked casually to his mother that he didnt suppose miss quarles would be able to get to chapel on the morrow as he had happened on her old grandfather who seemed quite breaking up martha murmuring sympathetically that mr quarles must be getting old was likewise compelled to gloss over her inacquaintance with jinnys latest sunday habits she shocked and surprised herself by remarking that ones grandfather would hardly count against farmer gale and hastened to addespecially as will seemed shocked toothat such was jinnys devotion to her grandfather that not for some years had she been able to stay longer than the morning service rejoiced though the old woman was at wills mingled concern for the religion of the young and the weal of the old she was a little uneasy at this personal turn of his theological thinking and she quickly changed the conversation to the great horn and the beast a discussion which in her eagerness she hardly noticed was practically a monologue by nightfall that saturday caleb had gathered with a sinking of the heart that will designed to accompany his elders on the morrowand to early service the boy had apparently failed to remark the breach in the old chapel routine the previous sabbath the sunday had been hushed up only too successfully it was as far as caleb dared go in the first plunge of confession to say that in the absence of a vehicle early service at chipstone was out of the question nowadays such was the situation that faced the old couple in the sleepless watches of the second saturday night and dimmed even marthas joy in the prodigals return to religion best go with him like when he was little she decided we mustnt unsettle him so soon now hes found god again aint so sure hes found god said caleb shrewdly god aint in a goosequill and writin a piece about daniel aint the road to heaven else where would me and most o the brethren be to my thinkin wills onny lost the devil its the same thing what else does he want to go to chapel for and early service at that to make trouble said caleb fretfully we was all so happy till he comeand you had maria oh caleb you dont deserve the lord should give him back to you and if you dont go tomorrow ill withdraw from you that aint right said poor caleb puzzled by the unscrupulous threat but ef its onny for morning sarvice hell expect you to goo too he knows about my rheumatics dear heart she said casuistically he knows i couldnt walk even to get my bonnet cleaned but ef you were to tell him about the new jerusalem hed best find that himself now hes on the way its not far from daniel viii thus it was that uncle lilliwhyte was again defrauded of his ritual and that after a still more furtive and still earlier service in the sanctity of their airless bedroom with hymns muted and prayers guiltily whispered the couple appeared at an eight oclock breakfast with an air of devotions unpaid and caleb hurrying the meal remarked that twas time to get ready for chapel or they would miss even the morning service at this will who was in his fashionable london jacketto the admiring awe of his elderssprang up and rushing to the back of the house near the waterbarrel brushed away hastily at a dull speck on his boot where a spurt from the boiling kettle had blotted out the shine he had so laboriously imparted the male ferret caged just above his stooping head awoke at the agitation and started rubbing itself under the neck as if in parody but far more swiftly and persistently then it jerked its nose and its thin whiskers through the wires not today laughed will jabbing its nose with the blackingbrush he felt very gentlemanly and happy for the brief rain of the evening before had dried up and the day was as fine as his clothes as caleb came out in quest of will the ferret was just snuggling back to slumber and the old man yawning with the loss of his sunday morning sleep looked enviously at the creature coiling itself so voluptuously in its straw lucky jinny brought me sech a noice sunday neckercher he said or oid ha been ashamed to walk with ye ye look like our member o parlyment he himself looked however a respectable figure enough in his tall hat and finely stitched and patterned sunday smock his highlows and gaiters and it was not till they were getting over the stile that led to the short cut through the green lane that will observed that his senior carried like a tramp a bundle in his handkerchief whats that he inquired fretfully becoming aware too that the green lane even at its best offered perils to his bootpolish thats my humebook and our dinner and tea theres two packets for each on us and we must be home for supper dont your poor mother will be lonely will had forgotten these meals they had in his boyhood been carried decorously in the wagon but the sunshine of the midmay morning did not permit illhumours and they strode happily along the dappled byways bounding over the shrunken sloughs the son uplifted even beyond bootpolish by the intoxication of the spring and the father by the intoxication of the spirit for the moment caleb had crossed the stile the old rapture of fellowworship had returned and the absence of martha seemed to lift the shadow of her criticism while doubts of his sons regeneration could hardly survive the sight of his springy step chapelwards will was indeed living over again his childish memories of these sunday journeys and somewhat to his surprise something fresh and delicious seemed to emanate from them it had after all been a pleasant change in the weekly round this family jaunt with the big doublelidded provision basket while the congregational picnicking in the chapel had not been without its jollity but caleb did not leave him long to his memories the old peculiar was anxious to have a problem solved that had been weighing upon him these two years in the new jerusalem whose descent to earthreadymade and completewas according to martha imminent to the impending confusion of disbelievers there was to be a street of pure gold as it were transparent glass marthaas if to immunize him against his visit to the old peculiar meetinghousehad read out the text that very morning at their surreptitious service and his ear had always heard brass instead of glass but how could gold be brass or either transparent he did not like to shock her by questioning the letter of a texthis differences from her turned merely on the relative importance and significance of her texts as compared with those he had picked up from the peculiars yet this puzzle was perhaps what really prevented him making the final plunge into christadelphianism it is true he might have demanded her solution of itoften through those long months of controversy as he looked at her saintly face so quiet on the pillow beside him it was borne in upon him that in that bookish brain under that frilled cotton nightcap lay the explanation of the holy mystery but possibly with the subterranean obstinacy of the peasant he shrank from an elucidation which might have left him irremediably at her mercy a vindication of the text by will on the other hand would give him time to turn round take his new bearings and a young man who was capable of composing a thesis upon the little horn and the great horn could surely wrestle with this mystery oi hear you writ a piece about daniel he began tactfully as they crossed the bridge will frowned he had forgotten marthas misunderstanding has he been round telling you he asked angrily me caleb stared oi baint howly enough for wisions will was puzzled in his turn you mean he cant walk so far oi wouldnt say that happen he can fly if he wants to fly surely a man so howly in his lifehim what dead so suddenly will stood still this altered many things the winged image of the gaffer faded before the picture of a lonely jinny when did he die you know that better than me said caleb meekly at this the thought that his epistle had overexcited the patriarch and stilled that aged heart shot up agitating the young man that was why relief mingled with a vague disappointment when caleb went on they lions couldnt kill him but oi reckon he had to die some time but many of them what sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake he tells us and maybehe added with a flashtheyll wake up in that golden city will grunted a vague maybe touching that there city said caleb the gold of the street thereof will be transparent i know murmured will suppressing a yawn he knew and the contradiction did not strike him instantly as by another flash the text solved itself in the old mans mindgold in those millennial days while it retained its sacred splendour would also lose its gross opaqueness becoming rarefied disembodied spiritualized so that gold was as brass since both were like glass making thus a harmony of light with the jasper wall clear as crystal and the twelve giant pearls of the gates itll be a pritty sight he mused aloud yes like the crystal palace sneered will you seen that asked caleb eagerly a man couldnt be in london and escape seeing it said will every cad drags you into his omnibus bound for hyde park such a crowd yes the chimneysweep got his pocket picked bundocks buoyoy was atellin said caleb but the streets thereof be they of gold the streets of london said will smiling noa the streets of the crystal city no of course not father then they cant be brass neither more like grass will laughed for theres real trees left standing inside caleb joined in the boys laugh though he had never really believed that the crystal palace represented the millennial city it was well to have the danger finally cleared away and abandoning the goldbrass puzzle his mind flew back illogically but passionately to his peculiar brethren and the joy of the awaiting ritual ah heres plashy hall said will and the dog seems having his sunday nap he threw open the white gate marked no thoroughfare but thats closed closed said will in fiery accents i shant even close it after us i count they wont mind you in your parlyment coat but go along dad and will pushed the old man into plashy walk and strode forward like a village hampden within a minute he missed caleb and looking back saw him hurrying back from the gate must allus shut gaaites he apologized with his rising accent ill burn it next time said will why this saves us a mile but well miss the early sarvicers complained caleb youve forgot how they walk out to meet the brethren what come footin it from afar and have an extry sarvice at a halfway house back o long bradmarsh surely the regular services will be enough but tis noice to git an extry snack said caleb wistfully manys the sunday oive had foive sarvices he sighed voluptuously well better luck next time said will lightly the tone was not unkindly but caleb took it in full earnest and his long secret grievance against martha began to ooze into speech under the spell of his sons sympathy her warning against unsettling the boy was forgotten in this natural gravitation of male to male against female fantasy yes he said ive allus been fast and faithful all along tis mother thats allus gooin forrard and woundily wilfuloi never met nobody loike her barrin old quarles when we married we was both sprinklers but scarcely had we got six childer afore she says she must be baptoized wait till the summer says oi for twas a black febary but nosow headlong is her natur they had to break the ice she give a deep soigh when the water took herit amost unhinged me but she would have it she felt sow happy and contented she drilled me hard to make me take the total immersion toonation obstinate is mother but oive allus stood out stubborn for the truth fast and faithful he repeated as if to reassure himself well but you changed too will reminded him less kindly you werent born a faithhealer that aint my fault bein as the truth wasnt found out in my young days though they warses o jeames was there all the time but the fust day oi met the brethren oi knowed they were the people for me there was one on em among my own labourers when oi said as we didnt know zactly what god was he said says he gods like you and me bein as he made man in his own image that was an eyeopener to me but the others parsecuted him and called him brother jerusalem as a rewoilin word he had a fork to pitch a high loadcost foive shillins fancy what a good fork that must ha beenand they went and broke it oi was grieved but naught grieved him except to grieve the lord he dednt drink neither and you look so odd if you dont drink but when they wanted to stand treat he said hed take bread and cheese goo to hell says they there aint no hell even for you he answers soft youll be in the same darkness as now thats all that was another eyeopener oi was taken with that hellnot bright and burnin but all black and cowldso oi came out o my darkness and jined the brethren and gave up beer barrin harvesttime which rejoiced mother and was money saved for the childer beyutiful things were brought to pass and beyutiful things were said the day oi went to my fust sarvice and ef the lord is with you today when you speak o your experiences oi count beyutiful things will be brought out agen will shuddered he stopped abruptly and was nigh turning back he had forgotten that the brethren would expect his soulexperiences and confessionsespecially after this spacious and adventurous interval whatsamatter asked caleb nothing nothing he said remembering his own power of sullen silence and to say something he asked as he walked on and whats wrong with mother now wrong caleb was shocked at this crude interpretation oi dont be meanin she aint in her rights to hunt out new texts she bein a scholard there was allus a branspannew one oi mind me the sundays i used to goo acourtin her a wery long way she livedthey talk broad and careless where she comes from not moist and proper like hereand oi had to git up early and goo along the seawalldeadly dark and lonesome it was winter nights and mornins but her face was allus with me like the moon why was she pretty then asked will cant you see replied caleb with a faint surprise she aint changed much she havin allus the peace of god in her heart will was touched and astonished by this revelation of romance in the two elderly people foisted upon him as parents whom he had all his life taken as eternally elderly but still more surprising was the realization forced upon him that the religion which to him was a bore was to them a thrill shall i carry the parcel father he asked gently nay nay that dont goo with parlyment clothes and it aint as sizeable as the box you carried from chipstone he chuckled in freshly admiring glee passing adown the long hawthorn avenue they now issued from plashy walk the rights of leg vindicated and soon they began to see signs of other pilgrims faring towards chipstone that great gatheringplace of faiths and creeds chapter vi sunday at chipstone this zealot is of a mongrel diverse kind cleric before and lay behind a lawless linseywoolsey brother half of one order half another butler hudibras i as old england has always been rich in characters in those grotesque or gnarled individualities that have escaped the common mould the superabundance of sects which in conjunction with the paucity of sauces amused voltaire has its natural explanation john bullhimself a character among nationalitiescould not long endure the papal leadingstrings and ever since the days of wycliffe a succession of free spirits has founded heresies not a few based on misunderstood mistranslations of greek or hebrew texts torn from their literary and above all their historical context but why during these five centuries essex has been a breedingplace for nonconformity second to no other county is a problem to tempt the philosopher for its ministers have been silenced or ejected in numbers almost unparalleled some indeed merely for tippling dicing carding and womanizing but the majority for the more serious offences of heresy or disrespect towards parliament while simple peasantsmen women and girlsfor their participation in seditious conventicles or practices have been fined jailed transported to his majestys plantations and even nailed to stakes and burnt alive clapping their hands the while with joy some of the most moving scenes of foxes book of martyrs and bloomfields history of the martyrs are laid in essex triumphant descendants of these opinionated saints were now converging on chipstone from every quarter of the compassit was but a toymodel of a town yet it held in its petty periphery chapels meetinghouses or churchesancienttowered or drably wooden or offering the image of a tinned congregation tightly packedfor baptists particular or general quakers wesleyans congregationalists peculiars and primitive methodists as well as your everyday churchgoer nothing indeed was wanting except an ecclesia for the variation represented by martha and as most of these structures were in the high street or just off it you beheld in that ancient thoroughfare of a sunday a crowd of christians as like to the naked eye as a flock of sheep sorting themselves into their denominational pigeonholes and disappearing as suddenly to right or left as the pedestrians in the vision of mirza vanished downwards through the trapdoors in the bridge of all these types of christian none seemed so indigenous to essex as that aptly christened peculiar it was as though peculiar to the marshes an emanation of the soil though the first apostolic fervour was over in chipstone and the spirit was moving rather towards woodham and southend the sect was still young and persecuted enough to be a devoted brotherhood as will soon realized from the greetings which his father exchanged with fellowpilgrims who grew more and more frequent as they drew nigh the outskirts of the theological town there was among others a cheerfullooking woman pushing a fourwheeled babycart which held an infant back and front and a foodparcel sandwiched between them caleb addressing her as sister offered to wheel it but she replied that the children would cry at a stranger well youll soon be comin to your destiny said caleb but before will and he had forged ahead of her she had begun pouring out a premature confession two or three were gathered together and the spirit seemingly blew through her that time last year she hadnt trusted the lord when they were wheeling the cart to chapel she had wondered to her husband how she could fit in the coming baby and the lord had now made room by taking the prior baby so that she was well chastised moreover they had parsecuted her husband before a magistrate for not calling in a doctor for the child but as it wasnt insured they had only put him in prison for a little all the same he was broke up having always been a forthright man the lord was indeed trying him by fire ay twas the same willie when your brother whatsaname died said caleb as they drew ahead of the labouring babycart but the brethren now exhort one another not to insure their childer satan being swift to cry childmurder but isnt it childmurder if a doctor might have saved it asked will coldly for the womans story had shocked him caleb looked pained ef the lord wouldnt listen even to prayers is it likely hed regard doctors howsomever the brethren stand fast and faithfulthey goo to prison even at harvesttime when youre worth forever o money but the lords people are wunnerful good to one another and the elders look arter the families oh what a joyous harvest thanksgivin we had two years agoo time the martyrs came out o their cells all in the open air it was and deacon mawhood brought out beyutiful lessons no matter you lost your harvest money he says you won the palm and the crown and tis the second harvest in the heavenly fields with angels to squinch your thirst from golden wessels that shall be yourn says the deacon will received the ratcatchers rhetoric with a snort which put caleb again on the defensive oive never took no medicine for ten year said caleb and look at me well ive taken plenty said will and look at me oi allow oi aint a samson like you admitted caleb honestly nor couldnt carry a box that far and when oi say no medicine oi dont mean when oim not ill for same as oim well mother makes me take a little pill afore meals bein a wegeble as stops the gripes there aint naught about that in the bible seein as the text starts onny when you git sick and arter she lost your brother jimor maybe he was zecharoiahshe did fetch a doctor for the tothers argufyin that when the childs too young to seek grace of itself oil inside aint no wuss than oil outside and then they christy dolphins come along who are they inquired will but caleb drew up with a sudden remembrance youll find that out for yourself they aint far from daniel live on the common do you mean noathere aint none near usthere was two in long bradmarsh but theyve gone back to the joanna prophet woman so your poor mother aint got he broke off again oi dont say ef mother was took real bad oi shouldnt goo and git doctor gory seein as she threatens to goo for him same as oim ill it aint the doctor its the faith says mother and so long as you dont believe in the doctor there aint no harm in lettin him thump you about so long as your heart turns to god says mother the doctor can listen to it all he likes then you do have the doctor will was amused at these compromises exacted by his masterful mother whose heretical evolution after the loss of offspring he could however well understand noanoa not for usleastways not yet caleb protested that was onny for the childer that made us feel free free will queried not responsible like he was somewhat embarrassed faithhealin aint the main thing he expounded anxiously its faithgittin its lovin god and seekin his grace just as youre doin today will was silent bless me cried caleb suddenly ef that dont look tempesty wills eyes went skywards and found indeed a livid patch of gloom like a ghastly sag of sky suddenly splotched in the warm blue and as he looked a zigzag flash stabbed through it quick cried caleb indicating a fairly leafy oak git under that tree no no said will its dangerous and a terrible peal of thunder accentuated his words oill hazard it said caleb hastening towards the shelter the lord is marcifulhe can kill us when he pleases he aint got no need o lightnin but thats gooin to pour like billyhoand the rine falls alike on the just and the unjustunless the roighteous mans got an umberrella will smiled though humour was as far as ever from calebs intentions unwilling to desert the old man and perhaps weighing the improbability of an electric stroke against the certainty of spoiling his jacket and the last surviving sheen of his boots will stood pluckily beside his parent while after another celestial salvo great drops began to patter on the leaves and even to drip through them lucky that thunder dednt come in the middle o last night mused the old man gratefully as it roared on its sech a bother dressin yourself agen to set up till it stops hark at they tommy devils squealin he cried indicating the startled swifts but after a few minutes calebs patience gave out the distant chiming of chipstone church bells with which the way had been piously enlivened was now chillingly inaudible the thought that they would be late for chapel gnawed at his heart and dryness seemed a poor equivalent for those missed moments of spiritual ecstasy he was about to dash through the storm when the rain ceased as suddenly as it came the blackbirds began to whistle and forage merrily and the sun bursting out more brilliantly than ever soon licked up the modicum of moisture that had percolated to their sunday exterior but calebs apprehensions were justified he had overrated the pace of his aged legs and despite the gain through plashy walk he got no compensation for the missed halfway service for when they arrived at the little meetinghouse the morning service proper had begun ii the chapel of the peculiars was one of the minor religious edifices that did not aspire to the high street behind an iron gate and a petty stone courtyard it displayed a gabled front with a roof of pantiles and a row of dull windows of an ecclesiastical order on either side as will passed through the door all his tardily born sympathy vanished and a wave of the old insufferable boredom smote him like a breath of the steerage on his atlantic steamer almost ere his hat was off his eye had taken in the whole oncefamiliar scene the painfully crude walls a little dingier with the passing of the years the broad tabledesk at the head of the hall at which deacon mawhood and the elders throned it in sunday black the rows of spruce wooden chairs sexually divided by a gangway and exhibiting in its left section a desert of elderly females with a few oases of hobbledehoy girls he thought of st pauls cathedral and calculated whimsically that if that cost twopence to see how much ought one not to pay to escape seeing this but if his entry meant ennui to himself it was a most dramatic event to the congregation at first indeed this stranger in the fashionable jacket was not associated with caleb whose return to the fold was a separate thrill it was believed for an instant that a veritable gentleman had succumbed to the truth and even when it was perceived that he was no other than will flynt the news of whose homecoming had reached the majority the sensation did not abate for was not god still visibly with his peculiar flock turning back the hearts of the wanderers whether of the old generation or the young a breath of new inspiration shook the hall and the greyhaired brother who had just begun reading the thirteenth chapter of acts faltered in his mispronunciation of cyrene as he went on droning out the chaptersurely the longest in the bible chosen maliciously to depress him further thought willits burden of the people of god set for a light to the gentiles evoked a mounting exaltation and those who had come with no thought of testifying found themselves possessed of the spirit there was in particular a man with muttonchop whiskers on the bench in front of will whose body swayed with excitement and who punctuated the reading with breathless jerks of nasal interpolation beyutiful yes amen thank gord mercy and the like and when at last the chapter ended on the verse and the disciples were filled with joy and with the holy ghost it lifted the man to his feet and he poured forth the story of his sinful past oi was church of englandin the choirand wore black and whoite gownsand rang the bellsand was confirmed and allbut gord had never pardoned my sins will stifled a yawn and looked towards the door but the rest of the audience hung upon the talethe tale of a deathbed repentance of churchmanship and the miraculous recovery to lead the better life of the peculiar brotherhood oi asked the elder to howd up my hands so that oi might die praising gord for the revelation sobs came from the left benches but they only fevered will he sat in a dull fury dazed by words that passed over his brain without leaving a meaning oh what a thronging boy and boya land where we shall never say good noightengraved in eternal brassthe lord shoines on your heartsheep and goatsstreets paved with pure gold as it were transparent glass it was not till he felt his arm clutched by caleb in the old mans excitement at hearing this last phrase that will connected such words with reality at all and they faded back into mere religion till a sudden mention of john in the oil of patmos shot up a quaint picture of a too profuse anointment other speakers followed with the same transcendental vocabulary and then hymns in an interval between which the blackgarmented deacon with a royal gesture that seemed to sweep away the remotest effluvium of aniseed or moleskins sent will a hymnbook by a deferentially wriggling brother it seemed an ironic revenge for the book he had flung into the bushes but it saved him from the oppressive proximity of his fathers which he had been sharing for the old man though he could not read the book liked to hold it as he had always held it with martha and indeed could not have sung without feeling it at his fingers ends will turned its pages with curiosity thinking of bundocks village idiot and noting that it was still published by a village barber then a gaunt hornspectacled man was seized of the spirit ive been looking for a hankercher he began to wills surprise ive been looking for a hankercher he repeated ive been looking for a hankercher he recapitulated with rising rhetoric to wipe my tears away but the thrilling level of this exordium was not maintained and the stock phrases started again merciless unendurable beating on wills brain till they beat vainly against the depths of his reverieor was it his doze ah surely that was jinnys horn at last no it was only his father blowing emotionally into his red cotton handkerchieftoo huge to need looking fora duplicate of that which held their meals besides jinny wouldnt be blowing her horn of a sunday but why didnt she come to chapel the graceless minx was she careering around with that farmer gale or was it her grandfathers illness if flighty young girls with hearts sound at bottom would come here and unfold the error of their independent ways the practice of confession might be justified and chapelservice become both useful and exciting but these faded people these ungainly men and fubsy females who on earth cared for their drab histories ah there was mother gander not so podgy as mostin the blue silk of auld lang syneif only she would get upor even charley mottthere would be some spark of interest but no the hornspectacled bore held the floor pitilessly and the phrases beat on beyutiful beyutiful wordsi thought i should diepoor me what a comfort in them words and the nasal voice its fervour unallayed by its own outpouring still punctuated the other speeches with jerky interpolations praise the lord or glory came with fiery iteration and sometimes this saint with the muttonchop whiskers said lord bless me or lord bless my soul and these frayed and almost meaningless ejaculations seemed full of a startling significance in his mouth and nose brother bridges they said to me hows your soul i couldnt give em a straightforward answer will woke up again it was not now the hornspectacled speakerhe had apparently been wiped off the floor at last and was not even visibleit was a man with a humorous twinkle and a red beard but if they had asked me hows your body there was a faint snigger from a thickset girl instantly repressed by her shocked mother but after will had extracted what relief he could from this incident he tried vainly to extract from the anecdote the exciting edification it held for the others how can i go to romford and tell people i havent got salvation a dramatic crisis indeed for all save will who did not even stifle his yawn the mans journey to romford seemed infinitely unimportant compared with journeys going on every tuesday and friday and despitefully checked on sunday once the door opened but it was only for a shambling youth in his teens and will did not share the satisfaction of the congregation at this new if belated proof of their vitality were not afeared no not the humblest of us pursued the redbearded man catching fresh inspiration from this continuous rise in their numbers and why because we dont go to work without a partner here at last was a definite image through the blur and if will in a vivid flash saw a workingpartner for himself in a less sublime incarnation than the speaker had in mind he was for once as aquiver as his father who now albeit with the stock exclamation of beyutiful proceeded to add real tears to the contents of his capacious handkerchief when will became attentive again it was a new voice testifying and the matter seemed quite sensational they used to be carried away and buried in a day but when our brother bundocks boy got it we had a special prayermeeting and even the marks were light oh so it was only the postmans smallpox he looked round in vain for her majestys servant indeed a general consciousness that the hero of the story was ungratefully absent damped its appealonly the man with the muttonchop whiskers called out with unabated ardour glory will felt that the glory was to bundock thus valiantly sticking to his lack of convictions more than even during the last week life at little bradmarsh seemed impossible as impossible as in his boyhood better had he rushed with the mob of his mates to california even now it was probably the best thing to do with his ninety pounds unmanly though it were to flee and leave this girl carrier with her arrogance unbroken in her absence if only one of the females would get up that would be at least a change but no the sex was shy today though the forenoon was he remembered the traditional time for its testifyings perhaps it was the presence of this stalwart young stranger that tonguetied it but the males seemed to be telling their soulstories at him challenging his eye appealing to his black jacketor was that only a morbid impression of his an outsider might have been touched by the thread of spiritual poetry in these outwardly commonplace lives but will being of them had the familiarity that breeds boredom if not contempt and contempt too was not wanting to this elegantly clad and muchtravelled connoisseur of men and women and creeds who had seen even french cathedrals in canada and knew that roman catholics were not the scarlet beasts his infancy had somehow imagined them once he caught mr charles motts eye fixed upon him with a curious wondering gaze which seemed to change to a wink as eye met eye wills eye however remaining serious a flush overspread the expotboys face and he looked away but wills contempt passed into alarm when at a sudden pause in the testifyings all other eyes unquestionably converged on him he turned as red as charley mott and glued his eyes to his hymnbook not daring to look up till another voice indicated that the spirit had found a more willing tongue for its organ but his relief was mixed with disgust for it was the dry voice of the original greyhaired reader and it seemed bent on a sermon which had not even the mitigated brightness of a confession then autobiography seemed suddenly to break through it for wills wandering thoughts were fixed by an anecdote about riding to rochester seven miles on a donkey on a winters evening lord bless me interpolated the nasal voice so distracting will that he never understood how the story led up to a doctors remark i must have your leg off a design the medical materialist appeared to have carried out will tried to peer under the table to see the preachers peg but failing to perceive any signs of corkiness concluded that the anecdote was not personal he gathered that after this melancholy amputation by impotent science faith had sufficed to keep the rest of the man together medicine had subsequently proclaimed he was in a galloping consumption but he aint dead yethes still sound and whole cried the preacher paradoxically to the applausive glory of the tireless commentator another illustrious example of regenerationthe preacher kept will awake by recountinghad begun life as a parson but none is beyond hope even in the sacristy one is not safe from the spirit and unable to go any longer through the flummeries and mummeries of the established church he had given up his living and fallenat one timeso low that he was glad to become a potman in a publichouse all eyes were here turned towards the unfortunate charley mott and from his squirming figure to mother gander sitting so stern and stiff but the tension relaxed when the preacherperhaps tactfullywent on to mention that it was at the white hart in colchester where the landlord and landlady had both parsecuted him they were now both dead glory from the nasal punctuator i am sorry they are dead said the preacher magnanimously but the lords arm is not short and while they were well dead will learnt that their poor persecuted potman had now a chapel of his own where he preached full salvation twenty or thirty were it appeared saved regularly and punctually every sunday evening glory trumpeted the nasal voice and again will sullen and glowering felt that the whole congregation was palpitating with expectation that he would leap to his feet and declare himself similarly saved or at least not lost during his long absence but he was not going to make a fool of himself he told himself harshly he would sooner face the ordeal of escape of running the gauntlet of the brothers and sisters and he looked round wildly towards the door perceiving with satisfaction that the late youth had left it slightly ajar then to his joy and the congregations disappointment another worshipper took the word or was taken by it bidlake the bargee with his dogeyes now shining and his shaggy face sublimated who declared with touching fervour that he would praise god as long as breath was in him and with the deathrattle in his throat he would cry you can do gord what you like with me ephraim recalled the coup by which he had converted his wife whom family sorrows had made an infidel ef you wont goo to heaven with me says oi oill goo to hell with you now they both pulled and poled together and were happyso happy despite family losses and troubles most men aint fit to live nor ready to die just drifters throw em the lifelinethe lifeline afore they drift away and with a vivid gesture he threw an imaginary rope by accident or design it was in wills direction and again the poor young man with a stifling sense of being lassoed became the cynosure of every eye but fortunately for him ephraim bidlake did not pause here and his rhapsody poured on glorious truthone generation to the totherthe prayer of roighteousnesscome as you arewain to trust in mana veritable cascade of phrases that falling on wills head gradually lowered it in sleep an impromptu speech is usually one the speaker cannot wind up and the worthy bargee went on tangling himself up more and more till it looked doubtful if he would ever have come to a stop had not something happened which stole even his breath away through the interstice of the door came suddenly sidling a little white dog but this accession to the congregation produced no joy merely a sense of profanity as it pattered up the central parting leaving moreover wet prints of its paws springing without hesitation or apology upon the sleepers best trousers it curled itself up comfortably with a grunt assuredly will was not fated today to escape the centre of the stage the young man recognized nip instantly and his yawn of awakening changed into a gasp and his somnolent pulse into a precipitate beat the animals leap was indeed sudden enough to startle the strongest heart will turned his head instinctively towards the dooroblivious even of his damped trousersbut there was no sign of nips mistress still whether she was in the vicinity or not the dog was clearly out of place grasping his pretext of escape firmly by the collar and clasping his struggling opportunity to his breast he stole from the meetinghouse iii he expected to see nips owner outside in his reading of the situation she had arrived so late that while she was hesitating whether to come in the shameless dog had burst through the door attracted doubtless by the aroma of all those dinnerpackets and this had made her still more ashamed to enter but the quaint little street was bare of jinny so sunless did it appear without her that he scarcely noticed that the sky was actually overcast again and that the black cloud had regathered he stood still hesitating in which relaxed mood of his the spasmodic struggles of the animal were successful and will became painfully aware that he was alone with his moist trousers and his london coat snowed over with little hairs while nip after some preliminary gambollings and barkings at the recovery of the liberty he had himself abandoned was vanishing into the high street so assured were nips movements that will divined at once he had only to follow him to restore him to his mistress and without waiting even to brush off the little white hairs he darted towards the street corner and was happily just in time to see the excellent creature trotting into the courtyard of the black sheep his pleasure was not however free from surprise what was jinny doing at her business headquarters on the lords day or had she come in her cart to chapel and put it up there he ran towards the picturesque stableyard there were a good many chaises gigs dogcarts and even carriages standingthe countryside drove to its churchesbut there was no trace of either jinny or methusalem while nip was standing with hangdog air by the doorstep under a poster of dukes marionettes but as will drew nearer he turned tail sauntered down the passage surveyed the painted hand and then with an air of decision bounded up the stairs ah she would be in the parlour and nips follower bounded upstairs too keeping closely to heel but no nip was not on dining bent though the door was open rejecting all the appetizing scents that already emanated from the eatingroom nip pitpatted along the dusky corridor and began whining and scrabbling outside a closed and numbered door very soon it receded before his pleadings and as he scampered in you poor dog came out in the girlish voice that had so lacerated him with fol de rols but not the worst of that musical torment could vie with the jar to his heartstrings when through the reclosing door came another unforgettable voice with the jovial interrogatory well nip and what was the parsons text he remembered nowwith a cold sick horrorthat this was the very bedroom from which indignant housemaids had excluded its tenantyes there was reynard opposite with his glassy eye and his erected brush possibly tony flip was not even up that was what came of minxes driving methusalems instead of being at divine service like all godfearing humanity she was coquettingor worsewith a mountebank in an inn bedroom yet he felt he must not spy upon herany moment too she might come outand he hurried downstairs and stood on the step under the ironwork lamp louring like the great black cloud which he now perceived to be in heavensent harmony with his mood and that drivelling patriarch had foamed at the mouth when he had hinted that womans place was not a cart but jinny did not keep him more than five endless minutes hullo will she cried gaily as she tripped from the passageway with nip in her arms what are you doing here how the broad frame of her bonnet set off the picture of her face small wonder a looseliving showman found it bewitching not so william flyntwith his high ideals of womanhood even to be called will was provoking rather than flattering he felt it now less the perquisite of the old friend than the proof of an indiscriminating levity ive come for the dinner he said coldly nip gazed straight at him with his mild brown eye but although will did not suppose that the brute would open its mouth like balaams ass and give him away he could not look it in the head he turned his shoulder on dog and damsel and stared at the poster i wish i could have dinner with you replied jinny frankly but i must be off to feed granfer farmer gales trap should be here by now he drives you home too he turned towards her startled within half a mileit is a treat for me to have another carrier but he isnt a peculiar he observed severely no hes a wesleyan like granfer who used to drive his father about he puts up at the chequers hard by his chapelhis service ought to be over i hope his horse hasnt taken fright againwe had just got to the high street when the storm broke and at the first flash the horse was off galloped miles beyond the town before he could be got to a standstill he might have killed you the silly cried will meaning the farmer yes said jinny simply meaning the animal by the time he was walked warily back it was too late to go in but i dont wonder nip was worried about me you see he likes to run behind the trap poor fellowshe wasted a kiss upon his unresponsive headand he always comes up in time to say goodbye at the chapel door where he hangs about till i come out but this time of course he must have been wandering about in search of me he wasnt there when i passed just now mr flippance declares he must have gone to chipstone church in the idea id suddenly joined it and the girlish laugh rang out dissipating some of his humours as much by its joyousness as by the innocent mention of the showman but why shouldnt you join it miss quarles he said it cant be duller than chapel now now will she shook a serious finger you ought to have gone to chapel yourself this morning and dont call me miss quarles but i prefer to call you miss quarles but why not jinny her voice was plaintive because everybody else calls you that is that any reason why you should call me miss quarles if you cant see it he began i cant and i hope you wont call me miss quarles and why shouldnt i because i wont answer to it and why not because will its not my name he gasped not your name she laughed merrily at his discomfiture its a long story and farmer gale will be here hulloa she went on making his confusion worse confounded how did nips hairs get on you he flushed and flicked nervously at his coat there are other white dogs he said evasively well dont let him spoil your coat and what about your bodice oh mine isnt new and londony he was gratified at her perception still more at her setting down nip that animal however was in the rampageous mood which always followed his restoration to freedom and he began leaping up at his mistresss hand down nip down oh i do believe hes bitten through my new glove she pulled it off ruefully to examine the damage sensible dog will growled he knows you oughtnt to be wearing mr flippances gloves her own little white teeth flashed out in a mocking smile lucky you are going to buy me another pair me why you wouldnt let me when i offered of course not im thinking of the pair youll be owing me owing you you dont suppose youll win the wager do you oh that he was disconcerted again of course ill win it he said defiantly in a bombastic burst it wont take me a days practice to blow down the walls of jericho she laughed so you do remember your bible well ill be satisfied if you blow nip back from a rabbit we shall see have you superscribed again he asked pompously assured of his accuracy this time not yeti expect the hornll be at chipstone by tuesdayyou shall have it the same evening and the next day ill be wanting gloves he said loftily we shall seeor rather hear what size do you take though oh i dont knowtwice yours i suppose oh not twice why sure and he suddenly prisoned her little ungloved hand between his brawny palms i could easily crush it he said with a strange desire to do so pressing it indeed almost to hurtingpoint at that instant a farpalpitating blueness transfigured the courtyard and from abovestairs came a terrific racket as if all the plates and dishes in the diningroom were hurling themselves at one another will felt the girls fingers curl spasmodically round his and hold them tight her face went white and he seemed to hear her heart thumping dont be frightened he said with his first manly satisfaction in her surely she was clinging to him for protection thatll be a fireball down the chimney she observed with disappointing coolness there was one came down last year in long bradmarsh and killed a poor little chimneysweep who had got stuck in the flue itll set the chimney on fire i expect this rain will put it out he said still cheerfully conscious of her warm fingers and feeling a joy in the deluge that had been so damp in his fathers company she drew back however into the passage to avoid the big plopping and ricochetting raindrops and her hand got disentangled what fun if its fallen down mr flippances chimney she laughed make him get up early her laughter seemed to ring untrue hysterical isnt he up yet he asked trying to speak lightly oh he never gets up on a sundaynot properly i mean i saw him half up but hes gone back to bed and is already snoringi heard him but how could you hear him he asked with careful carelessness oh i was in his daughters room whiling away the time of waitingshes got ten times his sensewhen woke up by our voices i suppose in he trails through the communicating door in his fancy dressinggown yawning like a mousetrap and asks me to buy him a horse at the fair a horse at the fair scarcely had he enjoyed the relief of working out that he had taken the harmless adjoining bedroom for the showmans when this new blow struck him like hooves on his chest of course i wouldnt listen to him she said of course not his breast expanded again how can a woman understand buying horses oh i dont mean that jinny was distinctly colder i mean its the lords day hell have to repeat his order on tuesday but surely you wouldnt go to a horse fair why not becauseitsits so horsey she laughed again and so fairish too isnt it what does he want a horse for he asked sullenly i dont suppose its for dinnerhe isnt a frenchy but hes got a caravan hasnt heand he has to begin his summer tour soon and why cant he buy his own horses that infant why his last horse died of old age at four and what about that sensible daughter of his she hasnt got horsesense said jinny smiling well i dont see how it comes into your business a carrier has to buy whatever shes asked whatever she can carry you cant carry a horse no but it can carry me besides ive often carried a calf or a pig and where am i to draw the line youll be buying elephants next he said with a bitter remembrance of mr flippances story im too old for gingerbread she replied unexpectedly but i havent forgotten the one you gave me once he trembled under her radiant gratitude with its evocation of the poetry of childhood but a convulsive bound forward on the part of nip broke up the argument ah heres farmer gale coming along she said cheerfully just like the fellow he thought to come just at that moment and his resentment at the arrival of the dogcart was not even mitigated by the watery spectacle presented by its redfaced driver whose personable and still youthful figure rose from a streaming tarpaulin to which a hat with an unremoved mourningband contributed its drippings you cant go in that rain will protested let him go without youill order a trap myself but you said you were dining herei cant wait he wincedhis white lie had come home like a curse to roost you can dine with me and what about granfer well i can dine at home but she scarcely heard him she was already fastening a handkerchief over her sunday bonneta fascinating process theres a good coverill snuggle right in shameless he thought riding about cheek by jowl and skirt by trouser with a young man not even of her own faith that thin tiny boy sandwiched between was no real separation why the tarpaulin almost swallowed him under they ought at least to sit back to back and if there was any chivalry in the puddingfaced lout he would transfer the tarpaulin to the back seat how could jinny forget that the magnate of little bradmarshcursd cornish interloperwas no fit company for the likes of her he wondered that people did not warn her but they were inured to her vagaries he supposed and even if the man meant honourably in his reckless passion how dare a widower with a great thumping boy approach a rosebud ah now she was talking to this secondhand warmedup aspirant who had already killed off one wife inquiring sweetly about his animals behaviour under the recent flash steady as a ploughhorse came the cheery reply my eye jinny you did handle him wonderful i reckon you saved my life and what about my own with a laugh whose gaiety stabbed she sprang upon the step goodbye will hope youll enjoy your dinner goodbye miss quarles he said coldly i mean miss but before he had realized he could not fill up the blank the trap had started and he could not even bound behind like the joyousbarking nip nothing tangible was left of the whole delectable and distressing episode except some white hairs on the fashionable fabric of moses son iv hope youll enjoy your dinner her last words still rang in his ear his dinner cold meat wrapped in a muckinger and consumed on chapel benches among drab elders and elderly sisters and betterlost brothers and dismal ratcatching deacons no sooner a crust and cheese at the bar but why not roast beef and yorkshire pudding in the parlourwhy not make his lie true yes lies were reprehensible truth was always best and his chaps began to water with ethical excitement but alas with a sudden misgiving he put his hand in his pocket not a farthing in the agitation of his chapelgoing he had forgotten to transfer his purse to the sunday suitnay even the ninety pounds were left in the discarded waistcoat he remembered with an unreasonable chill he was to be nailed to his lie then true he might possibly get credit but it was an awkward situation at best no better go back to his cold meatbesides his poor old father would be wondering and waiting it would be cruel to desert and distract him and the rain appearing somewhat thinner he turned up his coatcollar and started out almost colliding at the archway with the mott couple lovingly entwined under a spacious umbrella they at least had no need to dine in chapel mr charles mott looked at him again with the same curious wonder youre not going back he cried involuntarily i cant desert my dad will answered somewhat shamefacedly and he must eat charley darling mother gander intervened you know how bad our sunday dinners are i havent even got any money with me he cried with a last wild hope but mother gander did not respond to his longing for truth lend him the umbrella dearest she said ruthlessly weve another for the afternoon service accepting it with mitigated gratitudethe umbrella he was trusted with was worth more than the dinner he thought bemusedlyhe moved more slowly to the chapel wondering too how hotelkeeping could be reconciled with the sabbatarian conscience he found the meetinghouse now turned into an eatinghouse the congregation had however visibly thinned only those who had no hosts or homes in chipstone remaining for this lovefeast with the exception of deacon mawhood who rather than go home to his wife remained at the table as presiding dignitary flanked by great glass jugs of water the ravages in the ranks appeared to will an eloquent testimony to the spread of the doctrine in chipstone proper in his young days the sect had been more suburban and rural and the chapel at that hour had seethed with hungry pilgrims still there was quite a happy hubbub and the spectacle with its real sense of brotherhood struck from him more sympathy than anything in the service and when a sister told her cherub not to goffle so he was mysteriously touched by the old word and the memories it roused to a sincerer respect for the creed which satisfied jinny what fun the boys had had in the wagon driving home with her caleb was chewing a hunk of bread and meat the handkerchiefparcelshrunk like the congregationincarnadined the bench oi had to begin he explained apologetically seein as oid said grace expectin you back every second and it seemed foolin with the lord to wait more than ten minutes pity that dog worrited you beyutiful things were brought out when you was gone where did you git to he evaded the question im not hungry not arter that walk of ourn cried caleb incredulously oi count youve had your dinner somewhere else yes off the dog he said a bit crossly caleb smiled oill not believe that he said with an air of infinite cuteness ill have a drink condescended will do caleb passed him a large tin mug of water and theres plenty more where that come from will knew it was brother quintthe snob or shoemaker who lived next doorwho supplied these limitless streams aint she beautifully polished caleb went on navely when his thirsty son set the mug down holds noigh a quartoi never see sech mugs nowhere else and brother quintll fill it with biling for our tea there will theres your favourite sausages mother put in for you special none o your dogs in that and he chuckled brimming over with holy glee cooled by the long draught will allowed himself to be seduced by the veal sausages and finding with surprise that the first slid down his throat in a twinkling he was soon depleting the parcel into a mere muckinger and at this calebs innocent happiness was complete but the fate that stalks mortals at their culminating felicities now sped its arrow in excavating a pickled walnut from the remains of the parcel caleb loosed a minute cardboard box which sprang maliciously to the floor and then to the agitation of the neighbours rolled round and round towards the table under the very eyes of the ratcatcher the deacon stooped down zealously to pick it up and then held it on high it was a pillbox who brought this he cried in stern prophetic accents across the table the happy hubbub ceased the holy glee was frozen in a tense silence all eyes were turned on the profane symbol will saw his wretched fathers face go red and white and his scraggy throat work painfully below the ragged white beard both the flynts guessed at once that the careful martha had slipped into the packet her husbands usual pill before meals it was a dreadful moment for a space in which all nature seemed to hold its breath caleb sat rigid and dumb whose propity is this asked the deacon still more sternly and will divined the mighty struggle going on in his fathers quaint conscience casuistic questions as to how far a pillbox conveyed unconsciously had been brought by him or in what sense pills administered to him remorselessly from without could be said to be his property then suddenly calebs lips opened oi count twas in my parcel he said in tremulous accents the sublimity of the confession thrilled will he even felt a curious moisture at his eyes but before the deacon sitting there like a judge about to pronounce sentence could say a word a blinding glare followed almost instantaneously by an appalling crashing and smashing right overhead showed that nature had indeed held its breath and had now spoken in flame and thunder wills first reflection when the daze had passed away and the congregation found itself and its building providentially safe was that it was indeed lucky his father had spoken first otherwise his confession might have seemed extorted by terror but joshua mawhood was not the deacon to let such a situation pass without profit the lord havin spoke brethren said he there aint no need for my opinion the thing oi hate most in this lower world is hypocrisy and dissemblin roight up and down jo perry as the sayin goos ef we aint been destroyed as we sat here guzzlin and guttlin taint no merit of the congregation tis because the lord bein marciful dont destroy sodom and gomorrah so long as theres one roighteous man he rose majestically and drew himself up to his full height and held the pillbox even higher brother flynt if youll kindly step out oill hand you back your propity no fiercer punishment could have been devised for calebs gentle soul the sinner isolated passing through his shrinking brethren and sisters must come forward as to a confession table no wonder the poor man held back oi dont need it now deacon he said with lips almost as white as his hair you can throw it away ef you like with malicious enjoyment the deacon slowly and solemnly lifted the lid of the pillbox and dipped in his fingers to hold up the impious contents to the public execration then his face changed why its salt he cried in angry disappointment it was as if the devil were playing thimblerig with him oi was thinkin the missus had ought to put some in said caleb beaming again the woman of the babycart now found herself possessed of the spirit she sprang to her feet a baby on either arm we are the salt of the earth she shrilled wherewith the others shall be salted hallelujah burst from the muttonchop whiskers hallelujah responded the congregation and a great anthem rolled out outshouting the thunder v to the disappointment of his father who still hoped he would testify will would not stay for the afternoon service but his worthy sire could bear a disappointment after the revulsion in his favour he thought he had to take back the umbrella to the motts he insisted or with this weather the good samaritans might be unable to return to their worshipping in any case he had to see somebody at the black sheep on urgent business business he corrected hastily of a spiritual nature calculated to save certain souls from temptation well oim glad the sperrits workin said caleb and do ye git back to mother quick as you can for it aint fair as she should be left at home time oim enjoyin myself not that tis my fault there aint no chapel for christy dolphins he checked himself and added hurriedly do ye dont tell her about the pillbox happen shed think oi was wexed and do ye dont say you cant carry a box to chipstone mocked will gaily glad to be released and of a sunday tooyou old sabbathbreaker caleb did not smile the episode had left too deep a scar oi count the deacons in the roight he said tis hypocrisy and dissemblin to take pills at home and salt in public oi count oill testify to the truth this arternoon but you only take pills to keep off the indigestion not to cure it urged will giving him his own plea back besides salt is a sort of medicine too without it you might get scurvy and goodness knows what caleb shook his head lots wife wasnt turned into a medicine any man in his seven senses knows the difference twixt puttin salt or medicine on his wounds leaving his father to execute his sublime purpose will went off on his own mission under protection of the big mott umbrella in returning it he learnt that even its great ribbed dome had not saved mr mott from a wetting in consequence of which and his delicate health he was now imbibing stiff glasses of grog in his bedroom hovered over by the anxious mother gander it was pathetically out of the question will gathered for brother mott to attend chapel again that day wills urgent business lay however with mr anthony flippance the soul to be saved being jinnys now menaced with still further soilure from the gross contacts of horsecopers cadgers kidders butchers drovers shepherds swineherds touts tramps and all the tricksters and pickpockets of the cattlemarket the mission did not loom unpleasant for although he resented the fiction about the crystal palace and the stuffed elephant the tall talk was harmless enoughhe had heard taller in americaand he was not indisposed for ungodly society after the reek of the chapel that the genial showman would instantly see the matter from his point of view he did not doubt but tony flip was not in the diningroom even in dishabille and the waiter was still so occupied with late or leisurely diners as apparently to be unable to conjure him up ive just taken him up his breakfast he said with an envious sigh no youll find him but to intrude thus on the showmans privacy seemed indelicate he waylaid a chambermaid in the corridor and asked her to tell mr flippance a gentleman would be glad to see him when he had finished his meal she brought back a mysterious answer as from miss flippance that he never saw cleanshaven gents will fired up as at an insult evidently the rogue was not going to be so malleable that daughter of his too he remembered had no proper respect for jinny tell em ill wait here till my beard grows he commanded the chambermaid hung back giggling he felt in his pocket for a sixpenceagain encountering only lining if you dont take my message ill kiss you he menaced it was a jest that never failed him and it did not fail now though the fleeing tuckerin giggled more than ever he watched her enter the lions den but hardly had she done so when the noble animal himself padded forth grinning like a cheshire cat his fork protruded like a claw and justspluttered coffee dripping from his great jaws over the breast of his flamboyant hundredstained hide where is he he roared genially to the dark corridor come in come in will advanced defiantly so its you i was wondering what wit heaven had dropped with the thunder yankee yumouri ought to ha guessed it and he nearly spitted will on his fork in his enthusiastic effort to shake hands ill wait till my beard growsha ha ha that goes in this very nightno theres no show tonight hang it dont go polly he called as he pulled will into the room over a barrier of bluchers and wellingtons and even hessian boots with silken tassels we must get that into hamlet when i say to ophelia get thee to a nunnery go farewell ill wind up until thy beard grows thatll be your new cue polly but thatll spoil the scene miss flippance protested poised in a morning wrapper in the open doorway between the two rooms she was mysteriously mantled in aromatic clouds like the spirit in the mistletoe bough yet her father did not seem to be smoking not at all polly he persisted its just the right grotesque spirit therell be a laugh the one thing hamlet needs even the ghost dont carry it off youd better give me the line persisted miss flippance itll come better in the mad scene well well talk about iti think youve seen our american friend before before and behind said miss flippance viciously a scowl traversing her pockmarks and since he left me in the lurch i wasnt sorry to think id seen the back of him but as miss quaras the carrier hadnt got your drumstick there was nothing to return for apologized will then why have you she snapped and closed the door behind her with a similar snap vi pollys in a pet commented her parent she dont like being worried by actors in search of jobs specially on sundays its your hairless phiz you know but im not an actor of course notshe ought to have seen you havent the faceonly the razor ha ha ha will was vaguely resentful but i dare say i could black my face theres more to the drama than othello and more to othello than burnt cork and mr flippance laughed again as he dropped into his wooden armchair and resumed his breakfast at a little table twixt the bedcanopy and the window sit down wont you excuse my backi can hear all you say behind it ha ha thats another good gag eh will glancing round saw that the chair not occupied by his host was hopelessly littered by his garments mixed with papers he therefore dropped on the high fourposterit was now madeand cleared his throat for action youll have a drop of something mr flippance threw backwards mistranslating the sounds no thank you he must not be bribed or drugged will felt he had stern work before him it was as well however to placate the adversary glad to hear the shows a big draw he said and who told you that erthe bradmarsh carrier bless hershe carries all the lies i tell her arent things rosy then i never lie on sundays ha ha ha perhaps its just as well jinny wont do business with me today no old man i ought to be middling mollancholy as they say here but im as happy as the day is longand its getting longer every day he drained his coffeecup voluptuously never mind my businesswhats yours mine i havent come on business then you must have a brandy he reached out and pulled the green bellrope no thank you you see will swung his legs hesitatingly surely you dont think she ought to carry lies who the bradmarsh carrier jinny she has to carry anythingat the proper tariff but is it fair to her if you mean our doing bumper business she dont know its a lie and her telling it helps to make it true why you were itching to see the show yourself as soon as you heard other fools were flocking he turned a grinning face come now confess i didnt come to see the show will contradicted feeling vaguely baffled of course not being sunday but what did you come for cut the cackle and come to the osses i will he said eagerly i hear you want to buy one mr flippance swung round chair and all then you have come on business no i havent well have you got a horse no but i could get one and you dont call that business i didnt mean to will was getting embarrassed it just slipped out what i want to ask of you is where the devil is that waiter broke in the showman reaching for the cord again what i mean is said will determined to get it out before the waiter popped up that theres a girl youre leading into brazen courses a girl me mr flippance pulled himself angrily to his feet and stood glaring at will with the snapped bellcord in his hand like a green serpent you son of ananias if youve listened to any of those scandalmongering swine you ought to be jolly well ashamed of yourself there isnt a cleaner manfor a widowerin all the circuit why i could pile up the dollarsas you call itif id only darken my tent a bit so that the lovers of the drama could go rubbing their noses and licking one another like the calves in the next field but there isnt a brighter show this side of the atlantic besides my girls are all woodtheres not a flesh and blood female with me except polly and shes my own daughter born on the right side of the blanket too which is more than can be said for all of us what may be your name now what has my name to do with it he got off the bed what has his name to do with it asked mr flippance of the waiter who now shot in with a welldivined bottle and appurtenances beg pardon sir and so you may you son of a slug here take this rope and hang yourself with it so you wont tell your name you son of a flea he went on when the waiter had spirited off the breakfasttray well heres my backbite away and with a high tragic gesture he turned to open the brandybottle im not a backbiter said will angrily im a frontpuncher and my name is never mind your name i accepted you you came like the spirit of the may daymixed with the mayflower i opened my heart to you i gave you three names i was duke i was anthony flippance i was tony flip he gurgled the brandy into his glass i demanded no references i entrusted you with posters for my daughter which i delivered honestly but

meand cheap too and why cant you buy your own horses why because im a child of naturea simple playerwho wears his heart on his sleeve for daws to peck at my last mare crocked up in a week in the flower of her youthseems to have been bought in a knackers yard shaved and singed and brushed and combed till she was as shiny as a derby winner they gingered her ears and jaws and cayennepeppered her nostrils till she seemed clothed in thunder like the warhorse in the bible will smiled despite himself and you expect a girl to see through all that look here ill buy your horse mr flippance paused in the act of imbibing oh there we are he said looking shrewd want to cut out jinnys business wills cheeks became chromatically indistinguishable from his hair me do you think i want your dirty commission and do you think i want your stinking horse why the devil do you come interfering will was silent tony finished his glass like a victor if it aint the commission what are you after thats my business said will sullenly just what i said crowed tony but id rather pay jinny a quid than you a bob shes got her old grandfather to keep yes and hes as selfish and inconsiderate as you but she

wouldnt drag me back to the legitimate were talking of caravan horses said will at once mystified and mollified you seem to know all about it i guess you ran a show yourself in the states will smiled darkly thats not your affair but it might be im not above a partner with capital dukes marionettes are getting shabby the ghost is nearly black ophelia wants a new coat of paint harlequin is out of joint and the clowns cheeks are worn white and weve got too few characters and too many plays the public are on to it when they see hamlet turning up again in the beggar of bethnal green some new scenery too would smarten up the show i shant expect you to pull the stringsjust put up the chinkers and well divvy up you and me and polly now dont say no too quick drink it over and beaming beneficence he again tendered will the other glass this time will took it hearing himself clink it against tonys through a daze as he asked himself whether after all this notionutterly fantastic and unexpected as it wasmightnt be as good a way as any other of investing his ninety pounds he would certainly be in a position then to stop jinny from buying the horse well what do you say cried tony but you dont know my name murmured will with the stir of adventure and brandy in his veins pooh whats in a name a nose by any other name would swell as red and laughing he clapped will on the shoulder well spruce up the tent too and slick up the caravana dingy old hearse aint the best advertisement on a tour and why shouldnt you take some of the parts pity to waste your twang wed get some american figures madecowboys and slavedealers and suchand spice our ghosts and goblins with colonel bowie knives and yankee yumour we might even turn the bridegroom in the mistletoe bough into a rich newyorker and make the bride moulder away in an american trunk theres a fortune in it i dont mean in the trunkha ha ha with a last instinct of sanity will observed maliciously that it was sunday he merely meant to remind tony that that was his day for truth but the showmans glass nearly fell from his fingers you too he said and that jinnyas lively a girl as ever stepped and mother ganderas buxom a landlady as ever bussed a bagman whats come over the east anglian circuit and i took you for a man of the world unwilling to repudiate that status will remarked flabbily that precisely as a man of the world he didnt see any money in marionettes no money mr flippance swelled with indignation as he pointed out that drury lane and the mines of golconda were not in it with marionettes properly equipped and springcleaned the public was simply panting for highclass puppets it goaded will to emphasize his meaning is this your sunday talk or your weekday talk he interrupted dryly didnt you just tell me that youre doing badly mr flippance admitted it almost without a wince and had he not given the reason to take money out you must put money in i tell you theres a fortune in it he repeated sunk asked will blandly he added vengefully that he would consider a partnership when the stuffed elephant came home from the crystal palace tony in crimson comprehension rushed at the litter on the spare chair and dragged out a newspaper from under the neckties read that he said sublimely the essex county chronicle and his semigilded forefinger indicated a heavily blued passage our readers will be interested to know read will that it is a local showman who supplied the great stuffed elephant that holds her majestys gorgeous howdah in mr paxtons marvellous glass he dropped the paper i beg your pardon he said too disconcerted to realize that the local showman need not necessarily be tony flip but i really would rather not talk business today and i dont know anything about yoursthat wasnt my line in the states i never even saw a puppetshow in my life outside punch and judy a real live drama now he concluded vaguely meaning that he had at least seen real plays and utterly unforeseeing the effect the remark would have upon his host for tony flip bounded like a large mechanical toy plumped down again in his chair turned its back and his own to his guest and stuffing jewelled forefingers into both his ears cried out get thee behind me satan avaunt avaunt vii me satan said will astonished who ever heard of satan refusing to do business on sunday if his last innocent remark had produced convulsive effects in a perpendicular direction this set tony flip rolling from side to side in his chair yankee yumour he gasped between the spasms lord he said at last youll drive me to set up a minstrel show only to get that in will though puzzled could hardly help being flattered by these proofs of his facetious talents it was strange he thought how different the conversation went when he was with jinny then the laugh seemed always at his expense i should think a minstrel show would be more fun he observed tony veered round with his armchair ceased to laugh and regarded will with large reproachful eyes and you cant about sunday he said and then to come tempting me back to that witches sabbath of a profession nigger minstrels will murmured more dazed than ever as if nigger minstrels werent halfway to your othello no you son of satan to hell with your capital didnt you hear me say ditto to the ratcatcher they are dens of the deviltheatres then why do you run one me i dont class my show as a theatre marionettes keep themselves to themselves but you play shakespeare tony held up his fat glittering forefinger we pull shakespeares stringspolly and me but theres no actors the public can drag before the curtain will admitted the difference but not the moral distinction you ever met any actors and actresses said tony will could not pretend to that privilegeif mr flippance and his daughter refused to be countedand there was a long silence in which tony seemed to the outer eye to keep sips of brandyandwater lingering on his palate though he was reallyit transpiredchewing the cud of bitter memories for suddenly he burst out i lived all my life with em ive managed em for yearsor rather failed to manage em born in a green room rocked in a witches cauldron and baptized in greasepaint my ma was a leading ladyshe played heroines and my father wrote the melodramas and they know a good melodrama at the eagle yesive heard of the eagle in london said will ah you know it by the song perhaps up and down the city road in and out the eagle thats the way the money goes pop goes the weasel i never heard a weasel go pop will laughed it was the mouse if anything though i did once see a stoat crack up before a cat tonys mien relaxed in a faint smile the weasel was a tailors iron he explained pawned by the reckless snip to raise money for treating the damsels who danced with him on that openair platform to which the eagles audience streamed out betwixt the drama and the farce he added simply thats where my don juan of a dad first clapped eyes on a girl pretty of course but with no more acting in her than mother gander yet would you believe it he shoved her into the lead instead of ma and wrote a piece all for her and what was worse it was a big go that was the last straw and clasping me to her wounded bosom she left him poor ma i should have thought shed ha left him sooner murmured will vaguely uncomfortable under these frank domestic revelations it isnt so easy to leave a man youre not married to said tony will gasped ah that surprises you said the showman complacently with a cautious glance at his daughters door of communication he produced two cigars furtively from his washstand drawerwas he forbidden to smoke will wondered youll find that good he said pressing one upon his guest you see he explained as they puffed at these excellent weeds in a new intimacy if a woman leaves her husband it makes a scandal he dont like whereas a man thats not tied is only too glad to be rid of her oh i aint defending ma mind youit only shows she was a born actress i dare say shed only sucked up to pa to get parts but when he unstarred her fine emotional actress as she was she could never get her foot in again in london to play leads i mean for she was too proud to play anything else i can play anything except second fiddle she used to say and rather than cave in she married a fifthrate manager called jim flippance who had only a fitup theatre carries its own props scenery and proscenium but not openair you know and made him put up pieces with a kid in em to keep me out of mischief but it wasnt long before i soared out of the parental nest and by the time they both joined the majority poor old birds id been leading man or manager or both in half a dozen theatres two of em london houses will receiving this information with a silent curl of his smoke as though it were another elephantine claim mr flippance added vehemently real london theatres mind you not those swindling gaffs for paying amateurs described by bozthats charles dickens you know youve read dickens will shook his head too heavy and highclass for me they dont like him in the states eitherive heard he wrote a piece against them ah but you should hear him read his christmas carol theres a wasted actor for you lord if id had the running of that chap will was more interested in the girl who cut out mr flippances ma i hope your fatheryour pa he substituted politely married his new flame he said even through the glow of the brandy and the blur of the smoke he was dismayed by this dishevelled life how could he he had a wife in cork yes i forgot to say pa was irish ive always gone by my mothers married name but you can have my fathers name if you wish not for a million pounds said will you yankee yumorist tony blew a playful puff of smoke at him well youll see it if you come across the old eagle playbills or those of flippances fitup for that matter for we did all pas playsma had played them so long she knew all the parts pa sent her a lawyers letterfor she didnt even trouble to change the titles or the authors namebut she defied him to wash his dirty linen in court knowing how virtuous his eagle public was and that it might ha ruined him and his moral melodramas they seem a funny lotstage folk will commented bless you theres no bearing of em will relieved said he was glad mr flippance didnt approve of such morals morals tony glared at him whos talking of morals men will be men and women women whether theyre pros or public you didnt find america a sundayschool i reckon will coughing over his liquor supposed a man could have his fun anywhere thats what i say said the showman and on the other hand ive known actors as respectable as your ratcatcher im one of em myself as i told you just now id seen too many dead flies in the honeyand my pollys as pure as her poor dead mother no it aint their morals that bother me its their ways holy moses to think of the time i had travelling round managing these sons of dragons and hellcats i envied ma and flippance in the churchyard under their favourable stone notices the jealousies the catanddog bickerings the screams and hysterics who should play this or that who should be largest on the programmes and posters who should stand in the limelight who should take the callthey never quarrelled who should take the bird thats the hiss in our lingo they were always hissing at one another or at the poor manager thats me ive seen the leading man and the leading lady take their call hand in hand and the moment the curtain was down resume spitting fire at each other it wasnt that they had any vanity they said it was only that their position demanded they should take calls singly or be printed larger than each other cocks and catamarans i tell you if i hadnt swopped with duke for his marionettes i should have had little rosebushes growing out of me now and that favourable stone notice over me oh the peace of itits sunday all the week i can see marionettes would be easier to manage said will smiling ah but to feel it as i do you must have lived through it mr flippance rose in his emotion and paced animatedly you must have had a hornets nest for your seat and a brood of vipers in your bosom and shared diggings with the furies oh my radiant juvenile your suncoloured hair would have been snow if you had gone through what i have if youd had ophelia in hysterics and hamlet in liquor and even the ghost hardly able to walk and the callboy crying the curtain was up and the audience stamping and whistling and shorttempered people at the boxoffice demanding their money back youd be able to measure the feeling of thankfulness that comes over the cockles of my heart when i stand in my theatre and see my leading lady sitting so angelic on her wires unable to move hand or foot without me or when i jerk my leading man out of the centre of the stage all in a heavenly calm and to see the curtain come up and down with nobody scuffling behind it to bob and smirkoh the jerusalem restfulness there maynt be as much rhino in marionettes as in flesh and blood you just said there was more will reminded him unkindly i meant compared with the capital put in said tony without turning a hair you dont risk much when you dont have to pay your actors but duke wasnt mercenary and it was the glory that appealed to him poor man hed inherited the business like me but hed always been ambitious after high art he told me and flippances fitup was his boyhoods dream we did the swop over mulled claret last christmas eve in this very inn peace and goodwill thinks i as we clinked tumblers on the deal youve got the goodwill but peace no that youll never see again will smiled ill really have to come and see those blessd puppets he said as the showman replenished the glasses tony replied that he should see the whole boiling of them either before or after the show neatly packed in their big box and if theres any youd like to kick youre welcome he said what damage your property it would work off my bitter memories but theyre not the real live actors notheres the pity said tony but they look so realtheyre lifesize you knowthat i sometimes yell at em and abuse em just for the satisfaction of their not answering back and the leading lady looks as if she had a tongue to heri promise you a tonguebut thank the lord it can only talk shakespeare or noble sentimentscant even nag the management for a new dress as for the juvenile lead i cant help tweaking his nose sometimes for the sake of auld lang syne polly cant understand my spoiling his beautyi cant make her see im getting a bit of my own backand when she catches me punching the low comedians head with a boxingglove she saucers her eyes as though i was going dotty but she never had to manage em and i had to travel em toodont forget that fancy carting around a menagerie all in the same cage but i have my revenge when i travel em nowinto the box they goleads below and the heavy man sitting on their heads ha ha haand utilities and supers on top of all and it dont raise a whisper talk of the lion lying down with the lamb believe me old cock that there millennium will never come till were all on wires he drew vigorously at the cigar his eloquence had all but extinguished theres a lot of the brutes he mused between the puffs that dont know tony flips escaped out of hell and they write and call for engagementssame as polly thought you didand if it isnt sunday i take em to see my company and rub their noses into em so to speak look at em i say every man and woman knowing their place and when to speak and when to hold their blooming tongue every one knowing their parts too which is more than you ever did ill be bound no wigs no makeups no dresses no young bloods or decrepit dandies coming behind no prompter nobody missing their cue or unpunctual or hysterical no bardell versus pickwick nobody drunk married divorced deceased laid up locked up or run over between the dress rehearsal and the first night no understudies eating their heads off in the way when theyre not wanted and missing their cues when they are no sore throats no funerals to go to no babies to getif theres a baby wanted i order it from the makers and above all my boy say i to em no treasury whats that inquired will whats that well im blowed thats payday and kindly note i say to em that lead dont

halfcrowns as for curtaincalls the singing chambermaids got the same chance as lady macbeth and when it is a leading man thats come for a berth i take him to the front of the booth where theres a retired village idiot i picked up banging the drum look there says i hes not got much brains but he isnt wood and thats the only fleshandblood job ive got left in this blooming shop if you like to take it why in recognition of your position ill throw in an extra naphtha flare and what do they say laughed will it cant be repeated on a sunday but you can picture em black in the faceall except the nose that gets redder than ever hullo charley come in come in through the open door he had caught sight of the landlord in the corridor cant stop tony mr mott was in fact hurrying to take advantage of his spouses return to chapel ganderpecked again i suppose laughed the showman ah charley youd be much happier if you had a wife on wires there you go again and mr mott eager to join old pals at their fishing sniggered past leaving a reek of hairoil poor chap sighed tony but theres always hope for a man whose wife wont call in a doctor will laughed and cunningly took advantage of all this expansive geniality to escape from the room and the threatened transaction and to call from the doorstep as he took his farewell then its settledi get the horse if you bring it into the partnership cried tony after him not otherwise will found himself waylaid by polly as he passed her doorway she beckoned him within with a mysterious masterful forefinger and he seeing the moreen curtains of her fourposter discreetly drawn entered though not without puritan misgivings she drew another curtain over the closed door communicating with her fathers room and turned the key dont waste my cigar she said as he held it behind him i can see pas given you one of mine and taking up her glowing fagend from the ashtray she resumed her suction of it sipping in the intervals at a glass of milk i suppose you wont share my drink she said simply no thank you he said hardly believing his eyes though he now understood whence came the clouds in which he had found her mantled perhaps she was really a man in disguise despite her long earrings but then would ever a male take milk with his cigar what with tobacco and horsiness what was the sex coming to and yet there seemed something symbolic in this combination of stimulants this masculinity mitigated by milk what do you want to say to me he asked keeping the front door open with his hand whats this about a partnership she said softly i couldnt help hearing dont ask me said will in tones hushed as cautiously mr flippance did speak of it but ive never thought of the theatre as a business only as a spree did he want you to take a theatre she asked anxiously good heavens no he called it hell miss flippance smiled sadly thats his way of consoling himself hes dying to get a stock company again but he mustnt have even a theatre for amateurs id fight it tooth and nail its bad for him i know its bad for me said miss flippance she puffed out a cloud you see thered be no place for me i can wipe most actresses off the stage but im not prettyat least not since my illnessand the public wont have meexcept at the piano where i turn my back on them plain actresses must be heard and not seen oh will was taken aback by such candour besides one of the women would probably entangle him into marriage i dont mind his having a wife on wires and a smile came travelling over the pits of her face you dont mean to say he really wants to go back to hell said will dazed dont the moths after youve saved em from the lamp and it was no easy task saving him christmas after christmas i used to jest peace and goodwill indeed youll never have peace till youve got rid of your goodwill but thats what he says himself said will navely so he cant be craving to go backits the marionettes he wanted me to stand in with thats all my eye he dont know how happy he really is nowadays playing all the mens parts that was always the trouble in a real theatre especially when he was cockofthewalkhe never could make up his mind which part he wanted first hed try one and then think another was better and throw it up in the middle and take away the other mans part nobody likes to give up a halfdigested part and it doesnt make things easier when after all you get it back again imagine the ructions he was always making and im not going to have it all over again hes got all the parts now and so its going to stay with which ultimatum she held out her hand and gripped him with what he felt a manly clasp and an honest dont you be his partner she counselled hes lost all his own money and its not likely hed multiply yours he might have been a big london actor or manager but the bible sized him up before he was born unstable as water thou shalt not excel if only at least one can keep him to water no you stick to your cash theres no money in the show for more than him and memy last jewellery will have to go for the horseand if youve really got the dollars hed have a theatre with you as juvenile lead before you could say jack robinson and then hed steal your part and drive you to drink will replied firmly still holding her hand that he was going to put his money into farming and by the way would she countermand that order to the carrier for the horse oh but we must have a horse said polly quite so but why through jinny he was prepared himself he explained to get them the best animal at the lowest price and for what commission she queried for love said will polly withdrew her hand no thank you wed best let it go through jinnylike everything else chapter vii comedy of corydon and amaryllis among the rest a shepherd though but young yet hartend to his pipe with all the skill his few years could began to fit his quill willie he hight fair was the day but fairer was the maid who that days morn into the greenwoods strayd sweet was the air but sweeter was her breathing such rare perfumes the roses are bequeathing browne britannias pastorals i it was the shepherdcowman and not jinny who delivered the horn to will she had happened of him master peartree explained tediously in the remote field to which he had taken the sheep to feed off the winter barley powerfully trumpeting for him with it just when he was looking for fly when indeed in the very act of discovering a maggoty rump she had besought him to convey that liddle ole horn she being so late and granfer likely to be in a taking now this liddle ole hornwhen will saw master peartree and his sheepdog coming along in the evening lighthe took to be the shepherds crook or his great umbrella folded so lengthy did it loom and when he perceived that it was what he was expected to perform on he was taken aback it was not that he had not seen coachhorns in plenty but he had seen them in their proper environment and at their proper altitude their elemental straightforwardness making an exhilarating rightangle with the guards mouth a sort of streaming pennon but a coachhorn in its bare quiddity quite as tall as the shrunken old shepherd and hardly a foot shorter than will himself dissociated from jovial visions of scarlet rumsoused visages and spanking steeds was as ungainly to behold and as awkward to handle as it was difficult to explain away evidently the jade had bought him the largest size on the market he knew not whether to be flattered or vexed at her idea of the appropriately virile but to send it by this alien handto make a village wonder and scandal of it how indeed was he to explain to the bucolic mind his sudden passion for the instrument flutes and concertinas folks could understand even tin whistles but what could a man looking round for a farm want with a colossal coachhorn he was glad at least he had met master peartree out of sight of his parents there was a note attached to the case and he opened it the more eagerly that it delayed the explanation which master peartree seemed to his morbid vision to be grimly awaiting sirmr daniel quarles has pleasure in forwarding per favour of bearer mr william flynts esteemed order bill enclosed i hope you will find the stature agreeable to youit was only by casualty i got such a protracted one and as the compass protracts with the stature you could easily educe three octaves from it halftones of course i shall not expect as without holes only a musical arabian spirit like my granddaughter can evoke them but when you can play the buy a broom polka with concinnity i shall consider the gloves fairly conquered i remain yours obediently daniel quarles psthe mouthpiece unscrews being mutable so i can exchange it for another if this does not suit mr william flynts lips how the deuce was he to play a polka he had never heard especially with concinnity whatever that might be was the dominant thought in his perturbed brain but as master peartree seemed still expectantwas it even of a tunewill stooped down to pat the dog whose blacktipped tail was hoisted like a friendly signal it was a ragged animal just between two coatsa canine counterpart of its shabby stragglyhaired masterbut will caressed it like a velvety lapdog while he inquired carelesslyhis horn tucked like a telescope under his armhow the carrier had carried herself what exactly she had said but he only provokedafter the briefest glimpse of the girla rambling narrative about a sheep that had broken its arm in a roosh in the panicky restlessness of the thundery sunday it had fallen down a steep and another had rolled on top of it and even with this meldoo the sheep were so pernickety you could do naught with em doubtless in this cloudy heat they felt the weight of their woolhe should be shearing some for the early market as soon as they could get the labour which was not easy in these migrating days even young men who came back lazed about he added pointedly when they might be earning good money will hastened to inquire whether the shearers were as merry at their work as he remembered them he could never forget the beautiful bass voice of master peartree but he supposed time had now abated its resonancy or was he mistaken he was mistaken he admiringly admitted for the ancient was soon quavering out in a piping voice there was a sheep went out to reap and will beating time with the great horn was solemnly singing the chorus chrissimus day chrissimus day and now would the famous singer oblige with the buy a broom polka alas he did not know it with or without concinnity but young ravens might know it he who was as full of tunes as a dog of fleas and with his perpetual flow of melody made bread and tea like harvest suppers and shearing days as jolly as chrissimus but where was this musical box alas he had gone furrin being somewhere beyond southend but master expected him back for the shearing he was a rolling stone was ravens but he usually rolled back this time o year no not rolled with liquor nor yet like the sheep that broke its arm had it been a fat sheep he would have butchered it but as it was only store he had set the arm himself no he had no need of a vet for that like the degenerate young shepherds nowadays he wouldnt be beholden to cattledoctors not he keeping for ever o salts and gentians and bottles of lotion in his hut although suspicioning shabit might even be rot from the rivermarshin one of the sheep which he had just been examining for fly he had taken the opportunity to ask jinny to send round elijah skindle tis a long talk that has no turning and will when the narrative thus came by a wide detour back to jinny ceased fidgeting with the horn and demanded what she had said to that it transpired that she had refused to order elijah despite that mrs flynt had recommended him as cheaper alleging drat her that jorrow was the better man will curiously forgetting mr flippance and his horse concurred in the view that carriers cannot be choosers he also started another current of indignation against carriers getting other folks to fetch and carry for them would the hardworking shepherd who was too easily put upon kindly not encourage the girl in future to shirk her job touched by the sense of his own magnanimity and the sixpence slipped into his palm the good shepherd promised to repress his obligingness in the interests of the higher ethics and will bidding him farewell slipped behind the row of stagheaded poplars opposite the gate of frog farm and strovebefore entering the houseto adjust his horn down his trousers and up his back it was no easy process with such a protracted object fortunately it was thin save at the swelling end but by keeping this bulge below he could avoid humping his back to walk with such a ramrod up it and adown one leg would however have taxed the talents of the most graceful damsel training for deportment he hobbled painfully to the rear of the farmhouse designing to hide the horn before entering but lo there was his mother filling the foodpot of his neglected ferrets oh my poor will she exclaimed i told your father youd have rheumaticssitting in chapel in your damp clothes she tried to take him pitifully in her arms but he limped away fearing she would imagine his backbone had come outside its only one leg a bit stiff he said ungraciously but she hooked her arm in his and drew her halt offspring towards the back door a brief but parlous journey for he felt the horn slipping towards his boot why your ankles swollen said martha tragically itll soon go down he assured her a terrible struggle agitated the maternal heart even will preoccupied with his grotesque position could see her face working youre sure you wouldnt like to have the doctor oh no mother what nonsense her clouds lifted a little but this may be jinnys evening for comingi could tell her to go for him tomorrow tomorrow itll be betteri feel certain mother she beamed im so glad youve found faith dearie i knew when once you began studying the texts you couldnt miss it king asa too suffered from his feet but he sought to the physicians and displeased the lord have no confidence in man dearie theres days i get pains in my side as if my ribs grated together but id be afraid to put myself out of the lords hands after ive trusted to him all these years will winced he seemed to himself vaguely blasphemous as soon as he was alone in his bedroom the swelling was transferred to the capacious box so miraculously carried from chipstone he dared not descend to supper so speedy a miracle might have seemed too peculiar but next morning after a family breakfast which was for his elders a veritable feast of faith he stole out with the horn and his fishingrod and creel to the river which in the watches of the night he had decided upon as the loneliest spot for practising while the open ramshackle boathouse where the rusty punt usually nested was to afford a hidingplace for the instrument it was worth while going down that pastoral slope these days even were one not bent on music solitude and the winning of gloves in weather so prematurely sultry the river was so sweet and still and green with its shadowy reflections its blobs of duckweed the sedges and flags along its banks and the willowsgreywhite or silveryalong its borders gliding so tranquilly in its reaches and lapping so lazily round its islands that only at bends did the water seem to flow at all in the undulating meadows that sloped to it silted with cowdroppings master peartrees kine lay around chewing and the sense of brooding heat gave to the landscape a dreamy magic suffused with a sense of water it was to this idyllic retreat that our tityrus or corydon repaired to essay his metallic pipe and standing on the bank like a watchman his horn to his lips tucker tucker he breathed industriously into the unresponsive instrument in vain did he lip and tongue the notes as instructed nothing broke the sultry silence surely the mouthpiece could not suit mr william flynts lips suddenly in his shamed impotence he had a sense of a breathing presence in his agitation the horn slipped from his nervous fingers and went souse into the water while the startled beastfor the observer proved to be only one of master peartrees cowslumbered bouncingly back along the pasture fortunately the instrument had lodged in the shallow mud of the bank fishing it upit was his sole catch that weekhe found to his joy that it emitted a faint toot and he rightly divined that a little water was just what it had needed encouraged by this intervention of providence in his favour his performance bore henceforwards some proportion to his pains it was embarrassing though to return from these painful puffings without a single bite every dinnertime he had to sneak in as best he could with empty basket after a morning of pertinacious tooting successful enough to frighten off the deafest fish once indeed going home by a somewhat roundabout route that skirted blackwater hall he chanced on a chipstone fishmonger serving long bradmarsh and was able to take home some fruits of his rod but the only time our piscatorial swain ever tried for an honest bite was when he saw or heard somebody or something coming along then drawing in his horn like a snail he presented the picture of the complete angler usually it was only bidlakes barge that disturbed his strenuous solitude and the transient mockery of the twins was for the futile fisher not for the unsuspected musician not even master peartrees cows ever munched their way again to the bank while the horn was at its fell exercises for like the horn which the fairy logistilla presented to astolpho in orlando furioso its blast seemed to put all creation to flight his sole auditors were a pair of swans who refused to quit their normal haunt though they hissed him fiercely possibly they were accustomed to hear old triton blow his wreathd horn and so had a standard of musical taste is not the swans own song too celebrated though it appears only to perform before it dies as if to evade criticism but however soundly the swans might hiss will after three days of redfaced rehearsal on the pleasant bank of the brad felt ready to challenge his female critic in all save the polka she had set for examination and this he determinedafter failing to hunt it outwas no fair part of the wager a whole evening he had spent reknitting the thread of old acquaintanceship with carolling cottagers gleaning much gratitude for his kindly attentions but not the melody he was after and being forced politely to abide while gaffers piped heave away my johnny or gammers ruthlessly completed midsummer fair or dashing away with the smoothing iron however he could now turn out such complicated military flourishes that he excited his own military ardour and felt like marching in his thousands and doing such deeds of derringdo that the lips of all the damsels of essex would vie to change places with that mouthpiece it was high time then that this particular damsel should understand how vain was her hope that he could be baffled by a tube though he might not know that polka he was sure that whatever concinnity might be he could perform with it and impatience began to steal over him at the delay in the test performance for if jinny had fobbed him off with the shepherd on tuesday she evaded service altogether on friday even nip might conceivably crop up with some small groceries tied on to him and he could not try it on the dog also unless he saw her soon the cattle fair would be upon them and she still unsaved he must with the relics of his copybook paper compose a new note formally citing her to stand and hear and deliver the gloves but it was not easy to fix the place for deciding the wager the riverside meadows she could not well get at in her cart and for her to come specially on foot was hardly to be expected in view of her household labours to cut her off and perform to her on a high road was to run risks of being publicly ridiculous even byways have ears suppose his nerve or his breath failed suppose some impish accident muffled up the horn there would he be with swollen cheeks a mountain in labour producing not even a mousesqueak the mock of man and beast but there was steeples woodnot too far back off the high road but approached by a tangly brake that few ever penetrated thereif he could persuade her to itwas the ideal place for the great horn solo in a postscript he would express his willingness to take off her hands the purchase of the showmans horse to convey all this by correspondence involved almost as much effort as the practising though his renewed call upon the bible came to caleb and martha as the natural sequel of his faithcure it was no small feat of composition this particular letter in face of a people which however abundant its horses appeared to have had neither wagers upon them nor gloves riding or other ii that gloves were unknown to the ancient hebrews will could hardly bring himself to believe even by hours of searching especially after coming upon a fashion catalogue for ladies which showed a surprising wardrobe bonnets they had it would appear and headbands and tablets and changeable suits of apparel and mantles and wimples and crisping pins and fine linen and hoods and vails and mufflers and girdles and stomachers as for their jewelcases they seemed stuffed not only with rings and earrings and charms and bracelets and moony tires but likewise with jewels that dangled at the nose or tinkled at the feet how then should so elegant a world have dispensed with gloves but soafter scouring the sacred book from genesis to revelationhe must finally fain believe not a single patriarch priest satrap shepherd physician apostle publican or sinner had ever sported gloves and the queen of sheba fared no better in this respect than the witch of endor solomon in all his glory was not arrayed with even one of these the pharisees it would appear covered their foreheads with phylacterieswhatever these might bebut left their hands bare and yet will thought wistfully reading so early in the sacred book how rebekah put the skins of the kids of the goats upon jacobs hands they might surely in all those centuries have gone on to the idea of gloves especially for winter wear but no thousands of years after rebekah the knuckles of dives were apparently as raw as those of lazarus oh why had he not betted something biblicala muffler now would have suited either sex even handkerchiefs were available not that he could not risk spelling gloves to accord with loves which he found with no great difficulty in the holy text he felt it romantic to throw himself thus trustfully upon love even should it prove misleading yet the search was not altogether vain for though he could find no gloves the prophets he found were full of exhortations to jinny which he carefully dogeared and committed to memory and kept up his sleeve for contingencies how canst thou contend with horses jeremiah asked her ezekiel warned her against the cattledealer by reason of the abundance of his horses their dust shall cover thee as for isaiah he remarked plumply woe unto them that draw iniquity with cords of vanity and sin as it were with a cart rope to himself on the other hand the prophets were kind abounding in promises for the prosperity of his horn and it was amos who supplied his letter with its opening sentence abrupt but dramatic can two walk together except they be agreed but the letter written there was the problem of sending it the intervention of either bundock or daniel was intolerable he must find an individual way one verse that he came uponit was in the book of estherenchanted him with its images telling how mordecai wrote an order in the kings name and sealed it with the kings ring and sent letters by post on horseback riders on mules camels and young dromedaries how he would have liked to seal his letter too with a royal ring and send it by post on horseback he had a vision of the long procession of mules camels and dromedaries filing along the grassgrown lane to blackwater hall how old daniel would rub his eyes at the strange humped beastsyes and jinny too she would perhaps think that mr flippance had acquired a new show and was paying her a processional visit possibly these animal images did lead him to the invention of his postal method or possibly it was his prior apprehension of jinnys utilizing nip as a packagebearer at any rate after having wondered whether marthas pigeons could be trained up in the way they should go he hit on the device of tying his note to nips collar the creature was friendly and that saturday afternoon it would be at home he would only have to hover long enough around blackwater hall for his postdog to fawn upon him of course there was no certainty the dangling missive would escape daniels spectacles but nip being providentially of the colour of paper it was possible heaven had not blanched him in vain besides this time the note was carefully addressed to miss jinny quarles with the quarles scratched out by an afterthought when he remembered that it was not her name but alas nip did not play up that longedfor quadruped did not appear in the purlieus of the hall will tired of carrying about the note thought again of sticking it up in the stable and ventured near but his fear of encountering daniel quarles was too lively and finally he essayedwith some obscure remembrance of bowery melodramato fix it gleamingly in the fork of a tree by which methusalem stood when harnessing and unharnessing to his amaze a chaffinch flew out of the fork in violent protest while her gaily coloured consort dashed up from another quarter crying uwhit at him like an avine flippance peeping into the hollow of the fork he saw a couple of rather belated youngsters ugly baldheaded and featherless apparently newhatched and almost savouring of the egg yet when he touched them with the note opening great eyes and yawning with yellow beaks and kicking each other with skeleton legs but before he could bethink himself of a new postingplace lo as sudden as the chaffinches but far more welcome with a yelp of joy and a perpendicular tail wagging like a mad pendulum nip was upon him and having succeeded with a desperate bound in licking the tip of his stooping chin rolled himself on motherearth with voluptuous grunts will profited by this supineness to attach the note by the thread he had passed through it the new postal system was a success for when will after high tea sneaked out to the common and sounded his hornwith a happy combination of challenge salute and signalnip actually appeared with a reply it was however unsatisfactory miss bolderothe very name though he divined it denoted the same jinny came like a glacial blastpresented her compliments to mr william flynt but she had no time to be romantic in woods she said nor even at their homes could she ever pay more than volant visits to anybody and that strictly in the way of daniel quarless business he could almost always find her at blackwater hall except tuesdays and fridays but she trusted he would not be too turgid and thrasonical about his playing even if his contumacious serenade should be puissant enough to extort the pair of gloves all these strange words came of course from the universal spellingbook will though he would still have refused to toot before her grandfather might have felt less crushed had he known that in that ancient authority romantic was defined as idle iii it is possible that persons of strict ethicslike miss gentry saywould have lost sympathy with jinny in these epistolary efforts of hers to stand on tiptoe so to speak and write beyond her education but in thus titivating her style with gems of speech she knew not to be false she was moved by the necessity of countering an overweening overbearing interfering young man who was subtly assuming a sort of critical wardenship over her and her life he needed a good vibration shaking or beating she must teach him by her gelidity coldness to be less conversant familiar and that she was quite his parallel equal he must be made to feel that her company was not to be had for the rogation asking in short that she was no housekeeping ignoramus to be ridden over by worldtravelled wisdom however genuine no she was not going to incurvate bow or bend to mr william flynt this rigidity was the more necessary as ever since in that thunderstorm his hand had tightened on hersor was it the reversethe lightnings seemed to pass through her the reverberations to shake her whenever she thought of him and even when she did not what there was in him to rend her thus elementally she could not understand doubtless it was the memory of the storm now for ever associated with him he seemedit was perhaps his life of adventureto be in mystic unison with tempests and floods and that seacreek of her childhood now remembered exclusively as tossing and whiteflecked even when she was turning over her spellingbook to find words to vibrate him with it was the pages that vibrated when she copied its gelid trisyllables she felt her hand again in his and her quill quivered as if the lightning were going through it and even miss gentry though she would have derided jinnys new vocabulary might have admitted that there was a laudable side to her pursuit of learning the spellingbook itself overflowed with commendation of such scholastic zeal jinny no longer knitted or sewed in her evening hour of leisure it was occupiedeven after the concoction of the grandiose letterin a feverish study of the volume neglected since her first scholastic period she must make herself a greater intellectual power she felt she must master all human knowledge and that all human knowledge lay in the hundred and fifty pages of this little book our simple village girl who was not romantic in any sense of that word who except for bible and hymnbook had never read a booknot even a noveland who approached life with senses fresh and virginal sincerely and crudely believed nor was the pose of the universal spellingbook calculated to dissipate her delusion this wonderful work which was now destined to become jinnys guide philosopher and friend had nothing in common with those shallow productions of a later period concerned mainly with correct combinations of letters dating from the age of folios and exhibiting despite its diminutive size the same solid solemnity it did really take all knowledge for its province you learnt for example how to make the very ink you spelled withand although you may rarely have possessed those best blue galls of aleppo which formed the base of black still you might hope to get the three pints of stale beer that were the substratum of red and not only all knowledge but all morals formed the farrago of this book well might it ostentate among its patronizers clergymen private gentlemen philomaths writing masters and heads of academies originally publishedas already relatedin the year of the lisbon earthquake and creating apparently as great a sensation in england at least it constituted an omnium gatherum so peculiar and extensive that there was no earthly or heavenly subject you could be certain of not meeting there though there was one subject you could be certain of never escaping for it cropped up in the quaintest connexionsand that was virtue as the authorwho hailed oddly from the royal exchange assurance officejustly claimed in his dedication to the right honourable slingsby bethell esq lord mayor of the city of london and one of its representatives in parliament an encourager of everything tending to the practice of piety and the good of mankind it was designed to do more than barely teach the young idea how to spell to inculcate into the minds of youth early notices of religion and virtue and to point out to them their several duties in the various stages of life was no less its aim and i should be very thankful explained his lordships obliged obedient and most humble servant should i prove an instrument in the hand of providence in preventing but one of the rising generation from falling a sacrifice to the pernicious doctrines secret whispers and perpetual insinuations of popish emissaries it was a passage that had always swelled jinnys bosom with emotion and the vow to ensure the gratification of this saintly aspiration by supplying in herself the minimum one member of the rising generation to baffle these minions of the scarlet woman it had been at first a little bemusing to reflect that for her peculiar friends the established church was little less pernicious still fended by the double buffer of her sect and protestantism she had thus far resisted the emissaries she had never encountered for certainly the rev mr fallow whatever the chipstone curate might say of his puseyite practices had never tried to pervert her even to the establishment with three generations brought up on this pious pabulumthe copy from which sidrach the owler had educated himself for smuggling was already beyond the fiftieth editionit seemed strange that the century should have had any declensions from virtue to note that papistry should have progressed was incredible if in her dim childish way jinny had ever felt a jarring note in this treasurehouse of virtue and information it was the assumption that both these existed primarily for little boys true among the fascinating woodcuts was one depicting little girls at school but even there the mistress occupied the stiff chair while the dominie of the boys school majestic in a fullbottomed wig sat throned on a chair with arms a good child will love god she read with humid eyes only to be pulled up short by he will put his whole trust in him everything seemed to be masculine from god downwards there was no place for women even in punishment to be well whipt at school and at home day and nighta recommendation she found it difficult to reconcile with the definition of ferula as a foolish instrument used in some schoolswas a nemesis held out only to the boy who minded not his church his school and his book such a one would live and die a slave a fool and a dunce but as to the fate of bad little girls there was a mysterious silence even for their goodness there was no sure reward for though presumably they were included in the wellbehaved who would be clothed in garments of gold and have a crown of gold set on their head while angels rejoiced to see them these joys were never definitely attached to an exclusively feminine pronoun a virtuous woman appeared once to her relief but it was only to be a crown to her husband even in the footnotes jinny could not find a female if the young learner has learnt to read these lessons pretty perfectly said one note let him go over them once more as for the useful fables it was the boy that stole apples or went into the water instead of going to school and when it came to the longest story of all life truly painted in the natural history of tommy and harrythe story that professed to show youth the ways of life in general and did indeed show how wickedness wrecks you on the coast of barbary where you are torn to pieces by wild beasts as per woodcut while the pattern of virtue and goodness still lives happyit appeared that even a realistic picture of life may be complete without girls iv behold however jinnydespite her sexembarked on a learned career and burning the midnight oil in her fat little lamp instead of curling up in her chest of drawers puckering her brow she sat on a squat wooden armchair in that dun papered livingroom imbibing virtue and information till the dutch clock in the outer boxroom startled her with its emphatic declaration of the hour and the cracked mirror revealed eyes heavylidded far out over the common streamed the curtained light of that midnight oil for the shutter could not be closed owing to a pair of blackbirds that had set up house in the eaves jinny had found one of the young fallen on the grass she had fed it with morsels of meat which it swallowed with great yellow gulps following up the meal with a fluted grace she had restored it to its nesttouched to mark the domestic virtue of its coincubating parents it had grown quite big now and flown hoppingly away with short sharp cries but jinny still cherished the nest and felt no need of the barring shutter in the silence the creakings of the cottage often sounded like footsteps outside but jinny was not nervous and a real footstep would rouse nip she knew sometimes these warm may nights she heard the cuckoo keeping hours as late as hers sometimes the nightingales would sing passionately in the lane there was one she knew that niched in a mutilated ivyswathed trunk bordering on the common and she would hear it answering the faint melancholy calls from afar with throbs and gushes of melody as well as with a series of quick piercing notes and sometimes when the air was clear she could hear the distant church clocks but all these sounds like nips and the gaffers snoring were but a restful accompaniment to the acquisition of omniscience even the nightingale in her ignorance of literature failed to romanticize her thoughts painfully bent on mastering all there was to know meanings we have seen played a great part in

called stolidityfoolishness tarantulaa baneful insect valentinea romish festival upholstereran undertaker zodiaca circle in the heavens such were the strange vocables she kept muttering and misunderstanding believing indeed that paramour was merely a grander word for lover and connecting divorce with schismaticone guilty of unlawful separation it pained her to meet the sadduceesa people that denies the being of angels slurring as did these unimaginable heretics the status of her own mother surely it was for such that damnationthe punishment of hell torments had been designed punctuation too she studied growing learned in apostrophes asterisks carets crotchets and obelisks other hours were devoted to grammar tenses degrees of comparison always between good and better boys genitives and even scraps of latin pronunciation however was her great stumblingblock how was it possible to keep ones feet in the chaos say of foursyllabled words each accented on a different syllable antiquary ambassador affidavit animadvertit was heartbreaking and headsplitting her memory so marvellous when vivified by realities broke down before this procession of shadows with what relief she turned to the rich riot of moral and satyric poemsthough her sex was still distressingly ignored and through every loophole the eternal male popped up he most improves who studies with delight and learns sound morals while he learns to write still where swearing gaming and pride were rebuked in lashing lines she was not sorry to find the petticoat conspicuous by its absence it was a rare joy to come on queen anne in a list of abbreviations under the unexpected guise of ar in the list of kings too she appeared again together with mary and elizabeth not a large proportion jinny thought rejoicing at the victoria unforeseen by the learned author whose chronological account of remarkable things stopped like her friend commander daps at the battle of trafalgar this table was indeed one of her favourite pagesit gave her she felt a birdseye view of all historyand with her head for figures she never forgot that the ten commandments and the ten plagues were given in bc and that the sun stood still at joshuas word in while daniel was in the den of lions in she was puzzled though at the destruction of troy which intervened between joshuas interference with the sun and sauls anointment of the twentytwo great events that preceded the christian era this was the only one that the bible forbore to mention subsequently to christianity things seemed to her to have moved fast for up till the year alone fourteen remarkable things occurredtwothirds as many as had happened in the whole previous years since the world was createdwhile after extraordinary events sprouted like blackberries no less than fifty crowding to their grand climacteric in trafalgar in these fifty she was glad to see included the confutation of popery by martin luthera personage with whom miss gentry had made her familiarand she thrilled almost with local pride to find arts and sciences first taught at cambridge for the cambridge carriers sometimes penetrated eastwards as far as chipstone itself as a carrier indeed she was immensely excited by the eleven days successive snow of the frost for thirteen weeks of the terrible high wind of november the great and total eclipse of the sun april and the severe frost for nine weeks beginning on christmas eve she could vividly sympathize with the unfortunate carriers of those days and she did not wonder that these brumal phenomena should form so great a proportion of the few score happenings of universal history for frosts and winds must be terrible indeed to be recounted as on a level with the shooting of admiral byng the american declaration of independence the birth of the prince of wales and the attempted assassination of george iii at drury lane by hadfield a lunatic these studious vigils were invariably wound up with a prayer from this same limitless thesaurus on her knees by the transmogrified chest of drawers and with her hair hanging down her back and the lamplight falling on the coarse greytyped page of the spellingbook jinny repeated one or other of its masculine supplications prose or verse and only a cynic cynica sour crabbed fellow would have laughed at the solemnity with which she swallowed all those motley lucubrations whether lay or clerical an impromptu prayer for her grandfather was invariably slipped in for this holy book of hers finished as terribly as the old testament and what made it worse was that this awful culmination of the spellingbook was printed in blackletter it was a gruesome recital of the miseries and follies of the seven stages of lifenone of which seemed worth living even with the correctest of spelling while death seemed worth dying to escape the depravity and decrepitude of the final stadium but although her grandfather with all his peevish humours could hardly be counted so steeped in sin as the old man of the text while his infirmities were still rudimentary yet the physical prognostication was terrifyingfor when we come to those years that our eyes grow dim ears deaf visage pale hands shaking knees trembling and feet faltering then it is evident the dissolution of our mortal tabernacle is near at hand jinny could never read those dreadful words but she would creep anxiously to the foot of the dark twisting staircase and listen for the reassuring sound of the tabernacle snoring and if she bore so patiently with his whims and crotchets not none of the credit must be given to this sanctimonious spellingbook v while jinny was thus pursuing omniscience and equipping herself to meet the masterful young man and while the young man in question was adding the mastery of the horn to his conquests their roads failed to cross jinny went to chapel the sunday following the thunderstorm but will was too alarmed by the communal expectation of public autobiography to venture there again and his parents were only too glad to ignore his homestaying and to resume their private christapeculiardelphian service being sufficiently fortified by his preoccupation with the bible what had driven will to the book again was the outrageous appearance on saturday night of uncle lilliwhyte as parcelbearer recovering from his relief that the parcel did not contain snakes but the conventional household stores will found himself angry on his mothers behalf what right had jinny to foist such a fusty ragamuffin upon them the gay strings of whose rotting beaver only accentuated his griminess jinny must know that his mother ranked uncleanliness next to ungodliness and uncle lilliwhyte would be a fixture too unless violently shaken offhe was jinnys neighbour as natural a gobetween as wills own neighbour master peartree he had already bribed off the shepherd must he be blackmailed by both and so while essex was at prayer will was concocting a furious oriental epistle demanding a clean envoy if jinny was too lazy to come herself this was not so difficult to demand though laziness seemed as unknown to the hebrews as gloves he had dallied indeed with his original idea of fetching the household parcels from chipstone himself but somehow he could not bring himself to so complete a severance of relations with jinny especially as after the appearance of uncle lilliwhyte in the new rle of goodsdeliverer his mother had surprisingly suggested that to spare methusalems legs the old nondescript might always in future bring the weekly parcel for a penny or two will had put this suggestion emphatically asideit would mean exposing his mother to a contact she detestedbut he wound up his letter to jinny by threatening to become his own carrier unless the service was conducted with propriety nip duly returned that same sunday afternoon with the answer that if he would send his esteemed order in writing mr daniel quarles would have pleasure in executing his commission through a scrupulously scoured ambassador will started replying instantly that it was not his order let her mark that he was not the householder merely the scribe to write out the order however gave him unexpected pause who could have realized that parrafin sope and shuggar were alike unenjoyed by the heathen jews a pity that frog farm was itself so flowing with milk and honey with what confidence he could have drawn on the resources of palestine true one might dodgelamps and oil were abundant enough in juda and purification and sweetness could be suggested with airy allusiveness but in the end he only wrote grandly household order the same as uzual before this order had been executed however chance brought about a meeting not that miss gentry near whose wayside cottage it occurred would have called it chance for that deft needlewoman besides believing in her own stainedglass miracle cherished as we know a nave faith in culpepers complete herbala faith doubtless sustained by the attacks on the pope or on infidel physicians that might lurk snakelike in its most innocentseeming herb under the stimulus of this elementally indelicate worknever permitted to stray from her bedside though imparted in filtered form to jinnyshe would tie woody nightshade round her neck for her dizziness and buy watercress from uncle lilliwhyte to wash away pimples with the juice and if these herbs were as culpeper testified under the respective governance of mercury and the moon how much more so human life miss gentry had indeed remarked to will that very afternoon when he at last brought his mothers bonnet to be bleached as good as new that her own horoscope cast in infancy by her aunt had shown that the first time she went upon a voyage she would be drowned a reading whose infallibility her happy survival demonstrated since she had never been foolish enough to set foot upon a vessel but for the deciphering of this horoscope she had pointed out i should surely now have been drowned for i am naturally as fond of voyages as you it must be admitted that if miss gentry had thus pathetically perished will would not have taken his mothers bonnet to her nor met jinny that afternoon but then would he have met jinny but for the foolish sheep even the ovine fates it would appear are interblent with the human this sheep suddenly dawned upon jinnys vision as methusalem with his cunning nose was trying to open a gate that led over a private road on either side of which its fellows grazed preoccupied with the task of clasping nip so that he should not frighten the flock in his passage she did not at first observe that in the gap between the hinge of the gate and the post a sheeps head was jammed and that methusalems success in lifting the latch bade fair to asphyxiate it the silly creature having escaped from the flock had evidently tried to jump back again through this gap at a point just large enough to admit its head and with the failure of the leap the head had descended into the narrowest portion and there remained in pillory in the creatures terror at the approach of the cart and nips excited barking its efforts to free itself became more convulsive than ever checking methusalem in the middle of his pet trick and fastening up nip jinny jumped down and with soothing words seized the head of the frantic sheep which was still thrusting itself backward and forward though without the sense to jump upwards towards the broader space but alas its spasmodic struggles prevented her from getting a sufficient grip on it to lift the wedged and weighty head she saw its ear was torn and bleeding and to her imagination it was going black in the face she looked round desperately on the other side of the gate lay the flock scattered apathetically over the pasture they had reaped and manured chewing a tranquil cud like selfrighteous citizens before the writhings of one of their own black sheep of a good samaritan or shepherd there was no sign she climbed over the gate and strove to lift the agonizing head from the other side but she only increased the sufferers frenzy as well as nips be quiet nip she shouted almost hysteric herself and as she raised her eyes to admonish the yapping terrier she espied to her joy a puffing pipe and a stick advancing towards her cart whether a young man or old she was not aware he was simply man as saviour and he was at the gate and working at the rear of the struggling head before she had quite realized it was will and a certain added pleasure at the sight of this man in particular had scarcely time to well up before it was swamped by the far greater pleasure of seeing the sheep deftly released it staggered however as will let it go and lay sideways on the road gasping and jinny observed with horror a raw ring round its throat where the wool was cut through as by a cord but before she could get through the gate to its assistance it had risen feebly and as she came towards it it trotted off timidly vastly relieved she tried to coax or chevy the truant back to its companions but it refused to go on the contrary it retreated and in solitary selfsufficiency began to crop the wayside grass hasnt spoiled her appetite said will with a laugh they dont seem to feel things as much as us agreed jinny no indeed he knocked the ashes out of his pipe and pocketed it fancy if youd got your head nipped like that there seemed something aggressive in the suggestion i should have known to lift it up without waiting for a man she said all very well but when ones heads caught one is apt to lose it one struggles blindly were not all like sheep to go astray she said uneasily but thank you for your kind help she jumped up and drove slowly through the gate he closed it behind her and ran to open the gate at the opposite end of the private road thank you again she said passing through but surely youll come into the wood now youre so near he cried through the arch of the vanishing tilt the cart unexpectedly slackened jinnys head was turned backwards if you wont be long she said he shut the gate briskly and kept pace with her slow progress along the leafy lane towards the woodpath they both knew nip untied sprang to fawn at his feet and then bounded into the hedge after something smelt and barking raucously wormed his way along like a weasel why didnt you come will said jinny softly why didnt you he evaded why did you send uncle lilliwhyte i didnt come because you didnt she answered simply iiyour grandfather he stammered i couldnt well play before him you mean you couldnt play well she flashed thats all you know about it i can blow better than dick burrage then why be nervous of poor old granfer he might have been umpire he was shocked again good gracious jinny where did you get those betting words from thats my affair she pursed her pretty lips but never mindhowever you blowyouve deserved a pair of gloves todayin sheepskin he smiled im not above taking two pairs if you win of course ill win dont brag save your breath for your blowing we shall soon be there oh but im not going to blow now he pointed out not now then why have you lured me here but how could i guess i should meet you how could i lure you you could see i hadnt got my horn i hadnt noticed jinny murmured its big enough he said grimly then i certainly shant go into the wood im much too busy goodbye will she flicked her whip but ere methusalem could quicken a leg a terrible yelping came from the bushy hedgerowit was the voice of nip but not of nip the hunter rather of a hunted trapped nip oh poor nip and in a moment jinny had leapt down and was peering and pushing into the hedge but she could penetrate scarcely at all the wood behind was firmly guarded by a broad chaotic belt of thistle and nightshade burr and bramble furze and stingingnettle a veritable riot of prickliness and this thorny tangle had closed upon niptrespassers prosecuted indeedthough it was a relief to his mistress to find the trap was natural not wickedly human stuck full of burrs and looking like a spotted pard her pet was shrieking for first aid but even while she was hesitating to pierce farther despite her gloved hands will brushed by her thrilling her with the sense that this was his second feat of animal salvation while the woodland savours and the rich prodigality and ruin of naturefor dead wood lay around as profusely as rank vegetation sproutedseemed to stir in her the same sense of elemental forces as the thunderstorm she scarcely noticed that will had the aid of his stick in parting the jungle and when he restored the whining animal to her arms gratitude and heroworship mingled in her emotion though for a moment she was too occupied in picking nip clean to say much while will for his part was engaged with equal industry in removing thorns from his sleeves and burrs from his trousers oh youve hurt yourself she said at last catching sight of blood and scratches on his hands and wrists its nothing he tried to pluck out something from a finger shall i help you she pulled off her drivinggloves took his finger and squeezed at the flesh perceiving the microscopic protrusion of the thorn but her own fingers were shaking and she could not extract it he said it did not matter it would work out then he started sucking it she somehow would have liked as with a child to kiss the place and make it wellthe whole back of his left hand seemed reticulated in redbut instead she carried nip back to his basket in the cart he too was scored in red though he did not seem to mind any more than the sheep as she bent over her scratched pet will came up to the tailboard still sucking at his finger i shall need gloves now he said glancing with comic ruefulness at his scratches you poor hero she said with eyes softly flashing i will come into the wood and you shall win them his face lit up then fell but how he asked isnt there my horn silly he laughed gleefully youre right to call me that she leaped down the horn dangling at her girdle and fastened methusalem to a tree not that hes likely to move still his head is homewards methusalems head however was already grasswards he was munching with gusto while his great tail swished at the flies but suppose somebody steals the parcels said will with sudden compunction this isnt babylonor america said jinny witheringly besides theres nip only a few yards farther was the opening they had been making for but they now found it almost as overgrown as the entry chosen by nip and had it not been for the rare fernleaf elders in the hedge that marked their memory of the spot they might have passed it by might be in canada said will however he pioneered with his stick and following him closely she had a sense of safety and protection unknown since the days she was escorted from chapel it was quite strangeyet not unsweetto be thus guarded from the venomous vegetation thrusting at her from all sides and she was not sure she was relieved when the menace and novelty were over and they were in the wood the struggle moreover had made the humanized part of the wood on which they emerged somewhat tame the grove of young ash beautiful as the slim silvergrey trunks were with their new green liverytoo light to cast a shadowsuggested commerce to both of them and the suggestion was emphasized by the charred remains of a bonfire of elmloppings and by a deserted charcoalburners hut in a clearing but poetry had gathered on the mossy stumps of other trees long since felled and they came down a wonderful azure river of bluebells running as between wooded green banks as they waded through the tall thin stalks they chanced here on a patch of latelingering primroses and there on green advance waves of foxgloves with their long leaves primrose bluebell foxglovewhat a beautiful succession thought jinny how marvellous was earth in its changing loveliness and heaven in its unchanging bounty on another slope crowned by spanish chestnuts glittered a stream purling down to lose itself in scrub here rosemary was in bloom humming with bees and yonder was broom its yellow blossoms showing against a lighter green than the earlier gorse which flowered in great golden clumps the gorse looks fine said jinny and smells finer said will lets sit down not here said jinny coyly shrinking theres nettles theyre dead he said grasping their yellow brittleness but they walked on they came over baby bracken and crisp beechnuts to a sort of ring surrounded by blushing young oaks and little silver birches with their flat green leaves and tall aspentrees and one lonely mountainash with white flowers overhead early as it was the moon had long been hanging at threequarters white and magically diaphanous a dreamplanet unseen woodpigeons purred and a tomtit was singing here said will beginning to sit down no no she clutched his arm to keep him up an antheap this time her shyness had found sounder cover he gave a comical oh and stood watching the squirm of seething life absolutely black at the central congestion where ants walked indifferently under or over one another they were like the moving grains in an hourglass jinny thought will poked his stick into the great piazza dont said jinny im not hurting them the ants were in fact already using the rod as a causeway why theyre like you jinny like me all carriers and all busy she laughed and followed their movements with a new sympathy though she was rather disgusted by those that carried dead flies or dead ants those are not carriersthose are undertakers she insisted they sat down at last on a mound of spongy moss free from formic activity and there was a silence the little purling stream was too far off to break it but they heard a chaffinch and the peepboplaying cuckoo with that golden human note that floats through the warm brooding may and then the irrepressible and unbasketable nip came rushing and tearing not making straight for them but appearing and disappearing like a giant fungus in the rich masses of blues or greens or yellows he made an opening for conversation and presently when he came snuggling into jinnys armspoor scotched creaturean opportunity for joint patting and petting a process in which hands do not always succeed in partitioning out the pattable and pettable surface rigidly but graze and brush each other and even lie passively in abstracted contact why shouldnt i buy this wood said will after one of these sustained manual juxtapositions wouldnt that be lovely said jinny yesi must settle something soon those aspens though id cut em down theyre only a weed and yonder ashlings werent planted quite close enoughyouve got to make em fight for air if you want em straight enough to sell jinny was vaguely disappointed at the turn of this conversation not following the romantic dream vaguely underlying it but could you afford to buy such a big wood she murmured big wood why in canada you get forever of land for nothing then why didnt you stay there she asked this is better than america and his hand touched jinnys too consciously why what was the matter with america she murmured withdrawing the hand from nips flank with a little blush everything was the matter with america it appeared he was indeed more anxious to explain how nothing was the matter with essex but under jinnys physical bashfulness and intellectual curiosity he found himself headed off his native county and kept closely to transatlantic territory and under the spell of her eager attention he was soon discoursing fluently enough sketching a discreetly selected picture of his adventures beginning with the emigrant sailing packet in which he had gone out as a stowaway but wherein he fared little worse than the emigrants proper who in the first six of the thirtyseven days voyage had had none of the stipulated provisions served out to them despite their contract tickets and no meat during the whole voyage they had had to be satisfied with their daily water and the right of cooking and complaints were met with oaths from the officers and doctors and sometimes even with fists or ropeends from the sailors once or twice the hose had been turned on them but there were over nine hundred of them he said so she might imagine the babel and confusion though there were two great passenger decks on which the tallest man could stand and on whose shelved sides they could all find sleepingspace with never more than six to a berth and then from the moment america had burst upon the vessel in the guise of touts runners and employers all anxious to mislead or enslave he had borne through the continent the banner of a steady disapprobation in the states where his first clutches at fortune had been made peculiar perils awaited the british immigrant if he gravitated as was natural to the cliques and boardinghouses of his countrymen he was likely to be soon used up by the gambling and drinking sets that feigned to make him welcome and if he escaped this pitfall by his resourcefulness he would strike the native american prejudice against english immigrants popularly supposed to consist of the paupers and wastrels whom the parish overseers of old england anxious to be quit of the burden of supporting them bribed with free atlantic passages and dumped on the struggling new world a prejudice will admitted laughingly which his own purse had done nothing to diminish at first he had got a job as cardriver and fed at the markethouses but though the food was good and cheap the company was rough of manner and language and even when he was earning good moneyat a bootstore with the sign of a gigantic boot made of real leather reaching to the firstfloor windowshe had disliked the goalongsteamboat pressure of existence and the mechanics boarding house where gabbling yankees gobbled at a pace both unhealthy in itself and unchivalrous to the unpunctual the habit of loading the table with all the courses simultaneously took off the edge of his appetite if he was early and left only universal ruins if he was late he had no patience with clams that were not oysters eggplants that were not eggs and corn that had to be munched cowlike accustomed to the clean linen of the paternal farm he loathed the insectridden bedrooms one divided with a varying number of strangers he liked to see pigs but not perambulating and scavenging the streets why in new york they were more numerous than the dogs providence had designed tobacco he opined for smoking and not for chewing and saliva for swallowing not for spitting it was in fact a most unpleasant america that loomed up to jinnys vision that day especially in contrast with this lovely wood overbrooded by the white moon now growing faintly golden a sort of spittoon of a continent mitigated by dollars and dancing even in canada for which will had felt a more personal responsibilityaccentuated by the british soldiers to be met at every turnand in which he gladly picked out points of superiority to the states a similar sense of massive untidiness had weighed upon him and jarred every homeborn instinct he tried to convey to jinny the desolation of zigzag railfences that took the place of these hedges now glorious with hawthorn and foolsparsley and the starry stitchwort the raw settlements the halfbuilt log huts hardly superior to yon derelict charcoalburners hut their windows stuffed sometimes with old straw hats the unachieved roads full of mud or dust the ubiquitous stumps that were once trees the piles of logs that were not yet habitations all that crude civilization arising shoddily out of the virgin forest on the sole principle of the cheapest practicable with nothing wholehearted but the lust for dollars caleb flynts slow english conservatism calebs unworldly standards spoke again through his son but even will was too inarticulate to put his feeling precisely into wordsand when jinny reminded him that in this very wood trees had been cut down and burned and that he himself had spoken of cutting down the aspens he could not quite make clear to her who had never known any but longhumanized places the peculiar indecency of a forest at the stage of semitransformation into a mushroom settlement beautiful enough the backwoods he laboured to explain where mans fight with the forest was only begun where great beeches and maples and wild flowers still possessed the black mould the settler was to lay bare for wheat where his pioneer hut was circled by a green gloom and the chink of his cowbells or the laughter of his children alone vied with the ring of the axe and the thunderous fall of the giants but later onits like that plovers egg you opened once he burst forth with a sudden inspiration no longer an egg not yet a bird only a smell but it was you who gave it me laughed jinny there was a great content at her heart sitting here and seeing her little world open out in forests and seas and emotions still stranger and hehe for the first time enjoyed the society of woman as spiritual counterpart had moments in which he forgot jinny was pretty in which her handnow unconsciously nestling in his in her absorption in his narrationwas felt as a friendly rather than as a physical glow unfortunately in this sense of a sympathetic jinny lay the serpentine temptation which shattered their paradise for beguiled by her apparent subjugation he went on to improve the occasion and its just the same with women who are neither women nor men a womans place is the home the slipping of jinnys hand out of his was the first sign that he had roused her to reality her cry how late it is was the next and she looked at the sunset glowing in glamorous gold through the trees there was a magic peace in the air and a rare thrush sang as in a dream it seemed a tragedy to move will protested vehemently its not late at all you were unusually early this afternoon no dont goyoull wake up poor nip did your story send him to sleep rude dog but i must goa womans place is the home she got up smiling with the snoring dog in her arms but her mockery was friendly enough the intimate atmosphere could not be dissipated at a jerk he was constrained to follow her if only to precede her through that jungly path the prospect of driving home with her still shone rosy by the way he said lightly ive been talking with mr flippance about getting that horse for him what she stopped and turned on him her eyes blazing his last animal was faked he explained mildly he was badly taken in and you cant know all the tricks of the trade as well as a man and isnt mr flippance a man yes of course butbut it all depends on which man you seeand which woman but im sure no woman knows properly about horses he said how would you tell the age for instance by the teeth of course which teeth jinny flushed she really did not know and that made her only angrier if i wanted your help in my affairs i should have asked you well theres nothing to be mad about there is everything to be mad about how did you know he wanted me to get a horse only because i told you and then you go to him and interfere with my business and insinuate im incapable its not so much youre incapable he began its because a womans place isnt the cattlemarket i know but why cant we buy cows as well as butter and horses as well as horsecollars because only men goand its rough well then let women go and it wont be and do you want women to be horsemen too get up at four oclock and go ploughing why not they havent the strength for one thing theres lots of things they cant do and never will take thatching for instanceyou cant imagine a woman sprawling along a roof yes i can of course you can he sneered you can imagine her in breeches if petticoats get in the way therell never be bloomerites in england he said grimly you mark my word if a woman cant plough or dig without leggings thats a proof she wasnt meant to plough or dig they had reached now the pleached and tangly path back to the road but she darted ahead of him battling with the branches herself in her revolt from dependence he could not regain the lead unless he jostled rudely and every now and thennot with wilful malice but no less maddeninglyshe held back for him the boughs she had parted and all the while the sleeping nip was protected too clasped by one hand to her bosom suddenly the circle of her little horn got caught in the bushes like the horn of isaacs ram why jinny he cried we forgot all about the horn wait wait she disentangled it calmly you shant blow mine you must blow your own now he fired up you want to get out of the gloves now youre going hornmad she jested icily emerging on the high road goodbye mr flynt it was the first time she had withheld the will goodbye miss boldero he said as frigidly removing his hat with an exaggerated gallantry each felt that the parting was final never would they even speak to each other again but they had yet to reckon with nip for that intelligent creature waking into the distressing atmosphere that had been generated while his vigilance was relaxed would be no party to the breach when he perceived that the cart was to go off without will he jumped down and tried to chevy him into it and as the parties went off at a tangent he ran desperately from one to the other striving to shepherd them together barking and pleading and panting like a toy engine it was only a peremptory blast from a distant horn that at last persuaded the distracted animal where his first duty lay the dying day still flooded the earth with warmth and radiance the little coffeeandcreamcoloured calves still frisked in the meadows that the buttercups turned into fields of the cloth of gold the forgetmenots were still gleaming in the cottage gardens the lilac was still peeping over manorial walls the laburnum still hanging down its yellow chandeliers and the horsechestnut upholding its white candelabras but for these twain obstinately and against the best canine advice going their separate ways the colour had been sucked out of the landscape and the clemency from the air before will wandering deviously had remembered his evening sausages these also had grown cold mist and clouds had turned the moon to a bloodred boat and the bats were swooping and the woodowls shrilling where larks had soared and sung chapter viii cupid and cattle wit she hath without desire to make known how much she hath and her anger flames no higher than may fitly sweeten wrath full of pity as may be though perhaps not so to me browne britannias pastorals i it is to be feared that the sting of mr will flynts offence lay precisely in jinnys ignorance of horses and that if her old companion had come to her aid more tactfully she would have welcomed his cooperation in the great purchase but her pride in her work would hardly allow her to admit even to herself that here was a commission perhaps beyond her capacities had she not enjoyed an almost lifelong experience of methusalem as a monogamist would resent being told he knew nothing of matrimony so jinny repudiated the notion that she knew nothing of equinity besides the cattlemarket was far from seeming so strange a world to her as will had imagined had her cart not often conveyed thence or thither a netted calf had she not marketed even his own mothers piglings a fig for the masculine aura if mr flippance exaggerated after his fashion in declaring she would have undertaken to get him the moonat any rate it was not the man in it that would have kept her back it was therefore with a bruised and burning but indomitable heart that jinny went about her work these ever longer days for women must work though men may mope poor will who had nothing to do but to chew his bitter cud of memory was the more pitiable and his temper was not improved when early friday evening the comparatively clean master gale evidently caught on his way home from school arrived with the same as uzual this applecheeked and whitecollared understudy for jinny was no less an eyesore than uncle lilliwhyte and will made martha refuse the parcel on the ground that if they encouraged the lad it would lead to truancy such was his solicitude for the schoolboy whose copybook he had diverted from its scholastic function but he was not less furious when farmer gale brought back the parcel the next morning on horseback and explained amiably that he had seen jinny about it and that henceforward this overburdened damsel would leave the flynt parcel with his and he would have pleasure in delivering it in the course of riding about his farms the rain and the cold snap that had come so suddenly after the quarrel in the wood was welcome to jinny in her present mood for her the summer was over true she espied its first wild rose but it reminded her only of a round strawberry waterice such as her welltodo clients spooned at the chipstone confectioners everything was gelid except nips nose and that but added to her depression was the darling feverish from the scratches of his spiny crawlings or did he share his mistresss heavy humours her distraction might have led to a nasty accident had not the last of the trio kept his head for in a lonely lane methusalem who in these days seemed to whinny his sympathy and nuzzle into her palm with enhanced tenderness deftly avoided the prostrate antlered trunk of an oaktree which had been split and splintered by lightning possibly it had lain there since that sundays storm for her work had not brought her that way the bark of the whole tree had been peeled off save for a small patch where a few buds still suggested vitality and jinny had a grandiose sense that all nature sympathized with the strange desolation that had come over her joyous self her mind turned to fate and constellations as she drew up at miss gentrys door and summoned with a blast that fantastic female who was feeding the chickens with which she variegated life and tantalized squibs miss gentry did not need anything beyond her usual depilatory it was a standing grief and astonishment to her that though white lilies under the domain of the moon will trimly deck a blank place with hair neither culpeper nor the planets had provided against the contrary contingency even figwort owned by venus merely removing wens and freckles hence she was reduced to a mere chemists prescription a solution of barium sulphide swayed by no known planet the stuff came in a pot miss gentry in ordering it did not shirk the word depilatory on the contrary she pronounced the five syllables with a pomposity which was the more impressive to jinny because even the universal spellingbook stopped short at four syllables not for worldswhether to her client or the public at largewould jinny have betrayed her knowledge that the hairdestroyer represented a neverending battle with miss gentrys moustache and for the sensitive dressmaker herself the polysyllable was a soothing cover ostrichlike she hid her head in its spacious sandiness there was however the little matter of marthas bleached and newtrimmed bonnet which jinny might convey to frog farm and the casual mention that it was will who had brought it led to considerable conversation jinnys equipage was drawn up outside the little garden where tulips red damask and pink stood like tall guards before a tropical palace and miss gentry despite the chill wind leaned on her gardengate carefully nursing her black cat against nips possible swoops the excellent lady whose erudition jinny had always absorbed with the reverence due to a reader of the englishwomans magazine was always delighted to have the girl sitting at her feeteven though to the crude physical vision jinny always appeared to be sitting above her head and miss gentry to be looking up to her sometimes real information from the aforesaid magazine which bore the subtitle of the christian mothers miscellany was thus transmitted to jinny but miss gentrys brain was obviously too cluttered up with archaic notions to be really beneficial to her young devotee thus although miss gentry enlarged jinnys mind it was more a matter of range than of accuracy the conversation today however was on a more personal plane jinny was resolved to speak no further word to mr william flynt his interference was unforgivable but when it transpired that he had brought the bonnet she did not attempt to check miss gentrys flow of favourable comment still less to contradict it for a peculiar he was quite the gentleman miss gentry opined especially after that coarse and flippant bundock not tall enough for her taste because she thought you ought always to look up to a man still handsome in a rough way despite his ginger hair not ginger jinny protested it shades to ginger the dressmaker replied severely as an authority upon colours but it served to brighten up his face which was none too cheerful born under saturn i should think and the sign of the scorpion and what effect has that asked jinny alarmed well for one thing it qualifies the unruly actions and passions of venus the goddess of beauty observed jinny airing her spellingbook of love corrected miss gentry jinnys face shaded towards the colour under discussion and she cried down nip to that recumbent animals amusement he nearly jumped on the bonnetbox she explained he should eat herbs under the dominion of the sun said miss gentry nip nomr flynt he needs vital spirits still ginger is hardly the word murmured jinny it looks ginger against his clothes persisted miss gentry of course a man cant understand dressing himself why hes better dressed than anybody in long bradmarshexcept mr fallow said jinny miss gentry was mollified by the compliment to her pastor all the same his coat wrinkles at the shoulders she said you notice next time ive got better things to do than to look at mr flynts coatsleeves said jinny and ill be going on well if you do see him give him my kind regards said miss gentry and say that any time hes passing and would like a cup of tea id be glad to discuss the tract i gave him oh its no use trying to convert him said jinny hes nothing at all then why did he go to your chapel the other sunday did he go said jinny amazed i dare say thats what has depressed him he not only went but with your peculiar ideas of the house of god he had his dinner there oh no why he was dining at the black sheep nothing of the sort a dressmaker has ears but a carrier has eyes and i saw him there then ill never believe isabella mawhood again i hope you havent been making her more vanities said jinny as she slowly turned methusalems nose the other way only a new bonnet you funny little peculiar you see the case was coming on at the chelmsford sessions and i should have got a verdict against mr mawhood not only for his wifes silk dress but for the chickens his ferrets killed you issued a replevin i suppose put in jinny grandly i could have had a tort or a subpna or anything assented miss gentry with equal magnificence but the defendant thought best to compromise hes got to clear this cottage of rats for nothing this winteryou know how they come gnawing my best stuffsand in return my landlady has to pay for a new bonnet for his wife but mrs mawhoods silk dresswho pays for that asked jinny mystified oh mrs mott pays for that but why mrs mott she didnt want to have a scandal in the community and your socalled deacon swore he hadnt got the money they make mrs mott pay for everything nowadays its too bad said jinny and mrs mawhood comes out of it all with her dress paid for and a new bonnet well she does become clothes more than her sisterpeculiars i must say thatpresent company excepted that old ratcatchers lucky to have got such a young wife for his second even though he was her third shes not so young said jinny shes no older than i am persisted miss gentry and born like me under venus jinny suppressed a smile despite her respect for miss gentry she had never accepted her standing invitation to explore the colchester romance unread in the literature of love though she was the girls natural instinct refused to see the middleaged moustachiod dressmaker as the heroine of a lovedrama her affair with the angel seemed indeed to place her apart i think its disgraceful to have had three husbands she insisted not at all when each is a christian marriage and the first two spouses have been duly taken by an overruling providence of course the unhallowed romance one inspires is another thing as i always say to bundockoh we ought not to have mentioned names ought we squibs dear please forget it she stroked the cat in her arms but there jinny you cant understand these thingsyou too were born under saturn how do you know that jinny was vaguely resentful youre so coldbloodedperhaps it was even under the constellation of the piscesthe fishes that is youve never taken the faintest interest in love do you know i made a rhyme about you the other day a rhyme jinny was excited do tell me miss gentry shook her head you wouldnt like it oh but i must hear it miss gentry continued obstinately to stroke squibs but finally as if electrified by the fur she broke out like an inspired pythoness in a weird chanting voice when the brad in opposite ways shall course lo jinnys husband shall come on a horse and jinny shall then learn passions force jinny was so overwhelmed with admiration at the poetryquite on a par she felt with the pieces of the universal spellingbook especially as the rhyme or jingle in the ear was on the very pattern of the model verse there given prostrate my contrite heart i bend my god my father and my friend do not forsake me in the end that she could hardly take in the sense at the moment how lovely she said im glad youre satisfied it means of coursemiss gentry firmly explained the oraclethat youll never marry being as incapable of passion as the brad of flowing backwards and forwards at the same time a strange protest as written in letters of fire crept through all jinnys veins even her face flamed she began clucking to methusalem to start and ive made one about mrs mawhood too pursued the pythoness now irrepressible i dont wish her ill but im afraid itll prove true poor thing and without waiting to be discouraged indeed following the already moving cart she chanted she may look to south she may look to north but the finger of fate hath forbidden a fourth and the ratslayer clinging to life and his gold shall dance on the grave where she lieth cold not dance laughed jinny relieved at this diversion well preachits just as bad when a mans not ordained said miss gentry and this being the signal for a theological assault jinny drove off rapidly ii but she had no intention of bearing the bonnet to frog farm nor despite the account that farmer gale had given of the new parcel arrangement had she really agreed to establish him as subcarrierinordinary he was too moneyed and important for that and she found it hard enough to accept the favour of being driven to and from chapel in his dogcarta favour necessitated by her grandfathers and even her own ideas as to the indecorum of their business cart besides she had almost resolved to seek his advice perhaps his help in the famous horsepurchase anything rather than break down before will so she must not overdo it no master peartree for all his novel churlishness must convey the bonnet he could scarcely be treated like farmer gales boy and if they did refuse it at his hands still it would only abide next door the shepherdcowman was not however to be found in his accustomed haunts and she lost a good hour in hunting for him in the various mutually distant pastures to which he led his everedacious sheep none of the men ploughing the great red fields for turnips had seen him pass at last by the aid of a taciturn lout who was driving a tumbril laden with hurdles and backed with a tall crate master peartree was located in the farm buildings at the other extremity of farmer gales estate in a barnlike structure facing a long row of cartsheds skirting a sunless pond that was scurvy and illsmelling she drew up at the gate and blew a summons on her horn but its only effect was to startle the chickens pecking in the litter and the piglings fighting to snatch their mothers garbage from her tub or to nuzzle at her teats there was nothing for it but to carry the bonnetbox to the barn for the great farmyard was too mucky to drag her cart through picking her way among the strawy compost heaps she divined why her horn had brought no answer it had been deadened by a melody proceeding in a lusty tenor voice from the tall foldingdoors and thissomewhat to her surprisewas none other than the air of buy a broom it forced her to polka to it the rest of the way and although she must fain trip gingerly mid the manureheaps and the melody had ended with applause before she reached the thatched structure still it was with a brighter feeling that she found herself at the open doors but the first glimpse within made her turn pale and draw back a little the scene she had so unexpectedly stumbled upon was the stranger and grimmer for the silence that had now fallen though the faces of the shearers astride the struggling sheep were still lively enough master peartree had his boot over the head of a recalcitrant lamb which but for her recent adventure she would have imagined choking but it was not the ungentle shepherd that made for her the centre of the picture for among these men in dirty green corduroys and rolledup check shirtsleeves whose legs gripped grunting wheezing struggling or feebly kicking sheep was one in cleaner clothes whose bare brawny arms gave her a sharp sensation almost as if he had nipped her with the shears he held in his palm was it boredom or the need for his labour that had enlisted mr william flynt in this service she did not know but pale and dumb she retreated from the unconscious will whose sheep wedged between his legs hung limp with meek helpless eye the very image of a sacrificial victim and was being sheared with the meticulous concentration of the outsider bent on showing he is not inferior to the professional and indeed wills was the sole sheep she saw at once and with admiration that though nearly bare of its wool showed without bloodfleck a consummation to which its prudent lethargy had doubtless contributed young ravens on the other hand who was now lying with both feet on his animal had nicked it on ear leg and breast apparently one could not serve two masterssong and scissors perceiving jinny with her bonnetbox this young humorist now sang out the old streetcry buy a bandbox the chaff stayed her retreat and stiffened her trembling form hullo she retorted with less than her usual wit back again like a bad penny even as she spoke she saw will and his sheep give a spasmodic start and the first speck of blood appear on the flawless skin but the shearer did not look up although he automatically stretched out his hand for the ointment do ye dont struggle observed master peartree amiably to his youthful ewe oim not so strong as nobody said anything further and master peartree intent on his lamb did not look up jinny too stood silent for a moment with her incongruous bonnetbox recovering her sangfroid and watching a catcher trying to drive in an unshorn lamb from the pen in which it had cowered and which it now ran round bleating terrorstricken and unseizable she wondered if its heart were thumping more wildly than hers not that there was terror in her own breastrather a strange exultation that her presence had had power to incarnadine the immaculate sheepskin but her eyes roamed shyly from will and his nipped victim and studied with elaborate attention the divers coloured showcards of the successful ram lambs that made their vaunt upon the beams or along the sloping walls through which the thatching stuck pleasantly her mind went back to that sunny bracing day in february to the immense pastoral landscape of strawroofed sheeppens ooze mangold heaps and haystacks on which she had chanced when the lambs now so agitated were newyeaned some only an hour or two old with long skeleton legs and bodies smeared as with yellow gold how friskily they had soon learnt to leap on their mothers back that day she too had been as untroubled needing no outside melody to brisk up her pace young ravens inspired by his new audience to a fresh burst of melody started on the mistletoe bough the old ballad she had heard sung in the cottages at christmas singsongs and which she now for the first time connected with the play on mr flippances posters hullo jinny said master peartree at last her presence slowly percolating he finished his rebellious lamb and patted it forgivingly on the back remarking genially get up and lets have a squint at you and as it trotted out happily he threw its fleecetoo small to wind upon to a great heap in the corner and fell to work on a sheep youve just doneem when its turned cold protested jinny ay tis a pity said master peartree but first we couldnt get the labour and then that rined and their wool was too damp but oi need em now for the early market i know im buying a horse there said jinny another tinge of red appeared on the blameless skin of wills victim methusalem aint damaged hisself asked master peartree in concern oh no hes outside your gate damaging your hedge then whatever do you need another for oh just to ride over somebody but i wish id known you needed labour why want a job grinned jim puddifoot a giant in a brimless hat who was sharpening his shears on a piece of steel there was a snigger from his mates whats the pay said jinny who had been thinking of uncle lilliwhyte lately gravelled for lack of purchasers of his woodland pickings theres half a suvrin a hundred said master peartree as seriously and four quarts o beer a great shout of laughter rose from the hired men only will went on shearing with apparent imperturbability while a third carmine speck defaced the smooth surface of his martyred sheep wheres the laugh inquired master peartree dont rob a poor man of his beer carolled young ravens she dont drink he broke off to explain yes i do i drink like a fish water that is like that does this time even master peartree laughed while jim puddifoot raising his tin mug without a handle to his mouth cried heres to you and young ravens lifting up his pleasant voice trolled forth robin he married a wife in the west moppety moppety mono little stabs and pricks were going through wills breast and still more through the skin of his sheep as the chorus from which jinnys little trill was not excluded took up with a high jig jiggity tops and petticoats robinathrush cries mono it seemed to will as if jinny was carrying on like a flash lady in a boon company a high jig jiggity indeed releasing his victim at last he picked up its fleece sullenly and teased a tail out of it wherewith rolling up the rest he proceeded to tie the bundle in a silence that the singing rendered still grimmer whats that youve got there jinny asked master peartree becoming suddenly aware of the bonnetbox thats for you she said me oi aint got no womankind thank the lord again master peartree had touched unintentionally the springs of laughter will pinned the frightened ewelamb now caught and as dumb as himself between his legs and plucked a few preliminary bits from its breast with his fingers but its mrs flynts bonnet explained jinny and will you oblige me by taking it back tonight the snick of young flynts shears sounded savage that oi wont said master peartree seein as here stands her boy willie hisself oh does he said jinny i hadnt noticed ay that he do and even dednt he arxed me not to do your job agen time oi took in that liddle ole horn the new ovine martyr bounded quite a patch of its skin had been replaced by blood steady willie steady cried master peartree oi was afeared musicianers aint no good for shearing its this silly jumping beast growled will breaking his obstinate silence jinny was still tendering the bonnetbox to master peartree well give it to him then cant he take it straight asked the shepherd clipping busily that silly jumping beast is too much for him as it is he darent let go ill leave the bonnetbox for him aint no place heretis too mucky buy a broom hummed jinny and young ravens smiling seized a besom and swept vigorously at the stale and droppings oh i cant leave it herethe sheep might stave it in she said leave it in the store acrost the yardthe keys in the padlock said the shepherd oi count williell take it home same as he aint cut hisself to pieces another roar from the othersthis time master peartree beamed and it might have gone ill with wills lamb had the shears not slipped from his palm well but when folks go woolgathering remarked jinny blandly they forget things ill put it in the store but i wont be responsible tell her i wont forget it roared will who was picking up his shears in the gymnastic attitude necessitated by the palpitating sheep between his legs oi reckon she can yer for herself said the shepherd navely of course i can hear said jinny but tell him to tell his mother that the bills inside oi reckon he can yer too said the puzzled peartree he doesnt listen much to women explained jinny you ask him if his family wants anything else from chipstone well there he standsyou can arx him cant you well dont i stand here too said jinny and why doesnt he answer hes too shy sniggered ravens and burst out again with a high jig jiggity tops and petticoats shut up snarled will twas you asked me to sing retorted ravens thats so willie said the shepherd you should say you loved to yer buy a broom and all them old songs why dont you answer willie because theres nothing to say will roared we dont want nothing whatever from her he was not often so ungrammatical but anger knows no pedantry well why couldnt he say so at once said jinny and whistling a dashing young man from buckinghamwhistling was a new brazenness in wills earsshe picked her way across the miry yard to the weatherboarded tarred and tileroofed structure that stood on six mushroomtopped pillars whose smoothness offered no purchase for rats ascending the steep steps she deposited the bonnetbox betwixt the chickencorn and the eggs while padlocking the door again she saw to her surprise that methusalem was inside the gate labouring towards her through the mud the faithful animal impatient for her had evidently lifted the latch with its nose aided perhaps by its teeth the tears came into her eyes some one at least did want her and there was a long affectionate contact between that clever velvety nose and jinnys palm then she returned to the shearingbarn and handed master peartree the key good day and thank you she said i reckon i shall meet you at the cattle fair she did not wait to see if she had drawn blood from the sacrificial lamb but rounding her lips again whistled her way jauntily back to her cart as she drove along the sun struggling through a high cloudrack showed like a great worn silver coin and the shorn sheep gleamed fairily white on the great green pastures but there was an ache at her heart which the delicious wafts from the earlymown hayfields only made emptier iii the shabby little cart with the legend of daniel quarles and the smart dogcart of farmer gale rolled side by side of a monday morning in the restored june sunshine towards the chipstone cattlemarket jinny had timed this coincidence and meant to extract the farmers opinion of the horses for sale she had already gleaned from her grandfather what particular teeth were chronological but such confidence as she possessed in her own horsesense had been rudely dissipated by a volume on the noble animal which she had unearthed in mother ganders sanctum the lists of diseases and defects from which it might suffer was paralysing and even when it was a thing she had heard oflike grogginessit grew more sinister by being called navicular disease methusalems maladies had been simple enough and she had dared to drench or anoint him with divers remedies but now that knowledge had dissipated the bliss of ignorancenow that warts had enlarged into angleberries rheumatism had darkened into felon and farcy quittor ascaris megalocephala and countless other evils were seen hovering around methusalem thick as summer gnats she marvelled how he had staved them off that poor methusalem an affectionate animal by nature was the horsethe book told herhe wanted to please man only sometimes he was in agony and the flesh could not obey good heavens what if sometimes when she was in a hurry to get home she had wronged methusalem even in her thoughts remorsefully and with a new and morbid anxiety she caressed his delicate nose amazed at her ancient easy assurance of his immortality it even shook her faith in the allsufficiency of the spellingbook that it contained no intimation of the ills that horseflesh is heir to and the animal she had now to buy for mr flippance might be affected with all or any of these ills and even if one could detect such obvious defects as windgalls spavin thoroughpin or broken wind how avoid a cribbiter or a windsucker how grapple with the botfly two hundred of which could hook themselves horribly to a single equine stomach or with the still more formidable palisade worm which even its name of strongylus armatus could scarcely worsen a thousand of it having been counted by a patient authority on a surface of two inches and its census taken at a million for a single horse farmer gale however failed to throw much light on these alarming questions which he did not know indeed were being asked his conversation kept gliding away to his grievances for it consisted like that of most farmers of grumbles usually these started from the little stringtied sample bags of threshed grain he carried in his pocket to be blown and tasted by hardbargaining customers but today though he was not bound for the cornmarket he was nevertheless not to be baulked of his grievances they were not this time against nature but against man for as the fields they passed showed the corn was particularly forward it was not providence that had run down wheat to thirty shillings a quarter free trade was in reality the ruin of free britain for the labour of continental slaves who went with the soil and were sold with it like cattle who subsisted on black bread skimmilk and onions was brought into competition with that of the freeborn briton who must thus be dragged down to the same level the bluff freeborn briton was farmer gales favourite rle and his ruddy face grey bowler and smart gaiters made him sympathetic enough superficially while the potent landowners consideration for jinnys religious necessities had not failed to evoke a flattered gratitude in her humble breast when they drove together of a sunday to their respective chapels this amiable image of himself the breezy briton was now destined to shatter for after some critical comment on the ploughing of the fields they passed and the activities of the poachershe would certainly have to get rid of that suspicious character uncle lilliwhyte who occupied a cottage badly needed for a farmhandhe pointed out the impossibility of building another cottage as jinny had so crudely suggested prices were simply ruinous i tell my labourers as man to man he said emphatically that they cant have regular employment and their present wages take your choice boys says i look at other countries do they get more than their six or seven shillings a week no then thats what youll have to come down to but how can they live on it asked jinny how can farmers live he retorted we must go by the price of corn but did you go by the price of corn after the battle of waterloo asked jinny shrewdly for i remember granfer once telling me you goti mean your father gota hundred shillings a quarter then yet folks were so starved they went burning the ricks i was only a baby then i cant say what happened but the same thing happened nearer our time she reminded him thinking of the bidlake tragedy oh that silly rioting and machinesmashing that always came out of the poor not understanding politics if things were bad after waterloo it was all bonys work and as for the unrest twenty years ago we caught that from france too i remember dad telling me they had risen against their kingsuch an unsettled people but today its our own british government thats the enemy and the money we farmers have lost this year is something dreadful but you dont look as starved as some of our labourers families ive seen the pennymole children crying for dry bread and the father saying i darsnt cut you no moredo yell have none saturday and mr pennymoles always worked for you you dont understand politics jinny i understand poverty the pennymoles are better off now theyve got two boys grown up and earning sixpence a day but ive seen mrs pennymole making tea with charred bread and her husband compelled to steal the cabbages left for the cows oh i oughtnt to have said that she added in alarm you certainly oughtnt compelled to break the eighth commandmenta pretty doctrine and such liars too i saw quite a little girl munching a turnip shed just filched from my field and when i complained to her mother the woman unblushingly said tis me fats her up with swedes and turnips they cant see their children hunger they can put some of them in the poorhouse look at the mites there white and halfstarved sometimes ive got to deliver a parcel to mr jims the porter and i hear the master thrashing em with a stick and its what boys needeven my brat carrying parcels indeed he stopped abruptly well but they make the old folks of eighty and ninety scour the stone steps and do the washing they neednt go inthey can get relief from the parish the parish eighteenpence a week for the family when the fathers bedridden theres the parish loaves have you ever seen one halfbaked without real crust all raw and soft where it stuck to the next loaf beggars cant be choosers besides theres plenty of work after harvest yes even for babies of six said jinny bitterly and to keep boys from their beds after hard fieldwork and at white notley where they make the silk theres little girls standing on stools to reach the weavingdesk if you understood politics farmer gale persisted youd understand that prices make themselves and that what we get with one hand we have to give away with the other have you ever heard of the income tax now no admitted jinny ha youd change your tune if you had to pay a shilling on every pound you earned but thats merely the last straw that breaks the camels back for it isnt only as a farmer im put upon but think of the malt tax its simply a scandal is it i should have thought twas six shillings a week would be the scandal her eyes and cheeks blazed prettily and she was beginning to shelve the idea of consulting her companion at the horsemarket i dont say youre altogether wrong conceded farmer gale admiring despite himself her fire and sparkle but its the government thats responsible there was a great old meeting tother day at drury lane theatre in london two thousand people if a man the duke of richmond he up and said by heaven weve got to have protection and we will have it oh it was a grand speech i went up for it express and weve had a meeting of farmers down here too and were going to wake up the country we essex chaps are you said jinny secretly amused at this furriners complacent identification of himself with her county you wait were going to come out with a proclamation but thats a royal thing said jinny not always besides we shall end with god save the queen yes thats it down with the malt tax and god save the queen and the beginning to our worthy labourers greeting ill draw that up soon as i get home i should offer em ten shillings a week said jinny youre joking im dead earnest a family cant live under ten shillings a week then they wouldnt want to shoot your rabbits and steal your turnips and cabbages prices make themselves i tell you folks cant have more than theyre worth why my dad paid as much as thirteen shillings a week to our old looker flynt when he had his strength yes though nobody ever suspected he got more than twelve but besides his duties as bailiff he had to see after feeding the stock night and morning including sundays that was why my father paid him the extra shilling and you cant say i havent treated him generously over the farmhouse i wonder he could bring up such a large family so genteelly mused jinny at a tangent the more the easier a brat of four can scare the crows the only pity is that his boys wouldnt stay on the land what was there to stay for i think there ought to be a law that nobody gets under ten shillings persisted jinny what a blessing we havent got women over us said the farmer smiling at a heresy too unreasonable for argument men governments are bad enough but women would drive us to the workhouse and what about the queen asked jinny well what about the queen he repeated vaguely isnt the queen a woman the queen a woman he was dazed but she doesnt really governnot nowadays its lord john well then what about queen elizabeth ah that was some time back he said evasively yes she put on the crown in november quoted jinny from that spellingbook i didnt know you were so well up in history he said admiringly i reckon youre ready at ciphering too how could i do my work without it ah thats true and a good hand at a pen i suppose i can scratch what i want ah he fell silent you dont play the piano he asked after a pause no said jinny only the horn and she blew gaily upon it whereupon to her surprise and satisfactionfor she had forgotten him and it was necessary to tie him up against the sheepnip appeared tearing from the rear farmer gale watched musingly the operation of confining him to his basket by one of those pieces of hoopborne rope that had excited the speculation of mr elijah skindle i suppose you could play a polka on it he remarked jinny obliged with a few bars of the buy a broom if you had a piano he observed with growing admiration i expect youd soon learn to play it on that jinny shook her head i shall never have the time theres the goats and the garden and granfer and methusalem nearly all gs laughed farmer gale exhilarated by his own erudition and isnt methusalem a gee flashed jinny and exhilarated him further by her prodigious wit they were both smiling broadly as just outside the market they came upon will leaning against a limetree a pipe between his teeth and a darkness palpable on his forehead despite its ginger aureola jinnys smile died and her heart thumped instantaneously she decided that as the farmer had seen them together at the black sheep to ignore will absolutely would be to betray their quarrel to the world fine morning she cried as the vehicles passed will sullenly touched his hat he was amazed that the cornish potentate should countenance her presence so incongruous amid this orgie of untempered masculinity this medley of unpetticoated humanity of every rank and class of which drovers twirling branches or leaning on sticks formed the ground pattern small farmers rubbing shoulders with smartgaitered gentry in frilled shirts blueaproned butchers with scissors at breast jostling peasants in grimy smockfrocks and squash hats or ruddy whiskered old squires and great grazier farmers in blue giltbuttoned coats white flap buff waistcoats and white pot or broadbrimmed hats still more elegant town types in glossy straightbrimmed cylinders and doublebreasted green frockcoats galling the kibes of bucolic venerablebearded ancients in fusty sleeved waistcoats and greasy highhats who blew their noses with black fingers it was a fantasia of pipes and caps of immaculate collars and dirty scarves of broadcloth cutaways and filthy cardigan jackets of topbooted buckskins and corduroy trousers tied with string below the knee as jinny and farmer gale alighted and mingled with this grotesque mob swirling around the pens in the sunshine wills heart was hot with resentment against the girl who while rejecting the counsel and cooperation of her old friend in the great horsedeal had brazenly accepted the guidance of a bumptious furriner how shamelessly she walked amid that babel of moos baas grunts shouts and bellringing as if here was her natural place really to see smoke puffing publicly out of her mouth as it had puffed privately out of that pollys would hardly be surprising now and the men were looking after her there could be no doubt of that appraising her as if she too was in the market he could not but feel a faint relief that she was under substantial masculine escort however abhorred the marketplace along which our quite unconscious jinny was now making so indiscreet a tourney was constructed outside the town proper bordered on two sides by limetrees and open to the sky save in the auctionroom and bar where walls and roofing gave a grateful shade though the company in either did not contribute coolness the cattle were shuffling about restlessly jostling mounting the store calves and bullocks lay in pens the fatted calves had already been sold pathetic plumpnesses about to be butchered butchers indeed were already emerging from the auctionroom leading struggling strapmuzzled calves by headropes and holding onfor extra precautionto their tails poor creatures said jinny with tears coming to her eyes yes a poor lot assented farmer gale and if will could have felt the flash of scorn that went through jinnys heart he would have scowled less there was a store calf stamped in blue so tiny that jinny longed to mother it here again the farmer blundered he doubted if anybody would buy it at least it would be killed instanter to be mixed with pork for sausages he was a widower jinny remembered and the line in the spellingbook defining that word floated suddenly before her illumined mind widowerone who has buried his wife there had always seemed to her something superfluously sinister in that definitionas if the husband had personally put his wife out of the way or at least made sure she was disposed of was a man a widower whose wife had been burnt up she had wondered whimsically or if miss gentry had been married and gone to sea and been duly drowned would her husband have been free to remarry but for farmer gale at least how pat was the definition she felt he assuredly suggested the wilful widower this man without entrails of mercy whether for the poor or for beasts she moved away silently trying to lose him looking for the horses she passed pens of sheep and dogs only a few of these and tied and cows with swollen oozy udders there was a sheep nibbling at a fallen lime branch outside its pen and another shoving hard to displace him jinny picked it up and gave it to this covetous creature who sniffed and then turned away there seemed to be a sort of spellingbook moral in it before the pigs redcrossed and bluemarked she found master peartree in rapt contemplation the pegs be lookin thrifty and prosperous he observed in response to her asking how he found himself they dont need no auctioneers gammon no pig does punned jinny ah here we are said a less welcome voicejinny maliciously referred farmer gales we to his juxtaposition with the pigs the uneasy capping and ducking of the shepherdcowman before his master and his moving off towards his own animals suggested that pigs were a private passion with master peartree but he had brought up the memory of the shearingshed and with it the renewed thought of will and it was a tenderer thought than for the potentate at her side will might be stubborn and silly but never surely would he deny that no family should have less than ten shillings a week she felt relieved she had broken the ice between them even though fine morning was only a little hole in it as if echoing her thoughts fine morning said the pigauctioneer to farmer gale it was a special mark of attention from this gentlemanlylooking man elevated on a massive stool who wore gaiters and a great gleaming signetring that showed as he turned the pages of a written catalogue this was kept by elastic strings in a grand calf cover though pigskin would have seemed more in keeping two acolytes standing on the ground scribbled in their lowliness buyers sat on the rim of the pens with their feet dangling over the pigs and the pigdrovers hovered near in their long high aprons of coarse brown sacking soon farmer gale became as fascinated as master peartree for the pigs did indeed look thrifty and prosperous and as the penful was on the point of falling to a low bid he nipped in and secured a bargain while he was complacently cutting away bristles signing his acquisition with his scissors jinny stole away feeling he was safely penned iv will had long since disappeared from her ken but when she came to the long roofed place open at the side where beribboned and strawplaited hacks and draughthorses were tied to their staples there he was chained just as firmly by a sort of sentinel stubbornness it was as if he was saying through my body first the thrill his proximity gave her was shot through with a renewed resentment against this obviously undiminished opposition of his but she was resolved to meet him with banter rather than with anger you buying horses she said genially no i am not buying horses he answered roughly but arent you ashamed to be herethe only one of your sex surely not said jinny wheres your eyes he looked round wonderingly under your nose guided jinny there isnt that a mare and i passed sows and ewes and heifers by the score and thats what you class yourself with and then you deny you are lowering yourself i always lower myself when i get off my cart well you get up again thats the best advice i can give you drive home and shirk my job ill do your job you i thought you were not buying horses you know what i mean how much does old flippance want to give oh hes not so old she said evasively she was scanning the horses with troubled eye perturbed even more than by her own affairs by the thought of the innumerable diseases and defects and doctorings which might be lurking beneath their sheen of health and vigour her innocent faith undermined by literature and mr flippances experience she had a cynical sense of horsey hypocrisy of whited blacked or browned sepulchres within which fearsome worms burrowed in their millions she would have gladly consulted will had he not been so tactlessly intrusive even as it was she murmured encouragingly there doesnt seem much choice today indeed the animals were mostly huge shire horses with their heavily feathered fetlocks of hackneys there were only two or three i should take that suffolk punch advised will indicating a chestnut hell have the strength to draw the caravan and doesnt look so clumsy and hairylegged as the others i like the star on his forehead said jinny but i cant bear a cropped tail its cruel besides mr flippance hasnt got a caravan well how does he carry all that truck i saw oh that goes in wagons with horses just hired from town to town they dont even live in a caravan like mr dukes got no but they have a trap that they drive over in ahead and then mr flippance uses the trap to look for a pitch to hire or to bring home naphtha for the lamps or timber for mending the theatresomething always goes wrong he says then id have the cleveland which is the cleveland that tall bay with black points and clean legs ive hardly ever seen one at an essex fair but theyre strong as ploughhorses and handsome as hackneys but dont you think that couple there are handsomer the blackof course theyre a pair of real carriage horses splendid action i reckon but mr flippance wont want anything so showy as that just what a show does want laughed jinny you see he also rides about the town blowing on the horn and scattering handbills i didnt understand that and can he blow a horn as well as well as who as me said will boldly and when am i to have my gloves he sought her hand in the press and it was not withdrawn when you go blowing it for mr flippance in his next town she laughed happily then i must choose the horse i blow behind he said with an air of lightness whats the most old flippance will go to thirty pounds is his last word im afraid much too little but well see now ill take you back to your cart what for her hand unclasped ive got to buy the horse i must wait here but theyll be taken in there he pointed to the cattle auctionchamber and theres no need for you to bid personally i shall enjoy bidding among all those men you wont even get a look in the chamber was indeed besieged by a seething crowd some standing on tiptoe astrain to get their bids marked ill borrow one of those pigdealers stools she said do be serious jinny and do you suppose my work is a joke but you cant squeeze in that crowd suppose we find out the owner and get one of the black horses by private treaty and pay the market fee not me besides hell want a top price and theres more fun and chances in bidding oh look that poor clevelands got himself all tangled up do help him it was not easy to release the animal which having encoiled its legs in the rope attached to its staple was getting more and more frightened as its own efforts lassoed it the tighter jinnys heart beat fast lest will should get kicked and still faster at the nonchalance with which he accomplished his dangerous task thank you she said sweetly when the animal stood shaking but quiet its not your horse but i asked you to do it then you might do what i ask you he retorted she frowned she did not like this tricky titfortat it was unchivalrous it undid his deed of derringdo you must not interfere with my business she said severely and swept to the nearest door jinny where are you going he had followed her to the bar she said solemnly perceiving the nature of the forbidden chamber why cant i have a drink and a smoke what will you take he gasped believing her serious so female smoking even in public was no impossible foreboding to this buffet blockaded by laughing swilling tobaccoclouded masculinity mitigated onlyif not indeed aggravatedby a barmaid jinny was actually going to wriggle her way and the buffet did not even sell milk you shant go he said in a low hoarse tone clutching at her arm by god you shant but he succeeded only in grasping her dangling horn and in her dart forward it was left in his hand i didnt ask you to take that she laughed back as she crossed the threshold i meant whats your drink jinny he breathed his voice frozen mines ink she called out gaily and the males now aware of her presence vied with one another to pass the bottle and pen on the counter to her together with the little bowl of sand all of which she bore to the quiet side of the room where a protracted desk supplied facilities for notes and accounts reassured but still resentful will stood at the door awkwardly holding her horn with its bit of broken girdle and watching her protectively as she scribbled on a piece of paper and blotted it with the sand then coming back to him she took away her hornnot without a reproachful glance at the snapped cordand putting her folded paper into his hand instead glided past him and was lost in the hurlyburly disconsolate yet excited he opened the note and read this wholly unexpected quatrain swearing of all the nauseous complicated crimes that both infect and stigmatize the times theres none that can with impious oaths compare where vice and folly have an equal share this rebuke drawn from the endless thesaurus of the universal spellingbook and not original even in spelling will believed to be jinnys own composition and as inspired as it was alas deserved wonderful that jinny could sit down in all that turmoil in that smoky ginladen atmosphere and pour out these pure bursts of song surely martin tupper the mighty bard of the day whose renown had reached even wills illiterate ears could not better them and what was he will beside her he whose own claim to literature rested upon an imaginary exposition of daniel smarting with selfreproach he deposited the note where once her glove had restedit should be a text of warning henceforward but if she was thus marvellous still more necessary was it to withdraw her from these unfitting atmospheres and he returned more tenaciously than ever to his equine watch like a picket in a camp v meanwhile jinny had blotted herself out in the crowd around the sheepauctioneer who towered in the midst of his dirtywhite sea yelling all going at thirtyfive shillings apiece or striding from pen to pen across the bars while the buyers ruddled their lots with their mark and the drovers cleared for him ever fresh passages among the swirling sheep and acolytes kept parallel to him outside the fold with their inkhorns and notebooks but she had only fallen from the fryingpan into the oven for suddenly she became conscious that farmer gale was again at her side got your horse yet he inquired with his breeziest british smile sale not on yet she answered coldly then come and see the bullocks sell jinny pleading she must go to the horse saleroom moved away towards the congested chamber he followed smiling why that is where theyre selling the bullocks now he said her brain was seeking for a further pretext when she caught sight of the sentinel will frowning furiously in her direction if she slipped in now further argument from him would be nipped in the bud and silently she followed the robustious widower through the hole he bored into the seething mass the entry of a female attracted no general attention for it was impossible for the squeezed buyers to see more than the backs and sides of their immediate neighbours even if all eyes had not been on the auctioneer and on the beasts which occupied the central ring in the brief moments of their glory he stood at a raised desk this master of the revels in his shirtsleeves with a little stick for hammer a cleanshaven man with the back of his long head almost straight and further lengthened and straightened by the continuation down it of the central parting of his neatly combed hair the face bulging forward and into a massive mouth and chin he was flanked by two young bookkeepers one spottyfaced and spectacled in a scotch cap and loud tweeds and one bareheaded and demure and around him on the rising benches of an amphitheatre rose a mass of masculinity surmounted by small boys drovers chevied in the lotsstuck with paper numbersthrough large double wooden gates and backafter their great moments in the ringto their pens through a smaller folding gate the beasts did not always listen proudly to their praises the more modest instead of showing off their beauties preferred to nose restfully about the straw of the floor and had to be prodded into circular activity by the sticks of drovers who as the bullocks went sullenly round looked like a prose variety of picador in a toy arena and throughout fell the auctioneers patter sometimes suave and slow but for the most part staccato and breathless who will say seventy shillings property of mr purley of foxearth farm and a crown you all know foxearth farm you all know the hurdlemaker and his herds are even better than his hurdles who makes level money going going no dont you be going said farmer gale smilingly for the girl had begun to edge out she felt herself uncomfortably pressed why it almost seemed as if farmer gales arm were round her waist good heavens it was and what was more his body barred her movement outwards take away your arm she whispered fiercely im protecting you from the crowd he whispered back theyll break your ribs in take it away she hissed but he feigned not to hear and his eye being now on the arena not on her she was too shy to struggle and make a sensation the horn in her hand also impeded her efforts to extricate herself furious and flushing she was forced to stand there while the auctioneers prosy patter beat down on her brain in a maddening ceaseless pour selling to the highest bidderno reserve a big bullock in your hands start the bidding please to be sold without reserve i say how much come on look at his fat thank you seven pound fifteennine pound tena great big bullock im selling him without reserve he is to be sold whatever he fetches ten pound two and six going no not gone yet going i must go repeated jinny i must inspect the horses youll see them better in the ring here let me go ill never drive to chapel with you again why not jinny he bent down with sudden passion all the cautious cornishmans longwavering desires clenched by the discovery of her high educational endowments and concreted by actual contact with the desirable waist why not go to chapel together and be done with it once for all done with what she murmured reddening separating let me keep off the crowd always hush theyll hear you no they wont what do you say be quiet i want to hear the bidding shall we publish the banns jinny closed her lips obstinately wont you speak you know i can buy out half little bradmarsh in her silence the voice of the auctioneer possessed the situation the best heifer for the lastmaiden heifer beautiful quality fourteen pound marvellous creature marvellously cheap wont anybody start me the drover prodded the prodigy up and she trotted round dismally fifteen cried a squeaky voice fifteen echoed the auctioneer cheering up but his gloom soon returned for the bidding refused to advance being badly sold this heifer he wailed by crum hes right quoth the cornishman pricking up his ears sixteen pound he cried aloud and was already congratulating himself upon his bargain when like the voice of doom came the squeaky seventeen farmer gale was piqued eighteen he said surlily twenty it was a staggering blow but it only raised the farmers blood guineas he cried twentytwo pounds chirped the voice twentytwo pounds repeated the auctioneer insatiably beads of perspiration and hesitation appeared on the farmers brow in his concentration on the problem his arm relaxed jinny stepped aside and men unconsciously made way for her guineas cried the farmer twentytwo guineas repeated the auctioneer a beautiful maiden heifernever had a calf going but this time jinny was really gone she would not even risk waiting outside to hear the result but in generous gratitude at her escape she hoped he would at least secure the maiden heifer vi the sight of will still at his post suggested to her with a little qualm that he was not so wrong these male environments were not without their drawbacks those horses seem to fascinate you she said with a little tremor in her voice whether will or the violence just done to her was the cause of it she did not quite know but her mood was melting and her eye the brighter for a soft moisture but how was will to follow her vagaries and adventures thats my business he answered gruffly i thought it was mine she laughed she was quite prepared now to make it a joint affair you know my opinion on that he said icily you havent changed it yet she bantered why what should happen in these few minutes to make me change it things do happen in a few minutes she said mysteriously why i might have come back and bought up the whole show she waved her horn comprehensively over the horses what rubbish you do talk he said impatiently do i she fired up theres others think differently if they think differently its because they think lightly of you lightly indeed yesthey do to drag you into an indecent saleroom indecent she flushed wondering if will had seen that circumambient arm its all indecentall that talk about heifers i dont wonder you blush she laughed relieved im blushing for you you do talk such rubbish there you go with your cheek its only what you just said to me i said it because you do talk rubbish and you talk rubbish in saying it well go to those who talk sense miss boldero and he pulled out his pipe and matches with a symbolic gesture what an obstinate creature you are will me obstinate why aint it your obstinacy that keeps you here when im ready to do your job i told you i preferred to do my own jobs and with that she went straight up to the black hackneys and while will puffed volcanically she learnedly examined their teeth through tearmisted eyes that saw neither incisors nor agemarks then after carefully prodding their ribs and punching and poking them about as she had seen purchasers do with bullocks she swept haughtily towards the auction arena but afraid of encountering the farmer she hovered uncertainly on the threshold feeling like a bundle of straw between two donkeys gradually she realized and with enhanced resentment that she was the donkey that both these men had deceived her in representing the cattlearena as the sellingplace for the horses by the crowd that began to accumulate round the horses and to blot out the patient sentinel as the hour for their sale approached it became plain that they would be sold where they were tied and presently the motley crowd swollen by many of the cattleauctioneers audience thrilled with the coming of this heavyjowled worthy who had not turned a hair of his neatly combed chevelure the biddings were not brisk to jinnys joy only the heavier animals the ploughhorses and the carthorses seemed in demand the cobs and the ponies went for a song the sable steeds she had selected as the only suitable ones came latemost of the animals had been released from their staples and led off by their new masters to her dismay the hackneys were put up as a pair and all her pride seemed falling into ruin fortunately not provoking a bid they were then put up separately and jinny set the ball rolling for the first with a brazen offer of ten pounds for a moment she thought gleefully that the horse was to be hers at thatfor nobody there seemed in quest or in need of carriage horsesbut under the auctioneers scoff a few bargainhunters soon raised it to twenty and then to jinnys alarmfor her margin was getting dangerously narrowto twentyfour at twentyfive the bargainhunters fell off and a new voice interveneda husky voice that seemed to mean business and whose every counterbid filled her with dismay at its twentyeight pounds the auctioneer still upheld his stick with scorn and incredulity she was almost at her bids end twentynine pounds she cried crushingly this time the voice seemed indeed silenced she fully expected the stick to fall but at the first going though there had been no sound the auctioneer cried cheerily thirty pounds evidently somebody else had nodded or held up a finger inflamed by the fever of the struggle she was impelled to risk even her own earnings if flippance would not go so far thirtyone pounds she cried ringingly thirtyone pounds echoed the auctioneer with a promising accent of finality thirtytwo pounds he added instantly and this silent competition was even more crushing than the huskiest bid it put out her flame of recklessness and her heart sank with the stick as despite all the auctioneers derisory deprecation that wooden finger of fate fell finally at this truly absurd figure then the name of the unseen silent buyer transpired mr william flynt proclaimed a familiar voice a blaze of positive hatred ran through all jinnys being the brute the obstinate pig to come interfering with her daily work with her bread and butter to ride his will roughshod over hers and not only roughrider but coward sneak traitor had he not wormed and wheedled out of her the limit of her commission and thus romped in an easy winner and he would take his purchase to mr flippance she supposed yes he was already paying in fullshe saw him now near one of the clerks drawing a pocketbook out of the region of his black heart he was in a hurry he would hasten with the animal to tony flip but not so fast o dashing young man from canada flippance is a man of honour he will repudiate the purchase and the second hackney still remains the biter is bitthe pit you have digged shall engulf you but what was jinnys horror and indignation when this young man from canada now shamelessly revealed instead of going off with his spoil to mr flippance remained and ran up the second horse with his serpents tongue at still greater speed as now cocksure of her limit this time in her fury she ventured as far as thirtyfiveit was useless with a recklessness still more magnificent he cried forty and with a chill at her heart in curious contrast with the glow of hate at it she felt that all was over was it of any use bidding even for the few mediocre animals still possible would not this brutal monopolist buy up the whole buncheven as she had oddly enough hinted a few minutes before about doing yes there was nothing his masterful obstinacy would boggle at in its resolve to crush her will he still stood by the horseenclosure in unrelaxed vigilance before she could arrive at any decision her mind was still further unhinged by the simultaneous appearance of nip and the advent of pandemonium whether it was nip that had produced the pandemonium or the pandemonium that had liberated nip jinny never knew the fact was however that farmer gale waking to find himself outbidden for the heifer and disappointed of his maiden had retreated fuming to his trap and hearing nips revolutionary yaps for freedom in the adjacent cart had loosed him out of some vague instinct of malicekindness he called it to himself so unacknowledged was his desire to thwart the will of the creatures mistress a final kick administered to the retreating jumpalso apparently as a kindly encouragement to the freed dogs progresshad not proved conducive to the equilibrium of an animal already deranged by a longiterated grievance and an unexpected freedom and his helterskelter pelt through the marketplace not unnaturally startled the nerves of not a few fellowquadrupeds already shaken by the strange journeyings and novel experiences of the day but it was not until the sheep were reached that nips passing became a public episode there had even before been numberless difficult scenes with the sold lots the effort to muster them for their new journeyings had sufficiently taxed the lungs and tempers of men and sheepdogs when nip appeared the normally stolid master peartree was waving a giant red handkerchief and screaming wildly while dementedseeming drovers formed into a halfring danced and shrieked like savages at a religious service and waved sticks with a ritual air and the sheepdog leapt round and round chevying the flock in the desired direction in this delicate crisis nips rush of recognition at master peartree proved the last straw one superterrified wether threw the flock into a panic the sheep rushed to and fro and everywhere save where the sticks and shrieks pointed and going thus everywhere they went nowhere jumping on and over one anothers backs as in a game of leaplamb some darted back into alien pens and the sheepdog itself distracted leapt from back to back of these baying and menacing with feverish futility it was like a stormy sea of sheep in which man was tossed about as in a tempest there were sheep standing on their hind legs as if dancing there were men clinging on to these legs or to tails or to rumps and pushing pulling and wrestling with them but never ceasing to yell and chevy finally a rescue party appeared with a fivebarred gate which they moved this way and that striving to cut off at least one of the ways of escape but this only drove more sheep back into the wrong pens where they seemed hopelessly mixed up with lots still unsold jinny had never imagined sheep such lively and individual lunatics now the intruders were being dragged out by the wool of the head or the rump or halfcarried or wholly kicked again the fivebarred gate was brought into play this time to keep them away from the pens and then wherever the eye turned were these tempestuous billows of sheep they bounded reared wrestled danced pranced flew wildly at tangents some escaped towards the town and everywhere men screamed scurried bellowed waved hands or brandished sticks nip his head equally lost seemed to be doing every one of these things at once whether ovine or human and jinny in her anxiety to capture him to remove him unseen from the witches sabbath she feared he had called into being forgot all about the other possible if inferior horses by the time she had refastened nip and returned to the sale the stick had fallen for the last bid she was just in time to see will springing on one barebacked steed and leading his beribboned brother by a cord and despite all her anger and contempt she could not avoid a thrill of admiration for the grace of his poise and the fearlessness of his carriage and a dull aching pain began at her heart she felt she wanted something she had missed getting somethingand obscurely she told herself it was the horses he was leading away yes as a carrier she was a failure vii and then suddenly the jovial figure of the showman panted into view his face was unshorn unwashed even although abundantly irrigated with perspiration and he wore a lowcrowned vastbrimmed hat and an unseasonable furlined cloak reaching almost to his slippers and fastened at the neck by a brass buckle although jinny always had a soft place in her maternal heart for mr flippance nobody could have been more unwelcome at this moment of her professional humiliation but before she could confess her failure tony flip gasped out a horse a horse my kingdom not to have it how do you mean am i too late have you bought it yet not yet said jinny thank god he grasped effusively at her hand but encountering the horn first shook that instead without apparently noticing the difference just as i woke up it popped into my nut that this was the morning of the cattle fair out of bed i flew like from that bed in the crystal palace that chucks you out by a spring and though i maynt have beat the halfmile record im beat myself whew not a bad gag that and mopping his brow he grinned through a grimy handkerchief i thought you looked odd said jinny equally relieved yes i know my collars a rag but better sweat than debt eh its not your collarits seeing you out of your dressinggown at this hour youre a quiz thats what you are laughed tony never mind that cloak comes nigh it and youve still got your carpet slippers have i o lord i thought the road was feeling hard is that a bar i see before me it is said jinny severely but while youre still sober perhaps you will tell me why youve changed your mind about the horse because ive done with marionettes im going back to the legitimate jinny was puzzled to your wife do you mean i thought she was dead tony roared with laughter you little country mouse and yet youre right the legitimate is the missus i should never have leftthe drama with a big d i dont mean the drama with swear wordsha ha ha but the real live article you see duke and me weve agreed to swop back what for what for why thats just the trouble for a consideration says that son of a horseleech and i say thats bloodsucking good idea why shouldnt you be arbitrator the word which was unfortunately absent from the spellingbook suggested nothing to her but being hanged drawn and quartered like a rebel whom granfer had once seen executed but she was afraid of being again set down as a country mouse so she replied cautiously i havent the time oh ill pay you your time yes youd be the ideal arbitrator cried mr flippance catching fire at his own idea to begin with you know nothing about it so thats settled and you shall drive me to dukes caravan this very morning not if i have to wait for your drink the way you drive a man not to drink is awful he groaned never mind ive got cool again talking to you is as good as a drink guardian angel he squeezed her horn you see he narrated as they drove townwards duke turned up here with the flippance fitup on saturday night and struck an awful frost so he told me said jinny i met him yesterday when i came out of chapel and i told him what a roaring trade you were doing my preserver then its to you i owe it hes hankering for his own show back again not that he could expect to do any business in my own town or indeed any other he forgot that while i unseen can be duke the public wont look at him for a moment as flippance he takes the name of flippance in vainthe public knows the difference between a barnstormer and their own tony to say nothing of that mincing little duchess after my fullthroated fullbosomed polly poor dear pollypining away pulling strings why she told me said the astonished jinny that she wouldnt go back on the stage for all the treasures of the crystal palace ah thats her unselfishnessbless herher own crystal soul she knows how the stage tries her pas nerves but havent i stood by her side as we jogged the figures and seen her poor phiz working at the thought of being cut off from her public like in a divingbell she takes things hard does polly not like the duchess whos got no more temperament than a tinned sardine youve seen her havent you if you mean mrs duke she was with him yesterday a pretty blueeyed woman with golden hair oh is it golden this season but have you seen her act i mean ive never seen a play at all tut tut tut then youve never seen me ohyou seem to me a play all the time she said candidly he was not displeased then you do have an idea what a play is ive seen punch and judyand the christmas mummers he laughed well if polly was working punch and judy from behind thered be more life and go in her than there is to the duchess when shes on the stage playing juliet the public wont pay to see a china doll but my polly i tell you that standing with the strings in her hand with nobodys eye on her but mine and her makers and in a space where there isnt room to swing a cat ive seen that girl raging and shouting and tearing about with the passion of the scene till ive had to wake up too and weve gone at it dingdong hammer and tongs and with three figures each to work and voices to keep changing its no mean feat i can tell you duke and his duchess now when they worked the figures used to just stand like stocks saying the words no expression or movement except in the marionettes but if the public sees only the marionettes said jinny mr flippance shook his head theres no art in cold blood not that marionette art hasnt got its own special beauties and i freely admit that in puppetry proper im not in it with duke who was born into the business and who cut and fitted the figures himself lazy though you think me how ive sweated to get those things right what an ungrateful swine the public can be for ones pearls what kind of pearls asked jinny why when a character takes up a glass of wine for instance and drinks it well i shouldnt applaud that laughed jinny there you are he said with gloomy triumph the public cant see the cleverness of it but if you remember the delicacy it takes to manipulate the figure from behind to make it clutch the glass just right instead of pawing the air to make that glass come accurately to the mouth youll see the countless chances against perfection talk of the corkscrew equilibrist at astleys why jinny when that glass sets itself down again without accident there ought to be applause to make the welkin ring but not a hand not a hand well but it cant seem very wonderful from the front said jinny it would if people had brains to think for every joint in the human body theres a joint in dukes marionette and for every joint in dukes marionette theres a separate string to pull every art has its own ideal and for a puppet to sit down safely is a greater success than for a kean to play shylock though of course all this must be greek to you but when im thinking of the fun of punch and judy said jinny shrewdly i cant think of the cleverness of the showman pulling the stringsotherwise i should forget the figures werent alive nor the story realthe two things contradict one another by jove i think youve hit it said mr flippance more gloomily than ever they take the standard of dramanot of mechanical miracles and thats why they applaud most at the easiest effects just shouting and blood and thunder and thats why im sick i mean why polly is sick of the whole business take our tightrope dancer now i dont say shes as graceful as a live dancer at richardsons or pirouettes like the cairo contortionist of my young days at vauxhall but shes far more wonderful a live tightrope dancer can after all only fall downwards if she makes a slip but ours instead of tumbling down might fly up like a balloon or even just miss the tightrope and dance on nothing like you see a murderer at newgate but the public take the standard of the ballet or the queens of the tightrope and instead of giving us a hand for the cleverness in the making and dressing of the puppet and another hand for the putting life into it and a third hand for the dexterity of the manipulation theres times when we get no more recognition than if twas a monkeyonastick i tried to educate em by letting em see the strings or the wiresi mustnt tell an outsider what they are exactlyi flooded my stage with light duke now used to keep his scene particularly dark with the fantoccini whats fantokeeny asked jinny imitating his mispronunciation as best she could theyre the figures that are more mechanism than characterbalancers polecarriers stiltwalkers spiral ascensionists and this tightrope dancer im telling you of dukes idea was to keep the mechanism dark that seems to me best said jinny i dont agree said mr flippance theres the scenic effects to consider darken your scene and you hide it but if you light it you show up the way its done jinny urged unless you show em the way its done how can they appreciate the way you do it but there im done with it let duke have his pony polly shall tread the boards once more does he want you to give him a pony then to change back thats it the son of a shylock then you will want a horse after all a ponyyou little innocentmeans twentyfive pounds i suppose though thats about the value of a pony it depends whos bidding against you said jinny ruefully well anyhow thats what the bloodsucker wantsthe twentyfive pounds he gave me he wants back again but if he gave it you why isnt it fair to give it back ah youre beginning to arbitrate are you well then it isnt fair because i get back the flippance fitup tarnished and depreciated by the performances of that howling amateur and his squeaking doll of a duchess besides i dont want the fitup particularly only my trademark back the worldfamous word flippance for i am going to stay the whole year here in chipstoneyou see what lots of people there are on market daysmother ganders buying a bigger hall for you peculiarshavent you heardand me and charley have worked it with her to sell me the old chapel ill easily get it mortgaged licensed knocked into shape and enlargedthat piece of ground between the gate and the doors is wasted at present and theres an american capitalist keen to come ini met him just now riding a black horse and leading anotherand what better omen could man desire the flippance palace i shall call my theatresuggests the hyde park success dye see and when that crystal show is overit wont run beyond octoberill have the queens elephant standing in my lobby lord itll draw all essex chipstonell become the capital these sudden pieces of information left jinny gasping the old chapel thus whisked away from under her feet and turned into a gigantic punchandjudy show sent her world reeling while will transformed into a theatre proprietor seemed rapt away to unimaginable heightsor depths but she did not quite believe it all and what does miss flippance say she murmured polly shell be off her nut with joy why shes such a glutton for work is that girl that when we played the mistletoe bough she used to play lady agnes in act i and her spirit in act ii after shes killed by being shut up in the box you know and actually double the part with that of her maid maud who has two quick changes from jacket and petticoat to tunic and trunks and back again to bodice and skirt not to mention slipping to and fro twixt spirit and flesh shes pining away to a spirit herself poor dear for lack of her real work only we mustnt break it to her before the deed is doneor rather signed the poor girl would insist on sacrificing herself but after all ive saved thirty poundsyou realize i wont need a horse nowso even if i pay him twentyfive i make a fiver not a bad mornings work eh my dear well get a good stock company and give em everything from the bard to burletta and ive got some lovely ideas for taking plays out of mr dickenss novels oh well wake up the old place charley knows some local girls that would come in splendidly for ballets and choruses and theres a wonderful scenepainter too down herea chap i knew at the eagle in londonhes lost his job and come down to his folks to get curedhis hand shakes a bit still but hes a marvel i promise you the days hes not sewn up accepting this synonym for intoxication as referring to the medical operations upon the unfortunate artist jinny received the statement with an admiring commiseration and havent you got a friend a wonderful expert in costumes tony rattled on me she murmured puzzled a sort of bearded lady from a french convent a cranky old catholic who talks with angels but is a dab all the same at dressmaking you dont mean miss gentry thats the name well appoint her wardrobe mistress never had jinny known him so happy and gaseousand paradoxically enough the more he poured out the more inflated he got miss gentryll never enter a theatre said jinny assuredly we shall see wardrobe mistress to the flippance palace chipstone think how that will improve her billheads and theres you too why should you waste a firstclass stage presence on carrying you carry yourself too well for that eh ha ha ha a thinking part perhaps to begin with but with your good speaking voice before jinny had encountered the full shock of this new proposition mr flippance broke off and besought her frenziedly to drive down a side street as she obeyed she realized that they had just escaped pollythough a polly hardly recognizable in that houri in white creamily jacketed bonneted gloved and above all veiled whom only her massive tread betrayed as charmless you see explained pollys pa it doesnt do to argue with women youre fond of youve just got to do whats best for em duke now hes very weak with women twixt you and i he only got my fitup because the duchess tired of working in the dark and of blushing unseen wanted to show off what you call her blue eyes and golden hair she tried pulling his stringsseeand he having no backbone jigged about at her pleasure but now to my thinking dukes found out what a fool shes made of him and of herself too for of course shes mucked up his business polly maynt be a venus but shes stunning in her makeupsi assure you such a great artist is that woman that seeing her standing in the wings at the first dress rehearsal ive more than once fallen in love with her myselftill of course she opened her mouth yes polly can always have blue eyes and golden hair but the duchess will never have talent if she rehearses till doomsday then is mr duke satisfied to go back to the illegitimate asked jinny he laughed at the word to the marionettes thats what duke wants the twentyfive pounds for he answered hes lost heavily and hell be able to show her a quid pro quoor rather twentyfive of emha ha ha all the same wed better not talk business if the duchess happens to be at home she may have her hand too tight on his strings but what shall we do if shes in i shall only say ive looked in to congratulate her on her successes oh jinny was seriously shocked and mr flippance realizing that her conscience was as country as her vocabulary had the shrewdness to say he was only joking besides he added shes sure not to be at home in the morning why not because she wont have her hair on but how could she go out then without it tony made as if to pinch her cheek as if nothing else could adequately express his acute sense of her simplicity but she guarded deftly with the horn rapping him indeed on the knuckles with it why jinny you hurt me he said ruefully well remember im not a marionette youre certainly not a woman of the world the duchess wouldnt let us in i mean but thats just what we want provided we can get duke to exit in another minute or two she drove him up to the back of the learned pig and alighting they picked their way through the undulating and muddy enclosure grassgrown and strewn with logs where the caravan was stationed there was really a pig there duly styed in his very dirty academy besides pecking poultry and pathetic rabbithutches agleam with eager sniffing noses and a flutter of washing and two shabby traps holding up their shafts like beggars arms but the caravan itself illumined the untidy space with its gay green paint its high yellow wheels its spickandspan air culminating in the lace curtain of its tiny arched window mr flippance dragged his slippers up the stepladder and jinny having by this time gathered what an arbitrator was followed in his wake prepared to undertake this or any other job but the duchess did let them inmore she opened the door herself looking indeed too lovely for anything but a doll and suggesting by her rising and falling eyelids her smiling lips and her mobile hands that she was equipped with all the most expensive devices duke habited in an oldfashioned blue coat with brass buttons was discovered poring at a desk over a long narrow account book he was an elderly and melancholy young man with bristly blackandwhite hair and small pigeyes set close together the stamp of aspiration and defeat was set pathetically upon the sallow face he turned over his shoulder to his visitors jinny was not edified by mr flippances pretence that shejinnywas the sole ground for the visit she had he said been driving him home from the market where he had gone to dispose of a horse and he had taken the liberty of bringing her to see their wonderful caravan finding to his amazement that she had never been inside for once the stock essex epithet was justifiedit was indeed a wonderful caravan and the interior so took up her attention that for some time she failed to follow the conversation though she had a dim uneasy sense that it continuedas it beganwith scant regard to the ethics of the spellingbook the gay paint and the neat lace curtains had prepared her for an elegance and even an airiness that were not to be found within the caravan but little else seemed lacking for into this cramped wheeled chamber looking scarce larger than her own cart and certainly not so large as commander daps cabin in the watch vessel was packed not only a complete cottage with its parlour livingroom bedroom scullery and kitchen but the mantelpieces and chests of drawers were as crowded with china dogs and shepherdesses as blackwater hall itself besides a wealth of pictures objects of art posters and inhabited birdcages to which daniel quarless domain could lay no claim not that there was really more than one undivided space or that you could tell where one room ended and the other began nevertheless all the different sections were clearly visible though a square yard here or there did double or treble service forming part of this or that room according as you looked at it most clearly marked of course was the bedroom consisting of a raised neatly counterpaned bed like an upper berth in a ship and a chest of drawers topped with ornaments though the kitchen with its grate and oven and flaptable ran it close in every sense of the phrase amid these poky surroundings the duchesss blue eyes and golden hair shone so sunnily and veraciouslytaken unawares as she seemedthat jinny ignorant she was expecting a visitor felt that mr flippance was as unjust of judgment as he was loose of statement but an interior so foreign to her experience affected her with all the pleasurable interest of drama apart from the comedy of which she felt it to be the setting as awaking again to the conversation she heard the two males still keeping it carefully away from the negotiation pending between them and evidently hard exerciseddespite gin from an improbable corner cupboardto keep the ball of nothingness rolling painful silences fell which a linnet and a goldfinch mule strove loyally to fill but which remained so awkward that she herself was constrained to enter into the conspiracy though only by way of genuine admiration admiration of the caravana readymade thing that went with dukewas by no means however the admiration the duchess wanted and as she failed to extract it from poor mr flippance fidgeting under jinnys puritan eye she fell back on a tribute of her own to herself recounting tediously the triumphs of her tour and calling on her partner for corroboration which he supplied in joyless monosyllables all flippances interjections with a view to stem the stream and divert the conversation to a pretext for dukes exit with him were like straws tossed before a torrent but presently there came reliefthough the plot thickened jinny felt there was a sound of footsteps on the ladder and ah theres polly the monologist broke off if jinny was already steeped in a sense of the dramatic if stimulated by the novel setting she had begun to feel that in such crosscurrents and mutual deceptions must lie the substance of that unknown article of commerce these people lived bya playhow strongly was this intuition confirmed and this sense enhanced when mr flippance whispering in apparent facetiousness im in my slippersshell rag me kicked them off under a chair slid back mahogany panels below the bed disclosing a lower berth and tumbled in with his finger roguishly on his lips closing the panels from within the mistletoe bough he sibilated so there it was they were actually imitating a play before her very eyes duke and the duchess grinning drew the panels tighter the theatre was so in their blood jinny felt that these things came as natural to them as carrying to her it was thus that jinny saw her first farceunless the high tragedy of punch and judy be degraded by that name viii polly it soon transpired was come to the midday dinner with her friend and the dinner itself was coming in presently from the learned pig the real purpose of the invitation was it transpired equally that polly might explain to the duchess the reading of a part alleged to be confused in the manuscript acquired with the flippance fitup she was obviously fishing for tips while these things were transpiring poor flippance in his fur was perspiring gradually jinny saw a rift appearing in the bedpanels and widening to a cautious chasm of a few inches it made her feel choky herself especially as the caravans little window was closed she signed apprehensively to mr duke who however was already revolving feverishly how to clear the stage for himself and his fellownegotiator and presently he broke into the feminine dialogue with im sure dearest polly wouldnt mind acting that bit for you but there aint room for pollys genius hereshed be breaking up the happy home hadnt you better go into the innparlour bianca therell be nobody there yet the duchess might have lacked talent but she had not played in farces without learning how to behave in them so without even needing a wink from her spouse she made a kindly exit behind polly not however without turning back a grinning dolls head at mr flippances beaded countenance emerging gaspingly from his berth but jinny who had already witnessed comedy and farce was now more conscious of the tragedy of the situation than of its humours as she saw the duchess tripping down the ladder with silken stockings revealed by the raised skirt it seemed to jinny that the poor lady was tripping thus blithely to her dark doom behind the scenes of the puppet show that her blue eyes and golden hair had flaunted their last upon the stage and the irony of her grinning exit was accented by the manuscript in her hand she was going off to study a part she would nevermore play it all gave jinny a sense of the duchess being herself a puppet with an ironic fate pulling the strings and she was frightened by a thought hitherto beyond the reach of her soul by a dim feeling that perhaps she tooand everybody elsewas similarly mocked who was perpetually jerking her towards that young man and then jerking her back what force was always putting into her mouth words of fleer and flout and pulling away the hand she yearned to lay in his whew exclaimed mr anthony flippance as jinny shut the door safely on the duchessfor that lady never shut doors partly because the process interfered with the sweep of ones exit partly because what concerned a scene from which she was absent never entered her golden head whew repeated mr flippance scrambling out i know now what lady agnes felt like help lovelfather helpi fainti dieoh oh but im disappointed in polly he added diving under a chair fancy being all her life on the stage and not espying these slippers he dug his feet into them theres no time for joking said duke anxiously as he tugged open the drawer of a desk in his parlour i suppose jinny is in the know jinnys come as arbitrator what duke wheeled round his hair still more on end get on with your mysterydesk it stands to reason a runaway financial imagination like yours needs a brake aint you brake enough mr dukes tone was bitter and you want me to be broke retorted tony i give you my beautiful marionettes lifesized and lifepainted all carved by the best maker oh i know all about that interrupted duke impatiently well youre not going to deny your own skill i hope duke glared impotently with his little pigeyes and with the costliest costumes tony went on blandly and all these puppets moreover with the latest mechanical contrivances regardless of expense and dont i give you the finest goodwill in east anglia burst in mr duke the flippance fitup with all its plays prestige and unique takings one thing at a time old cock packed into a box that itself opens out and forms part of the stage combining portability of props with do dry up cried the maddened duke if youre not quick bianca will be back whats that to me to cut it short i give you the finest marionette show in the world with scenery skyborders and plays complete and an oldestablished reputation a show that has played before the crowned heads of europe america and australia and like the workhouse boy in mr dickenss book you ask for more what say you jinny thinkest thou the duke should have more we all want more said jinny air maynt i open the window oh excuse me mr duke evidently trained by his big doll rushed to do it but havent i lost enough without losing my twentyfive pounds too he turned back to his desk and extricating from its remoter recesses another large narrow fat account bookthe twin of that he had been poring overheld it up theatrically heres my marionette accounts for sixteen yearslook through em and see if you can find any single weekay even the week of king williams funeralas low as the best of the weeks since i touched your wretched show my wretched show mr flippance lost his blandness why if thats the case its you that have depreciated it you ought to pay me compensation but duke had dramatically dumped the book down side by side with its twin look on this picture and on that he said dukes marionettes week ending march th colchester total s d flippance fitup colchester corn exchange week ending march th monday eleven shillings theres an opening tuesday oh come to the dd total said tony impatiently there aint any total said duke crushingly tuesday sixteen shillings and sixpence always rising you see said tony wednesday duke went on implacably nine shillings and fourpence why how do you get fourpence interrupted tony severely you havent been letting down the prices i hope thats noted at the side see said the careful duke a swindler passed off a groat as a tanner thursday eight and sixpenceimagine the colchester corn exchange with eight and sixpence friday nine shillings rising again you see chirruped tony saturday one pound thirteen and six there you are that pulls you up saturday evening concluded duke two pounds eight and then he grumbles mr flippance raised his great ringed hands towards jinny total six pounds five and tenpence and isnt that enough to live on cried tony only two in family and a little bird or so and if your boxoffice man had been smart enough to tell a groat from a tester youd have had six guineas he wasnt such a fool said duke dryly for on another night its noted that a halfsovereign was passed off on him for sixpence and then you outrage providence by complaining of the takings said tony rent of corn exchange continued duke doggedly three guineas salaries to company including checktaker four pounds eight lighting a pound advertising including billposter three pounds ten but my dear chap what extravagance no wonder travelling expenses company and scenery excluding caravan eighteen and ninepence drinks to pressmenone and sixpence oh not enough no wonder net deficit seven pounds sixteen and threepence plus the salary of bianca and me what why you said salary of company four pounds eight you dont suppose i included ourselves with the checktaker you didnt oh my dear fellow said tony sympathetically no wonder youre down in the mouth a wise manager always pays his salary before any other expense then hes always sure of a standby it isnt the money thats the worst duke explained its the dreadful loneliness why didnt you stuff the house with paper and put up free list absolutely suspended easier said than done in a place where you dont know a soul why bianca had a benefit night and how many do you think were in the stalls two women and a boy ive known only the theatre cat began tony cheerfully and the boy went to sleep wasnt it his bedtime but i will say its not entirely the fault of your acting ive noticed ever since that crystal palace loomed on the horizon its unsettled the public within at least fifty miles from hyde park i was talking to a showman who told me that in march and april this year business fell off everywherethere was no interest in giants dwarfs fat men pigfaced ladies and even jugglers animal magnetizers liontamers performing elephants ventriloquists prestidigitators and professors of necromancy didnt you hear of the fate of poor wishbone the conjurer at chelmsford fair not even a kid dropped into his booth so he went out to perform outside but before he could hey presto the purse back to the owner the peeler copped him the magistrate wouldnt listen to his patter and he cant tap himself out of quod either poor chap besides we all remember the awful weather in march yes and up to the very opening of the crystal palacerain rain rain well take the march of said duke turning back his oblong pages and dont forget peoplell sit in assembly rooms or a corn exchange when they wont risk a draughty tent now look at the weather that yearwhen i pulled my own strings tuesday wsthat is wet snow wednesday rn rough night thursday sht storm hail and thunder saturday wt wind tilt off come now you could hardly have a worse week could you everything except bf or bf black fog or big funeral yet see my takings for that week were tony flipped away the book with his jewelled hand what youve got to compare with your colchester week he said is not your marionette week in march but my fitup week for that date i dont see that it stands to reason they debated the point warmly finally tony referred it to jinny that was what she was there for he recalled i certainly think arbitrated the little carrier that we ought to see what mr flippances live theatre could do in the same weather oh very well acquiesced duke sulkily and what did you do that week heavens man how on earth can i remember but havent you got it written down what do you take me for asked tony a tradesman a bookkeeper unless polly you told me the other christmas that you averaged twentyfive said duke bitterly and i paid you one weeks takings by way of douceur well then you do know my weekly takings said tony loftily i cant stay here for ever put in jinny ive got my work im paying you aint i tony rebuked her but not giving me work she assumed a judicial air do you mr flippance maintain that your theatre is a more valuable concern than mr dukes marionettes of course i do then said the young solomon in petticoats surely if you get it back you ought to pay him the difference in value bravo bravo mr dukes little pigeyes gleamed a sensible girl oh jinny groaned mr flippance to desert your old pal and do you mr duke went on jinny imperturbably maintain that your marionettes are a better property than the flippance fitup certainly not said mr duke not to be caught the marionettes are a worse property then she asked duke banged his book much worse then why do you want it back tony uttered a shriek of delight a daniel come to judgment oh jinny i could hug you a sweep of her horn kept him at arms length you say mr duke that the fitup property is the better and yet you want to give it up mr duke leaned his elbows on the desk and dropped his head in his hands you confuse mei must have time to think hamlet observed tony pleasantly but i dont think the ghost will walk his hand moved towards the gin decanter but again that baffling horn intervened look here said duke rummaging in his drawer ive got the transfer written out ready for signature two copiesthe exact words of our last agreement only turned the other way of course im a plain manis it to be or not to be that is the question said tony sepulchrally but you see it isnt so plain as you youve depreciated my theatre and its not worth the extra pony why cant you make a reasonable compromise and just swap back what and be a pony out of pocket youll be an elephant out of pocket if you dont jinny reminded him seven pounds sixteen and threepence a week mount up ah that was a particularly bad week then there were good weeks flashed tony i tell you the best werent as good as the marionettes worst come come old cock draw it mild if you dont believe me said duke firing up look for yourself and whats more if you find im wrong keep the pony and be hanged to you easy easy but i was never a man to refuse a sporting offertip us the tomes duke handed him the twin account books but soon tiring of the rows of figures mr flippance begged jinny to pursue the investigation while he studied the document of transfer it was not without a thrill that setting the volumes on a hanging flap that duke had changed for her into a table she went back over the pages of faded ink that told of toils and tribulations in the years before she had come into being as a carrier she was peculiarly sensitive to these records of wrecked tents and ruined takings through the peace of the summer morning in that poky caravan the winds from that prenatal period seemed to be rushing its snows falling its hails and thunders crashing and with these imagined tempests came up the thought of will what was he doing now with his beautiful black horses was he looking for mr flippance at the black sheep but the thought of him was too agitating she crushed it down and got absorbed in her task and the tales the figures told the blanks carefully explained by good friday or royal mourning or the journey to some distant pitch the varying cost of these pitches in publicans meadows the varying expense of cartage the sudden jumps in the takings dueas annotatedto high days and holidays or to royal weddings or to favourite pieces she wondered why mr duke ever played any others what is dfn she asked suddenly dismissed fine night said mr duke in melancholy accents it was the supreme tragedy although a fine night he explained rubbing it in to himself not enough to be worth playing to you didnt always do good business you see gurgled tony from the ginglass he had imperceptibly acquired accidents will happen duke retorted and what is ds put in jinny dismissed snow ds is diddling show explained duke gloomily i struck one only last week at the very publichouse i hired my pitch from that wasnt playing fair said tony no indeed they stuck a placard in the window great water otter free and when youd had your drink they took you to the stables to see it in its tub there were crowds every night it was put in the paper tony grinned lord what fools these mortals be but why asked jinny id rather see a waterotter than a dancing doll youre not even a country mouse said tony when the fools push and squeeze to get near the tub they warn em dont go too near and all the while its only a big iron kettlea waterotter see jinny laughed yes thats what they all do said duke dismally laugh and help to gull the others and between them the legitimate goes to the dogs or the otters jinny bent in lighter spirits over the twin volumes im afraid youve lost mr flippance she announced at last i cant see any drama week of mr dukes that goes as high as the worst of his marionette weeks right you are said tony cheerful under his liquid sport is sport and the pony is yours here goes and picking up a pen from the desk he signed one of the documents with a long thick line sweeping backward from his final e duke signed the other copy more soberly and jinny witnessed both signatures with careful calligraphy it only remains old cock said tony to deliver the twentyfive pounds hear hear agreed duke you dont suppose i carry it about with me dukes face fell but without money passing it aint legal but i jumped out of bed in a hurryjinnyll bear me out i mean he added hurriedly as a dramatic interest flickered across dukes face look at my slippers oh ive seen your stinking old slippers duke was getting unpleasant what i want to see is my money sorry old boyno use letting your dander riseits a case of hgihavent got it and moiumust owe it you still i dare say we can rake up something on account to make a legal consideration doubtless jinny has got half a crown give me one jinny till i get home jinny who had always hitherto dealt with polly and been scrupulously paid had no hesitation in handing him the coin she did not know it was the cost of her arbitration duke accepted it ungraciously as earnest money and if i may advise you how to run your own show now youve got it back said tony handsomely dont go so much by the fairs theres not only the waste of time and travel in between one and tother its lowering a fine art to the level of a merrygoround or the talking lobst i cant wait for ever interposed jinny are you coming she opened the door your times paid said mr flippance severely however duke takes my meaning heres luck to him and with a last gulp at dukes gin he followed her to the door send me my scenery and props and the same cart can take back yours and the box of figures no no said duke thatll need several journeys or carts we divide the freightage what when i throw in twentyfive pounds o duke duke if you aint careful therell be a show of the meanest man on earth and shaking his fat jewelled forefinger waggishly at the caravan proprietor he followed the carrier now for a last kick at the company he observed to her as the door closed upon the dismal duke ix but at that moment the ground resounded with gallant hoofs and a handsome redhaired cavalier riding a barebacked black horse and leading another steed of satan and followed by a bounding little white dog brought life and spirit into the scene the rabbits poked their noses greedily through their wires and the pig grunted in perturbation jinny shrinking back behind mr flippance remained paralysed on the steps of the caravan while tony unconscious that he was needed as a screen hurried forward with a joyous greeting and a query which served the purpose as effectually for jinny was left unnoted on her pedestal you looking for me asked tony i was answered the horseman but now im looking for the stables the black sheeps full up and i thought id put up my spare horse at the learned pig till i could find you however here you are but you crossed me man just outside the market did i is jinny here i see her cart outside never mind jinnyyoure just in the nick of time i want to talk business to you and so do i to you if i crossed you twas because i was galloping to you with the horse you ordered through jinny and i was galloping to her to cancel it what cried will but the joyous rush and gambollings of nip now directed his attention to nips statuesque mistress im afraid youve let yourself in for those horses she said descending she did not speak maliciouslythe sting of her defeat was over now that his victory had recoiled on the victor and she was really a little sorry for him but all other feelings were overwhelmed for the moment by this new sense of dash and grace in which he and the beautiful pawing steeds were mixed up centaurlike his figure looking so much taller on horseback that it almost corresponded to miss gentrys ideal unfortunately will himself had no sense of the horses except as a costly and burdensome mistake the iron issuing from jinnys soul was entering into his but surely you want one of em he said addressing mr flippance he had cherished a dim hope that the showman might launch out into binary grandeur but at the worst he was prepared to keep one horseit would be useful for riding into chipstonepending its sale but to have two horses on his hands eating their heads off after consuming practically the whole of his capitalthis was too much nor could he believe that jinny was not gloating over the nemesis that had overtaken his attempt to crush her will i dont see what i should do with a horse said tony seeing that im setting up the flippance palace theatre as a local landmark of course i might have a play written round him he mused or even round em both they would certainly draw all chipstone especially with a carriage behind em odd isnt it therell be scores of carriages waiting outside my theatre yet to see one on the stage gives everybody a thrill lord how the public does love to see natural things in unnatural places as my old pa used to saymy real pa i meanput an idiot on the stage and he gives pleasure put him in the stalls and he writes dramatic criticism ha ha ha then you do want em said will eagerly if youre ready to bring in the noble animals as part of the capital ill look around for a dramatist to work em in youd best look around for a capitalist retorted will in angry disappointment ive told you before im going into farming then youll want the horses yourself theyre no good for farming jinny corrected aint they said tony surveying them with a fresh eye then why did he buy them will got angrier thats my business do you want them or not i can always do with anything a plays a pie you can shove anything into youd look bully yourself as you americans say riding just as you are just a cowboy costume thats all you need will you do it will i do what play lead and supply your own horses dont be a foolor try to make me one im a plain farmer tony grinned jinny dont seem to think em suitable for plain farming i reckon youd better set up as undertaker theyll go lovely with a hearse all you need is a corpse and i shant be long finding one hissed will tony clapped his hands thats the style lord man what a wasted actor jinny could not suppress a smile it brought wills temper to breakingpoint these horses at least wont be wasted he said to her at a white heat for ill take our friends advice harness em to a hearse murmured jinny no to a coach ill put an end miss to your mannish ways indeed jinny bridled up without however quite following the threat youve done for yourself he explained youve forced me into competition youve got me the horsestheres no end of outofwork coaches on the market to be got for an old song ill carry passengers and luggage faster and cheaper than you and heavier stuff too and ill wipe you out jinny grew white but at the venom of his words not their business significance her instinct retorted with a smile and i got you the horn too dont forget that i donti was thinking of that its all your doingand serve you jolly well right he turned sneeringly to mr flippance so i wont be a wasted musician either oho said jinny and shall we see you on the boxseat all acrowing and ablowing i know you still think i cant blowbut you shall see seeing isnt believing said jinny had you there old cock said tony she knows what i mean right enough ill start a coachservice twixt little bradmarsh and chipstone ay and farther too passengers inside luggage on the roof ill wake up this sleepy old spot and his vigour seemed to communicate itself to his horses they caracoled and stamped better let sleeping spots lie said jinny i thought you hated yankee goingahead itll save you going ahead anyhow said will why didnt you let things sleep me how could i help helping granfer women have always got an excuse and the man gave unto me and i did eat lord hes been reading the bible laughed tony will flushed all those hours in quest of orthography passed through his mind and what had all his painstaking letters led to quarrels recriminations miseries well let him have done with it all ignore her crush her that was the best way once he had driven her out of the business that tongue of hers would wag more meekly then perhaps a rousing blast on jinnys horn cut defiantly into his thoughts it was at once a challenge and a mockery will turned his horses heads sharply and trotted out nip at their heels but at the edge of the enclosure nip looked back wistfully to beg his mistress to join the party she however lowering her horn cried come here you naughty dog come here at once nip stood in pathetic hesitation its that animal my play shall be written round said tony decisively how much do you want for him you know i wouldnt part with him for love or money said jinny well i havent got any money said tony slowly but if youd like the other thing dont be silly jinny moved towards her cart i mean ita wife like you would be the making of a man now youll have to walk home said jinny springing into her seat it was too ironic a climax to the morning not in my slippers gasped tony you should have put on your boots said jinny sternly but listen he clung to the cart as if he would stop it its a heavensent opportunity it must be sent back said jinny gravely i mean for me he explained desperately you know how polly objects to my marrying again but ive got to break the deal with duke to her so i could work in the two at once it couldnt be worse i shall never marry said jinny gee up but whoa whoa you dont carry only your husbands cried tony stop he pursued methusalem for some yards but even methusalem was too quick for him and then as he stood panting and perspiring and overcome by a dark upwelling of disbelief in life he perceived the duchess with her manuscript and his daughter returning from the histrionic consultation at the learned pig thank the lord pollys feeding out he murmured as he slunk into a doorway then his face brightened up after all he thought ive only got to break to her about the theatre chapter ix two of a trade this comic story or this tragic jest may make you laugh or cry as you think best gay prologue to the what dye call it i the darkest season in jinnys lifeoutwardly a feast of lightwas come to the crowning mockery of its august splendour day after day there was the lazy pomp of high summer massive white clouds in a blue sky a spacious voluptuousness a languid glory but jinny felt less melancholy on the rare days when seamists rolled in from the marshes and spectral sheep were heard tinkling from dim meadows the corn was now cut and this too was a curious alleviation of the gnawing at her heart when the farspreading wheatfields had rustled in the sun like the hair of the earthmother an auburn gold touched with amber and purple lights infinitely subtle and suffusive the beauty of it all had been almost intolerable now that remorseless reapers had turned the wheat into rows of stooks that were more suggestive of the hair of a village girl in curlpapers jinny found it easier to jog on her sorely diminished business along the sunbaked roads it was not merely that will had turned from a swain into an enemy and from a figure of romance into a business rival it was not merely that his hated handsome visage kept coming up in her mind at the oddest moments to the confusion of her work it was the pressure of his competition hitherto jinny had believed in mankind despite the seven stages of life by which her spellingbook combined instruction in old english print with detailed information on how the devil blurs gods image in man despite the testifyings of her fellowpeculiars to their own wickedness she had regarded her fellowbeings as in the main virtuous and kindly what was she to think of human nature when she saw this dashing innovator literally carrying all before him in her pique and distress she failed to allow for the sensation created by the advent of the small secondhand coach with its pair of highstepping black horses nothing so great and momentous had happened in bradmarsh from time immemorial even in jinnys own mind it loomed as large as any of the events in the spellingbook from noahs flood to trafalgar throughout all those somnolent essex byways the passage of the novel equipage brought everybody to door or window it was equal to the passing of the county flyer on the main roads a thunder of wheels and a jingle of harness and a music of the horn true two horses are not four and a driver who blows his own trumpet has not the grandeur of a coachman with a scarletcoated guard not to mention the absence of relays to paw the ground and be switched without loss of a second to the fiery vehicle still with scarcely a hill to negotiate before chipstone two horses and a man seemed velocity and magnificence to villages accustomed to a crawling twowheeled tiltcart and a girl and the flynt flyeras it styled itself in vainglorious painthad created a demand as well as a sensation even if the want had been unfelt before starting three services a week instead of two it moreover dashed and zigzagged into corners and byroads that jinny had never pretended to serve the denizens of which had been content to wait at crossroads and landmarks or to deal with her through intermediary neighbours or houses of call and besides these attractions of convenience and novelty there was the comfort for passengers of riding in the body of the coach with their feet in the straw instead of dangling uneasily from the narrow sideledges in jinnys cart or sprawling in contorted adjustment to parcels and boxes persons who had always walked now found it simpler to jump into the coach than to fag along in the heat the carrying business saw itself transformed and extended in this elegant and epochmaking vehicle the nonhuman freight overflowing from the fore and hind boots was stacked on the roof though the lucky firstcomer had always space to sit beside will and hear his stories of the great world a shipmate from frisco had boasted of driving in kid gloves a polished silklined cab and spanking fifteenhundreddollar steeds with silvergleaming harness and earning his three hundred dollars a month the vision beglamoured wills own status on the box and reconciled him to lifting the luggage of his labouring inferiors he aped it by driving in his best moses son suit as though more of a sporting charioteer than a menial touting for custom and parcels and clients flung themselves into his arms what wonder if the highpiled load soon outtopped jinnys revealed in its nakedness on these sweltering days when she drove without her tilt for gradually folks eyes seemed opened unsealed of a spell without a word spoken it was as if something unnatural and monstrous had been wafted away and the simple order of naturein the shape of a male carrierhad been restored without being quite conscious of how they had lugged their own boxes for the puny female customers were aware of a new facility they did not so much turn against jinny as forget her in this gravitation to the natural centre at first will hadwith a touch of consideratenessfixed his days on mondays wednesdays and saturdays not to clash with jinnys tuesdays and fridays but as his supply created new demands as he found he could widen his ambit as far even as brandy hole creek or blackripple he took on new circuits first for tuesday and then for friday and dropping his wednesdays to give his hardworked horses a solid rest in midweek it was not these new routes of his that galled jinny nor his impinging on her dayspossibly she was not altogether displeased to meet the rival vehicle no the iron that entered her soul was the loss of her previous customers who despite wills comparative magnanimity had changed their day to suit the rival round in the cases where she had imagined herself a friend rather than an employee it was heartbreaking hence this new and rankling doubt of her species waxing daily as her business waned folk seemed to follow one another like sheep and whenever now on a bit of miry road she came upon the serried footmarks of a flock she shuddered with a sense of the ignoble pettiness of the pattern no massive individual stamp like methusalems not even a characteristic dent like nips but an ignominious churning of mud by a multiplication of innumerable little identities pigs too supplied her with bitter comparisons when with her cart void of passengers and almost empty of parcels she passed at some crossroad the flynt flyer stiflingly chockfull of both for she had often noted in the feeding of swine that however abundant the food at its snout master pig will always rush to the thickest jostlingpoint such was the crowd such was humanity thought our little cynic who was however no mere soured philosopher but a harassed housekeeper with a couple of aged dependents whose rashers or oats were becoming seriously endangered methusalem had always lived from hoof to mouth and as for her grandfather had he not spent all his savings on her angelmothers debts there were still potatoes in the store and half a flitch in the larder and beer in the barrel and vegetables in the ground and milk in the goats udders but the reserves of provender as of cash were small and methusalem whose appetite age could not abate now began to loom as a deficit rather than an asset nip was the first to noticeand with pained astonishmentthe parsimony of the new regime why keep a mistress if one is to be practically thrown back on ones own resources ii in these circumstances it scarcely seemed on a par with the ethics of the spellingbook or of a piece with jinnys character that she should go to miss gentry and order a new sunday dress of pink sprigged muslin of the latest designa gown that but for its not hooking up at the back was absolutely ladylike still less that she should drive in it on tuesdays and fridays whether it was in emulation of her rival on the theory that fashionableness was a factor of his success whether it was to brighten up her spirits or to exhibit a defiant prosperity jinny did not reveal even to herself but that it was worn at will rather than on herself may be deduced from the fact that the commission to the french dressmaker followed hard upon her first encounter with the flynt flyer at the crossroads it was on this occasionas at many subsequent meetings on tuesdays or fridaysthat nip was torn almost literally in two by his desire to be in both vehicles at once that they should wish to pass each other without a halt or even a hail was amazing to the poor animal and if his distraction usually ended in a leap on to the coach where will was never without a beguiling biscuit he was always careful to rejoin the cart before the interval had become too spacious though a nipobothsides he was disloyal to neither indeed if ever creature did his best to bring two foolish mortals together that creature was nip but they no longer even saluted each other at first indeed the gentleman driver had doffed his hat gallantly but jinnys face had remained a stone though that stone was a ruby will therefore when he had to meet or pass her flew by at a rate which by its air of insolent superiority only increased her resentment later he had begun to slow down when he espied her lumbering along his route and to play the buy a broom polka on his horn with malicious accuracy by way of retort jinny once tied a label to nips collar marked in charge of the guard it was meant to taunt will with lacking the dignity of a true driver who never blew a horn but the somewhat periphrastic sarcasm seemed to miss fire for will took the label literally and when nip had executed his usual leap on to the coach he kept him prisoner for several days the faithful animal though fed as never before was as unhappy tied on the roof as jinny was and when her cart at last passed and her horn blew imperiously for him he made such a supercanine effort that his cord snapped and in an instant he was snuggling hysterically in the legitimate lap regardless of that flowery summery fabric his label she found now bore the words pay up the gloves alas paying upwhether for wagers or fabricswas out of jinnys power that very morning miss gentry had handed her the bill delicately wrapped in a tract such a situation was quite new to her though not unprovided against in the spellingbook weigh evry small expence and nothing waste farthings if savd amount to pounds in haste this had been a large expense yet she had not weighed it it was her debts and not her savings that had in such haste amounted to pounds woe to the pride that had seduced her what the weak head with strongest bias rules is pride the neverfailing vice of fools she did not need her books reminder of her heads weaknessonly too dismally she recognized that strange slipperiness of memory which made it more difficult to execute her commissions in proportion as their number dwindled was not the little notebook to which she must now have recourse the abiding symbol of this paradoxical humiliation she was not psychologist enough to understand that it was the very perfection of her memory which was now tripping her up so many of her clients had for so long demanded the same things so seasonably that she was automatically compelled to carry out commissions that had now lapsed she was like an actress who knows her part even backwards but is broken up and confused when cuts are made finding the too familiar words not to be ousted jinny would mechanically purchase items for clients who had forsaken her and thenso scatterbrained was she becomeleave them at other customers houses and on the other hand she was capable of forgetting the orders of the few faithful it was thus that under the combined strain of miss gentrys bill the sultry august weather the sight of the packed coach and its jaunty driver the frantic return of nip with his mocking message jinny whom necessity had compelled to keep farmer gale as a customer clean forgot his urgent need of a weddingcake it was not that she had forgotten to order it or even to fetch it from the leading confectioners the sudden union of farmer gale with the wealthy landsurveyors widow whose pianoplaying had excited the faroff admiration of elijah skindle was too sensational an event especially to herself to permit of complete oblivion it was only that she forgot to deliver the cake at beacon chimneys she was actually within sight of the stagheaded poplars that marked the horizon of home when turning her head as nip suddenly leapt for a rabbit she saw the great elegant carton in the cart and the wedding was on the morrow consciencestricken and morbidly feeling as though the marriage would scarcely be legal without this colossal confection she resolved worn out as she was with the heat to drive back to the house but she had reckoned without methusalem to turn back within the very smell of his stable was unprecedented it violated every equine code like nip he now became aware of the instability of thingsof a new order but more obstinate he refused to recognize it nothing short of the whipwhich would have moved him not out of pain but out of astonishmentcould have sufficed to turn him and how could a mistress who knew him in the right and herself in the wrong resort to that especially after such a sultry day so after every effort to coax him or to lead him by the bridle had failed and almost twenty minutes had been wasted she decidedin view of her grandfathers supperto make a special journey the first thing in the morning as she gave methusalem his glad head she remembered that it was just before the turning to the hymeneal homestead that she had met that scandalously successful coach iii before jinny reached home that evening a complainant had already called at blackwater hall to unload his grievance such visitors were alas no longer a novelty to daniel quarles who had one day begun to find himself no merely nominal representative of the business but a principal charged with derelictions his virulent rebuttals of the reproaches did but increase the defections the flouted customers made no allowances for the ferocities of senility and when told to go to hell simply went to the flynt flyera much pleasanter alternative indeed one suspects they welcomed the insult as justifying gravitation to the new star the indelicacy however of divulging its existence to the nonagenarian was reserved for mr elijah skindle that rising practitioners patronage was not the least of jinnys humiliations even after his proposal of marriage she had not been able to refuse to carry dogs to and from his establishment when so commanded by her clients though she had drawn the line at orders originating from himself now however in justice to her grandfather she could not but accept his commissions even though she was aware they were largely artificial mere canals for communication and courtship why for example could not mr skindle whose gig was often at gardens buzzing with beehives not purchase his own honey why must she procure him an article linkable with moons and permitting fatuous references to sweetness his protestations of lack of time were too brazen even for his own mouth he stuttered and blushed like a schoolboy it will be seen that elijahs deeper self had not accepted his lucky escape from her hope springs eternal especially when the desirable ones pride is bent if not broken by adversity that proud stomach which had rejected his proffered luxuries with disdain now bade fair to be empty while he moreover touched nothing he did not profit by and through a lucky rise in animal sickness was fast overtaking the respectable jorrow with an audacity almost napoleonic he had conceived the idea of at once blazoning and curing his baldness purchasing a hairrestorer through jinny herself so that she might be an accessory to the improvement at which he wasobviously for her sakeslaving and there did actually begin to sprout on his cranium microscopic dots like pepper sprinkled over an eggshell elijah lost no opportunity now of lifting his cap at the sight of her though he had not yet acquired the habit of removing it indoors whoa elijah drew up his trap in the grassy lane before blackwater hall and jumped down the afterglow of sunset was in the sky but the common was still torpid with the breezeless heat of the day he was in his best flannel suit and smartest cap though the same old pipe stuck in his blackened teeth removing it he rapped at the door with it knocking out the ashes with the same taps as nothing happened he tugged from his pocket a paperwrapped pot and thudded at the door with that he had been simulating rage for he had come to denounce a mistake though enchanted to have the opportunity of calling on jinny but now for fear she was not yet backand vexed with himself for not choosing one of her domestic dayshe began to get really ruffled he lifted the latch unceremoniously but the door seemed bolted repocketing the pot with an unsmothered oath he moved towards the livingroom wall and peeped through the wideflung little casement pah only the gaffer snoring in his favourite posture head on the family bible the shabbiness of the ancient earthcoloured smockfrock like the meanness of the furniture added to elijahs disgust fancy her slaving in this heat he mused when she might be snoozing on my horsehair sofa he shouted angrily wake up you old codger the nonagenarian obeyed with a start whats amiss my little mavis he yawned i aint a mavis elijah informed him irately im a veterinary surgeon daniel quarles sprang to his feet marciful powers anything wrong with methusalem no no elijah assured him through the little window ive come about jinny the old man tottered and caught at his chair an accident to jinny stuff and nonsense shell be home any minute can i come in and wait for her daniel growled and grumbled dont you see oim busy readin the scriptures i wont interfere with that he moved back to the door and rattled the latch masterfully he suddenly saw the possibility of pushing his suit with the grandfather why do you lock yourself in he demanded as the bolts creaked back dont you see theyve took the dutch clock said the gaffer pitifully she desarts me all day long and oi cant have my eyes everywheres elijah glanced up at the clock in the anteroom ticking as imperturbably as ever why its up there he said puzzled do ye dont try to befool me thats the same face but theyve took out the works and put in rubbidge but it aint works were justified by he added musingly elijah picking his way among the old cypress chests followed him into the livingroom sat down unasked on the settle and mechanically pulled out his pipe git out o my house roared daniel elijahs pipe fell on the rush mat boldero hisself explained the ancient never durst smoke in my nostrils and who be you who was boldero elijah thought a more sensible question but he picked up his pipe with an apology all right uncle no harm done he wiped his forehead warm aint it then why do ye want hellsmoke i shouldnt quite call this hellsmoke elijah deprecated theres no smoke without hellfire daniel explained farmer thoroughgood he smoked just such a pipe as yourn and he was thorough good you see said elijah with an air of victorious repartee thorough bad chuckled the gaffer with a still greater air of wit starved his missus to death the neighbours as come to see the corpse found her on a bed made out of a common sheephurdle stood on bricks he tapped the bible with a dirty thumb do ye dont yoke a hoss and ass together says the book but that evildoer used to plough a field with a cow and a donkey and when it ploughed too hard hed harness an old sow in front of the donkeytheres curranttrees there now what pays better not needin no ploughin quite like the old song observed elijah still feeling superior and witty there was a cow went out to plough chrissimus day chrissimus day hummed the old man set agoing he quavered on there was a pig went out to dig on chrissimus day in the marning set ye down he broke off genially though elijah was already ensconced leg over knee jinnyll be home in a jiffy i wonder shes so long elijah began tentatively when shes got so little to do ay assented the ancient souring again tis me thats got the whole work o the place but gals likes to gad about in the summer what becomes o the old folks never troubles the young uns nowadays they might just as well be married ventured elijah boldly ay their husbands ud make em work said the gaffer his eye gleaming maliciously but oi dont howd with starvin em like farmer thoroughgood did his missus when they come to see her corpse they found her on a bed made out of a common sheephurdle ay and he used to plough his fields with a elijah groaning inwardly composed himself to hear the story again fortunately there was a fresh development at the finish one day twas a team o bullocks and a blind hoss he started droivin powerful warrum it warwuss than todayand the flies sow worritin that the bullocks set their tails up and bolted the poor blind hoss couldnt see where to goo and fell down the oxen couldnt drag him and got tangled up in the traces he roared with laughter at the picture and elijah grinned too those flies do worrit he agreed flicking at his forehead but about that jinny of yours he added shell onny have them harmless flypapers you see said daniel pointing to a coloured patch on the ceiling blackened by a happy multitude ef ye cant wait for her he added amiably oill give her your message a wet you said a veterinary surgeon mr elijah skindle said elijah grandly skindle the old man groped agitatedly in his memory thats a name oi know known all over the hundred said elijah complacently ay and theyre hearing of my success at colchester too where i come from cowchester the old man sprang up thats itthe man as married annie but that aint youhe had more hair to him perhaps it was my father said elijah flushing nay nay annie couldnt have a son your soize the gaffer pondered my mothers name is annie said elijah a strange fire crept into the old patriarchs eyes a bigboned mawther of a girl tall as the rod her father lit the lamps with long raven hair and eyes as black as sloes and a wunnerful fine buzzom he said with slow voluptuousness your mother aint like that no admitted elijah daniel quarles heaved a sigh oi thought not or youd be more of a beauty well youre wrong retorted elijah for ive heard that my grandfather did use to light the lamps in chipstone and its a great shame the way my brothers and sisters all dump her on me to keep the old man seized him suddenly by the coatlapels shes back in chipstone been back over two yearsever since father died hes dead elijah felt the hands trembling against his breast of courseand ive got her to keep though im the youngest he grumbled thats the same luck as oi had said the gaffer with this bit of property though sidrach hes the firstborn he dropped pensively back into his chair but oi count annies better off where she is bein as oive got jinny to keep and food gittin dearer every day she says something cruel and happen sidrachll come back too when hes old not havin landed property like me ne yet no relations in babylon never been sech a year since he went awaythe brad was all froze over elijah imprudently recollectedto the old mans annoyancethat it had frozen equally in queen victorias first winter and he brought up murphys coldest day the proverbial lucky hit of an almanackmaker fortunately the gaffer recalled an ancient jest of bundocks mother ganders ginbottles froze over and relaxed in genial hysterics ay shes conwerted now he said wiping his rheumy eyes but what an adulteress in them days ye couldnt get drunk at the black sheep ef ye triedbeer without hops and wine without gripes mechanically drawing out his pipe and popping it back in alarm elijah reverted to jinny daniel now blamed methusalem for her lateness horses too were lazy and ungrateful same as granddaughters why dont you get rid of him said elijah with a sudden inspiration that would cut her comb he thought jinny docked of methusalem would be ripe for the marriagealtar hes long past his work but daniel quarles shook his head jinny wouldnt like me to part with that besides whod buy him i would said elijah with a feeling of all for love or the world well lost you od rabbet what for id give you a fiver parried the knacker in his reckless passion though most people let me have em for the trouble of killing em he added incautiously the old man sprang up again git out o my house and dont ye dare cross my doorstep agen elijah cowered back in his seat but ive come on business he protested oi baint agooin to sell methusalem thats not what i came for elijah urged soothingly its about jinny oi baint agooin to sell jinny neither elijah winced was it divination or drivel he wondered you might as well sell her he said boldly look how shes mucking up your business muddling everything and rising and pulling out the pot again he banged it down on the table my jinny muddle things git out o my house before the gaffers blazing spectacles and furious fangs elijah backed doorwards not before its set right he said assured of his line of retreat the quarleses dont make muddles for a hundred year oh jinnys been all right the last hundred years he interrupted impatiently its the last few weeks i complain about i hope its not sunstroke my jinny the gaffers anger died she went away singin as merry as could be my little mavis he said anxiously then what do you make of that elijah indicated the pot the old man unwrapped it slowly and readjusting his spectacles spelt out the label olivers depildepil he stumbled on is that pills no its for the hair well thats what you want aint it he said navely mr skindle coloured up but this is to take off the hair he explained well you cant do that chuckled daniel bein more a lisha than a lijah oh yes i can said elijah his every dot bristling but if i hadnt been a noticing man i should have undone all the good of months of my pots of hairrestorer whichever way it be tis agen nature said the gaffer the lord giveth and the lord taketh away but pots be as like as peas thats the shopmans fault not jinnys oh indeed cried elijah savagely and what about her bringing me hairpins hairpins gasped the gaffer hairpins for a man without hair even samson in his prime didnt want hairpins elijah pointed out angrily but thats what she brought me a packet of last week instead of tobacco sarve ye right ye unswept chimbley the gaffer growled with a grin that aint serving me right riposted elijah thats serving me wrong he added with redoubled wit and wouldnt take em back neither the little minx maintained id ordered em for my ma well shed want hairpins wouldnt she with all that beautiful raven hair said the gaffer turning serious happen you ordered em for her i never order anything for her said elijah waiving the description of her chevelure more shame to you then young man ye dont desarve to have her same as yere too stingy to pay for the hairpins yed best give em to her with daniel quarless love im not stingy retorted elijah hotly would i be keeping my mother with the poorhouse so handy and me the youngest too if elijah skindle wasnt the most generous man in chipstone but i wont pay for jinnys woolgathering no wonder everybodys going to the coach the coach repeated daniel quarles what coach hasnt jinny told you cried elijah equally astonished the handsomest pair of black horses a funeral coach halfwhispered the gaffer paling the notion of slaughtering methusalem had already brought the thought of death unpleasantly near you and jinny may well call it so old sluggaby said elijah grimly the old man fell back into his chair nobody never needed no funeral coaches here he quavered our shoulders on the corpsepath was good enough for us twas onny that obstinacious little dap when poor pegs laid by the wall as wanted one whos talking of funeral coaches snapped mr skindle anyhow ive got to have that pot changed git out o my house repeated the ancient for the fourth time hurling the pot out of the window luckily it fell on grass elijahs patience was at an end besides it had now occurred to him he might cut off jinny on the route away from this tiresome nonagenarian the effort to woo her through him had been baffled by his inconsequence whos hankering after your wooden chairs ive got horsehair at home he retorted crushingly as he climbed into his trap he heard the bolts shot behind him but just as he was clucking off his horse the gaffers head popped frenziedly through the casement stop thief it cried stop you be careful what youre saying old cockalorum said elijah angrily lashing his horse with vicarious wrath and pick up that pot i shant pay for it youve stole my spectacles oi cant find em nowheres why youve got em on elijah called back contemptuously so eagerly did his horse respond to the whip and the homeward impulse that elijah had the satisfaction of passing the equally enthusiastic methusalem before he could pull up he was not even sure that this arrogantly gowned jinny had acknowledged his salute she would be at her door before he could turnconfound it why had he not waited another moment or started earlier and cut her off at a remoter point to face that old dodderer again would be an anticlimax iv so swiftly did daniel quarles nod again over his big bible that by the time jinny had got methusalem stabled she could not rouse him to undo the bolts and all her merry whistling as she neared the latch was a wasted pretence this protective habit of his indoors was a recent development coinciding curiously with the advent of the coach she was concealing from him and these closed doorseven his bedroom was now locked from withinannoyed and alarmed her she had visions of him agonizing in his bed and herself reduced to breaking open the door perhaps even now he was ill dying dead she dashed to the livingroom windowstumbling over a pot outside it ah thank god that dear peaceful grey head that sonorous snore pausing now to pick up the mysterious pot she was distressed again the passing of elijah was explained miss gentrys depilatory she had brought to mr skindle mr skindles hair restorer to miss gentry he had come to complain but unable to get admission he had flung the pot on the path oh plaguy similarity of potted pomadesfatal double errorshe had killed two clients with one stone her eyes filled with tears even with a notebook she could not keep straight so guilty did she look as she scrambled noiselessly through the casement that an observer would have thought her a burglar creeping past her grandfather she opened the housedoorthe gigantic key that used to hang on the beam was now always in the lockbrought in the carton with the weddingcake from the cart and placed it on the chest of drawers for unfailing reminder in the morning then swiftly changing into her old frock and hanging up the new behind a cornercurtain she donned her apron and stole into the kitchen finally to lay the table she must with loving hands uplift the venerable head the ancient had not slept off his perturbation though he did not remember the cause of it and seeing his supper still unlaid he was righteously wroth a muddler mucking up everythingthats what you be he said repeating unconsciously elijahs indictment and jinny remembering the pot that now stood by the weddingcake went about wanly unresentfully with movements lacking their wonted deftness her grandfather had already forgotten the suggestion of sunstroke much as it had shaken him for her actual pallor he had no eye when she finally brought in the meal she found him risen and standing tranced before the great weddingcake gazing dazedly at its elaborately frosted architecture you didnt want to open it she cried with irrepressible petulance as she hooked down the pasteboard lid he ignored the reproach weddins and funerals in one day he brooded pomps and wanities come to the table granfer she said more gently pomps and wanities he repeated whos this for its for farmer gales weddingtwas too late to deliver it come along in my day folks made their own weddincakes and dednt want no funeral coaches neither the churchpath or the farmwagon come along she took his arm theres no funeral coaches here a whining and scratching at the door made a welcome diversion nip back from the huntingpath sneaked in aware of sin with ears flat tail abased and sidelong squint aint seen that for days said the gaffer wheres that been i dont know she lied glad of nips guilty air for to explain would reveal the coach on the razzledazzle i suppose after supper she remembered a box must be put in the anteroom that had been left with her to be called for it was stupid not to have brought it in at once ere the cart had been put in its shedas stupid as her potswapping in a sudden fear that if unremoved tonight she would carry it off to farmer gales wedding just when the owner would be coming for it she asked her grandfather to lend a hand with it it was an unfortunate request for as the still sinewy veteran was dragging his end over the sill he said weirdly there aint no man in bradmarsh more lugsomen that who wants your newfangled coach what coach murmured jinny half puzzled half apprehensive the funeral coach he stood still where else ould a coffin goo rubbish granfer theres no funeral coach her little silvery voice rang out heave away my johnny come along granfer ive got to rub down methusalemyoull be too tired now no funeral coach he repeated slowly loosing the box youve been dreaming granfer but the two black horses her heart beat like a criminals on the eve of detection nightmares she laughed what did i say but he said who said annies buoyoy annies lijah he calls hisself elijah and did he go up in a chariot of fire with the horses and more than ever incensed against mr skindle she hastily started her carriers chanty there is hey there is ree automatically his sepulchral bass exuded and his arms reclasped the box there is hoo there is gee then together their antithetical voices rolled out joyously as the box moved forward but the bobtailed mare bears the bells away inwardly she was thinking that a funeral coach was just what it was did its bells not ring the knell of all the peaceful past yes it was the hearse of her past of her youth and somehowsomehowshe must readjust herself to the strange raw cruelty of the present v she resettled him before his bible but when she returned from the stable he had wandered again to the chest of drawers and was now holding up the pot and ye told me oi was dreamin he said angrily why did ye lie to me what do you mean granfer she said flushing how did that pot come here i brought it of course no you dednt annies goodfornawthen son brought it but i brought it in she persisted it was lying on the path ah oi mind me nowhe threw it at me the wretch said jinny believing him poor granfer she cried with selfreproach patting his hairy hand but its bedtime come along why did ye lie to me he repeated unappeased theres no funeral coach she persisted but even as she spoke the faint tooting of a horn was heard from afar nip idly gulping at flies pricked up his ears the ancient uttered a cry the coach the coach jinnys hand clutched his more tightly they could now hear the distant rattling and jinglingthe flynt flyer was incredibly coming their way along that grassgrown road what was it doing by that lonely common she wondered tremulously what customers were there to steal here did the pirate hanker even after uncle lilliwhyte youll lose your beauty sleep granfer she drew him towards the corkscrew staircase but he broke from her convulsively and hobbled out into the path and stood with hand at ear towards the advancing clatter to be seen staring at its meteoric passing would be too dreadful go in nip she cried with unwonted harshness are you coming granfer she said following the dog or shall i bolt you out must bolt up against thieves you know and she began singing cheerily there is hey there is ree nay tis the black hosses that bears the bells away curse em what should coaches be doing in these parts same as me i suppose she said with desperate lightness its only that young man who fancies himself adriving and ablowing a young man come to steal my business well one cant lock that up come in granfer oill lock him up whats the thiefs name hes not a thief its the young man from frog farm that whippersnapper come with a coach to drive over you and me thats just what hed try to do if we stand here come insidethe jackanipsll only think were envying his bonkka turnout the argument and the touch of idiom succeeded though she could feel his form shaking with passion as she drew him in why did ye keep it from me he asked pitifully because i knew youd get in a state as she shot the bolts the better to shut will out she realized that her beating heart was somehow left outside and that it was drawing her after it through doors howsoever barred and windows howsoever fastened if only to watch the pageant of his passing a funeral coach the ancient was mumbling you and jinny may well call it so ole sluggaby yes indeed we may granfer she said smiling for its his own funeral hes conducting hell soon come a cropper blast him growled the gaffer hush jinny was shocked its all as fair as fair for over a hundred year weve fetched and carried twixt bradmarsh and chipstone and now this scallywag with his newfangled black hosses a fit of coughing broke off the speech and he suddenly looked so much like the last stage of man in the spellingbook that jinny had to put him back into his chair didnt i say youd get into a state but you know theres more carrying than ithan we can manage havent you sent lots of our customers away curse em said the gaffer comprehensively warmin and oi told em sow to their head hes only got our leavings you see and she burst out in gay parody there is black both of black let em run till they crack tis methusalem bears the bells away but the bells were now jingling nearer and nearerjingling in victorious arrogance the old man started up again in his chair how dare caleb flynts lad set hisself up agen me dont granfer she pressed him down competition folks call it hes got to earn his living just like us nobody shant come competitioning here he broke from her again daniel shall be an adder what biteth the hoss heels he began unbolting the door youll never be able to bite his horse heels she urged they fly by like the wind she had a sick fear the old man would hurl himself at the bridles be dragged to death but to her astonishment ere he had lifted the latch she heard the horses slowing down the eight sounding hoofs the clanging swingletrees and harness the great roadgrinding equipage were actually coming to a halt at her porch whoa snowdrop easy there cherryblossom she knew the humour of these names of theirs as she knew from a hundred channels of gossip everything about their owner even to the identity of the blonde young female from foxearth farm who was so persistently a passenger so he had been forced to humiliate himself to make the first approachit was she who had after all been the conqueror who had held out the longer and in a swift flood of emotion she felt more than ever the injustice of her grandfathers standpoint will had not come competitioning it had all been unpremeditated the horses had been left on his hands by that harumscarum showman and anyhow was he not serving the countryside better than she with her ramshackle little cart but whatever the rights and the wrongs a scene between the two men must be prevented hes come to eat humble pie granfer she whispered but we dont see people after office hoursand its your bedtime oill show him whos who said the gaffer disregarding her but you cant do that like this she urged with the cunning of desperation put on your sunday smock ay ay oill larn him to come crakin and vauntin his face lit up with baleful satisfaction as he thought of the rare stitching in the gathers and patterns of that frock of fine linen as jinny relieved was sheepdogging him up to his room they heard the buttend of a whip beating at the housedoor daniel quarles takes his time young man the gaffer observed to the cobwebbed corkscrew staircase and to jinny when she shut his door on him he called back do ye dont forgit to put out the beer and two glasses vi that imperious buttend gave no time to change back to her own ostentatious costume but she did not pause even to tear off her flecked apron after all in face of his surrender she could forgo arrogance of appearance besides he would scarcely have time to notice anything so swiftly must she be rid of himhowever she might savour his surrenderbefore her grandfather could redescend upon him true the call for beer showed a relaxed tension but who could predict the effect of quaffing it upon two hottempered males ignoring the injunction she hurried to the housedoor good evening miss boldero she was a shade disconcerted by the formality but a great waft of the old friendship seemed to emanate from his frank eyes and the red hair his hatlifting uncovered she felt herself drawn to that flame like a poor little moth she wanted to fall upon his magnanimous morningjacket to sob away her sin of pride good evening mr flynt she murmured he was astonished at the sight of her and taken aback mentally he had shaken her off had ridden over her by force of will finding occupation and exhilaration in his new and prosperous adventure finding consolation too in the creamy beauty of the girl who shuttled with such suspicious frequency in the flynt flyer blanche suggested not only cream but butter so pliant and pattable did she seem so ready to take the impress of wills personality that was very restful after the intense irritativeness of the rival carrier for irritativeness still remained to him jinnys essenceeven in their alienation her hornblowing still jarred her pink muslin dress was a new provocation he was vexed at her jogtrot apathy when their vehicles passed an apathy that took the sting out of his speed he was piqued that she did not complain to any one of his competition that she took no steps of reprisal made no objection even to nips visits to him but the central irritation in all these fleeting glimpses and encounters had been her prettiness now seeing her close for the first time since their quarrel at the cattlemarket and without her being whisked away he had a shock why she was not pretty at all she was shabby and wan where was the sparkle that had haunted the depths of him the real jinny was it suddenly became patent a worn creature with shadows under her eyes and little lines on her forehead how could he ever have imagined her attractive why blanche was like a sultana beside her but if the thrill he had expected to feel was replaced by this dull disappointment another emotion did not fail to supervene it was pitypity not unmixed with compunction had it been so manly as he had thought to come interfering with her business violating the immemorial local tradition which assigned the carrying to a quarles wont you come in she was forced to say seeing him silent and petrified in the porch thank youive only brought this from miss gentry he answered in awkward negation he had come to jeer but now he held the pot of hair restorer apologetically jinny went from white to red it was the supreme humiliation not only had he not come to make it up he had come at the culminating moment of his triumphsent as a carrier to her and sent not merely with a parcel but with the proof of her blundering how kind of her she said taking it but neither her hand nor her voice was steady did she send any message with it not particularly he had meant to rub in miss gentrys denunciations of female stupidity to demand the other pot but his heart failed well thank her for her present said poor jinny struggling hard for composure and tell her ill be giving her something in return on my next round he suppressed a smile shamed from it by the pathos of her courage i guess she means it for your grandfather he said chivalrously perhaps she does jinny murmured she turned away to close the door on herself the beautiful black horses pawed the ground impatiently will shuffled and squirmed less gracefullythere seemed nothing to do but to go had he not refused to step inside but he had taken her at the end of his long round he had deposited all his passengers and packages and he felt loth to leave her thus a resolution was forming within himgenerating so rapidly in the warmth of compunction and renewed comradeship that possibly the germs of it had already taken root in his subconsciousness when nips label brought him her sneer at his lack of a guard its very hot he fenced lingering can i have a glass of water she started remembering the gaffers admonition oh wont you have a glass of beer no thanks just adams ale almost liquefied herself by feeling this son of adam needed hereven thus slightlyshe moved swiftly to and fro returning with the glass but not so swiftly that she had not smuggled olivers depilatory and the weddingcake into the kitchen in case he should yet come in he took the glass managing to touch her cold trembling fingers much obliged he said after a deep draught and this time it was her fingers that were drawn though less consciously to touch his round the returned glass then swallowing something harder than water ive been thinking about it all jinny and im sorry he blurted ha her heart leapt up again sorry for you he explained for me her face hardened iimean he corrected stammeringly sorry to hurt your business you havent hurt my business theres room for both its a fair competition its very forgiving of you to say so but i said id start a coachservice and i had to make my word good hadnt i a man cant say a thing and leave it empty air no in her new humility she was prepared to admire such solid manhood but thats no reason why we should be bad friends is it she had thought that it was now that attitude of hers seemed childishly foolish selfabasement kept her dumb no reason he repeated mistaking her silence for obstinacy why we shouldnt shake hands only this glass she flashed more happily but it shook in her hand ah he sighed with satisfaction the way to his proposition lay open he could broach it at once much better to pull together eh much she echoed how sweet to see the mists of folly and bitterness rolling away to feel the weight lifting from her heart impulsively she held out her left hand and as he clasped it the warmth that came to him from its cold firmness somewhat shook his sense of blanches surpassing charm charm in fact seemedto his bewildermentto be independent of beauty or was it that what radiated from jinnys little hand was a sense of capable comradeship missing from that large limp palm which received but did not give well but comradeship was what he wanted what he was now going to propose and if charm was thrown in so much the better for the partnership aha son of belial so yeve come to bog and vaunt your horn here it was her forgotten grandfather startled from her daydream she dropped the glass and it shivered to fragments in the dusk daniel quarles wizened though he was loomed prophetic over them in snowy beard and smock his forehead gloomed with thunder and his ancient beaver vii will drew out his white handkerchief and tying it on his whip waved it humorously the old man was disconcerted in his biblical vein this be a rummy un jinny is he off his head no granferthats a flag of truce a signal hes got something friendly to say the gaffer turned on her then why dont ye arx him inside like a christian stead o breakin my glasses thank you mr quarles said will swiftly he lowered the flag and almost rushed across the threshold jinny retreated before him and the trio passed silently through the ticking antechamber why dont ye loight the lamp the gaffer grumbled jinny gratefully flew to hide her perturbation in the kitchen true she would only be throwing more light upon it but the breathingspace was welcome hadnt you better have a look at my coach before it gets darker will was reminded to say curse your coach he had reawakened the prophet easy there said will untying his handkerchief its to be a family coach now you see family coach repeated daniel puzzled jinny fumbling at the lamp with butterfingers was glad it had not yet illumined her blushes for mingled with the rapturous tumult at her heart was a shrinking sense of impending publicity of ethereal emotions too swiftly and masterfully translated into gross commitments how had her mere passive acquiescence in a better relationship warranted wills larger assumptions well thats what itll be if you accept my proposition wont it she heard will say set ye down set ye down said daniel whats your proposition jinny whyre you lazying with that lamp in a moment granfer she brought it in its fat globe shedding a rosy glow over the dingy wallpaper the squat chairs and the china shepherdesses but for herself she had no need of it everything seemed to her transfigured steeped in a heavenly light wheres that beer the ancient roared its absence illumined she was glad to escape into the kitchen with her jug will moved towards the front door you come and see the coach mr quarles he persisted before its too dark dang your coach but the imprecation was mild and the ancient shuffled to the door and surveyed the imposing equipage complete from box to boot with its glossy sable steeds will swelling with renewed pride and mentally comparing it with the canvasrotted lumbering little carriers cart and the aged animal on its last legs awaited with complacency the rapturous exclamations of the old connoisseur but they did not come ay quite soizable not such a bad coach rayther topheavy wheres the leaders you dont want more than two horses on these roads aint there plenty o pairhorse coaches besides it dont set up for a coach exactly im a carrier mainly the old man winced at the word youve called her the flynt flyer he said peering at the painted legend and fly she does said will recovering his complacency theres life and spirit for you he added as the horses pawed and tossed their heads more like an adder biting their heels said daniel balefully but oi thought oi heerd they was black will was outraged the devil himself couldnt be blacker daniel shook his head mudcolour oi should call the offside hoss well theres black mud aint there nearside hoss seems wheezy daniel said sympathetically as it snorted with impatience wheezy cherryblossom why he could run ten miles more without turning a hair why hes sweatin like one oclock so am i will wiped his forehead furiously but thats only the weather hosses dont want to sweat when theres nowt to carry for a moment will was knocked breathless recovering he smiled complacently why its all delivered and it was a deliverance a terrible load phew nothing to ours lord what a mort o custom look at that whopping box weve just carried in he pointed to the anteroom and all they other boxes he added with an inspiration staring at the lumber of his deceased and scattered family oh i know will conceded graciously that there are folks that stick to jinnyi mean to youfor old sakes sake ay and youre hankerin arter our hundred years connexion eh said will dazed he stole a reassuring glance at his magnificent turnout oi could see what ye were droivin at with your friendly proposition want us to take you into pardnership will slapped his knee well im danged daniel chuckled fatuously ho ho guessed it did oi ye cant keep much from daniel quarles and in high good humour he laid his hand on the young mans shoulder and moved him back into the house they found jinny who had just deposited the beerjug on the table flitting up the stairs where ye gooin jinny the gaffer called after her youve got things to talk over she called back it aint secrets he crowed dont run away will added youre the person most concerned but his blushing rival had disappeared it was all too unnerving especially when the cracked mirror aided by the fat lamp showed her what a shabby unkempt figure was setting out the beerglasses on the tigerpainted tray as she could not change into her grand gown under the invaders eye she was furtively carrying it up to her grandfathers bedroom viii set ye down repeated the gaffer have a glass o beer no thank you ive had water and the glass too the old man chuckled that aint much of a chate have a shiver o cake will did not like to refuse the slice till the gaffer after looking round with growing grumpiness brought in the great weddingcake from the kitchen naked of its carton muddlin things away he was murmuring as he posed it pompously on the table whence its highbuilt glory of frosted sugar shed a festal air over the room no thank you cried will hastily divining a mistakeon the gaffers part if not on jinnys he guessed farmer gale was concerned with it for the whole countryside was agog with the meanness of a wedding that did not include a labourers supper nay even a holiday for them the old man glared breadknife in hand it would give me stomachache will apologized the confession arrested the ancient never had gullion in my life he bragged laying down the breadknife but you young folks its like this said will taking advantage of this better mood theres not enough business to keep both of us going suppose i buy you out buy me out the prophet of wrath resurged his arm shot out for the breadknife pointing it door ward git out o my house for a hundred year will got angry if i do get out it will be a hundred years before i come back however he said forcing a smile lets put it another way jinny shall come and help my business jinnyll never give up methusalem well methusalemll give up jinny before very longhe cant last for ever and she can keep him for sundaysyes thatll be a good idea she can drive to chapel with him not being a business animal and then shed be clear of successors to farmer gale a sidethought added but oi thought twas me you had a proposition for said the gaffer testily will hastily readjusted his tactics of course of course its really lumping our businesses instead of competing dont you see well dednt oi say twas a pardnership you was arter quite right only well give poor old methusalem a retiring pension he he croaked the gaffer he added honestly but oi dont droive much meself nowadays tis onny the connexion yed be getting and the adwice and counsel just what i want said will enthusiastically and im willing to share and share alike snacks snacks its not a bad notion admitted the ancient its a ripping notion arter all as you say theres no reason we should come into colloosion he dropped the knife back on the table and looked out of the still open window ay its a grand coach he gurgled the talk of the countrysideonly needs a turnpike road to beat the train said will expanding afresh snowdrop and cherryblossom i call these horses for funbecause theyre so black you see ay black as the devil and hark at em pawintheres fire and sperrit for you thats as foine a coach as ever oi took up from itll not look amiss with quarles painted stead o flynt i beg your pardon said will quickly flynt must remain the flynt flyeryou cant alter that why cant you you cant say the quarles flyerthe quarles creeper runs better off the tongue the flynt flyerthat goes together but its you and mes got to goo together retorted the obstinate old man anyways it must be the quarles and flynt flyer thats too long besides the flynt flyers become a trademarkknown everywhere and what about daniel quarles carrier thats a better known trademark well paint that will shook his head i cant do that but ill paint flynt and quarles carriers underneath the name of the coach and thats the limit daniel quarles was always a peaceable man quarles and flynt breathed the gaffer beatifically no flynt and quarles will corrected flynt must go first why must dont f come before q folks would think we didnt know our a b c it would be more scholardy daniel admitted will proffered a conclusive hand then its a bargain but daniel let the hand hover oi dont droive much meself nowadays he repeated with anxious honesty we dont expect it of the head of the firm said will grandly theres substitutes and subordinates but his hand drooped with a sense of bathos ay said the old man swelling subordinators and granddarters he fished for the hand oughtnt we to let em know will insinuated oi allus liked young flynt your father answered the gaffer squeezing his fingers heartily and there warnt much amiss with your mother a forthright family aldoe peculiar jinny droives asundays to chapel with the buoyoys at which sudden failureor rather resurgenceof memory will felt more urgently than ever the need of getting jinnys consent rather than the nonagenarians youre mighty lucky he said craftily to have a granddaughter so spry i reckon wed better have her down and tell her ay that oi be replied the gaffer tis heartenin to hear her singin up and down the house indeed a little silvery trill was reaching them now to will it recalled more than one moment of mockery but he felt nothing provocative in this song except its parade of happiness it seemed to fling back his compassion to be ominous of a refusal of his proposition perhaps on second thoughts it might be better to leave the old man to present her with a finished fact well i must be getting home he said glad thats settled daniel clutched the knife again and well cut the cake upon it no no mistake or no mistake it seemed sacrilegious to slice into this quasiecclesiastical magnificence but its a bargain jinny shall cut it jinny he called up just coming granfer thats too grand for a bargain will remonstrated would almost do for a wedding he added with sly malice well aint this for a pardnership the old man cackled he moved to the door and stood looking out on the horses steady my beauties he said proprietorially he shuffled to them and rubbed a voluptuous hand along the satiny sheen of their skins flynt and quarles he murmured will had taken the opportunity to escape from the house he now prepared to light his lamps bats were swooping and darting weaving their weird patterns but the air was still uncooled yere not agooin afore the cakes cut the gaffer protested id best not see jinnyshe might only fly at me rubbidge when weve made it up but im late and i shouldnt wonder if theres a thunderstorm wont take half a jiffy he dashed into the house and seized the knife will was only in time to arrest his uplifted arm and jinny descending on the tableau had a tragicomic sense of rushing betwixt a murderer and her lover what are you doing granfer she gasped he surrendered the breadknife blinkingly to her and will released his arm struck breathless by the change in jinny not only were apron and shabby gown replaced by the gentry masterpiece not only was her hair combed and braided in a style he had never seen but the face which reduced all these fripperies to insignificance seemed years younger and fresher the little lines were gone from the forehead the hard defiance from the eyes and the wanness from the cheeks the whole face was mantled with a soft light how shrewd he had been to suggest this partnership he thought with a pleasant glow forgetting its origin in pity for assuredly this softly radiant person made no call on that emotion the old man was equally astonished why jinny yere as smart as a carrot he cried navely bless ye he kissed her fondly willie wants to goo into pardnershipquarles and flynt the young people looked at each other both as carrots in hue well willie wheres your tongue tell her how weve settled it he can tell me on sunday said jinny not utterly unresentful of their masculine methods on sunday the gaffer gasped after chapel jinny explained oi wont have no such talk asundays its got to be now goo ahead buoyoy oh granfer jinny pleaded cant you go and light wills lamps ye want to upset it all behind my back he said with a cunning air no i dont ye cant diddle daniel quarles its a fustrate proposition and dont ye dare say noa but granfer jinny hung her head you might understand oi understand better nor you look at that coach nowa grand coachquarles and flynt never mind the coachlight the lamps jinny cried paradoxically daniel moved out reluctantly its a hansum proposition jinny he said wheres your tinderbox willie heres matches said will he looked uneasy her grandfather seemed to be irritating the girlit boded ill for his proposition dont be afeared willie she wont fly at ye now easy my beauties steady snowdrop ix you dont mind my clearing up said jinny pouncing upon farmer gales imperilled cake not if you dont fly at me will quoted with a nervous facetiousness jinny smiled with equal nervousness oh i wont fly at younor jump at you neither will flinched had he not felt committed to her grandfather he would have shrunk from the rebuff now menacing his proposition indeed he was not quite clear as to how he could really amalgamate the two concerns the notion of a girl guard which had first flashed upon him as an inspiration was now felt to be beset by obstacles true the operations of blowing such a long horn taking so many fares booking so many parcels and locking and unlocking the boots were a serious discount from the pleasures of driving and a person familiar with the minuti of carrying and a readyreckoner incarnate and so agreeably incarnate might well seem providential but would the unfitness of so unconventional an occupation be glossed over by the existing acceptance of her in that line of business and would his overlordship be a protection or an added scandal still he was in for it now unless she refused the postwhich he hoped she would not for after all at the worst with all these new circuits of his he might still leave to her her little pottering round counting it as a branch of the new flynt and quarles business he would still have won the monopoly of the local carrying and without the weight on his conscience of starving her out i know youve got a deal of pride and all that he began diffidently but youll bear in mind your grandfathers tickled with the notion its hardly granfers business jinny murmured blushing oh i quite understand that of course its your business really didnt i ask you not to run away i didnt mean to reckon it settled unless you said yes i should hope not said jinny with a spirit that banished the blush she carried the cake back to the top of the chest of drawers of course its silly our going on separate dont you think so i havent thought she took up the beerjug to remove it well i haveive thought a good dealthats why i figured that with you as my partnerno not for me thank you for jinny was mechanically filling a glass flushing afresh she poured the beer back but whos to look after granfer she said her eyes averted how can i leave him ive thought of thatnaturally when youre so much with me you cant be much with him but you see therell be plenty of dollars to share outmoney i meanand wed be able to get in a woman to take care of him to get in a woman so he was prepared to let poor old granfer live with them o exquisite incredible magnanimity it solved all difficulties in a flash and what about methusalem she asked expectant of a similarly sublime solution poor old methusalem he laughed wont he like going to grass well if hes so very keen suppose he trots around once a week on his own little affairshairrestorers and the like even the little dart failed to pierce she was overwhelmed by this culminating magnanimity this was indeed surrender so she was not ignorant of horses so her work had not been improper she smiled responsively but her voice shook you mean i can carry on under the flynt flag of course you wouldnt really mind alls grist that comes to the mill besides it would leave me free to branch out to totfield major and perhaps even colchester tuesdays say if you like but she did not like her conception of a wifes dignity boggled at the notion of driving around as before unmaidenly it was nothe had handsomely admitted itbut unwifely it assuredly was a wifes place she felt instinctively was the home she shook her head i dont think i ought to drive methusalem any more he gasped well you wouldnt expect to handle a pair of horses would you if he meant she could not jinny was not so sure but why argue so irrelevant a point no of course not she murmured obediently i mean methusalem will like going out to grass he breathed freely again the path to his project was clear at last but as a sort of guard now he ventured with an indulgent air jinny beamed at so facetious a picture she saw herself in red with big buttons and shorn hair so im to blow your horn for you after all sureonce youve paid up the gloves she laughed merrily even miss gentrys bill was a dissipated nightmare now but where shall i get the money she joked for the pleasure of his reply oh youll take all the money he instructed her seriously ill have to allow you some though she pointed out gaily half he explained we divide the takings equallythats my proposition snacks oh thats much too much she protested as seriously the apparent admission pleased him but increased his sense of magnanimity share and share alike he repeated magnificently but you dont want to spend half the takings jinny persisted how could i manage on a half why youll have much more than you ever had jinny was mystified but therell be the house to keep up andand she paused with shy flaming cheeks will was getting a bit puzzled too and your grandfather but ive already offered to pay for him and his minder tooout of the joint takings i mean surely half and half is the most you can expect but it showed once more how little our jinny had really been changed from earlyvictorian womanhood by her exceptional experiences that so unconventional a system of joint housekeeping made no appeal to her a quarter is the most you can expect she retorted what will was even more revolted by her ingratitude than by her impudence when you only bring in your wretched little cart and i sank all my capital in the coach your capital jinny repeated blankly you know what i had to pay for the horses it was an unfortunate memory to stir up and it helped a flood of raw light to burst upon her youre not really proposing i should be your guard she asked in a changed voice yes i am he reassured her for money she breathed incredulously of course you dont suppose i ask it for love business is jinny turned on him like a tigressanger was the only thing that could drown this dreadful sense of shame how dare you she cried how dare you ask me to work for you for money will winced before her passion you promised not to fly at me he reminded her glumly i didnt think youd suggest that and whats wrong in suggesting a partnership a partnership she sneered do you suppose im going to pull you out of the mud wills blood was up in its turn you pull me what else you find yourself stuck and you come to me to save your funeral coach funeral coach thats what granfer calls it and you will find yourself carrying corpses if you go on cooping up your passengers in this weather your silly concern hasnt got a tilt to take off but at least you might put the luggage inside and the livestock on top oh dont be frightened i wont charge for my advice but you being young and raw here stow that will banged the floor with his whip then you refuse my offer offer i call it a petition me petitioning his breath failed it wasnt me that came with a flag of truce he snorted youll come one day with a cry for mercy me youll never see me at frog farm id rather go to the poorhouseto see you i mean will set his teeth very well thenmy conscience is clear i did think i might have been hard on you but now now she echoed mockingly i shall crush you she laughed tauntingly pride goes before a fall i shall crush you without pity you young rapscallion it was the gaffer hobbling back having lit the coachlamps he had lingered in voluptuous contemplation of what they illumined but the noise of high words had reached him and now with the astonishing muscularity that still lingered in his shrunken frame the ancient seized the whip and wrenched it from wills grasp jinny flew between them fearing he would strike as he stood there in prophetic fury palpitating in his every limb her earlier intervention though against a knife had been comic here was tragedy she felt you crush my jinny why oill snap ye in two like this whip and he hurled the pieces of the stock at wills feet nip leapt for the buttend and brought it back in his mouth with highwagging tall demanding another throw he broke the tension of foolish mortality dont excite yourself granfer said jinny leading him to his chair ill cut him out before hes a month older will guffawed i offered her a fair chance mr quarles he said taking the butt from nips mouth you yourself said it was a handsome offer we dont want your offers ye pirate thief nor your chances neither yeve only got our crumbles oive sent a mort o customers to hell and you can goo with em as you please will picked up the whipend quietly but the old volcano was still rumbling you crush my jinnyyou with your flags and rags why all bradmarsh ould give ye rough music yed be tinkettled very well only dont say i didnt give you a fair and friendly chance dont blame me if you come to want bread bread the old man sprang towards the chest of drawers and this time the cake was stabbed to the heart have a shiver he cried magnificently holding up a regal hunk on the knifepoint even will was taken aback by this deed of derringdo better save it up he said sullenly save it repeated daniel hysterically nip was already on his hind legs begging for itwith a superb gesture the prodigal grandfather threw it at the tireless mouth never you darken my doorstep again he cried to will will cracked his bit of whip with a scornful laugh before you see me in this house again youll have to carry me in carry him in dye hear that nip the ancient chuckled contemptuously thats a good un carry me in repeated will fiercely and holding up his hand so help me god he cried spare your swearings buoyoy said daniel grimly throwing the plaintive nip another pile of sugary splendour ye ont never cross this threshold agen save on your hands and knees and sending his knife quivering into the floor he brought down his hand on his bible on your hands and knees he repeated solemnly will turned and strode out stiffly he looked almost tall a moment later they heard the clatter and jingle of the great equipage moving forwards and the jubilant winding of the long horn chapter x horse groom and bride then lay my tottring legs so low that have run very far oer hedges and oer ditches oer turnpike gate and bar poor old horse poor old horse somerset song i normally the nonagenarian preserved scant memory of the happenings of the present vivid though his youthful recollections were but the great weddingcake served up at every meal for days cooperated with the intensity of the scene to stamp his quarrel with will upon his feebly registering brain especially did nips standing supplication for his quota revive and deepen the impression on your hands and knees he would cry savagely as he threw the lucky dog a luscious morsel and even when nip was absent at mealtimesas his mistress contrived more than once in her anxiety to pamper neither him nor her grandfathers resentmentthe old man would growl grimly carry him in aching enough at heart from her own quarrel with will she had the wretched feeling that if by some impossibility she and her rival could ever again come together the grotesque oaths of these two obstinate males would keep the family breach unhealed but sentiment cannot retain its acuteness under business worries and carking household cares the rich cake eaten through so monotonously became to jinny a sort of ironic symbol of the declining fortunes of blackwater hall it contributed indeed no little to the decay of the old business not merely by the great sum that had to be paid to the confectioner but through the loss of the considerable customer whose hymeneal festivities its absence overgloomed marie antoinettes advice to the starving to eat cake did not come into the spellingbook otherwise jinny might have reflected how near they were come to adopting it not that her grandfather had as yet occasion to suspect the bareness of the larder unlike mother hubbard he never went to the cupboard the cupboard always comfortably coming to him moreover some rabbits shot by the farmers as the falling crops uncovered them and presented to the ancient by annual custom served to postpone the evil day jinny was hardly conscious how much she stinted herself for his sake so poor was her appetite become it was only oncewhen passing the big harvest dinner barn where farmer gales men roared drunken chorusesthat she felt a craving for food this valuable freedom from hunger she attributed to the heat in the winter she told herself she could always stoke for the week at the tuesday and friday meals so amiably provided at mother ganders that worthy lady would also doubtless refill grandfathers beerbarrel at cost price it was fortunate he did not smoke or snuff methodism had its points a more serious problem was presented by methusalemgrowing distended by overmuch grassand even her goats coveted an occasional supplement to the hedgerows and the oak scrub if their milk was to run freely but of hay or cabbages her store was small and these finicking feeders though they condescended to eat horsechestnuts would not even accept a gnawed apple the poultry too must soon be eaten if they could not be properly fed and the thought of instructing her grandfather to twist a familiar neck made her blood run cold with such a varied household to cater for our little housekeeper began to envy maria who according to mrs flynt raised her large and frequent families on everything and anything on earth rhubarbleaves being the one and only pabulum pigs turned up their snouts at it was not the least painful part of this novel pinch of poverty that jinny felt herself compelled to forgo those calls with little presents for the pennymoles the bidlakes and the poor and the bedridden in general with which she had diversified her deliveries she did not realize that her mere presence would have been a creature comfort but of these pangs and problems the world knew naught hearing her little horn making its gay music and seeing her still jauntily perched on her drivingboard in her elegant rosepink frock and with the latest fancy whipcord edge to the straw of her bonnet her music indeed was far livelier than the wheezy notes of the flynt flyers guard though otherwise the redcoated clodhopper who had been stuck up on the coach a few days after its visit to blackwater hall lent the last touch to its fascinations but if passengers other than elijah skindle and one or two equally unbusinesslike young men were no longer content to crawl along in her cart that historic vehicle showed scant sign of defeat already when the removal of the hoops in the hot weather had threatened to expose too clearly the nakedness of the land parcels of stones on the model of the swainchaser had begun to cumber it up and when one monday morning the flynt flyer came swaggering in new peagreen paint the quarles crawler turned up on tuesday mountainous with the old boxes and cypress clotheschests routed out of the anteroom and emptied of their litter it was at this point that the gaffer had had to be put into the plot he had long since begun to smell a rathaving a supersense for his business however his other senses might failand it would have been impossible to heave up the boxes without him or to explain their removal without imparting some notion of the tragic truth and the truth did not diminish his resentment against young calebs boy or his vigilance against further robbers carry him in he would cackle and croak as he bore out the emptied sprucehutches to the cart or carefully permutated their positions in it then with hoarse thunder on your hands and knees ye pirate thief but these ostentated boxeswhile they saved the pride of the quarlesesdid but damage the remainder of their custom the faithful few had been held back by solicitude for jinnys livelihood seeing her now so flourishing the very tailboard lowered on its chains and groaning under protruding portmantles her last clients save peculiars lapsed in silent relief one after another daily poor jinny expected to see four horses on the rival vehicle and its circuit extended to colchester but that would have meant for will a grandeur inconsistent with the petty commissions which he still deigned to execute it would have allowed some of her old custom to return to her and he was sullenly bent on driving herliterallyout of the business but he enhanced the dignity of his profession by copying from an old inn of the packhorse days its signboard of the carriers arms depicting a rope a wantyhook and five packing skewers these painted in black on the peagreen seemed to proclaim his formal annexation and monopoly of the local carrying trade jinny began to think seriously of buying up from the barns some straw from the reaped sheaves and competing with the cottagers in the allpervasive plaiting industry splitting straws was no despicable occupation in the valley of the brad where it was done by enginery and provided even children of six and old men of eighty with the opportunity of adding to the family income tambourlace and other things also entered into her thoughts the only thing that never entered into them was the idea of ceasing to ply so long as the boxes and the cart held together the flynt flyer should always see the rival vehicle imperturbably jogging in every sense she would carry on ii august was ending aridly methusalems sensitive nose was protected from flies by green bracken calves snuggled in the hot meadows meditatively chewing an image of somnolence their tails flicking whitely stooks or manureheaps had reduced the fields to geometrical patterns tall hollyhocks leaned dustily like ruined towers bucolic conversation was of the absent rain rooks were more destructive than ever swedes were doing badly and every one had waited to sow turnips rape or mustard they had no fodder even for winter stock master peartree began to worry over his sheep as they munched the sapless grass in the waterless little villages the ground was hard as iron and bundock strode over the swamps around frog farm as fearlessly as now frequently a regular doucher was the general demand upon providence though it was couchedfor church and chapelin less vivid terms these prayers enabled bundock to work off one of his old aphorisms saved for a rainless day its no use praying for rain he chuckled to the countryside till you see the stormclouds but you dont scarce need to pray then the countryside pointed out to his disgust in jinnys soul too there was drought and she seemed to share bundocks view that prayer was waste of breath not that her evening prayers were left unsaid but in her apathy and weariness no private plea was added to the prescribed form though the spellingbook commended the asking for extra mercies provided also one begged for a perpetual continuance of the protestant succession what deliverance could there be for her god himself she felt obscurely could not help her any more than she had ever been able to help little mavises fallen from their nests and deserted by their mothers their thrillingeyed vitality and exquisite flutterings had only made her miserable but perhaps god was now as sorry for her one grownup mavis too she remembered a victim to the winter battle of life the neck half severed from the halfplucked body the liquid eye gazing appealingly at her the legs stirring feebly in a welter of feathers she had nerved herself to grant its dumb plea she had stamped sharply on its skull and seen its eye fly out on the path like a bright bead could god do aught less drastic for her not that she ever dreamed of dying she must live on however mutilated for it was impossible to conceive her grandfather getting along without her consider only his trousers how loosely they were now flapping round his shrunken calves almost like a sailors soon the winter winds would be piping through them without her to take in a tuck where would he be and who would cut his hair and trim his beard it was her grandfather who was mainly responsible for the discontinuance of her chapel habit on lords day his increased fretfulness and fractiousness since he was become aware of the rival power made it imprudent to leave him for long except unavoidablynot to mention the danger to herself of awkward meetings at chapel with that rival powerand there was the further difficulty of getting to chipstone now farmer gales trap was out of the question but she was not without a nearer place of worshipfor to the scandal of the peculiars particularly bundock she now began to attend the parish church of little bradmarsh whose emptiness with its parade of free seats after eleven oclock was a standing pleasantry in the spheres of dissent the convenience of proximity was not however its main attraction for jinny and miss gentry would have rejoiced less had she understood that a change of heart or doctrine or the magnetism of the reverend mr fallow had as little to do with jinnys apparent conversion though the fact that jinny had never forgotten her one childish glimpse of the prayerabsorbed pastor doubtless served to reassure the girl as to the not altogether ungodly character of his edifice she had entered to cart over to the chipstone hospital some fruit laid before the altar at the harvest thanksgiving by the one prosperous worshipper for mr fallow was still an unwavering client of hers almost the last outside her own communion possibly because having neither family nor flock to distract him from his classics he had scarcely observed the coach in the speculi britanni pars in which he had once hunted out her genealogyto his own satisfaction and nobodys hurtessex was compared to palestine for its flow of milke and hunny and hunny was still her staple link with the tall fustycoated snuffsmeared figure stooping over his hives or his virgil both sacredly fused for him in the fourth georgic she marketed his surplus exchanging it for firkins of butter ando aberrations of the godliestcanisters of lundy foot and it was after disposing of some of his smaller tithesfor the parish had remained outside the recent commutation act of that jinny had been thus led to set foot in his church there were in those days no floral decorations to mar the completeness with which the arches and pillars ministered to her troubled mood the outside she had always found soothing with its grey old stonework and its lichened tower rising amid haystacks and thatched cottages with dormer windows but how much cooler the peace that fell upon her when she passed through the old spiky oak door and under the long wooden vaulted roof into a dimness shot with rich stained glass mr fallow had been one of the earliest clergymen of the century to remove the whitewash from the old painted walls of his church and though the royal armsthe lion and the unicornstill lingered over the chancel there was no other jar in the spiritual harmony except the stove whose pipe went hideously up and along the ceiling ignoring that however in the effect of the whole and forgetting everything else jinny sank upon a pewbench and abandoned herself to the unholy influences of architecture so restful after her chapel with its benches and tabledesk ugliness unadorned not even a gradual consciousness of neglected duty could impair the divine tranquillity but the sober beauty of the place might not have sufficed to draw her again but for a strange circumstance one of the stainedglass figures dully familiar to her from without as a leaden glaze proved when seen from within in all the glory of art to be an angel of the very type under which her childish vision had imagined her hovering mother and that it actually was mystically interfused with her mother as her emotion had immediately intertwined it was demonstrated by the fact that even when she at last went forward to gather up the plums and apples the eyes followed her about in protection and benediction miss gentrys legend of her moving angel lost its last shade of improbability and it was with a new humility that jinny repeated to her at the first opportunity her remorse for the permuted pot nor did the angels emanation of guardianship prove illusory for outraged though miss gentry had been by the suggestion that her moustache needed a hairrestorer she graciously intimatedafter the second sunday of jinnys attendancethat the debt for the dress could be worked off in commission charges it was a vast relief for the bundockborne rumour of her apostacy had alienated the bulk of her coreligionists and exchanged the lingering remorse of earlier deserters for a sense of rectitude and foresight bundocks sympathy with the brotherhood almost reinstated him in its good graces but it brings its own punishment he pointed out consolingly fancy putting a parson over herself to poke his snuffy nose into everything thats a pretty dress jinny hell say is it paid for or thats a cranky old grandpa youve gotwhy dont ye put him in the poorhouse it was as well poor jinny did not overhear him or she might have doubted whether her load of boxes was so uniformly imposing as she imagined the deacon who did hear him and who spent his life poking into holes and reprimanding sinners was even more righteously indignant at the interference of parsons inquisitive as warmin in a larder he described them fussing around the poor but without a drop of rum in their milk of human koindness mr fallowit would appearhad interfered on behalf of his parishioner in the threatened lawsuit with miss gentry he had persuaded the guileless ratcatcher to promise to clear her cottage for nothing and this although mrs mott was paying her in full for his wifes silk dress the responsibility for which he had righteously repudiated oill clear her cottage he added darkly and it seemed to bundock that the parson had succeeded only in patching up the feud but what was to be expected of the canting crew the postman inquired the new chipstone curate had called on his father and bundock related with a chuckle how the bedridden old boy had patronizingly regretted that being on his back he could do nothing to help his visitor he sent him away with a bedflea in his ear gloated bundock mr joshua mawhood recalled a bigger flea in the same clerical ear the hapless curate had offered him a ticket for a lecture on economy come with me bradmarsh way the ratcatcher had retorted and oill show you mrs pennymoles cottage and if youll show me how she can bring up her nine childer on eleven shillings a week oill eat your shovelhat bundock unable to find a still larger flea fell back on hypothesis if id been a churchman and a chap in a white choker came to mine he said id tell him to mind his own business and i dare say hed be insulted though id be giving him splendid advice you know where the door is id say for you didnt come in by the chimney now walk out or else and carried away by his own drama bundock administered a hearty kick to the apparently stilllingering phantom needless to say mr fallow exercised none of this imagined prying into jinnys affairs like his pewopener whose long caped coat with the official red border found now a fresh justification he was only too glad of her uninvited attendance and the considerable accretion she brought to his congregation her presence freshened up for himself his old sermons for her sake he even put in new latin quotations but jinny enjoyed more the three musicians in the gallerycellist flautist and bassoonistwhose black frockcoats and trousers made them as important in quality as they were in quantity and when after they had played a few bars the congregation sang awake my soul and with the sun thy daily stage of duty run jinny felt herself rapt far indeed from her daily stage of duty even the pewopener shuffling about in his list slippers to poke up the stove or a small boy or to snuff the guttering tallow candles on dark mornings could not bring her to earth and another factor than the church and its motherangel helped jinny over this dreary time this was her dog for only now did nip emerge into his full caninity or at least only now did jinny learn to appreciate him to the full in howsoever leaden a mood she started her carrying work nips ecstasy soon tinged it with gold his blissful staccato barks his tall inflated tail his upleapings at her as she harnessed methusalem his gallopings and gambollings round that stolider fellowquadruped his crazy friskings and curvetingswho could resist such joy of life often it seemed to jinny that he was returning thanks to his maker for the sunshine or the good smells rebuking unconsciously her heartheaviness bidding her cry no more over spilt milk but just lap up what she could cheer up jinny she heard him bark men are brutes and women fools and granfers grumpy and customers cruel but life is jolly and odours numerous and where theres a way theres a will and infected by these sentiments of his she would crack her whip and methusalem would prick up his ears and pretend for her sake to go faster and there would be a lull in the ache at her heart nip however was less consoling when the rival carriers met on the road then his invincible persuasion that the two were one brought jinny considerable discomfort for will persisted in his later tactics of slowing down whether to take stock of her appearance or to rub in the odious comparison of their respective equipages so that while these were in proximity nip was able to feel himself shepherding them and he ran from one to the other rounding them up even when jinny manuvred off down the first byway nip not to be baulked would travel between one and the other growing more and more desperate as they grew more and more distant till at last fearful of losing both he exchanged his frenzied shuttling between them for a still more frenzied standstill midway between the mutually receding vehiclesyou saw him almost literally torn in two finally after plaintive ululations of protest he would trot back with hangdog look and drooping tail to the shabby cart where his mistress throned grim and pale amid her manifold mock parcels iii but it was neither mr fallows sermons nor nips that gave jinny her first real sense of religion not even the bassviol and flute though she heard them with ecstasy nor the collects and litanies though she perused them with interest it came to her one pitchblack night when she had too confidently ventured out to bring first aida jug of real tea with some bread and butterto poor rheumatic uncle lilliwhyte whom earlier that day while gathering mushrooms for supper she had discovered in a deserted charcoalburners hut she had not known before that farmer gale had carried out his threat of evicting the nondescript from his cottage on the plea of needing it for a labourer and although she had been compelled to suspend the ministrations which had set mr fallow looking for the lady bountiful in her blood she felt vaguely responsible for uncle lilliwhytes declined fortunes so parallel to her own would in fact the cornishman have turned him out if jinny had allowed that allpowerful arm to remain round her waist at the cattlemarket nay could she not have cheered and nourished a subject countryside the unsavoury ancient was lying on some coarse sacking in a clearing still half charred literally sackcloth and ashes jinny thought as she groped her way along the glade by the twinkle of his candle through the chinks of his ramshackle hut an old flintlock some snares nets and rods and a cookingpot seemed all its furniture she was horrified to thinkas she gazed at the gaps in the roofthat the prayer for rain might be granted but to her surprise the old man was sharing the communal aspirationa good rine asll make the seeds spearthough not hopeful of the boon immediately he did not want to be a wetead he declared paradoxically but the ground would be harder before the sun met the wind such solicitude on behalf of soil belonging so largely to the farmer who had evicted him seemed to jinny touchingly christian it was only when she had turned her back on his glimmering light and got into the thick of the woods that they became curiously unfamiliar great trees that she did not know existed came colliding against her tangles of roots tripped her up on her favourite paths she stumbled into unfriendly pricklinesses of every species she seemed indeed ridiculously lost within a furlong of her own door how this black labyrinth had got there she could not understand but it looked as if she might be all night escaping from it she was even uneasily expecting one of the snakes uncle lilliwhyte hunted to glide perversely under her feet she bruising its head and it biting her heel as the curse in genesis predicted of course if she could spit into its mouth after chewing some spanish bugloss it would instantly die so at least miss gentry had assured her but how find the rare bugloss in this blackness or how spit accurately into the serpents mouth why had she not brought a lantern she asked herself was it really because she was jug and package laden or had it been only conceit she asked the question still more selfreproachfully when after smashing the empty jug in a stumble which left her knuckles bleeding she heard the gurgle of a waterhen and realized that she was far off her track and nearly into the brad she could not swim but even a swimmer in such a moonless starless void would not see the shore cautiously feeling her way among the willows she groped towards the pastureland paradoxically pleased when she fell over a sleeping cow she lay there some minutes in the warm darkness not anxious to move on for the river wound perilously in and out one could still hear it rippling deliciously in the reeds and the odours of the night were as exquisite and then through the measureless blackness a faint suggestion of grey began to make itself perceptible or rather divinable so shadowy was it a lesser shade of black rather than an adumbration of light it was as if behind the blank firmament some star was striving to shine and suddenly mystically she felt that this hinted radiance was god the light behind lifes darkness and the words of the twentythird psalm came to her mind with all the force of a revelation the lord is my shepherd i shall not want he maketh me lie down in green pastures he leadeth me beside the still waters how divinely apt was every word so long as she had not wanted for aught so long as she had not needed to be led she had not really felt the meaning of the words now that she was strayed and ahungered she knew overpoweringly that she had a shepherd he was behind her watching as surely as she watched over her grandfather now she understood what the peculiars meant when they got up to testify she must go back to them bear witness this very next sunday mr fallows church had no place for such testimonies women could not speak even at morning service and as if to complete her conversion there was a swift pattering a joyous bark and a cold nose in her fevered palm she had only to attach her handkerchief to nips collar to be guided safely home but it was nip that was really her shepherd she told herself or at least her sheepdog it was nip that was leading her beside the still waters dog was after all only god spelt backwards she thought with a sense of mystic discovery and remembering all that nip had done to bring her back to faith in life she felt he was indeed a divine messenger but then it was borne in upon her that if she testified her true thoughts the brethren would deem her irreverent after all it was mr fallow who might understand better he who spoke of his bees with love and had once cited to her a passage from a roman poet about bees being part of the divine mind the roman writer was not a catholic he had explained carefully seeing her dubious face iv in her gratitude to the dressmaker jinny had become more than ever her intellectual parasite and a wealth of information from the christian mothers miscellany and culpepers herbalto say nothing of the spinsters own sibylline rhymesenriched the walk to and from church which miss gentry graciously permitted her carrier and debtor to take in her society next sunday morning they parted indeed inside miss gentry plumping herself unrebuked into the curtained threebenched pew of the dead and gone squire whom old farmer gale had dispossessed jinny was thus unable to exchange glances with her at the thrilling announcement read out by the cleric who after the second lesson declared curtlyas if it were the most natural thing in the worldthat mr anthony flippance widower of frog farm and miss bianca cleopatra jones spinster of foxearth farm both of this parish proposed to enter into holy matrimony at once a whirligig of images circled round jinny and she saw dizzily the explanation of a disappearance that had puzzled her for tony had vanished from the black sheep without leaving a tip the old waiter grumbled what had led up to this adventure she wondered and how was polly taking her intended stepmother isnt that the showman youve spoken of miss gentry inquired as the congregation of seven streamed out swollen by musicians sexton clerk and pewopener the fomenter of ungodliness it certainly seems my old customer replied jinny somewhat evasively but i didnt know he was living at frog farm didnt you tell me he was going to turn your chapel into a playhouse so he said once but nothing seems to have come of it mores the pity miss gentry surprised jinny by commenting she added even a playhouse would do less harm ii dont see that jinny stammered protesting its as clear as daylight the devil stamps his sign plainly on a playhouse he forges gods name on a chapel and who is this miss jones i dont know i never heard of any girl at foxearth farm called cleopatrickwhat a funny name cleopatra corrected miss gentry grandly her bosom expanding till it strained her sunday silk a great queen of egypt in the days of old born under venus and died of the bite of an asp whats an asp said jinny its what they call the serpent of old nile good gracious jinny exclaimed couldnt they have given her majesty agrimony wine neither horsemint nor wild parsnip could avail there is no ointment against suicide miss gentry explained she killed herself a queen kill herself what for what does one kill oneself for miss gentry demanded crushingly for love of course but i hope her namesake is more respectable cleopatra never published the banns but how comes this miss jones to be at foxearth farm i thought the people were called purleyhurdlemakers arent they yesit must be a lodger they do take lodgers i must ask barnabyi meet him on the road sometimes she stood still suddenly going red and white by turns like the revolving lens of a lighthouse miss gentry stared then smiled in sentimental sympathy is he a nice boy she cooed who yees very nice jinny stammered but ive just remembered miss jones isnt his sister who said she was oh jinny jinny miss gentry sometimes became roguish shes only his stepsister jinny explained desperately mrs purleys first husband was called jones if the bride should really be the purley creaturethe fair charmer who rode so often in wills coach as to be almost keeping company with him what a lifting of a nightmare what a sudden horizon of rose but no it was too good to be true but i never heard she was called cleopatra she wound up sadly people often have a second name hidden away like a tuck said miss gentry but her first name isnt the same either its blanche but bianca is blanche bayed miss gentry like an excited bloodhound only more grand and foreignlike jinnys colours revolved again is it she breathed but she remembered mr flippances address had been announced as frog farm if he had thus ousted young mr flynt she urged how could he be living so amicably under his rivals roof besides how should mr purleys second wife a matron as famous for her cheeses as her spouse for his hurdles have christened her girl so outlandishly no joneses were as abundant as hips and haws and this miss jones could only have come to their outoftheway parishlike mr flippancefor reasons of statutory residence though why the showman should bury himself to be married miss gentry declared to be an exciting enigma perhaps he liked a quiet wedding jinny suggested having too many acquaintances in towns and with that she dismissed the hope from her mind but it was not so easy to dismiss the topic from miss gentrys that lady was rolling the hymeneal discussion under her tongue she pointed out that foxearth farm was not in little bradmarsh and was prepared to discuss the romantic ramifications if it should turn out on the weddingday that the bride was disqualified but jinny cruelly took the sweet out of her mouth foxearth farm was in the parish she declared its one of those funny bits lost stolen or strayed into other parishes i know because of the women from there who come upon our parish for blankets when theyre laid aside oh jinny deprecated miss gentry to whom maternity was as sordid and surreptitious as matrimony was righteously romantic but jinny innocently misunderstanding persisted why i remember the fuss when the steamroller tried to charge our parish for doing up a scrap of the road beyond foxearth farm they walked through the sunlit churchyard in constrained silence miss gentry feeling as if the steamroller had gone over roses but stimulated by the iron pole and the four steps by which ladies who rode pillion anciently mounted and dismounted she began wondering who would be making the brides dress that gave jinny a happy idea how if she got miss gentry the workthat would be a slight return for all she owed her why shouldnt you make it she inquired excitedly i could speak to mr flippance now that i know where he is hush child dont profane the sabbath men dont count in wedding matters said miss gentry in complex correction nor would i care about the patronage of stage people but she maynt be stage like runs to like miss gentry sighed and jinny felt the colchester romance hovering again but it did not descend instead miss gentry remarked that she ought to have known that it could not be a local beauty no playactor with any brains at all could be attracted by anything hereabouts especially when they could not achieve the acquaintance of women of real attraction and intellect these preferring the company of cats to that of strolling sinners nevertheless far be it from her wilfully to rob jinny of a commission i wasnt thinking of my commission jinny protested with a little flush i couldnt dream of it otherwise squibs and i need so little and have more work than we can manage squibs jinny murmured the place is overrun with rats miss gentry explained what will it be when the cold drives them in from the ditches however fortunately that horrible old mawhood stands compelled to clear the cottage before winter that was the compromise our too kindly pastor let him off with so you told me shall i order the deacon at once the deacon miss gentry sniffed bishops theyll call themselves next there is a bishop jinny reminded her bishop harrod wretched little ratcatchers miss gentry hissed setting themselves up against the church established im so glad youre done with them but im not jinny confessed shyly im still peculiar you are indeed miss gentry cried startled do you mean to tell me that after the glorious privilege of sitting under mr fallow words failed her and they also failed jinny to whom this unfamiliar metaphor conjured up a puzzling picture of the vicar perched on her sunday bonnet the girl was the first to recover her breath granfer told me my mother wanted me to be peculiar she explained i cant go against my angelmother then she blushed prettily never having mentioned the angel mother since childhood and feeling somehow as if she had profaned a sacred secret if your angel mother was alive cried miss gentry with conviction its to our church that she would cometo our grand old church with its storied windows a divine thrill ran through all jinnys frame her belief that her mother and the painted angel were mysteriously one was sealed the oracle had spoken miss gentry swelling at her silencejinny heard the silk cracklingfelt herself indeed an oracle squibs had his pick of the plates at that sunday dinner enjoying a sabbath rest from rats and basking in his mistresss lap a black curledup breathing mass of felicity v as jinny jogged along next tuesday morning diverging from her usual beat to take in the hurdlemakers home that laylike a geological faultin the wrong parish the plan that formed itself in her mind was to approach the question of the bride and the weddingdress by way of barnaby purley the youth who had so chivalrously come to her rescue by delivering at uckford manor the keg of oil overlooked by her on that memorable journey with elijah skindle it was because foxearth farm possessed this hobbledehoy scion and a trap of its own that jinny had never done its marketing nor come face to face with the creature of whom with sidelong eye she caught tantalizing glimpses in the flynt flyer not badlookin was the countrysides appraisal of her which was rather ominous indicating as it did considerable beauty and conjoined as it was with a rumour of easy conquests culminating in the coachowner but a good square look at her had not been attainable even on sunday for though the family was church of englandmr giles purley being even a churchwardenit preferred to worship in the parish church to which it did not parochially belong jinny told herself she was hastening at this first opportunity purely in miss gentrys interest for fear the bridal gown had been ordered elsewhere but she could not quite disguise from herself her consuming anxiety to discover whether this everyday miss jones was really a cleopatra though she called her poignant emotion mere curiosity and deemed herself as apathetic at heart as the bumblebees now crawling miserably about her cart which could be flicked into a feeble flight and drone but which soon relapsed into their torpor in truth the suppressed hope of finding blanche safely paired with the showman was now quickening her pulses and restoring the wild rose to her cheeks the september day too for all the longcontinued drought and despite the drowsy bumblebees was not devoid of animating influences especially the delicious smell of burnings from the fields where men tossed from their prongs brown masses of weed into red and smoking heaps or carried like merry devils fiery forks from one pile to another monstrous fungi clove in pied picturesqueness to the elmtrunks and a hawthorn grove with its scarlet berries was like a vast radiant smile overhead the sun a shimmery thinclouded sphere showed like an eye in a great white peacocks wing the hips and blackberries were interfused in the hedges the ivy flowered on the squat church towers the virginia creepers were reddening the cottages and the dahlias grew tall in the little front gardens in the orchards the peartrees and appletrees were heavy with fruit around them the turnipfields looked more like spreads of mustard so thick were the slender yellowflowering stems pushing between the crop proper and everywhere was life pecking poultry scattering before methusalems feet and little frogs playing leapfrog swarms of the daddylonglegs and gigantic spiders great quarrelling families of rooks quiet chewing cattle pigs nosing for acorns or windfall apples hares or great rats or weasels scuttling across the road partridges straying fearlessly in the stubble swallows darting unpromisingly high and when jinny passed over the little brick bridge at which a black drainagemill waved what seemed its four crossed white combs a pair of superb swans hissed their proud protectiveness over a very drab cygnet driving through an avenue of firs and hornbeam and past a dirty pond with two flagged mounds in the middle she reached the clearing where the hurdlemaker operated with his farmhouse for base of his combined industrial agricultural and pastoral occupations mr giles purley a rosywrinkled applefaced ancient stood in his shirtsleeves looking as pleasantly untidy as his farmyard which was full of felled logs and split wood and bean and corn stacks and ramshackle sheds he was planing off knots with a billhook and as jinny drove up to the gate of the old timbered red house he greeted her with a cheery grumble at the drought which forced such winter work prematurely upon him jinny was abashed to find no pretext for her visit coming to her tongue so she stammered out that she wanted to see barnaby and the droll look that twinkled across his fathers face sent her colour up still higher always wants a change they youngsters he chuckled benevolently whether tis of work or sweethearts at this point jinny became aware of barnaby himself who equally in his shirtsleeves was smiling sheepishly up at her from the ditch which he was discumbering with a hook lilies of the walley they stick in their buttonholes went on his father waggishly as if weeds was ever aught but weeds there aint one that showlders his sack o corn or sticks to his dearie sheeps eyes they can make but as for sheephurdles the note was now earnest it seemed an unpropitious moment to tackle barnaby and to make it more impossible blanche herself suddenly bounded from the orchard flourishing a great corroded pear nipped thirteen she cried gaily not badlookin forsooth to jinny she appeared in her bloom and colour like a rich peach dipped in cream overripeness was the only flaw her beauty suggested to this girl in her teens but the chill at jinnys heart did not prevent her crying out with equal gaiety what an unlucky numberfor the wasps barnaby laughed adoringly from his ditch mr giles purley in simple joy of the slaughter the pigs he explained gleefully had gnawed at the pearbags and blanche was wunnerful masterous at nipping the wasps as they crawled out of the forbidden fruit asps jinny found herself thinking would have a bad time at such bold hands though they made the cleopatra likeliershe slued her eyes round to see the rings on them but the engagement finger was hidden by the big pear and miss jones her gaiety checked was eyeing her like the intruder she was she can kill two at once barnaby called up like you with the lasses flashed his father to his confusion its nothing said blanche coldly they havent time to curl their tails round who the lasses asked jinny and to her relief the beautiful blanche vouchsafed a smile you wont be stung if you dont think youll be the girl explained more cordially then unable to retain the proud secret longer even from the carrier she burst forth im going on the stage with it what jinny gasped only as a beginning of course bianca the barehanded waspkiller itll be on the bills rubbidge came explosively from mr purley and where will mr flippance get the wapses in the winter a circusslut indeedi wonder what your mother can be thinkin of and whats mr honeytongue going to bill you as barnaby not champion hurdlemaker ill go gaff wait till you see me said barnaby with sullen mysteriousness you dont know a circus from a theaytre youll stick to your shackles and bolts said his parent grimly and peel the bark off too at the mention of mr flippance jinnys heart beat fast she felt hovering on the verge of the revelation and the bianca and the stageproject rekindled her hope but mr purleys grievance had to be worked off first theyre too lazy to peel the wood he explained to jinny but thats the main thing for hurdlesto strip em well against rain same as you was fulldressed in a pouring rainthe time it ud take you to dry if you was naked now oh dad barnaby remonstrated to his parents confusion and enjoyed this titfortat when do you expect mr flippance mr purley jinny asked him hastily oh he never comes in the mornings blanche replied and this appropriation of the question seemed to jinny to continue the promise of bianca and the stageproject then can i speak toto his intended she flashed brilliantly with a clever smile shes gone to her dressmaker said blanche simply it was a double blow and jinny winced before it in that twinkling of her eye blanche seemed years younger diabolically handsome a nipper of buds as well as of wasps but a worse blow awaited her for she had scarcely regained her composure when the distant sound of a wheezy horn and a sense of an impending avalanche brought blanche into bounding activity again why theres will she exclaimed with a comic happy start and me not dressed yet and without a word to the little carrier she ran gaily into the house frantically clutching nip who was about to spring to meet the coach jinny cried vague thanks to the hurdlemaker and hurried methusalem down a byway so narrow that she could hardly squeeze through the untrimmed werges neglected of barnaby vi when she heard the coach well on its way again on the chipstone road with blanche divined within she found herself possessed by an unexpected urging towards mr flippance she had no real round any longeronly the hours to fill and her grandfather to half deceiveand perhaps despite miss gentrys own opinion the bridegroom might yet be able to prevent her being cut out by the rival pair of scissors the truth was jinny felt a physical need of the toning up the showman somehow imparted to life to drive around the rest of the day with practically no business but her own thoughts would be too dreadful he must surely babble happily about his bride and apart from the interest of her identity some of his glow could not but radiate to her and there was caleb and martha to see toohow were they faring these dear simple creatures too long unvisited but thenthought that froze the hearthad she not declared she would never set foot in frog farm again no she answered herself defiantlyand no memory of hereditary quibbling nothing of her sense of humour rose to trouble the replyall she had said was that will should never see her there and will was safely chained to the chipstone road all the same she looked round apprehensively and with wildly beating heart before she allowed methusalem to lift the latch of the familiar gate and she had somehow expected so great a transformation in the farmhouse under its new and sinister activities and was conscious of so vast a change in herself since she had last seen it that its primitive black front almost startled her so unchanged did it appear true the ferrets cages were gone but their absence only made it more its old self and the moan of the doves was as reassuring as the singing of the kettle on her own hearth calebs red shirtsleeves looked for once in keeping with the scene arising as they did out of yellow flametinged clouds from the rubbishheap which he was burning and the pleasant pungent smell of which filled her eyes with tears half smoke half emotion even in that glow the homely haircircled face was capable of a new illumination gracious goodness theres jinny he ran to the housedoor mother mother he cried in jubilant agitation martha emerged at a hobbling run aprongirded despite the glow her face darkened you give a body a turn she grumbled i almost thought twas the golden city coming down tis nigh as good he retorted boldly bein as jinny was same as gone there and bless me ef she dont look ghosty good morning jinny said martha coldly we dont need a carrier nowwith our coach to get everything jinnys cheeks turned far from ghosty i havent come to youonly to mr flippance but he gets everything too through willie i know thati merely want to speak to him you cant now the missus means hes abed caleb explained rushing to jinnys relief and indeed the information brought a smile back to her twitching lips minds me of a great old tortoise diggin hisself into his blankets do him good to be up with the sun same as when oi was a scarecrow soon as the wheat was sown you dont want to tell everybody you began as a scarecrow said martha frigidly ef were rich now dear heart and can ride in our own coach tis the lords hand not ours oi watched over wheat and winter beans and arly peas and winter oats and then spring barley but all the time the lord was watchin over me not as a scarecrow said martha severely oi warnt a scarecrow ploughintime bein set on the middle hoss to flick the whip and chance times when twas too frosty to plough oi went to dame pipplers to school i never heard that before said martha dednt like to tell ye he confessed being as twas too cowld to howd the slatepencil and the booklarnin leaked out twixt the frosts twas a penny a week wasted martha saw their visitor was amused at this revelation after fifty years of wedlock jinny wants to be going on she observed testily look at all her boxes oim proper pleased to see em for as oi says to willie oi hope as you aint hart jinnys business and grieved the lord ye cant sleep oi says ef yeve grieved the lord then mr flippance must be a saint laughed jinny but she was touched to tears caleb had however not finished his apologia for his lack of learning and was to be diverted neither by jinnys jests nor his wifes grimaces and in the summer he explained carefully oi got to goo out with my liddle old gun agin they birdthieves though peas and pebbles was all the shot my feyther cant you try some at mr flippances window interrupted jinny fearful the fretful martha would soon close her door upon her oid have to stand sideways for that he pointed to a hookedback casement fust he kivers hisself up then he opens hisself outhe chuckled contemptuouslytis in dock out nettle as the sayin goos jinny lifted her little horn to her lips and blew a blast so literally rousing that hardly had its echoes died than from the black casement framework a red unshaven face like the rayed rising sun on an inn signboard dawned above clouds of flamboyant dressinggown jinny hurrah cried the apparition in delighted surprise the very person ive been wanting for weeks in the effulgence of that great rubicund sphere of a face jinnys mists began to dissolveafter all with all his faults he belonged to her rosy past to the good old times ere black horses or red men had arisen to rend her then why didnt you let me know she smiled just what i was thinking of doing so glad youve saved me a letter never was so hardworked in my life good morning ma he threw to mrs flynt whose set face now relaxed into a maternal mildness do i smell breakfast ye could ha smelt it afore seven friend said caleb growing dour as martha grew soft and the missus a bit paltry today too am i late im so sorry why i thought it was wills horn mr flippance overslept himself dearie martha said reproachfully but you hate food spilin caleb protested not so much as i hate spoilt food said tony not that a good housekeeper like mrs flynt would really let food spoilany more than you your wheatpatch ef ye had helped gittin that bit o corn in retorted caleb yed fare to have more to sleep on theres more than one kind of work caleb said martha severely theres brainwork for them that have never been scarecrows yes indeed mrs flynt said tony earnestly im worked to a shadow and there was no such hurry to get the corn in martha added with all they prayers for rine gooin on ye cant be too careful caleb urged but what work had you got mr flippance jinny laughed getting married didnt you know she was startled but youre not married already no such luck when the lady says yes you think all your troubles are over but theyre only beginning calebs face relaxed in a grin whereupon marthas hardened to a frown marriage is no laughing matter she said with a glower at her husband no indeed mrs flynt endorsed tony what with the forms and questions and ceremonies and witnesses and what not and rings to buy and bouquets to orderits worse than a dress rehearsal but youve had the rehearsal jinny reminded him i was young and strong now youve got to help me me jinny was enchanted at this smoothing of the path for miss gentry but im so busy she protested professionally i cant wait till youre up jinnys too busy martha corroborated and in her eagerness to be rid of the girl she unconsciously clucked to methusalem and so exactly like jinny that the noble animal actually started wait wait mr flippance shouted down wildly do wait such a lot to consult you about havent even got a best man yet find me one and ill call down blessings on your head i dont want you to call them down she jested up thats the trouble ill be down before you can say jack robinson i wasnt going to suggest him and she reined in her fiery steed martha had hurried to her kitchen to bring in the belated breakfast and the convulsion into which jinnys last remark appeared to throw caleb was left unchecked by wifely grimaces the veteran alternated between gurgles and roars so continuously that jinny flattered as she was by the reception of her jest began to feel uneasy that fair flabbergasted him he gasped getting his breath at last how can oi says oi ef oim a buoyoy oi says he wiped the tears from his whiskered cheeks and blew his nose into his great muckinger but he didnt ask you to be best man she said puzzled and you arent a boy twas master as called me a buoyoy he explained his eyes still dancing so as to keep down my wages oive got three hosses same as the min oi says and can plough my stetch similarsame as them and cut and trave up my corn bettern bill ravens as felt the teeth of the sickle two days arter he started and couldnt work no more though doublemoney time as oi can sartify bein as twar me what tied my neckercher round his arm with the blood pourin down like sweat and lucky twarnt his wife oi says but another woman gooin behind him to be larnt how she bein in confinement but master he wouldnt listen to nawthen oill give you easy ploughin was all he promised yere onny a buoyoy he says obstinacious like and oi stayed on a bit not mislikin the cans of tea the wives brought all hot and sweet and the big granary with pillars and fower on us thrashin and rattlin on the big oak floor jolly as a harvest supper and bill ravensthat be the feyther of the rollin stone as shears chance times for master peartreesingin like the saints in jerusalem all except for the words but at last bein as feyther wanted the money and oi needed time to look for a farmer not so nippy gimme a week off says oi to old skindflint a week off says master what for gooin to git married at this point the convulsion recommenced and jinny though she understood how the flippance wedding had set his memories agog had still to wait for enlightenment as to why they were agrin married oi says how can oi git married ef oim a buoyoy it was out at last the great repartee of his life and jinny felt he was right to cherish its memory she occupied the period of his renewed cachinnation in descending from her seat and giving methusalem his impoverished nosebag her action reminded caleb to offer to show her the enlarged stables with the old roof raised to admit the coach then colouring as if at an indelicacy he hastily inquired how her grandfather was remarking with commiseration that he must be getting a bit elderly never had jinny known him so loquaciousthe absence of martha was combining with her own advent to loosen his usually ruly member and at last the pentup flood of his grievances against the showman burst forth the return of will jinny gathered had been dislocating enough even before his newfangled coach had brought the stir of the great world and bundock almost daily but now the house and the hours were all topsytivvy worse than in cousin carolines time he would do will the justice to say that it wasnt his faultwill had been against putting up a furriner in their spare bedroombut the great old sluggaby had come and ingratiated himself so with the rheumatic but romantic martha and offered such startling pricesa pound a week for board and lodgingenough to feed the whole pennymole family for a fortnightthat she had forced her will upon both the male flynts the trouble with martha is caleb summed up she allus wants what she wants mr flippance he explained got a piper for her from her lunnon sin agogfunny name that for the lords house even in lunnonand that piper fared to be all about the christy dolphins and their doinsthe loightstand martha called it and she read me a piece out of it how mr somebody husband o sister tother was baptized by elder somebody else and she wanted me to goo and do likewise but you are nearly one of them arent you jinny smiled he looked uneasy oi dont want to be baptized a jew he said plaintively martha she argufies as paul says we are the jews bein abrahams seed in our innards so long as she calls us the lords people oi fair itches to be one but that goos agin the stomach like to call yourself a jew same as she was satisfied with the new jerusalem part oid goo with her for ef the book says no man hath gone up to heaven or whither oi goo ye cannot come that proves as heavens got to come to us and happen oill live to see it droppin down with its street of pure gold same as transparent brass but oi wont be swallowed up whole like a billyowl swallows a mouse whats that youre saying caleb said martha now perceived back at her housedoor he was telling me about the lightstand said jinny glibly martha beamed again ah it wont be long before that light spreads though now the world is all shrouded in darkness and superstition but salvation is of the jews that aint writ in the book inquired caleb anxiously salvation is of the jews repeated martha implacably john iv theres nine of us now in essex alone the lightstand says not reckoning london they dont know about another thats on the way zionwards she added mysteriously meaning me said caleb nervously meaning a man with brains and booklearning said martha sternly and hes ready to see you now jinny well nine aint no great shakes caleb murmured we are the salt of the earth martha reminded him a pinch of salt goes a long way ay when it rolls in a pillbox caleb reflected ruefully and hows the old chapel jinny he said aloud willy never goos now jinny coloured up one of her pretexts for apostacy seemed null and void ill see you when i come out i suppose she said evasively as she followed martha within vii the parlour of frog farm had not the peculiar mustiness which greeted jinnys nostrils when last she peeped into it that tragic morning of marias illness but there was by way of compensation a reek of stale tobacco and the odours of the breakfast bacon and mushrooms while in lieu of the sacrosanct tidiness there was a pervasion of papers with a whole mass of scripts sliding steadily from the slippery sofa the brownlozenged text on the wall when he giveth quietness who then can make trouble seemed to shriek for calebs answer friend flippance other documents bulged and bristled from both pockets of the dressinggown as from greasy paniers bless you jinny tony gurgled from his breakfastcup he eyed her rapturously what a pretty pair youll make at the wedding its no use mr flippance said martha beaming ive told you before i wont go into a church mr flippance who had been mentally coupling his bride and jinny replied with but the briefest muscular quiver that the only thing that reconciled him to marthas absence was that she was incapacitated by matrimony from the rle of bridesmaid this morning he would not trouble her to wait you can withdraw from me he said jocosely martha was jarred by this profane use of the sacred vocabulary and moreover felt it almost as improper to leave jinny alone in her house even with a budding bridegroom jinnys got no secrets from me she said tartly and mr flippance divining his error remarked blandly nor have i and as martha started to dust the mantelpiece ornaments and to discover cigarash in her china shoes he drew jinnys attention to the beautiful silk sampler that hung over them and all worked with mrs flynts own hand what a wonderful lionand as for the unicorn shes got it to the life oh its only what i did when a girl said martha blushing modestly only i didnt like to hang it up then because id left no room for the foreign trees like my sisters put in well but youve got in the alphabet big and little and all the figures wonderful thats where willie learnt his a b c from said martha radiant ah that gay deceiver sighed mr flippance he told me he was a yankee but now i find hes only a yumorist still hes a chap any woman can be proud ofwhat do you say jinny jinny who had seated herself on the sofa carefully steadied the slipping manuscripts as she replied with a forced lightness i say if you want a best man you cant find a better ah thats the trouble he wont take part in a church ceremony neither he says hes got to consider the old folksat the chapel he added promptly but at any rate we shall have the best bridesmaid you dont mean me said jinny colouring under his admiring gaze because its impossible i havent the timeor the money is it the dress youre thinking of surely the theatre royal chipstone can run to that and pulling a protrusive scroll from a pocket of his dressinggown he unfurled it beatifically exposing a poster with the coupled names of anthony flippance and cleopatra jones in giant letters anthony and cleopatra he breathed in a ravishment the moment she told me her second name was cleopatra i knew it was useless fighting against the fates but have you bought our chapel then jinny inquired bought your chapel mr flippance was mystified why on earth should i buy your chapel youyou might have turned it into a theatre she stammered apologetically he waved the suggestion away with a jewelled hand only a new temple of thespis could live up to anthony and cleopatra we are building where now it was jinny that was mystifiedshe had seen no such enterprise afoot here he tapped the other pocket of his dressinggown plans he rolled up his poster reluctantly cleopatra wanted to see it in print didnt i say what a work getting married was but now that the bridesmaids settled but shes not said jinny more alarmed than when he was trying to cast her for the bride perhaps because the danger of being sucked in was greater oh jinny he looked at her with large reproachful eyes and mechanically threw bacon to nip who had at last sniffed his way in and who fortunately for marthas composure caught it ere it reached her carpet you see she wants to have the thing all regular and respectable and all her family are in wales she hasnt got a parent handy to give her away and having led a wandering life she hadnt even a parish to marry in i never thought youd desert an old pal but im no pal of hersi dont even know her oh jinny and just arresting a paperslide he extricated a photograph from the imperilled mass the new scott archer process he declared proudly knocks your daguerreotypes into the middle of last week good gag that eh but it was jinny who seemed knocked into that period and not only by this new triumph of the camera for in this wonderful breathing image she recognizedin all save size for this seemed a cleopatra swelling to regal staturethe beauteous human doll she had last seen walking down the steps of a toy house conning a part but shes married she gasped not yet would to heaven it were all over said mr flippance airily but his great brow grew black for an instant ere he turned it sunnily on martha oh ma could i have more of these marvellous mushrooms ill see you greedy boy she smiled retreating well who could help saying encore to such items he turned reproachfully on jinny you nearly shocked the old lady but didnt youdidnt you call her the duchess jinny stammered oh but perhaps it is mrs dukes sistershe looks taller thats because shes got no legs he explained paradoxically but its all rightthe loveliest leading lady in london jinny heard the capital letters distinctly he went on to explain that london didnt know this yet and that some time must elapse before cleopatra would be in a position to demonstrate it on the spot owing to local jealousies but jinny came back remorselessly to her point but surely she was married to mr duke hush appearances are deceptive they were just close friends you couldnt well be closerin that dolls house said jinny scornfully and her own words reminded her how he had denounced the duchess as a squeaking doll whose golden hair was spurious now you shock me jinny said mr flippance severely pure as the driven snow is my cleo stainless as the lady agnes shut up in that great oak chest on her wedding morn sweet as her namesake bianca in the taming of the shrew why does she tame shrews asked jinny puzzled thats a play by shakespearethe name not occurring in the spellingbook left jinny unimpressed a shrew is a vixen this natural history left jinny still less impressed thats nonsense she said a shrew is tiny and lovely to look at with darling rounded ears i buried one the other day and its eye was as bright as life its only a way of speaking he explained as you call a woman a cat katharinas the polecat of the play that her husband has to tame with a whip but bianca is a dove gentle and spotless doves are not so gentle said jinny they peck each other dreadfully i like vixens better at least they seem fonder of their family when you peep down their earths mr flippance who had never in his life seen either a shrew or a vixen or a polecat or observed the habits of doves was taken aback he had even a vague sense of blasphemy some ancient religious images whirring confusedly in his brain understand this jinny he said sharply abandoning the shifting sands of metaphor cleo gave mr duke her companionship and her artistic cooperation but as for marrying himbring me that book he indicated the precious volume which mrs flynt had left in the parlour for his study of the textevidence of the christadelphian teaching but jinny took his bible oath for granted sincerity and righteous indignation radiated from every round inch of his face and jinny despite her farmyard experience was too nebulous in her ideas of human matings not to be shaken in truth he had been vastly relieved by the discovery that the couple had pretermitted the ceremony and that he was saved the tedium and expense of a divorce suit though he wondered why mr duke with his meticulous bookkeeping and contracts should be so loose where women were concerned while he so averse from parchments and figures had a proper respect for the marriagetie human nature was devilishly deep he thought no wonder a man got drowned if he tried to fathom himself but jinny though she now believed she had misunderstood the ducal mnage was not without an instinctive distrust she didnt want to live in the caravan she protested no he agreed misapprehending the local idiom it was that pigheaded wirepuller who wanted it dukes the villain of the piece abusing my darlings innocence and exploiting her artistic aspirations he got round the poor girl knowing her aunt had left her all her money cleo my dear jinny is the niece of the famous cleopatra the cairo contortionist after whom she was christened and whose death a year or so ago eclipsed the gaiety of astleys and mr battys new hippodrome was she so beautiful asked jinny somewhat awed i was in love with her myself in my youth mr flippance replied simply but though you could gossip with her round the cokebrazier at the back of the ring she always made you feel that no man was worthy to chalk the soles of her tightrope shoes and her niece as you have doubtless perceived has the same grand manner then why did she keep company with mr duke jinny returned to the sore spot mr flippance felt like a buzzing bluebottle if you dont believe me he cried show me the little dukes and duchesses where are they produce em he looked at her fiercelyas demanding a rain of coroneted cherubs from the air the bold stroke put the climax to jinnys obfuscation marriage without children was practically unknown on her round though the children often died dont you see he wanted to compromise her pursued tony triumphantly after giving the cherubs a reasonable time to materialize he thought shed never dare break away with her money and that he could spend her last farthing on boosting himself into the legitimate hes all right with the marionettesa dapster as you say here mr flippance admitted magnanimously but as an actor he could no more expect to please my public than to keep cleo hidden in a bushel he might throw up the sponge and go back to his fantoccinibut what career was that for cleo she broke with him on the nailthe partnership i mean and i ask you ma he wound up with an appreciative sniff as martha reentered not only with mushrooms but freshly fried bacon what woman of spirit could do otherwise mrs flynt beamed assent and her apparent acquaintance with the facts contributed to lull jinnys uneasiness surely the pious martha would not connive at scandalous proceedings relieved she sat silent wonderingwhile mr flippance did jovial justice to the encore dishwhat the duchess would think if she knew that she jinny could have anticipated her in the rle of the second mrs flippance and what would polly have thought of her as a stepmother she wondered still more whimsically perhaps between them they could have made a man of him she had never seen his daughter over her cigar and milk or her sense of polly as a pillar of respectability might have been shattered and how is miss flippance she said his face changed suddenlyrainclouds overgloomed the sun his fork fell from his fingers you dont know what daughters are he blubbered shes left me left you ask ma he half sobbed it was infinitely pathetic dont let it get cold again martha coaxed i cant eat he lit a cheroot abstractedly and the old woman and the young girl followed his silent puffings with a yearning sympathy while nip begged unheeded mad on marionettes is polly he said at last the moment i got rid of em she packed up my things and was off stole your things cried the startled jinny nono she knew i should be moving on for the bannscleo likes a quiet placeso she left me tidy that was her sole conception of her duty to her legal pa but she had always looked upon me as a thing to be tidiednot a soul to be loved and cherished he wiped an eye with the sleeve of his dressinggown and asked brokenly for his brandy martha hurried to his bedroom but perhaps your daughterll come back jinny suggested soothingly god forbid he cried i mean theyd be at it hammer and tongs perhaps providence does all things for the best but where has she gone jinnys sympathy was now passing to polly as she began to grasp the true complexity of her exodus to her grandmother in cork i expect he blew a placid puff did i never tell you my pas real wifethe one he didnt live with i meanwas originally the widow of a welltodo cheesemonger polly always looked up her nominal granny when we played ireland she likes respectable people is that why she wont come to the wedding jinny inquired cruelly for pollys refusal to countenance it again stirred up her doubts mr flippance was angered afresh i tell you my cleopatra can hold up her head with the whitest cheesemongers widow in the land but its hard he said reverting to pathos and flicking his cigarash mournfully into the justdusted shoe to be left without a daughter at such a crisis think how she would have stagemanaged everythingeven bought the ring the tragedy of his situation mastered him forgive my emotioni was always one to wear my heart on my sleeve he wiped his eyes on it again nobody will ever pack like polly ah thank you ma he said as martha reappeared with the brandy bottle have you half a crown he added pouring himself out a careless quota you see he explained setting down his glass dolefully and tendering marthas halfcrown to the astonished jinny though old pals desert one at the altar tony flip doesnt forget his obligations but whats it for jinny took the coin tentatively you lent me it when that wicked duke demanded money on the contract oh thank you jinny was toucheda halfcrown seemed as large as her cartwheel nowadays half remorsefully she suggested that a far better bridesmaid would be the girl at foxearth farm he shook his head ive been into that but there areobjections it doesnt do you see for the super to be taller than the leading lady now you being shorter but if miss jones were to wear very low heels but that would only make miss purley look still taller he said puzzled i mean miss purley to wear the low heelsshe is a miss jones too what blanche jones is her nameshes only old purleys stepdaughter he started up then mrs purley was formerly mrs jones yes hurrah he seized the surprised martha by the waist and began waltzing with her while nip barked with excitement quiet nip whats the matter cried jinny smiling a relation at last dont you see that mrs jones can give the bride away but shes not really a relation all these joneses are one large family he said airily but you dont need a relation martha pointed out a friend will do really i must study the stagedirectionsi mean he corrected himself hastily yours may be different from the church of england but i know all the same for we werent allowed to marry in our own chapels leastways not till after willie was born well anyhow im sure cleopatra would prefer a relation mrs jones is a churchwoman i hope its necessary ma you know he apologized yesher husbands a churchwarden said jinny a churchwarden hurrah better and better then he shall give cleo away he bumped the beaming breathless martha round again but he isnt even called jones jinny reminded him a husband takes over his wifes jonesiness bless you jinny he seized her hand and dragged her likewise into the circular movement now we go round the mulberrybush the mulberrybush the mulberrybush caleb coming past the door at this instant stood spellbound had mr flippance been really converted and was it the joy of the new jerusalem or had martha now moved on and was this the new dancing sect of which one heard rumours marthas caperings ceased at sight of him its the wedding she said somewhat shamefacedly im just going to pickle your walnuts dear heart she added sweetly and jinny must be getting to her work too at which delicate hint jinny faintly flushing rose to take her leave and nip who had been whining his impatience was already gambolling hysterically without before she remembered she had forgotten the very purpose of her visit oh by the way mr flippance she said as she followed nip i suppose the weddinggown is ordered weddinggown he repeated you dont think cleo has any need of weddinggowns why the lady agnes dressact oneis the very prop for the occasion and brand new for she had just got duke to put on the mistletoe bough otherwise i should have been asking you for the address of that wonderful french friend of yoursthe bearded lady you know but if you wont be a bridesmaid youve got to come to the showyes and the wedding breakfast tooi wont take any refusal itll be at foxearth farm and im ordering oceans of sweet champagne well thank you a million times for finding cleo a father goodbye dear god bless you he had shuffled without and now kissed his hand to the moving cart what about a new weddinggown for you jinny called back a dressinggown i mean yumorist came his chuckled answer viii though not unconscious of a subterranean hostility in martha which she put down to the new business rivalry and though still perturbed about the duchess jinny felt distinctly better for this visit not to mention the halfcrown that now rare coin she was still more heartened two days later when bundock brought a letter from mr flippance stating that strange to say cleopatra did not find the lady agnes dress suitable it would make her feel she was only playing at marrying she said and she was too respectful of holy matrimony to desecrate it by any suggestion of unreality indeed she was already being fitted by the leading chipstone artist the dress was however turning out so dubiously that she would be glad if jinnys french friend would call upon her at foxearth farm with a view to preparing a double as for jinny being bridesmaid he must reluctantly ask her to abandon the idea as cleopatra considered her too short thats the flippance fist said bundock lingering to watch her read the letter scrawls all over the shop i dont mind your answering by post he added maliciously now ive got to go there so much i often killhe he hetwo frogs with one stone now so youre to be bridesmaid tony tells me nothing of the sort said jinny and mind your own business it is my business he said in an aggrieved tone didnt he ask me to be best man as if in this age of reason i could take part in superstitious rites i dont see any superstition about marrying said jinny im not so suretying a man to a woman like a dog to a barrel but anyhow why drag in heaven because marriages are made there i suppose said jinny stuff and nonsense and then the rice and the old shoes they throw i saw you throw one when your sister got married maybe but i didnt believe in it then why did you throw it he hesitated a moment they say if you dont believe in it its even luckier than if you do jinny laughed heartily im not joking bundock declared angrily if you were i shouldnt be laughing said jinny oh well go to church bundock retorted in disgust and i hope the beadle will give you an extra prod next sunday what do you mean dont pretend everybody knows that church is a double torturefirst the parson sends you to sleep with his sermon and then the verger wakes you up with his rod jinny laughed again dont tell me said bundock my own father was forced to goall the labourers on the estate poor chaps deadsleepy after the weeks work and that rod used to puggle em about no wonder dad chucked both squire and parson it doesnt happen in mr fallows church jinny assured him because nobody goes and bundock hurried off with this great last word and jinny saw his bag heaving with the mirthful movement of his shoulders somewhat to jinnys surprise miss gentry from being cleopatras alternative dressmaker developed into her adorer it appearing that the lady displayed not only proportions most pleasing to the technical eyejust made for clothes miss gentry put itbut a positive appetite for tracts she loathed dissent it transpired and to be married by a minister would seem to her little better than living in sin a very paragon of propriety and an elegant pillar of the faith miss cleopatra jones spinster worshipped regularly with the churchwarden and his family in the wrong parish church miss gentry ravished by this combination of respectability and romance did not once compel the fair client to attend upon her travelling to foxearth farm instead in jinnys cart it was impossible for jinnys doubts of cleopatras immaculacy to survive miss gentrys encomiums while miss gentry ascended to the bedroom of her beautiful and still goldenhaired client posed in an atmosphere of old oak bedsteads and panelled linen presses jinny would sit with the second mrs purley in her dairya cheerful speckless room which enjoyed a specially spacious window dairies being immune from the windowtaxwhile that bulkier edition of blanche made cheeses and conversation mrs purley made conversation irrespective of her auditor for she needed no collaborator indeed a second party coming athwart this niagara of monologue would have been swept aside like a straw as a great musician can take a few simple notes and out of this theme evoke endless intricacies enlargements repetitions echoes duplications parallelisms and permutations and then transform the whole into another key and give it you all over again so out of a simple happening like her feeding of a sick chicken or her discovery that a hen had laid her clutch in the hedge mrs purley without for a moment interrupting the milling of curd or the draining of whey could improvise a fugal discourse that went ramifying and returning upon itself ad infinitum it reminded jinny of kelcott wood where every day from three to five on these september afternoons hundreds of starlings perched like bits of black coal on the mountainashes kept up a ceaseless chattering shrilling clucking querying cackling but she soon ceased to hear mrs purley was even lulled by the cascade very familiar grew every pan dipper vat tub press cheesecloth or strawmat while the one readable article she knew by heart it was the inscription on a china mug in which mrs purley sometimes put milk and it recorded the virtues of a blackhaired blackwhiskered head painted thereon the incorruptible patriot the undaunted supporter of the peoples rights the father of the fatherless the pride and glory of his country such were a few of the attributes ascribed with a profuseness resembling mrs purleys conversation to a certain henry brougham esq who as jinny learnt from miss gentry was really and truly a love having defended queen caroline when miss gentry was a schoolgirl queens were as liable to illluck as herself jinny began to suspect recalling that egyptian asp and she became a little anxious for victoria who now came to figure in her dreams as defended against french fireeaters by this blackavised man with the protruding nose retreating forehead and weak chin somehowit was unintelligible when she woke up but quite clear in her dreamthe defended victoria was also herself for was not henry brougham the father of the fatherless adjoining the dairy was a room lit from itto avoid taxationby a pane in the door jinny sometimes had an uneasy sense that blanche was inspecting her through that pane otherwise she hardly ever encountered the vespacide who betrayed indeed no sense of rivalry for the relations between will and the little carrier were unknown and blanche would in any case have considered so humble a personage negligible or at least nippable for if this handsome creature wasas she had struck jinnya shade overripe it was not for lack of volunteer pluckers and the mutability which mr giles purley had gently derided in his son had been even more marked in his stepdaughter fortunately will was unaware of the episodes that had preceded his return to england and not only did he regard himself as the first male that had ever squeezed that fair hand but untaught by its prowess as a waspkiller he believed her a passive victim to his own compelling charm and the apparent perfection of blanches surrender was the more grateful to him after the granite he had kept striking in jinny but the mobility which had hitherto marked miss blanches affections was now manifesting itself in a novel shape for like miss gentry she had come under the spell of cleopatra though a very different cleopatra from the ardent churchwoman who revealed herself to the dressmaker the cleopatra who magnetized the cheesemakers daughter and who carelessly abetted by mr flippances sketchy promises filled the ignorant girl with dramatic and palpitating ambitions was a queen of the footlights an inspirer of romantic passions and in her unguarded momentsas when you sat on her bed at midnight with your hair downa teller of strange bohemian stories a citer of perturbing sapphic songs the melodies of which she could even whistle what wonder if mrs hemansblanches favourite poet hithertobegan to pall she had been proud enough of her culture leaving as she felt it did the parental perspectives far behind her but now boundless horizons seemed opening up before her and the london journal which cleopatra swallowed with her meals seemed to blanche to contain nothing so alluring as cleopatras own career it was by quite accidentally overhearing a remark of blanches and not by dint of mr flippances repeated invitation that jinny was finally strung up to attend the great wedding the probability that will and blanche would be at the feast was a drawback that prevailed over the lure of a good square meal and even over the glamour of that mysterious nectarchampagne but when she heard blanche instruct her mother that she would certainly not have to lay a place for that common carrier in a flame that might almost have consumed her letterpaper jinny wrote her acceptance to mr flippance and expended his halfcrown which she had laid by for a rainy day on a wedding present which would do him gooda bible to wit in prevision of the great day she left off wearing her best gown cleaned it and by the aid of miss gentry and a bit of lace gave it a new turn after the wedding it must alas be pawned jinny though she had hitherto entered the pawnshop only to pledge or redeem things for her customers had schooled herself to the inevitable so had mr flippance whose idea of a best man had now sunk to barnaby but he was used to handling unpromising performers he said though he regretted the absence of a dress rehearsal more especially for mrs purley who having been induced to mother cleopatra nothing would induce mr purley to father her was unlikely he feared to confine herself to a simple i do that was not he groaned drolly her idea of a speaking part he deplored too that there were not enough bells or bellringers in the little bradmarsh church to ring an elaborate joypeal as cleopatra was so anxious to have every property and accessory of holy matrimony complete it was for this reason doubtless that miss gentry after reducing the rival dress to a rag ultimately emerged as the bridesmaid ix for the convenience of foxearth farm as well as of will who though a bit sulky about his mothers waiting on the showman was too entangled with miss purley to refuse to grace the festal board the ceremony had been fixed for a saturday at ten and on that morning jinny had meant to rise with the sun so as to do the bulk of her days chares in advance what was her dismay therefore to open blinking eyes on her grandfather standing over her pseudobed in his best sunday smock whip in hand and to hear through her wideflung casement methusalem neighing outside and the cart creaking am i late she gasped sitting up then she became aware of a beautiful blue moonlight filling the room with glory and of a lambent loveliness spreading right up to the stars sprinkled over her slit of sky tis your weddingday dearie said the ghostly figure of the gaffer and she now perceived there were wedding favours on his whip evidently taken from methusalems may day ribbons which he must have hunted out of the gloryhole where odds and ends were kept bitterly she regretted having excited his brain by informing him of her programme he was evidently prepared to drive her to the ceremony but its too early she temporized yeve got to be there for breakfus you said dearie he reminded her no no she explained the wedding breakfast with fashionable folk is only a sort of bever or elevener at earliest he chuckled yere gooin to be rich and fashionablewont it wex that jackanips oi suspicioned twas you he war arter the fust time he come gawmin to the stable ye cant deceive daniel quarles on your hands and knees ye pirate thief he cracked his whip fiercely up ye git jinny yeve got to titivate yerself oive put the water in your basin but granfer she said acutely distressed its not my wedding not your wedding of course not then whose wedding be it he demanded angrily taint mine seein as oim too poor to keep annie though shes riddy of her rascal at last he seized her wrists and shook her why did you lie to me and make a fool o me so this was why granfer had embraced her so effusively last night when she avowed her programme for the morrow this was why he had given her blessings in lieu of the expected reproaches for her projected absence this was why he had gone up to bed humming his longsilent song oim seventeen come sunday it was a mistake she felt now to have stayed at home for his sake on the friday changing the immemorial day of absence he had been strange all day without grasping what was the cause of his unrest and nips parallel uneasiness had reacted upon him it was not however till she had incautiously remarked that methusalem too was off his feed that he cried out in horror that she had forgotten to go on her rounds smilingly she assured him she had not forgotten indeed the void in her whole being occasioned by the loss of mother ganders gratis meal had been a gnawing reminder since midday but imaginingand not indeed untrulythat her work was gone he had burst into imprecations on the pirate thief as she sat up now on her mattress helpless in her grief her mind raced feverishly through the episode recalling every word of the dialogue unravelling his senile misapprehension half wilful it seemed to her now in his eagerness to clutch at happier times its nothing to do with the coach competition granfer its only because ive got to be out tomorrow for a wedding a wedding she aint marrying agen who annie annie which annie theres onny one annie lijahs mother old mrs skindle what an idea its a friend of mine a gentleman youve never seen at this point she had had she remembered the fatal idea of showing him her furbishedup frock to soothe him for he was trembling all over would you like to see what im going to wear she understood now the new light that had shot into his eye as he touched the lace trimming similarsame to what your greataunt susannah wore the day she married that doddy little dap ye aint agooin to make a fool o yerself similarsame whos the man he had demanded fiercely you dont know him i told youits a mr flippance a beautiful peace had come over the convulsed face flippance aint that the gent whats come to live in frog farm thats a fustclass toff no mistake uncle lilliwhyte should be tellin me when he come with the watercress on tuesday as mr flippance pays a pound a week for hisself alone that was the point at which her grandfather had kissed her with effusion crying yell be in clover dearie while she licking her chaps at the thought of the morrows banquet had playfully answered that there would certainly be a mort to eat the prospect set him clucking gleefully spite o that rapscallion he had chuckled enlarging thereupon to her on the way the lord protects his righteous subjects and enlivening his discourse with adjurations to the pirate thief to take to his hands and knees had followed reproaches for hiding the news from him reproaches to mr flippance for not calling on him not even inviting him to the wedding soothing explanations from her that mr flippance knew he was too poorly to go that far assurances she would be back as early as possible she ought to have understood his delusion or selfdelusion she thought when he had clung to her in a sudden panic then ye will come backye aint leavin me to starve ye wont let that jackanips starve me out and when she had reassured him and caressed him even promised to bring him something tasty from the wedding breakfast he had gripped her harder than evershe could still feel his bony fingers on her wristbut of course they actually were on her wrists as she sat there now against her pillowyell live here with mesame as afore why ever shouldnt i she had answered in her innocence well always live with youmethusalem nip all of us what unlucky impulse of affection or reassurance had made her stoop down to kiss the dog in his basketall her being burnt with shame at the remembrance of her grandfathers reply though at the time it had touched her to tears god bless ye jinny oi know this aint a proper bedroom for you but oill sleep here if you like and do you and he move up to mine she had put by the offer gently nonsense granfer you cant shift at your ageor nip either oi baint so old as sidrach he had retorted not without resentment and oi doubt he aint left off bein a rollin stone and oi reckon oi can fit into that chest of drawers better than when oi was bonkka but the shrivelled form with the hollow cheeks flaming eyes and snowy beard was still shaking her angrily and her sense of his pathos vanished in a sick fear not so much for herself though his fingers seemed formidably sinister as for his aged brain under this disappointment why did you say twas your wedding morn the dutch clock providentially striking three offered a fresh chance of temporizing there granfer cant be my wedding morn yet only three oclock he let go her hands aint ye ashamed to have fun with your granfer he asked vastly relieved but its a middlin long drive to chipstone before breakfus its not at chipstonethe weddings at little bradmarsh oh he said blankly so theres lots of time granfer and you can go back to bed not me do oi mightnt wake in time agen ill wake youbut ill be fit for nothing in the morning if i dont go to sleep now the day oi was married he chuckled oi never offered to sleep the noight aforene yet the noight arter he he go away granfer she begged frantically let me go to sleep ay ay goo to sleep my little mavis nobody shant touch ye what a pity we ate up that weddingcake but oi had to cut a shiver to stop his boggin and crakin hadnt oi dearie quite right better eat weddingcake than humblepie she jested desperately ef he comes sniffin around arter youre married oill snap him in two like this whip dont break my whip she clutched at the beribboned butt thats my whip jinny let that go well go to bed then with a happy thought she lit the tallow candle on her bedside chair and tendered it to him it operated as mechanically upon his instinctive habits as she had hoped good night dearie he said and very soon she heard him undressing as usual and his snore came with welcome rapidity then she sprang out of bed pulled on some clothes and ran out to release the angry and mystified methusalem from the shafts and to receive his nuzzled forgiveness in the stable but when she got back to bed sleep long refused to come the sense of her tragic situation was overwhelming even the great peace of the moonlit night could not soak into her it was impossible to go to the wedding now she felt when at last sleep came she was again incomprehensibly queen victoria hemmed in by foes and protected only by the father of the fatherless with his black whiskers she awoke about dawn unrefreshed and hungry but a cold sponging from the basin her grandfather had prepared enabled her to cope with the labours of the day she looked forward with apprehension to the scene with the old man when he should realize that the grand match was indeed off but she could think of nothing better than going about in her dirtiest apron to keep his mind off the subject the precaution proved unnecessary he slept so late and so heavilyas if a weight was off his mindthat when he at last awoke he seemed to have slept the delusion off as though it were something too recent to remain in his memory as for the scene in the small hours that had apparently left no impress at all upon his brain in fact so jocose and natural was he at breakfast which she purposely made prodigal for him that the optimism of the morning sun which came streaming in almost banished her own memory of it too it seemed as much a nightmare as her desperate struggle against the foes of victoriajinny the lure of the wedding jaunt revived and the thought of the domestic economy she would be achieving thereby made her sparing of her own breakfast she had a bad moment however when her grandfather suddenly caught sight of the horseless cart outside stop thief he cried jumping up agitatedly jinny was vexed with herself to have left that reminder of the grotesque episode its that lijah he shrieked hes stole methusalem hush granfer she warned him suppose anybody heard you but he ran out towards the common and she after him his tottering limbs seemed galvanized my horse is all right she gasped catching him up in a few rods i was too tired yesterday to put my cart away thats all he turned and glared suspiciously at her thats my hossand my cart too cant you read the namedaniel quarles carrier but ye wont never let me put no padlock on my stable your horse is there safecome and see he allowed himself to be led to the soothing spectacle but oill put a padlock at once same as in my barn he said firmly dont that rascal lijah will grab him without tippin a farden x the overlooked cart proved a blessing not a calamity for the operation of padlocking the stabledoor before the horse was stolen so absorbed the gaffer that jinny found it possible after all to don her finery and slip off to the wedding unseen even of nip who was supervising the new measures for methusalems safety curiosity to see miss gentrys creation in action had combined with the pangs of appetite and her acceptance of the invitation to make temptation irresistible and she calculated that she could be back by noon and that pottering over his vegetable patch or his bible the old man would scarcely notice her absence when she reached the church she found the coach stationed outside and though the liveried guard was lacking today the black horses looked handsomer than ever with their red weddingfavours while the peagreen polish of the vehicle reduced her to a wormlike humility at the thought of the impossibility of her cart taking part in todays display evidently will had brought the bridegroom from frog farm out of the corner of her eye she espied will himself sunning himself on his box and her heart thumped though all she was conscious of was the insolent incongruity of his pipe with the occasion the edifice his new frockcoat and the posy in its buttonhole fearing she was late she hurried into the church but nothing was going on though the size of the congregationfar larger than usualwas an exciting surprise there was no sign of any of the weddingparty not even mr flippance and after imperceptibly saluting her angelmother she sank back into a rear pew half pleased to have missed nothing half uneasy lest there be a delay turning over a prayer book in search of the wedding service she came for the first time and not without surprise on the fifth of november thanksgiving for the happy deliverance of king james i and the three estates of england from the most traitorous and bloodyintended massacre by gunpowder and also for the happy arrival of king william on this day for the deliverance of our church and nation king williams arrival struck her as providential but confusingfor though he had apparently detected the popish barrels in the nick of time how came there to be two kings at once suddenly she was aware by some tingling telegraphy that the bride and bridesmaid had arrived outside in a grand open carriage mr fallow in his surplice came in at the clerks intimation and took up his position at the altar rails the musicians struck up the voice that breathed oer eden and then there was a sudden faltering and a whispering took place twixt parson and clerk and mr fallow was swallowed again by his vestry while the clerk disappeared through the church door it was realized that mr flippance was not in the church and it was understood that the brides face was being saved in the vestry where however as time passed the agitated congregation divined hysterics jinnythinking of her neglected grandfatherwas what he called on canterhooks had mr flippance not then come in the coach had he been carelessly left in bed as usual catching her angelmothers eye she received a distinct injunction to go out in search of him but she was too shy to move in the presence of all those people though she had a vision of herself frantically harnessing methusalem and carting the bridegroom to church in his dressinggownwould carpet slippers be an impediment to matrimony she wondered mr fallow came in again looking so worried that she recalled an ecclesiastical experience he had related to her how one of his parishioners nowadays a notorious hot gospeller had found religion on the very verge of setting out to be married and had passed so much time on his knees absorbed in the newly felt truth that it was only through his friend the bellringer stopping the church clock that he was married by noon if indeeda doubt which ever after weighed on mr fallowhe was legally married at all what if at this solemn moment of his life mr flippance should similarly find religion she devoutly hoped the discovery would be at least delayed till he was safely married good heavens perhaps the bible she had given him was in fault perhaps she was responsible for his rapt remissness disregarding the congregations eyes she went boldly into the vestry here sure enough she found the heroine of the day supported by a trio of ladies the outstanding absence of mr flippance left jinny but a phantasmagoric sense of a bride still composed indeed but so ghastly that despite her glamour of veilfolds and orangeblossom she scarcely looked goldenhaired of a bridesmaid hardly recognizable as miss gentry for the opposite reason that it was she with her swarthy splendour opulent bosom and glory of silk and flowers who seemed the cleopatra of a blanche so appallingly queenly in her creamier fashion under the art of the rival dressmaker that her own cleaned gown seemed but to emphasize her shabbiness and dowdiness acoustically the voice of mrs purley expatiating on the situation was the dominant note but through and beneath the cascade jinny was aware of miss gentry explaining to the bride that the horses which had brought the bridegroom were not responsible for his disappearance not unpropitious but of the finest augury were these sable animals omens going by contraries so they had brought mr flippance they were tossing their bepranked heads jinny found and champing their bits as if sharing in the human unrest will was no longer smoking placidly on his box but in agitated parley with barnaby and his father she heard the inn suggested and saw the purleys posting towards it she herself ran round to the tower fantastically figuring mr flippance on his knees on the belfry floor amid the ropes and the cobwebs but even the one bellringer seemed to have sallied in search of the bridegroom or at least of the inn the churchyard was large and rambling and thickly populatedpathetic proof there had been life in the church onceand it was in a sequestered corner behind a tall monument that jinny with a great upleap of the heart at last espied the object of her quest though he seemed even more unreal than miss gentry in his narrowbrimmed tophat satin stock with horseshoe pin and swallowtail coat while his face was as white as his waistcoat what are you doing came involuntarily to her lips reading the tombstones he said wistfully so peaceful but theyre waiting for you theyre waiting for everybody thats the joke of it all i dont mean the gravestones look theres a french inscription and that name must be flemish see i havent time why what have you got to do i mean you havent got time its your wedding dont rub it in what long grass so we go to grassall of us thanks for your bible by the way so her apprehensions had been right it was religion that was bemusing him so glad you like it come along she said in rousing accents all flesh is grass he maundered on and rank grass at that its only thick here because they cant mow this bit she explained too many tombs she plucked at his sleeve so its hay we run to he said disregarding her o lord mr fallows tithes i suppose well why waste good hay hes waiting for you well hes got plenty of time by all accounts i mean shes waiting she cried in distress is she there already look at that bird cracking its snail on the gravestone its an early birdyoull be late dont worry tony flip never missed his cue yet funny isnt it how it all comes right at nightespecially with polly there perhaps shell come if we give her a little time but have you invited her does she know if she dont its not for want of telegrams to every possible address but she may be in cork you said you cant keep the bride waiting she shouldnt have come so earlyits the first time ive known her punctual the early bird catches the snail eh but its halfpast ten and theres a crowd tooi dont know where they all come from come along one cant consider the supers well consider me then ive got to get back to granfer the true artist always has stagefright jinny give me a moment ill be on soon all right she was vastly relieved have you got the ring tony flip never forgets a property see and whisking it suddenly out of his waistcoat pocket he seized her left hand and slipped it on her gloved weddingfinger thats where it ought to be jinny she pulled it off outraged and flung it from her on your wedding day too she cried now its lost he said cheerfully and the bearded bridesmaid will have to go home with the unblushing bride you ought to have given it to barnaby she said anxious and remorseful she went on her knees groping feverishly in the long grass on your hands and knees kept sounding irrelevantly in her brain mr flippance watched her like a neutral id forgotten that the woman runs away with the piece he explained to her distracted ear i thought marriage was a show with two principals but if theres got to be a leading lady why not stick to polly you should have thought of that before she murmured correct as polonius jinny even when i get the theatre itll only be hell over again why couldnt i stick to the marionettes i charge thee fling away ambition jinnyby that sin fell the angels but youve only flung away my ring here it is she pounced joyfully just my luck he took it ruefully i thought you said she was so pure and wonderful she reminded him he winced that wouldnt prevent her bullying me he replied somewhat lamely what about the taming of the shrew she asked by jove youre right jinny petruchios the game whips and scorpions what his face took on a little of its old colour its getting up so early that has upset me after all jinny a lovely woman who loves you and puts all her money on you isnt to be picked up every day of course not anyhow its too late to change now dont say that as if i didnt want to change before there was anything to changeoh you know what i mean its too late now she repeated firmly she stood over him a sternfaced little monitor of duty come along go aheadthe rosewreathed victim will be at the altar they moved on a little he paused as with sudden hopefulness you dont happen to know if theres a great oak chest with a spring lock in foxearth farm how should i know she murmured apprehensive now for his reason he sighed well never minditll all be all right at night and whats it all for anyhow wife of the above he read out weirdly how they cling on but jinny had gone off into a reverie of her own the tombstone formula he had recited struck a longburied memory and in a flash she saw again a quiet graveyard and a stone behind a tumbledown tower and commander daps blackgloved forefinger tracing out her mothers epitaph to a strange solemn little girl all the wonder and glamour of childhood was in that flash all the strangeness of life and time and her eyes filled with tears when the mist cleared away mr flippance was gone she ran frantically around among the tombs like a sheepdog till at length the sound of mr fallows ecclesiastical voice floated out to her and hurrying back into the church she felt foolish and tranquillized to find the service well forward xi jinny had misread mr fallows look it was not fear of dragging on beyond the legal hournoon was still too remotebut impatience at being kept away from his antiquarian lore by such trifles as matrimony especially matrimony which was no longer as in prereformation days preceded by the holy communion and symbolic of the union of christ and his church had there been a carecloth to be thrown over the couples heads such as existed in essex churches in even matrimony might have interested him but as it was his thoughts ran on old cheeses he had been comparing his latin edition of camdens britannia with the twovolume folio translation a century later by a worthy bishop and was half scandalized half excited to find that the translator had introduced a wealth of new matter incidentally mr fallow had learned the hundred was celebrated for its huge cheesesinusitat magnitudinisof ewes milk and that to make them the men milked the ewes like women elsewhere and these huge cheeses were consumed not only in england but exportedad saturandos agrestes et opificesto satisfie the coarse stomachs of husbandmen and labourers as the bishop put it when had this manufacture of giant cheeses from ewes milk died out in essex mr fallow had already seized the opportunity of interrogating mrs purley whose reputation as a cheesemaker had reached him but appalled by the voluminousness of her ignorance he had taken sanctuary in his church and was still brooding over the problem as his lips framed the more trivial interrogatories of the ceremony for jinny however it was a thrilling moment when mr fallow lackadaisically called upon the couple as ye will answer at the dreadful day of judgment to avow if they knew any impediment to their lawful union that in face of so formidable a threat neither came out with mr duke though she still half expected him to pop up in person from the void was for her sweet stupidity the final proof of the brides immaculacy and the whole service she thought beautiful and moving having missed the gross beginning thereof she was startled to hear the bridegroom addressed by mr fallow as anthony and the bride with equal familiarity as bianca cleopatra otherwise the ceremonial seemed far too highflown for this terrestrial twain though somehow not at all transcending the relationship in which her own soul could stand towards its spiritual comrade but the replies of the three principals came all in unexpected wise mr flippances i will was so ready and ringing and his countenance so rosy that jinny wondered which was the actorthe flippance of the churchyard or the flippance of the church the exduchess on the other hand still pallid faltered her affirmation almost in a whisper at any rate it was not so loud as his comment ive told you always to speak sharp on your cue certainly no husband could ever have asserted himself at an earlier momentwas he perhaps already following jinnys hint or was it only the stagemanager responding mechanically to stimulus as for mrs purley she showed even more stagefright her i do failing even as a gesture and having to be prompted too small a speaking part for her commented tony later with a twinkle when everything was over and the register signed and barnaby breaking down under the weight of his financial duties had wished the bride many happy returnsa felicitation only dispelled by his father saluting her as mrs flippancethat now reassured lady sweeping regally to her carriage her train over one arm and her husband over the othersmiled at the admiring avenue of villagers and small boys as though they had thrown her the bouquet she held when mr flippance gay and debonair had handed mrs flippance looking goldenhaired again into their barouche and been driven off with the hood up and his beautiful doll beside him jinny perceived will handing the gorgeously gowned blanche with parallel ceremoniousness into the coach where the transmogrified miss gentry was already installed behind the bulwark of her great bouquet and then jinny became aware of barnaby hovering shyly between her and the trap which held his parents and indicating dumbly that the niche vacated by his sister was now for her she had a sudden feeling that they did not want her in the coach beside those grand gowns hunched out with starched petticoats as if she would have set foot in it no not for all the gowns in the world but they were right she thought bitterlywhat had she to do with all this grandeur and happiness the honeymoon was even to be in boulogne she had gathered and she heard some force welling up from the dark depths of herself cry to barnaby i cant comeim so sorry but granfer was upset in the night please excuse me to mr flippance at this the bitterness passed from her soul to poor barnabys everybody was pairing off the flippances his parents will and his sister there was nobody left for him but miss gentry but therell be oysters as well as dumplings he pleaded will brought them from colchester jinnys famished interiorin making such a skimpy breakfast it had counted on the wedding mealseconded his plea desperately but the mention of will was fatal as a hermits sick fantasy conjures up the temptation he knows he will resist so jinny saw yearningly vividly but hopelessly the spread banquet the dumplings soused in gravy the brown bread and butter for the oysters the juicy meats the mysterious champagnebottles the sunny napery the laughing festival faces and above all the curly aureole of wills hair im sorry she repeated veraciously in a panic the youth ran after the receding barouche jinny wont come he gasped dont stop coachman said mrs flippance sharply tell her called back mr flippance she mustor ill never ask her to my wedding again poor barnaby tore back to the coach i say miss gentry youre a friend of jinnysdo make her come a friend of jinnys it was an even unluckier remark than the reference to will a patron an educator an interpreter of herbs and planets gracious and kindly who might evenin privateadmit the little carrier to confidences and pythian inspirations yes but a friend how came mr flippance to commit such a faux pas as to bring a carrier into equality with her and blanche why had not the adorable cleopatra been firmer with the man i cant order her to come she reminded barnaby majestically its not like for a parcel as the horses tossed their weddingfavours and the coach jingled off with its fashionable burden even the trap moving on under the stimulus of mrs purleys rhetoric the whole scene became a blur to jinny and standing there by the old pillionsteps she felt herself dwindled into a little aching heart alone in a measureless misery how tragic to be cut off from all this gay eating and drinking there was almost a voluptuousness in the very poignancy of her selfmutilation what a blessing we all do run to hay she brooded in a warm flood of selfpity but if jinny thus saw the weddingguests through a blur of selftorturing bitterness their feast did not begin as merrily as she beheld it despite that mrs purley as soon as she had exchanged her bonnetcap with the net quilting for a home cap served up unexpected glasses of gin anthony no less than barnaby was upset by jinnys absence and cleopatra resented this fuss over a super but still more disgruntled by the gap at the table was odd to say will for his soul had not been so placid as his pipe the glimpses he had caught of jinny were perturbing overpowering as were the presences of the bride and blanche or rather precisely because they were overpowering they struck him as artificial by the side of this little wild rose with her woodland flavour and the memory of their afternoon in the ashgrove came up glowing touched as with the enchantment of its bluebells blanche for her part was peevish at wills taciturnity miss gentry still rankling under barnabys suspicion that she was the carriers bosom friend was particularly down upon that youths nave attempt to confine the conversation to jinny though it confirmed her suspicion of the state of things between those two mr purley in his turn had been dismayed by blanches fineries the young generation forgot that their fathers were only farmers compelled to take lodgers in bad seasons thus it was left to mrs purley to sustain almost the whole burden of conversation but her preoccupation with her little servingmaid and the kitchen plus her uneasiness at eating in this grand room away from her hanging hams and onions interposed intervals of silence even in her prattle and the theme of her facetious variationsher fear in church that the bridegroom had bolteddid not add to the general cheeriness the old wainscoted parlour with its rough oak beams across the ceiling had seldom heard oysters swallowed with gloomier gulps fortunately the pop of the sweet champagne brought a note of excited gaiety into the funereal air and glassclinking and looking to one another and catching one anothers eye were soon the order of the earlyvictorian day mr flippance acknowledging the toast of the bride and bridegroom did not fail to thank mr and mrs purley for the precious treasure they had solemnly entrusted to his unworthy hands a being whose beauty equalled her brains and whose virtue her genius mr purley deprecatingly murmured dont mention it meaning of course his share in the production of this prodigy but mrs purley fresh from her church rle began to feel that she had dandled cleopatra in her arms in replying for himself and his good wifefor the age assumed that mrs purley could not speakmr purley could not wish the newly married couple anything better than to be as happy as they had been literally a good wife eh interlarded tony genially none better asseverated mr purley im close but shes nippy youre thinking of blanche barnaby called out gaily through the laughter i dont say as your mothers nippy in words mr purley corrected with a twinkle he went on to wish as much happiness to all the unmarried people present at which miss gentry giggled and markedly avoided barnabys eye while will reconciled to fate several glasses ago squeezed blanches hand under the table even when mr purley becoming a little broad referred to the time when his good wife had first ventured into the hurdlemakers arms miss gentry joined in the hilarity her passion for the churchgoing cleopatra had convinced her that the stage was not necessarily of the devilthe mistletoe bough she had found was only the same story that had been written as a poem ginevra by a mr rogers who she had gathered was a most respectable banker and she was looking forward to her mistressship of the robes at the coming theatre royal and even to witnessing her darlings debut as lady agnes from the front several hysterical embraces had already passed between her and the bridesomewhat to blanches jealousyand all things swam before her in a rosy mist as she now pulled a cracker with mr purley and read unblushingly when glass meets glass and friendship quaffs from lip to lip tis love that laughs a motto which caused the hurdlemaker to remark that it was lucky his good wife had left the room that loquacious lady had fallen strangely silent the wine which had loosened all the other tongues seemed to have constricted hers perhaps it was merely the already mentioned preoccupation with her pies or other dishes still in the oven or perhaps it was the encounter for the first time in her life with a great rival tongue it consorted with this latter hypothesis that she could be heard babbling now from her kitchen like a cricket on the hearth and her elaboration of a temperature theme came distractingly across the larger horizons of mr flippances discourse playing havoc with his account of macreadys farewell at drury lane that march and obscuring the moral of the vacant succession charles kean pooh not a patch on his father had they seen him in dion boucicaults new play at the princesss love in a maze no then before voting for charles kean he would advise them to goor rather not to go he had never denied the merits of the manager of sadlers wells especially as sir pertinax macsycophant though he knew his young friend willie preferred mr phelps in othello i say whom the mantle fits let him wear it summed up mr flippance oracularly and launched into an exposition of how he would run the national theatre no miss mitford tragedies for him with macreadys at thirty pounds a week still less charles kean hamlets at fifty pounds a night but real plays of the dayhe did not mean the sort of things they did at the surrey which were no truer to life than the repertory of the marionettes but why not say the chartist movement and the forbidden demonstration on kennington common or let mr sheridan knowles instead of talking his baptist theology at exeter hall write a no popery play with cardinal wiseman as the villain hear hear from miss gentry of course there was the danger the censor would quash such plays as he had quashed even miss mitfords charles the first but then he mr flippance knew old john kemble and would undertake to persuade him that times had changed mrs flippance who had displayed some restiveness under the long appraisal of male talent displayed yet more when mr flippance was now provoked to rapturous boyish memories of the censors sister mrs siddons but blanche and barnaby listened so spellbound that they ceased finally to hear their mothers inborne monologue at all it was at this literally dramatic moment that bundock appeared at the banquet with the explanation that nobody would answer his knocking and tendered the bridegroom a pink envelope which he had benevolently brought on from frog farm on his homeward journey miss gentry unused to these bombshells uttered a shriek which more than ever riveted the postmans eyes on her flamboyant efflorescence steady steady said tony opening the telegram with unfaltering fingers take some more fizz and give brother bundock a glass he read the fateful message and the anxious watchers saw strange thoughts and feelings passing in lines across his forehead and in waves across the folds of his flabby cleanshaven jowl then his emotions all coalesced and crashed into laughter noisy but not devoid of grimness listen to this he cried sincere condolences married polly this morning duke mrs flippance turned scarlet hes married polly she shrieked the beast the insulting beast easy easy said the bridegroom to this second perturbed female it isnt him pollys marriedits his marionettes chingford the telegram is marked i expect the caravan is honeymooning in epping forest give me boulogne but nobody was listening to him any longer the hysterics that had been only a rumour in church became a reality now miss gentry had produced salts for her darling and was calling for burnt feathers and blanche and barnaby tumbling over each other kitchenwards only set their mothers tongue clacking fortissimo even mr purley was slapping the brides hands as she shrieked on the sofahe was deeply moved by her convulsions never having seen a doll in distress bundock alone remained petrified the empty champagneglass in his hand his eyes still glued on miss gentry and the bubbles in his veins reevoking that effervescence of the spring in which even a rearward consciousness of green mud had not availed to blunt the charm of opulent beauty through the tohubohu mr flippance calmly scribbled a countertelegram congratulations on your marriage condolences to polly pity we aint got some of that scotch stuff to quiet her said the agitated hurdlemaker whisky do you mean said tony no no that new stuff they should be telling ofdiscovered by that scotch doctorputs you to sleep like and onsenses you oh chloroform said tony ay thats the name masterous stuff for females to my thinking so it is i understand mr flippance smiled faintly but not for cases like this the parsons wont let you use it bundock burst forth they say its against religion i suppose they want the monopoly of sending you to sleep he sniggered happily ill chloroform her mr flippance murmured he could well understand cleopatras fury at being replaced by a woman so superficially unattractive as dear polly especially as she herself catching at any stage career in her impecunious days had not even been married by the fellow can you read my writing bundock he asked loudly proceeding to read to him in stentorian tones as if from the telegram polly care of dukes marionettes chingford come home at once and all shall be forgotten and forgiven your heartbroken but mrs flippance was already on her feet and the telegram in fragments on the floor i wont have her here she cried youve got to choose between us my darling who could hesitate try a little gin he hovered over her tenderly take down a different reply bundock please he dictated the message he had really written condolences to polly repeated mrs flippance smiling savagely i should think so i doubt if he has even legally married her oh trust polly for that shes got her head square on at this mrs flippance showed signs of relapse poor polly said tony hastily fancy her being tied to a man like that i dont know that she could have done much better snorted mrs flippance but fancy polly being wasted on a man who packs for himself another glass bundock not while im on the queens business thank you said the postman but youre not arent your letters delivered what about your telegram true true o bundock what a sense of duty you recall us to ours we must drink to the queen the queen ladies and gentlemen he filled up bundocks glass i cant refuse to drink that sniggered bundock wonderful what one days round can bring forth he said putting down his glass i began with a babyi mean the midwife told me of onewent on to a corpseand now here am i at a wedding its in a cottage by the hollygrovethe corpse i mean we dont want the skeleton at the feast interrupted tony bundock hastened to turn the conversation to the grand new house elijah skindle was buildingrosemary villa blanche pouted her beautiful lips in disgust dont talk of a knackerthats worse than a corpse but bundock was anxious to work off that elijah called his house rosemary villa because rosemary was good for the hair and having achieved this stroke prudently departed before the laughter died blanche seemed especially taken with his gibe at that poor grotesque mr skindle after his departure flown with stuff for scandal and witticism headier to him than the wine the party grew jollier than ever they played pope joan with motheropearl counters and then blanche sang farewell to the mountain by ear likea bird without preliminary fuss or instrumental accompaniment and mr flippance crying encore and bis spoke significantly of the possibility of including an annual opera season in english in his drury lane repertory why should her majestys theatre and the italian tongue have a monopoly ravished blanche gave the lass that loves a sailor her eyes languishing and this led mr purley on to dancing the old essex hornpipe whose name sounded like his own with barnaby banging a tray for the tambourine and wills throat replacing the melodeon to miss gentry beaming in christian goodwill upon the merry company it appeared strangely multiplied at moments but the more the merrier when the happy pair had departed for boulogne via the chipstone barouche what wonder if will finding himself alone in the passage with blanche and not denied a kiss felt his last hesitations deliciously dissolved how restful to absorb this clinging femininity this surrendered sweetness with what almost open abandonment she had sung the lass that loves a sailor at him with what breaking trills and adoring glances marriage was in the airtwo examples of it had been brought to his ken in one morningand he now plumply proposed a third a strange awakening awaited him blanche grew suddenly rigid her imagination had already been inflamed by cleopatra clinging to whose aromatic skirts she saw herself soaring to a world of romance and mystery she had swallowed credulously the exuberant play of mr flippances fantasy round her feats of waspkilling and was willing to do even that on the stage if it enabled her soles to touch the sacred boards in her daydreams will had already begun to recede but now that mr flippance had discovered a voice in her too and operatic vistas opened out under his champagne and his no less gaseous compliments she could not suddenly sink to the comparative lowliness of a boxseat that song which will had taken for the symbol of her submission was really the final instrument of his humiliation rejected by the girl who has snuggled into ones heart evoked ones protective emotions exhibited herself all softness and sweetness it was incredible he did not know whether he was more angry or more ashamed and he was tortured by this warm creamy scented loveliness which a moment before had seemed under his palms to mould as he would and was now become baffling polar and remote blanche blanche he cried trying to retain her hand and tears actually rolled down his cheeks but underneath all the storm he heard a still small voice crying jinny jinny jinny so he had been saved from this fatuous marriage from this supple conceited minx with her imitative scents and mock graces the genuine simple rosebud of a jinny was waiting waiting for him all the time the jinny round whose heart his own heartstrings had been twined from mysterious infancy who touched him like the song of home sweet home heard when miserable in montreal the darling lovable little jinny as pretty as she was merry no real exemplar of the unmaidenly only a dutiful supporter of her grandfather and his business at most a bit unbalanced by her mannish role jinny the girl with the brains to appreciate him and whom he alone could appreciate as she deserved how wonderful were the ways of providence how nearly he had been trapped and caged and robbed of her i dont see what you mean by leading a fellow on he reproached blanche hoarsely with no feigned sense of grievance as he gazed at the mocking mirage of her loveliness but underneath the tears and the torment his heart seemed to have come to haven jinny it sang happily jinny jinny jinny xii on arriving home jinnys first thought after giving the gaffer his dinner and swallowing a few mouthfuls to overcome her faintnessher mood of selftorture would not allow morewas to give methusalem some oats extracted by stratagem from the old mans padlocked barn she had scraped together a few handfuls and was bearing them towards his manger in a limp sack when she perceived that the stabledoor was open and gave on a littered emptiness her heart stood still as before the supernatural true the new padlock was clawing laxly at its staple as if forced open but then it had not been there at all till that very morning and for methusalem to leave his stable voluntarily was as unthinkable as for a sheep to abandon a cloverfield yet there stretched the bare space looking portentously vast what had happened she ran round the little estate as though methusalem would not have bulked on the vision from almost any point and then she peered anxiously over the common as if he could be concealed among the gorse or the blackberrybushes the hard ground of the road marked only by the driedup ruts of her own wheels gave no indication of his hoofs it flashed upon her that padlocks were after all not so ridiculous but examining more closely the one that drooped by the stabledoor she saw that its little key was still in it evidently the old man had forgotten to turn it the cart was still in its shed looking as dead to her now as a shell without its snail though the image was perhaps a little too hard on methusalem but to alarm her grandfather before she had made a thorough search would only confirm him in his delusions peeping through the casement of the livingroom she was relieved to see and hear him at the table safely asleep on his afterdinner bible with his beard thus buried in the text he might sleep for hours in the warmth and buzzing silence lucky she thought as she tiptoed past that he had not made the discovery himself he would probably have accused poor mr skindle again even set out after the innocent vet with his whip then perhaps actions for assault and battery for slander for who knew what horsestealing was unheard of in these parts and who save a dealer in antiquities would steal methusalem no as in a fit of midsummer madnessunder the depression of the drought and his depleted nosebagshe had bolted after all old horses were probably as uncertain as old grandfathers was there to be a new course of senility for her study she wondered ruefully had she now to school herself to the vagaries of horsey decay as she had schooled herself to human but of course she surmised suddenly it was the dragging the poor horse up in the middle of the night that had turned his aged brain and the hammeringin of the staple had lent the last touch of alarm he had been liable to panic even in his prime perhaps he had bolted before granfers very eyes mane and tail madly erect that might explain the uneasy look with which the old man had met her returna sidelong glance almost like nips squint after an escapadehis taciturnity as of a culprit not daring to confess his carelessness as well as his welcome blindness to the wedding fineries she had been too desperate to remove but no he would not have sat down under such a loss or brisked up so swiftly under the smell of dinner or pressed the food so solicitously upon her with the remark theres a plenty for both of us deariedo ye dont be afeared it would almost seem as if he had been noting her selfdenial at any rate such an assurance could not coexist with the loss of their means of livelihood it was a mystery the only thing that was clear was that methusalem must be recaptured before her grandfather was aware of his loss such a catastrophe coming after the scene in the small hours might have as morbid an effect upon him as that nocturnal episode had evidently had upon methusalem himself bonnetless with streaming ringlets in her laceadorned dress she wandered farther and farther in quest of her beloved companion it was some time before she discovered that her other friend was at her heels surely nip would guide her to methusalem as he had guided her through the darkness but this abandonment to his whim only led her to the cottages with which he was on terms of cupboard affection and dragged her into the very heart of the tragedy retailed by bundock to the weddingparty to the home of a dead labourer his fitten were dead since the morning the widow informed her with lachrymose gusto at the end he was loightheaded and talked about puttin up the stack the neighbours were still more ghoulishly garrulous and the odour of this death pervaded their cottages like the smell of the straw steeped in their pails and as the housewives turned their plaitingwheels they span rival tales of lurid deceases while a woman who was walking with her little girlboth plaiting hard as they walkedremoved the split straws from her mouth to proclaim that she had prophesied a death in the househaving seen the mans bees swarm on his clothesprop she hoped they would tell his bees of his decease but desirable as it was to meet a white horsethat bringer of lucknobody had set eyes on a wildwandering methusalem nor was he in the village pound she found herself drifting through the wood where she had once sat with will and through the glade where the tops of the aspens were a quiver of little white gleams had methusalem perhaps come trampling here that was all her thought save for a shadowy rim of painful memory bare of methusalem the wood at this anxious moment was as blank of poetry as the lanky hornbeam poles or the bundles of tops lying around one aspen was so weak and bent it recalled her grandfather and the whitebarked birches craned so over the other trees she was reminded of a picture with giraffes in mother ganders sanctum but of horses there was no sign picking up a wing covert of a jay not because of the beautiful blue barring but because it would make fishing flies for uncle lilliwhyte she now ran to his hut with a flickering hope that he would have information but it was empty of him and she saw from the absence of his old flintlock that he was sufficiently recovered to be poaching she emerged from the wood near miss gentrys cottage but the landlady who had the deserted squibs in her arms could only calculate that methusalem had left his stable at the same moment as the dead labourers soul had flown out of his body and that there was doubtless a connexion harses has wunnerful sense said the good woman jinny agreed but withheld her opinion of humans she felt if only all the horses jogging along these sunsplashed arcades of elms could speak the mystery would soon be cleared up for methusalem was of a noserubbing sociability but it was only the drivers of all these lazyrolling cartsfodder straw timber dung what notthat presumed to speak for their great hairylegged beasts to one wagoner lying so high on his goldenhued load that his eye seemed to sweep all essex she called up with peculiar hope he confessed he had been drowsing in the heat so mungy he pleaded indeed the afternoon was getting abnormally hot and stuffy and jinny had to defend her bare head from the sun with her handkerchief hedgers and ditchers had seen as little of a masterless bareflanked methusalem as the thatcher with his more advantageous viewpoint leisurely driving in the stakes with his little club this kneepadded corduroyed elder opined that it would be tempesty and they could do with some rain that the rain was indeed wanted as badly as she wanted methusalem was obvious enough from the solitude about the white gibbetshaped silverlane pump and the black barrel on wheels round which aproned lankbosomed women should have been gossiping jug or pail in hand in the absence of this congregation jinny had to perambulate the greenandwhite houses of the great square and hurl individual inquiries across the wooden doorboards that safeguarded the infants only the village midwife had seen a horse like methusalem as she returned from a case she had been too sleepy though to notice properly from this futile quest jinny came out on the road again but wheelwright and blacksmith ploughman and gipsy publican and tinker all were drawn blank beside trees tidily bounding farms or meadows dotted with cows and foals and every kind of horse except methusalem past grotesque quaintchimneyed houses half brick half weatherboard the road led jinny on and on till it took her across the bridge here on the bank she recognized the plastered hair of mr charles mott who was fishing gloomily no he had not seen a white horseworse luckand would to god he added savagely that he had never seen a black sheep jinny hurried off as from a monster of profanity for mr motts disinclination for his wifes society especially on chapel days was she knew beginning to perturb the peculiars and with the sacramental language of the marriage service yet ringing in her ears it seemed to our guileless jinny ineffably wicked to be sunk in selfish sport instead of cherishing and comforting the woman to whom you had consecrated yourself she moved on pensivelythe road after descending rose somewhat so that long bradmarsh seemed to nestle behind her in a hollow a medley of thatch and slate steeple and chimneystacks hayricks and innsigns and fluttering sheets and petticoats but the forward view seemed far more bounded than usual deprived as it was of the drivers vantagepoint to the toiling pedestrian her familiar landscape was subtly changed and this added to the sense of change and disaster she passed foxearth farm near enough to see again the barouche now awaiting the honeymooners and to hear the voices of will and blanche mingling in a merry chorus there was an aching at her heart but everything now came dulled to her as through an opiate methusalem was the only real thing in life she wanted to make her inquiry of the driver but her legs bore her onwards to a glade where she could rest on one of mr purleys felled trunks even there the chorus pursued her spoiling the music of the little stream that babbled at her feet and the beauty of willowherb and tall yellow leopardsbane and those white bellblossoms of convolvulus twining and twisting high up among the trees still standing it was well past five before footsore and spent she stopped on her homeward road at the pennymole cottage for information and a glass of water this must be her last point for standing as it did at the four wantz way it overlooked every direction in which methusalem could possibly have gone had he come thus far while the size of the pennymole family provided over a score of eyes she found herself plunged into the eveofsabbath ritualall the seven younger children being scrubbed in turn by the mother in a single tub of water and left to run about in a state of nature or varying stages of leisurely redressing but neither the nude nor the semidecent nor mrs pennymole herself with her bar of yellow soap had seen even the tip of methusalems tail and the extinction of this last hope left jinny so visibly overcome that the busy mother insisted on her sitting down and waiting for tea she urged that father would soon be home as well as the two elder boys all at work in different places and happen lucky one of the three would have seen the missing animal jinny felt too weak to refuse the tea and though the thought of her neglected grandfather was as gnawing as her hunger she reasoned with herself that she would really get to him quicker if refreshed the elder lads came in very soon one after the other each handing his days sixpence to his mother and receiving a penny for himself but neither brought even a crumb for jinny mrs pennymole beguiled the time of waiting for the master and the meal by relating in view of the labourers death how she had lost two children five years ago no fewer than four were down at once with the black thrush two boys lay on the sofa one at each end an infant in the bassinet under the table and a girl in the bed one of the sofa patients had swellings behind his ears the size of eggs but they were lanced and he lived to earn his three shillings a week the other a fine lad of thirteen died at three in the afternoon the girl died at halfpast eleven at nightbeautiful she looked like a wax statue the undertaker was afraid to put them in their coffin afraid to bring contagion to his own children perhaps your husband would do it he suggested to her but her husband poor man couldnt how would you like to put your childer in coffins he asked the undertaker the doctor wouldnt let her follow the funeral she was so broken but it was jinny who was broken now these reminiscences were more painful for her than for the mother whoinexhaustible fountain of lifescoured her newer progeny to their accompaniment yes existence seemed very black to jinny sitting there without food or will or methusalem or anything but a grandfather and the china owl with a real coloured handkerchief tied round its head which was the outstanding ornament of the mantelpiece seemed in its grotesque gloom an apt symbol of existence she was very glad when cheery brawny mr pennymole burst in labouring with a story in which whiskershaking laughter bubbled through a humorous stupefaction he had begun to tell the story almost before he had perceived and greeted jinny and methusalems disappearance on which he could throw no light served to enhance it to him too the day had brought an earthshaking noveltythere must be something in the moon for thirty years he explained as he took off his coat and boots though not his cap he had risen at halfpast four but waking that morning at one oclock he had got to sleep again and the next thing he knewafter what seemed to him a little light slumberwas a child saying mother whats the time halfpast five mother had repliedmrs pennymole here corroborated the statement at some length adding that it was jemima who inquired she being such a light sleeper and always so anxious to be off to school an interruption that her lord sustained impatiently for this was the dramatic moment of the story halfpast five up he had jumped never made his fire nor his tea never had his pipe and instead of leaving home at twenty to six still smoking it he had rushed round to his brotherinlaws where fortunately he was in time for the last cup o tea and then out with his horses as usual and i made him tea and sent it round to the field gurgled mrs pennymole as she unhooked her bodice for the last baby he had two teas mr pennymole and jinny joined in her laugh sometimes ive woke at arfpast three he explained carefully but then i felt all right he recapitulated the wonder of his oversleeping himself as he drew up to the table where the bulk of his progeny was already installed and it overbrooded his distribution of bread and jam in great slices and i was up at four mrs pennymole bragged waggishly yes upstairs mr pennymole retorted sharp as his knife and the table was in a roar not to mention the four corners of the room where those of the brood squatted who could not find places at the board everybody sat munching the ritual hunk though for the black strong tea the adults alone had cups two mugs circulating among the swarm of children whose clamours for their fair turn had to be checked by paternal cries for silence mrs pennymole pressed both husband and guest to share her little piece of fat pork fried with bread but they knew better what was due to a nursing mother jinny felt grateful enough for the bread and jam and the tea cheap but at least not from burnt crusts and sugared abundantly despite that sugaras mrs pennymole complainedhad gone up something cruel but though such a meal was luxury for her nowadays she could hardly help wistful mouthwatering visions of the weddingfeast from the known dumplings to the unknown champagne it was for a strange company she had exchanged the weddingparty she thought ruefully as she refused a third slice of bread she could not well accept it when each child solemnly asked in turn whether it would like a second had replied with wonderful unanimity in the affirmative and mr pennymole with his eye on the waning loaf had remarked that children had wonderful healthy appetites though that was better than doctors she was glad however to be given a wedge of bread and cheese though when her host jabbed his into his mouth at the point of his knife it called up a distressing memory of a gobbet of weddingcake thrown to a dog and she became suddenly aware that nip was no longer with her she remembered seeing him last as she sat on the log and she rightly divined thatwiser than shehe had gone to the weddingmeal before she could get away from her barmecide banquet the brotherinlaw and his wife came in and then the whole story of the oversleeping had to be laughed and marvelled over afresh the more often mr pennymole told the story the more his sense of its whimsicalness and wonder grew upon him and the more his audience enjoyed it i made his tea cackled mrs pennymole i sent it round to the field so he had two teas the cottage rocked with laughter only the owl and jinny preserved their gravity and even jinny could not resist the infection when mrs pennymole boasted to her visitors that she herself had been up at four and mr pennymole with an air of invincible shrewdness pointed out that it was upstairs she had been so that though neither of the newcomers could throw light upon the methusalem mystery jinny left the cottage refreshed by more than tea and with the flavour of the corpsetalk washed away the humour of it all even went with her on her long homeward tramp in imagination she heard the oddness of the oversleeping and the duplication of the teas still savoured with grins and guffaws while the little ones dribbled bedwards while the elder boys were scrubbed in the scullery and while the indefatigable mrs pennymole was washing the hero of the history down to his waist her fancy followed the tale spreading over the parish told and retold borne by bundock to ever wider circles adding to the gaiety of the hundred abiding as a family tradition when that babe at mrs pennymoles breast was a grandmotherthe tale of how for thirty years mr pennymole had got up at halfpast four and how at long last the record was broken speeding along in this merrier mood jinny had almost reached home by a short cut through the woods when she espied a gaystringed battered beaver and learned the tragic truth xiii uncle lilliwhyte was carrying by its long legs the spoil of his rusty flintlockjinny was glad to see it was only a legitimate curlew with its daggerlike bill he offered the bird for sale but she was afraid it had fed too long on the marsh mud she was glad to hear though he had called that very morning and sold her grandfather trufflesuncle had a pigs nose for truffles and her grandfather a passion for them he hadnt got change for a foivepun note uncle lilliwhyte reported and oi hadnt neither he chuckled so ye owes me tuppence jinny was amused at her grandfathers magnificent mendacityhis lordly way of carrying off his pennilessness never mind the twopence now she said you havent seen methusalem i suppose she had supposed it so often that she took the answer for granted this reply struck her like a cannonball not since lijah skindle took him away this marnin elijah skindle took him she gasped breathless yet relieved what for where had her grandfathers fears been justified then to his orspital oi reckon trottin behind the trap he was tied to it a sick oss dont want to goo that pace though thinks oi twould be before bever he added when she demanded the exact hour when i was at church but methusalem wasnt sick when i left home must ha been took sickor it stands to reason your granfer wouldnt ha let him goo but granfer didnt know arxin your pardon jinnymr quarles waved to em as they went off and oill be thankful to you for the tuppence needin my sunday beer she groped in her purse but if mr skindle took him back to chipstone how comes it nobody has seen him he went roundabouts by bog lane and squash end tis all droiedup nowadays and took bidlakes ferry oi reckon stead o the bridge a sinister feeling as yet formless began to creep into jinnys veins handing the nondescript his twopence and the jay feather she ran out of the wood and then in the dusking owllight by a fieldpath and through a prickly hedge of dogrose and blackberry that left her with scratched fingers into her own little plot of ground the stable door was now locked though its aching emptiness was still visible through the weatherboarding as she passed by the housedoor was even more securely fastened and all the windows were tightly closed she rattled the casement of the livingroom and heard her grandfather finally hobbling down the stairs he examined her cautiously through the little panes yeve left me in the dark he complained turning the windowclasp oim famished where you been gaddin in that frock did you send methusalem away she cried impatiently he put a scooped hand to his ear what be you asayin open the door she called angrily you mustnt shut me out weve got to be careful jinny he moved to the door theres a sight o bad charriters about yes indeed what did mr skindle want here she asked as the bolts shot back skindle he pondered young lijah dye mean he brought me a pot that was long agowhat did he want this morning this marnin oh aythe sidelong look returned with remembrance and was succeeded by one of defiancethats my business a terrible suspicion flashed upon jinny you havent sold methusalem she cried he winced thats my property daniel quarles carrier and by the good rights oi you have sold him she hissed in a fury strange to herself and she found herself shaking the old man by the arms shaking him as he had shaken her that very morning in the small hours and he was cowering before her the fierce old man cowering there on his own doorstep oi couldnt see ye starve he pleaded oh its not me you were thinking of she said harshly not caring whether she was just or not you might have trusted yourself to me after all these years indignation at elijahs supposed swindling mingled with her wraththe idea of his getting methusalem an animal worth his weight in gold for a miserable fivepound note she gave the old man a final shake imaginatively intended for mr skindle wheres the money she cried letting him go he recovered himself somewhat thats my money he said sullenly but where have you put it cunning and obstinacy mingled in his eye oive put it safe agin all they thieves i dont believe youve got any money she said matching cunning by cunning you just let mr skindle rob you noa oi dednt oi got more than methusalem was worth really more than a sovereign a suvran he cackled with a crafty air more than double that more than two sovereigns said jinny in tones of ingenuous admiration more than double that more than four sovereigns enthusiasm shone in her eyes through the dusk he hurried towards the stairs youre not going to bed she called with mock anxiety you havent had supper well have plenty o supper now he he his gleeful cackle descended from the winding staircase before he returned chuckling still she had lit the lamp and put out some cold rabbitpie and a jug of beer on the tigerpainted tray a foiver he cried waving it she snatched at the note and tore it in two and let the pieces flutter away help thieves shes robbed me screamed the gaffer he scrambled on his knees after the fragments hush how dare you sell methusalem he cowered again before her passion that was eating us out of house and home he whimpered get up theres your supper he rose like a scolded child clutching the scraps of thin paper she put on her bonnet where ye gooin to mr skindle of course too late for that no it isnt but ye wont git methusalem back oh wont i though but yeve tore up his foiver i dont care but alarmed at heart over her insane deed she took the pieces from his unresisting hand and put them in her purse dont bolt me out or ill break the window but listen dearie mr skindle wont be therethe placell be shut up all the better ill break it in but whats the good o that poor old methusalems out o his misery by now her heart stood still what do you mean she was white and shaking lijah kills at seven he said afore his supper oh my god she gasped the completeness of the tragedy impinging on her for the first time you sold him to be killed no no she cried recovering he wouldnt give five pounds just for a carcase then ef that aint killed yet said the gaffer that wont be till tomorrow night a sensible remark for once jinny thought subsiding almost happily into a chair it had been silly even to contemplate setting out afresh after all the days journeyings in this weather the doomed horses would be shut up in mr skindles fieldshe recalled their joyous gambollingsthe first thing in the morning she would set out to the rescue and yet what if her grandfather should be wrong what if mr skindle killed before breakfast no delay might be fatal and she started up afresh and unlocking the stabledoor brought in her lantern yere not gooin to mr skindle at this time o day protested the gaffer from his soothing tray i must she lit the candle in the lantern well give my love to his mother she thought it sarcasm and went off even more embittered against him she had not gone far before she met the returning reveller nips ears were abased and his eyes edgelong but in an instant aware she was glad of his company he welcomed her roysterously to it but the blackness that now began to fall upon the pair was not wholly of the night great livid thunderclouds were sagging over them and of a sudden the whole landscape was lit up with blue blazings and shaken with terrific thunder and then came the rainthe longprayedfor rain with its rich rejoicing gurgle providence importuned on all sides now asserted itself in a pour that was like solid sheets of water and the parched soil seemed swilled in a few seconds to plough along was not only difficult but foolhardy heaven had clearly thrown cold water on the project she crept almost shamefacedly back to her still guzzling grandfather got a wettin he chuckled sarve ye right to be sow obstropolus and sarve you right too he added launching a kick towards the shivering and dripping animal nip though untouched uttered a dreadful howl and grovelled on his back do you want to kill them both cried jinny she was now sure that methusalem was beyond reprievethe point of mr skindles strategy in purchasing him so as to leave her no sphere but matrimony was penetrating to her mind and by the side of such a dirty bit wills frank and blusterous methods began to appear magnanimity itself to have found out too probably from bundock that she would be away at the wedding the sly skunk xiv for a full hour after nip and her grandfather slept the sleep of the innocent in their beds she sat up watching the storm with no surprise at this unrest of the elements no less a cataclysm was adequate to the passing of methusalem this sympathy of nature indeed relieved her some of her stoniness melted and her faceas if in reciprocationbecame as deluged as the face of the earthmother all the long years with methusalem passed before her vision ever since that first meeting of theirs outside the watch vessel their common adventures in sunshine and snow in mud and rain her whip only an extra tail for him to whisk off his flies withal ah the long martyrdom from those flies especially the nosefly that spoilt the glory of july she heard again that queer ticktack of his hoofs his whinnying his coughing saw the spasmodic shudder of his shoulderjoints the peculiar gulp with which he took his drench how often they had gone together to have a nail fixed or his shoes roughed for the winter what silly alarms he had felt when she had had to soothe him like a mother coax him to pass something and on the other hand what a skill beyond hers in going unguided through the moonless swiftfallen winter night how happily he had nibbled at the beans in his cornercrib or the oats in his manger what time he was brushed and combedwould that beloved mane get into ratstails no more was she never again to feel that soft nose against her cheek in a love passing the love of man could all this cheery laborious vitality have ended be one with the dust she had so often brushed from his fetlocks that joy which had set him frisking like an uncouth kitten when he was released from the shafts was it not to be his now that he was freed for ever was he to be nothing but a carcase nayhorror upon horrorwould he survive only as gloveor bootbuttons as that wretch of a skindle calculated would that triumphant tail wave only at human funerals his own last rites unpaid a remembrance of her glimpse at the charnelhouse made her almost sick fed to the foxhounds perhaps could such things be in a godgoverned world and her cart too would goof the old life there would be nothing left any more she could see the bill pasted up on the barndoors carriers cart on springs with set of harness cart gear back bands belly bands but what nonsense who would advertise such a ramshackle ruin a shabby cracked canvas tilt patched with sackingfancy that on a poster no like its horse it would be adjudged fit only to be broken up perhaps somebody wearing methusalem on his shoes would sit on the bar of a stile made of its axletree she woke from her reverie and to the wetness of her face streaming with bittersweet tears the moon rode almost full and in the pale blue spread of sky sparse stars shone one or two twinkling she opened the door and went out into the night what delicious wafts of smells after the long mugginess of the day the elms and poplars rose in mystic lines bordering the great bare spaces surely the death of methusalem had been but a nightmareif she went to the stable there would he be as usual snug and safe in his straw she sped thither over the sodden grass with absolute conviction alas the same endless emptiness yawned the manger looked strange and tragic in the moonlight she thought of a divine infant once lying in one wrapped in his swaddlingclothes and then looking up skywards she saw a figure hovering yes it wasit was the angelmother so beautiful in the azure light at the sight all her anguish was dissolved in sweetness mother mother she cried stretching up her arms to the vision comfort thee my child came the dulcet tones methusalem is not dead but sleeping at the glad news jinny burst into tears and in the mist they made her mother faded away but she walked in soft happiness back to the house and said her prayers of gratitude and went believingly to bed and slept as when she was a babe so long did she sleep that when she woke the old man was standing over her again just as the morning before save that now he was in his everyday earthcoloured smock and wore a frown instead of a weddinglook and the sunshine was streaming into the room wheres my breakfus jinny he said grumpily im so sorry she said yawning and rubbing her eyes i must have overslept myself and then she remembered mr pennymoles story and a smile came over her face theres nawthen to laugh at he said savagely ef ye goo out at bulls noon yere bound to forgit my breakfus and that eatin his head off too ye know theres no work for him ye dednt want to bring him back back she almost screamed is methusalem back as ef ye dednt know he said disgusted disregarding him and everything else she sprang out of bed rolling the blanket round her and with bare feet she sped to the stable but she had hardly got outside before the jet of hope had sunk back it was but another of her grandfathers delusions but no o incredible miraculous enchanting spectacle there he was the dear old beast not dead but sleeping exactly as the angelmother had said not a hair of his mane injured not an inch of his tail less and never did two polynesian lovers rub noses half so passionately as this happy pair jinny would have rubbed his nose still more adoringly had she knownas she knew laterthe rle it had played in his salvation the threatening thunderclouds had made mr skindle put off his slaughtering till the morning so that he himself might get home before the storm broke the doomed horses he left shut in his fieldwho cared whether they got wet but as soon as the coast was clear of skindle and his latestlingering myrmidons methusalem had simply lifted the latch of the gate with his nose and gone home mr skindle oblivious of this accomplishment of his though he had seen it practised on his neverforgotten journey with jinny had imagined him conclusively corralled mr charles mott returning with some boon companions from a distant hostelry where the draughts were more generous than he was allowed at the black sheep was among the few who saw the noble animal hurrying homewards and he told jinny the next tuesday that she ought to enter methusalem for the colchester stakes his unusual rate of motion was also reported by miss gentry who lying awake with a headache after the excitement of the day had heard him snort past her window just when the storm was ebbing he must have sagely sheltered while it raged and have arrived at blackwater hall soon after jinny had beheld her vision but as yet jinny attributed the miracle to her angelmother and what a happy sunday morning was that with the church bells all clearly ringing come and thank god and her she did not fail to obey them though not without a sharp turn in that padlock and with the little key safe in her bosom and having happily ascertained from mother gander that the fivepound note was valid in pieces she dropped them into mr skindles letterbox together with remarks that drew heavily on her spellingbooks noun adjectives of four syllables cadaverous belonging to a carcase execrable hateful accursed sophistical captious deceitful sulphureous full of brimstone and vindictive belonging to an apology were among her proudest specimens they were not calculated to encourage mr skindles matrimonial hopes chapter xi winters tale thou barrein ground whome winters wrath hath wasted art made a myrrhour to behold my plight spenser the shepheards calendar i pitterpatter was the dominant note of the rest of the year the prayer for rain had been only too successful and the blackbirds whistled their thanksgiving over their worms but humanity grumbled with its wonted ingratitude there were warm and windy days and cold and sparkling days but the roads never quite dried up the short cuts to frog farm became impassable for bundock in the coursing season the longgrassed marshlands clove to the spectators gaiters and when the beagles were out jinny had the satisfaction of seeing farmer gale and breathless bumpkins floundering over sodden stubblefields or ankledeep in mud what time baffled whippersin piped plaintively or jetted husky cries at their scattered pack glad as she was to eat of the leporine family she detested sport for sports sake even the foxhunting though her poultryrun had just been raided and a dogfox had snarled fearlessly at nip from the ditch once when the hare crossing her cart with the dogs at his very heels cleared the broad ditch with a magnificent leap jinny clapped her hands as though at a flippance melodrama sport for lifes sake was another affair and she looked back regretfully to the good old times described by her grandfather when the farmer having finished his days work would go out rabbitshooting to preserve his crop or when the fox could be shot snared or even hooked as a dangerous animal now when poor old uncle lilliwhyte had found jinnys vulpine enemy dead in one of his gins caught by a claw that rising vet mr skindle was called in to make a postmortem examination and it was only because he certified that the sacred animal had died of starvation and not been poisoned that the old woodman escaped the worst rigours of the unwritten law as it was his crime in setting the trap at all on land not his own and his failingthrough a new attack of rheumatismto examine it before the fox died almost resulted in his being officially driven from his derelict hut into the chipstone poorhouse a fate he only escaped by passionate asseverations that he had always been and till death would continue upright by which he meant independent that was in one sense more than jinny could call herself for her store of barley or rye for her breadmaking was dangerously low and she had come to depend a good deal on the food brought by this queer raven at prices more corresponding to his gratitude than to market value she still peddled her goats milk for a trifle among her neighbours the abundant blackberries gave her fruit though she could not afford the sugar for jam she had gathered nuts as industriously as a squirrel she ensured jelly for her grandfather by making it out of her own apples while by exchanging the bad apples with a neighbour who kept pigs she got methusalem some green fodder in the shape of tares but it was an unceasing strain to keep things going in the old style and uncle lilliwhytes spoils were more than welcome for his activities varied from codlingfishing to eelspearing and from fowling on the saltings to collecting glasswort for pickling his rabbits and hares came with suspiciously injured legs and jinny seeing the bloodyblobbed eyes could only hope they had not been long in his wire loops as she felt the long warm beautiful bodies she had to tell herself how pernicious they were to the rootcrops or the young appletrees more legitimate spoils arrived when the old man was well enough to crawl to the nearest saltmarsh with his ancient fowlingpiece for when the ebb bared the mud countless seabirds came to feed and more than once a brace of mallards offered jinny a vivid image of her inferiority to the rival carrier so gorgeously shimmering was the males head so drab the females for while the driver of the flynt flyer had been blossoming out in the frockcoat he had first sported for the flippance wedding jinny had been refraining even from her furbishedup gown reserving it mentally for a last resource and feeling herself lucky that it was still unpawned but one day when the vehicles metfor despite the heaviness of the going jinny foolishly and extravagantly continued to plod her miry roundsshe caught will looking down so compassionately at her spotting shoes that she straightway resolved to buy another pair at any sacrifice savage satisfaction at her defeat she could have borne but this pity she would not brook better sell the goats especially as granfer would need a new flannel shirt for the winter the animals were not very lucrative and one out of the three would suffice to supply milk for herself andby its bleather grandfathers sense of stability but she had reckoned insufficiently with this last he admitted he had no great stomach for her goats cheese and felt a middling need for flannel but he clung to his nannies as though without them his world would fall to pieces that her shoes were doing so he did not remark in the endthough she shrank from the three golden balls on her own behalfthere was nothing for it but to pledge her weddingfrock under pretence it was a customers but in her dread lest the pawnbroker should recognize the dress the sharpness which extracted the utmost from him for her distressed clients was replaced by a diffident acceptance of barely enough for the shoes this discussion about her live stock however gave her an idea she carted part of her poultry to and fro in a crate and their clucking and fluttering gave an air of liveliness to the business and made even will flynt believe it had woke up again especially as he saw the smart new shoes on the little feet supplemented presently by a new winter bonnet which despite his experience with his own mothers bonnet he did not divine was merely an old one whitened and remodelled by miss gentry thus the equinoctial season found the little carrier still upon her seat defiant of competition and radiating prosperity from the crown of her bonnet to the sole of her shoe even the plainness of her skirt and shawl seemed only an adaptation to the weather but she would have been better off by her log fire making the local variety of limerick lace with which she was on other days trying to eke out her infrequent sixpences though the rain abated towards the end of october halcyon days and even hours alternated with hours and days of turbulent winds and hailstorms and the sky would change in almost an instant from a keen blue with every perspective standing out clear and sunwashed to a lowering roof of clouds spitting hailstones and a gentle wind would be succeeded by half a gale that stripped their flames from the poplars and sent the reddened beechleaves whirling fantastically in november these blasts grew more biting nip cowered in his basket within the cart and the calves in the fields sheltered themselves behind the blowndown trunks of elms shivering jinny reminded herself that the real object of her rounds was the biweekly gorge at mother ganders they were indeed more generous than ever these midday meals so relieved was jinnys hostess to find she had not really been baptized into mr fallows church mrs mott even had the gaffers beerbarrel replenished gratis not that she had any suspicion of the girls straits though parcels were no longer left at the bar for jinny the poor woman was too taken up with her own troubles to draw the deduction from that beneath her imposing blue silk bodice beat a wounded heart and in jinnys society she found consolation for the lack of her husbands for a quarrel had begun between the motts which was destined to shake all chipstone with its reverberations mr charles mott had profanely refused to be peculiar any longer the endeavour to draw him to the wednesday services had proved the last straw to him religion and sunday were synonyms and he had been willing to concede the day to boredom he was a sportsman and was ready to play fair but his wife was not playing fair he considered when she pretended that ratting coursing and dicing remained reprehensible even on weekdays expostulatory elders had vainly pointed out to him that it was only the churchman who made so much of sunday and so little of every other day and deacon mawhood had been compelled to order several goes of rum at the black sheep to find opportunities of explaining to its landlord that his cravatpin and plethora of rings were an offence let him note how his admirable wife had given up her gold chain well i dont want no chain charley had retorted and his cronies still acclaimed the repartee he had in fact broken his chain and would not even go to the sunday chapel you and me have both got our cross to bear deacon mawhood sighed sympathetically to the distraught lady theres saints among us as wont even keep a cat or a bird because the thought of them may come twixt the soul and chapel oi sometimes suspicion its a failing in roighteousness to keep a husband or a wifeparticlar when they riots on your hardearned savings the grievances which the poor hostess of the black sheepnow become a keeper of onepoured into jinnys ear fully confirmed all the spellingbook had told her of the wickedness of manits preoccupation with the male gender had left woman unimpugned but it was more under mr mawhoods encouragement than jinnys that this female pillar of the chapel now sent the bellman round chipstone with his bell and his cocked hat and his old french cry to inform all and sundry that she would not be responsible for her husbands debts it was a procedure which scandalized chipstone since the day when a neighbouring village had set up its cage for drunken men in the pound with the other strayed beasts no such blow had been dealt at the dignity of man but charley and his crew met it with derisory laughter all mrs motts property was hisor rather theirs he could sell the lease of the black sheep over her head if she did not behave herself nay he could sell her very self at the market cross the bolder maintained not without citing precedent by many the bellman was blamed for compromising the dignity of his sex by none so contemptuously as by bundock for the crier not taking his own announcement seriously had embellished it with facetious gags that set the street roaring i wouldnt say if they were funny complained bundock anybody can play on the word peculiar and certainly peculiar it is to put your husband in the stocks so to speak i dont deny charleys legs sometimes need that support but what can you expect if you marry your potboy you must take potluck he he he to which the bulk of chipstone christendom added that however prodigal the expotman he did not waste so much money as his wife lavished on that ridiculous sect of hers a hundred pounds for the bishop at his jubilee birthday it was said with bated breatha noice fortune really charley was only too longsuffering not to take his property including his wife more strictly in hand and when it was learnt that lawyers letters were actually passing between the bedrooms of the parties there was general satisfaction in short public opinion was as outraged by mrs motts treatment of her husband as by her original acquisition of him the only difference was that mr mott was now a martyr the insult to the male sex was especially resented by the tradesmen to whom the martyr stood so profitably indebted and under their incitement a new ban might have been put on the black sheep but for the reluctance of will flynt who though second to none in reprobation refused to shift the headquarters of his coach to the rival establishment that would only be hurting charleys business he pointed out and indirectly themselves the economic aspects of revenge had not occurred to these muddleheads and they were grateful to the coachdriver for the reminder they did not know that his true motive for sticking to the black sheep was that jinny was to be encountered in its courtyard on tuesdays and fridays nor was jinny herself aware how profusely she was repaying mrs mott for her meals as if this scandal among the peculiars was not enough deacon mawhood himself came into ill odour more literally for in carrying out his agreement to clear the gentry cottage of rats he had committed the crime of which uncle lilliwhyte had been acquitted he had operated by poison to wit and the stench of the dead vermin in their holes nearly crazed the excellent dressmaker already sufficiently distracted by the silence of her bosom friend mrs flippance swallowed up in boulogne as in a grave miss gentry like mother gander now wept on jinnys shoulder though it had to be done outside the garden gate and even there the wafts caught one if it had not been for the prediction that she would be drowned did she ever set foot on a boat she would have been in boulogne weeks ago with her darling but like a ghost she could not cross water indeed she would already have been a ghost but for her strong smellingsalts her decoction of scabious against infection and the fumigation of the cottage jinny did not shrink from bearding her spiritual superior in his bar and giving mr joshua mawhood a taste of her tongue if that was his notion of religion he ought to be cast out of his chapel and she would let mrs mott know of what a hoggish illusion he had been guiltyillusion sham or cheatthe universal spellingbook but the deacon standing on the letter of his bond was impermeable to reproachnay had a sense of righteousness as having incidentally punished a distributor of tracts no less offensive than his dead rats not even the remonstrances of mr fallow who had arranged the compromise over mrs mawhoods dress could bring the deacon to a sense of sin still less of compensation her rats were eating the pears like hollamy he said and oive cleared cottage and orchard of em mr fallow was so interested to know what hollamy was that he went away with a diminished sense of failure but neither dictionaries nor octogenarians could throw any light on its etymology the most plausible conjecture he could reach was that it must be hogmanay gifts made at the years end ii but if the peculiar faith was thus involved in scandal churchmanship did not fail to provide its quota of gossip to the months that ended a fateful year it was not only that miss blanche of foxearth farm had collected the scalp of yet another suitor and one who as bundocks own eyes had witnessed at the flippance weddingfeast had been wantonly encouraged it was that the minx whose brother barnaby went about in october saying will flynt was not good enough for her became openly engaged in november to that obviously inferior specimen mr elijah skindle and old giles purley tired of vagaries so incongruous in a churchwardens family was said bundocks father imperiously hurrying on the match although it was the postman who was the reference on the liberties permitted to will at the wedding breakfast it was his bedridden parent who became the leading authority on the new blanche engagement that was because barnaby disappointed of the wider life of the tony flip theatre with no winter prospect but that of chopping down undergrowth and laying it out in long rows for hoops and hurdles and receiving no consolation from jinny when their vehicles passed had discovered in the postmans youngest sister a being even more beauteous and when he had to take the trap into chipstone never failed in devoted attendance on the sickbed it was thus that all the world knew that the flippances had not written once from boulogne not even to send on the promised cheque for the weddingbreakfast but even bundocks father had not the true history of the engagement constructing as he did from barnabys chatter a facile version of a better match how dear lijah was coining money far quicker than will with his petty fares and commissions and fast ousting jorrow and with what elegant furniture he was fitting up the bridal bedchamber barnaby himself did not know that with the gradual vanishing of his sisters theatrical and operatic hopes blanche immeasurably more embittered and disillusioned than himself had sought in vain to win back will and had thrown herself first strategically and then despairingly into the arms of elijah who summoned professionally to the farm had found unhopedfor consolation for his lost jinny tongues would have wagged still more joyously had it been known that will for his part was trying to win back jinny who in her turn was as adamantine to him as he to blanche the two carriers met not seldom on the miry yellowcarpeted roads awhirl with flying leaves or in the rainy courtyard of the black sheep and for each the scene at once shifted to a sunny tangled fairyland where the woodpigeon purred and oak elm beech and silver birch in ample leaf rose in a crescent with crisp beechnuts underfoot and baby bracken but not even nip could effect any visible communication much more gracious was jinny to barnaby as soon as she was relieved of his passing adoration the weather improved for a space in midnovember there was a bite in the air and the sheepbells tinkled keenly from the pastures the morning hoarfrosts held till noon a great red ball of sun and a pale yellow crescent moon would shine together in the heavens early sunsets seen through bare branches seemed to fill them with a golden fruitage that changed slowly to lemon and the haystacks rose magically through enchanted hazes but the cold only made jinny hungrier and the earthbeauty sadder it was as if she had already forgotten the blessing of methusalems return and as if carrying was not after all the hearts deepest dreamespecially with nothing to carry it was a relief to be blocked occasionally by master peartrees sheep billowing along like a yellow nile and to exchange conversation with the shepherd now at the most leisured moment of his year patiently she would hear how the sheep got ravenous in the high cold winds why he was driving them out of yon dangerzone of rape and turnip and how the only real anxiety between now and christmas was that one might fall on its back or the hunt frighten the ewes for soon somehow he would be speaking of his nextwall neighbours in frog farm and somehow the family would always narrow to will a grumpy runty lad he described him once sometimes he goos about full o mum other times you can yer him through the wall grizzlin and growlin like my ould dog time my poor missus had her fust baiby hed ha torn the child to pieces he went on diverging into an exposition of how sheepdogs had to be trained to prepare for babies but she cut it as short as she dared inquiring but whod he be jealous of the baibyoim explainin to you he said no i mean whos young mr flynt jealous of she asked wondering how will could know that she had been shedding such gracious smiles on barnaby and when the shepherd replied lijah skindle in course she winced perceptibly but though the sting of the reply rankled she was not so sure as the rest of the world that it was true iii the abundance of black sloes they said foretold a hard winter and as the winter approached jinnys outlook grew darker even to keep a roof over their heads was not easy with the thatch everywhere holed by starlings driblets came through the old mans bedroom ceiling and were caught in a pail and as for the walls daniel quarles cursed the builder who had put in such bad mortar that big birds came and picked the grit out o the lime the rain drove even through the closed lattices to keep the livingroom dry he had made jinny purchase putty of which he daubed no less than three pounds over the rotting woodwork of the window a stumpy piece of log he also nailed to the bottom of the window to block up the crevices though he could do nothing with the top of the kitchen door through the little vine that grew over it and which in some years yielded several pounds of small white grapes and if it was high time that her hall should be patched up jinny often thought with commiseration of poor uncle lilliwhyte in his leaky hut throughout all these rains even from a selfish point of view his health was a consideration if he broke up a main source of supply would disappear and any day he might be at least temporarily paralysed by his rheumatism and need provender instead of supplying it a frail reed indeed to rely on and jinny began to wonder if she had been wise in training nip so carefully not to hunt rabbits with food and shelter thus alike insecure jinny remembering the formula of her sect resolved to ask in faith perhaps too conscious a resolution impaired the faithat any rate providence even with an accessory at court in the shape of the angelmother proved stony and the angelmother herself appeared limited in her powers however limitless her sympathy she could not even make folks demand tambour lace jinny began to wonder if no terrestrial powers remained to be invoked in the old mans behalf what had become of all the children whose names were recorded in the flyleaf of his hereditary bible and only some of whom had their deaths chronicled cautiously she probed and pried into corners she had never dared approach before instinctively feeling them full of cobwebs and grime and her instinct was justifiedeach child had been more obstropolus than the others one of the daughters was always a slammacks and had married beneath her anothera beauty even fairer than jinnys motherhad on the contrary caught a london linendraper on his holidays and looked down on her father who would starve rather than eat a bit of her bread one boy had listed another been beguiled into the navy by that dirty little dap a thirda lanky youth nicknamed laddershad gone to london to see the coronation of king william and had disappeared while his devilmaycare younger brother had shot a rabbit at night and been transported to wan demons land a name that made jinny shudder this last was the only son of whose present locality he was even vaguely aware though oddly enough the sailor son had once sent him word that landing with a boats crew upon an island called wan couver he had come upon ladders in the service of the hudson bay company living in a stockaded fort called after the queen and surrounded by naked painted indians but as none of these children were ever to dare cross their fathers doorstep again there did not seem much help to be looked for from any quarter of the globe that might contain them and jinny was sorry she had not left the cobwebbed corners in their original mystery for as the stories multiplied the old man began to loom as a sort of sinister raven that drives out its own offspring though gradually she came to see behind all the stories the same tale of a castiron religion against which the young generation broke itself or was it only a castiron obstinacy she asked herself after working out that the first at least of these family jars must have occurred before her grandfathers oftnarrated encounter with john wesley it was with a new astonishment that she learnt he had been careful to make his will lest blackwater hall should fall into the hands of his youngest surviving rascal and whove you left it to she inquired innocently why who has the natral right to it sidrach in course as ought to has had it stead o me he bein the eldest hes been cut out o the wote too what goos with the property and whats worth pounds and pounds he was so convinced of the righteousness of this will and appeared so genuinely fond of his brother that jinny was afraid to suggest the strong probability of sidrach predeceasing him indeed sidrach began now to play a larger and larger part in his thoughts his mind reverted to the early days of the owler and gradually the prosperity of those days shone again over the patriarch in babylon sidrach now loomed as a star of hope and daniel spoke constantly of paying his longprojected visit to him at chelmsford designing apparently to drive the cart himself and to inform his brother of the magnanimous bequest that was coming to hima legacy that would suggest to sidrach corresponding magnanimity in the living present afraid the gaffer would actually set forth on this dangerous and visionary quest jinny did her best to discredit the notion of sidrachs opulence and quoted rolling stones gather no moss but the gaffer argued tenaciously that if his eldest brother had not been comfortably off he would have come to seek the shelter of their rooftree or at least applied for their assistance as he must be getting old or at least he modified it too old to work jinny offered to write to sidrach to inquire but her grandfather could not find the tenyearold letter inviting the visit no he would go over and find sidrach instead and jinny was reduced to pointing out from day to day how unfavourable the weather was for the excursion as the days grew shorter and shorter the project finding no opposition to nourish it seemed to subside jinny was almost consciencestricken when one sunday after church mr fallow showed her a paragraph in the chelmsford chronicle stating that another link with the past had been broken by the death last monday from a fall downstairs in the chelmsford poorhouse of a centenarian named sidrach quarles who claimed to be a hundred and five and who was certainly well over the hundred his recollections which were a source of entertainment to all visitors going back to the days when england was still ruled by a furriner meaning thereby george ii the shock jinny received at this was more of life than of death it made her realize she had never quite believed in sidrachs existence and this sense of his substantiality almost swamped the minor fact of his decease she saw no reason why he should not remain substantial now that she had perhaps been guilty of baulking her grandfathers last chance of seeing his beloved brother she did not feel equal to robbing him of his last hope of assistance he might even agitate himself over making a fresh will and it was far better to let providence or the lawyer folk decide on his heir no doubt when the dread necessity arose the youngest son would be raked up from somewhere but that dark moment still seemed far the longer her grandfather lived the more she had got used to the idea of his never dying true sidrach had died though his habit of living had been even more ingrained but they did not take proper care of you in a workhouse and besides he had died of an accident she would keep daniel from that fate even as she would keep him from the poorhouse as she sat at his side by the fire that sunday night knitting him a muffler her thoughts were playing so pitifully over poor old sidrach in his bleak paupers grave that she was not at all surprised when her grandfather announced with sudden decision that he would go to see sidrach the very next day with a chill at her heart as though a dead hand had been placed on it she told him gently that it was nonsense and that he must wait now till the spring but he shook his head obstinately dont seem as ef oill last out till the spring she laughed forcedly what an idea not unless theres an election and oi can buy grub with my wotemoney he explained and oi aint heerd as parlyment is considerin the likes of us youve always had plenty to eat she protested colouring up that aint enough in the larder when oi looks ne yet for methusalem in the barn yeve got to have a store like the beer in my barrel wheres my flitch wheres my cheeses same as were snowbound like the year sidrach went away where would oi get my chrismus dinner tis a middlin long way to babylon but oill start with the daylight and be back between the lights and ef oim longer why the moons arly oill be proper pleased to see dear sidrach againhe larnt me my letters and oill bring him back to live with us now hes gittin oldish it aint good for a man to live alone says the book and thatll be good for us too he bein as full o suvrans as a dog of fleas nip isnt full of fleas she said with mock anger hoping to make a diversion why you scrub him yourself but he went on unheeding daniel quarles has allus been upright and hed sooner die than goo to his darter or the poorhouse she thought miserably that the poorhouse was where he would have to go to find any traces of his beloved sidrach and she set herself by every device of logic or cajolery to discourage this revived dream of the journey he might not even find sidrach in such a big city she now hinted but he laughed at that everybody knew sidrach a bonkka hansum chap with a mosey face and a woice like the bull of bashan and as strong too wery short work hed ha made of master will carry him in indeed carried him outand with one handthats what sidrach would ha done why hes tall enough to light the streetlamps in chemsford these streetlamps jinny gathered still figured in his mind as of oil and she was able by dexterous draughts on his reminiscences to put off the evil day of his expedition but whenever there was visible dearth at table the thought of his rich brother flared up again could blackwater hall perhaps be sold she thought desperately and the money spent on his declining years the thought was stimulated by a meeting of the homage court which came from railhead in the flynt flyer and before which miss gentrys landlady as a copyholder had to do suit and service in the moot hall to the lords of the manor but jinny ascertained that beacon chimneys a ramshackle place with much land had been bought up recently by farmer gale for his new bride at fifty shillings an acre farm and buildings thrown in a rate at which blackwater hall would not even yield the forty shillings supposed to be its annual value as a voting concernwhereas the gaffers view cautiously extracted ran ef you spread suvrans all over my land each touchin the tother you pick up your pieces and oi keep my land moreover mr fallow to whom she had broached the idea reminded her feelingly that old people could not be moved he was keenly interested however to learn that the tenure was an example of borough english and hunted up the local roll of customs th edward iv proclaiming that time out of the mind of man the ould auncient custom of the bourow had been for the heritage to go to the youngest sonne of the first wife at heart jinny was glad the idea of selling the hall was impracticable for what would have become of methusalem and the business of daniel quarles carrier to surrender before the flynt flyer would have been a bitter pill indeed iv when all but the last swallows had departed and christmas began to loom in the offing the sidrach obsession resurged and there being a spell of bright clear weather the only way she could devise to stave off the expedition was to pretend to undertake it herself this was the more necessary as she was not certain the scheme did not cover a crafty design to drive methusalem back to the knackers for the five pounds she would start very early and go not to chelmsford but to brandy hole creek instead of waiting her christmas letter to commander dap she would visit him personally he was after all a relative and would not like to see his brotherinlaw starveof course she would accept nothing for herself already she had intended to skirt the subject at christmas but to ask assistance openly was painful while if one was too reticent one might be misunderstood in conversation one could feel ones way so on a misty morning of late november when the peewits were calling over the dark fields she set out the old man watching her off with a lantern and do ye bring back sidrach he called after her sow we can all live happy for answer she blew her horn cheerily feeling this was less a lie than speech she would come back with help of some sortthat was certain whether she would confess that the help came from commander dap or would attribute it to sidrach or whether it would be wiser to come back with the discovery of sidrachs death trusting to its staleness to blunt the blow and to the news of daps assistance to overcome it or whether it would be imprudent to mention dap at all not merely because it would be hard to explain how she had met the commander of the watch vessel at chelmsford but because her grandfather in his inveterate venom against dap was capable of refusing his favourson all these distracting alternatives she hoped to make up her mind during the day here too she would perhaps have to feel her way but she now miserably realized the wisdom of the spellingbooks writingpiece lying may be thought convenient and profitable because not so soon discovered but pray remember the evil of it is perpetual for it brings persons under everlasting jealousy and suspicion for they are not to be believed when they speak the truth nor trusted when perhaps they mean honestly she meant honestly enough god knew but into what a tangle she was getting she consoled herself with the thought that anyhow there would be no pretending that day in her businessto spare methusalem on so long a journey the empty boxes had been left at home single drops oozed upon her as she started but as the mist lifted though it revealed sodden blackened pastures on both sides of her route the underlying betterness of the weather manifested itself and soon under an arching blue methusalem was almost trotting over withering bracken and fallen leaves in a world of browns and yellows while an abnormally friendly robin perching on the cartshaft and the scarletberried bryony festooning the hedgerows contributed with the gleaming hollyberries to colour her darkling mood there was a certain refreshment too in going off by this new route where she for her part was as unknown it was odd how the mere turning her back on the chipstone road transformed everything even the paththough this was not so pleasant for methusalemhad at first an upward tendency and her mere passing evoked stares and comments this surprised her in turn till she remembered wills disapprobation she did not realize that the visible emptiness of the cart with its implication that she was not plying only driving it to some male headquarters mitigated the sensation and she congratulated herself there was no old client to observe the absence of cargo in the first few miles she met no soul she knew except the taciturn lout who had once directed her to master peartrees shearingshed and who was now preparing a feedingground for the flock pulling out mangolds with a picker and hurling them over the hurdled field from a brokenpronged fork the sheep had to go to this higher ground for fear of floods he informed her in a burst of communicativeness and it wasnt half as eatable passing a row of thatched blacktarred cottages at a moment when the mothers were coming to the garden gates to speed their broods to school she offered lifts till her space was packed with little ones the old cart was now alive with youth and laughter and the flocks of rooks from the elms were outchattered the road lay between great fields flanked by broad ditches along which argosies of yellow leaves went sailing and there were shooters with dogs happy duckponds old towers and steeples black barns gabled old houses with vergeboards over the windows quaint innsigns and mossytiled granges and the ground kept humping itself and dropping more erratically than her home circuit but never sufficiently to spoil the sublime flatness in which single figures stooping to turn over the soil showed like quadrupeds in a vast circle she must needs go a bit out of her way to reach the school which lay in a little town on the estuary and it was a thrilling moment when from her seat she had her first faroff glimpse of the very waters that had beglamoured her childhoodoutwardly it was only the gleam as of a white river with hazy land beyond and on the hither side a few black huts looking almost like vessels but over everything was wrapped a dreamy peace which the clamour of the actual children could not penetrate while in her nostrilsthough it was surely too far off to be wafted to herthere arose the strange salty putrid odour of fenland offensive and delectable and as the road curved slowly towards the shore all the charm and mystery of childhood seemed to be in those barges with the redbrown sails those grassy knolls and unlovely mudflats in which rotting boats stuck half sunken before she could deposit her charges in their classrooms some had dropped off and were looking for treasure in the flat dykeseamed fields they had arrived too early for school they explained but she felt rewarded for carrying them to the waterside when she espied the long low hull and great brown sail of bidlakes barge with a blast of her horn she summoned the trio of females but only the twins mounted to the deck to wave hands at her as the broad wherry came tacking and gliding past the shaggy ephraim explaining in an indecorous shout that the missus was to be laid aside again and this time he was looking around for a nice quiet lodging on shore for her and the girls how handsome sophy and sally were growing she thought how charmingly they had smiled just as if she had never left off bringing them presents what a comfort they were so grown up now they should soon be fending for themselves after the barge was wafted away she remained on the shore a few minutes fascinated by the latticework reflection of the clouds on the water which through their scudding over it against the stream seemed to be going in opposite directions at once she did not know why this phenomenon was agitating the recesses of her being but suddenly there flashed up from the obscure turmoil the lines of miss gentry in her sibylline mood when the brad in opposite ways shall course lo jinnys husband shall come on a horse and jinny shall then learn passions force of course this was not the brad nor was it really going two ways at once and in any case who wanted a husband or passion clucking so suddenly to methusalem that his movement scattered some poultry pecking around him amid golden straw she turned up through the high street at a fishmongers shop she got down and bought a pennyworth of bloaters for her grandfathers supper the man sliding them off a rod where they hung like blackened corpses from a gibbet she was half minded to inspect the shop of the practical tailor next door to see if she could not pick up something cheap and serviceable for the old mans winter wear but there was nothing in the little housewindow not even a roll of cloth except illustrations of mens clothing so ultrafashionable and dear that she was frightened to go in pacha dorsay chesterfields codringtons sylphides peltoes zephyr wrappers etc etc every description of winter coathere was assuredly what he needed but one pound five who was there behind the seawall that could rise to such prices possibly it was here that mr flippance had got his wedding equipment she returned sadly to her cart not even noticing that all these fashionable pictures were simply cut out of the catalogue of the great moses son london the road now led again through great grasslands under shimmering clouds floating in a spacious blue and with gentle slopes and hillocks though little streams had replaced the broad ditches there were rabbits taking the air that showed white scuts at the approach of nip far to the right she left the saltings with their grazing cattle but she could still see them from her drivingboard and the marshes stretched humped and brown and infinitely interstreaked a mudmaze with purple herbage and motley seabirds then suddenly there was a thunder and clatter behind her and she pulled her horse mechanically to the left to avoid a coach not realizing till it slowed down that this was the flynt flyers day for the district her heart beat fast almost painfully and she went scarlet with the thought that will would think she had come purposely on his track why oh why had she just chosen that day there was no turning to be seen and desperately she steered methusalems nose towards a farmgate prepared to trespass but it proved to be only a lift for wagons opened by raising the rail from its slots a feat which methusalems nose could not achieve she leaped down and tried to pull it up herself but her fingers were trembling and in an instant will was at her side hat gracefully in hand the rail lifted up and the gate held aside for her passing blushing still more furiously under the gaze of the coach passengers she led methusalem through and as she passed she said with a sweet smile thank you this was all the audience heard or saw but what was really said and substantially understood by both principals was will oh my dear jinny how pretty and kissable you look in that becoming new bonnet and isnt it silly to be trying to compete with me along this road when though you get business from goodness knows who you cant even keep your old customers on your own route you havent got the tiniest parcel i see nor any hope of one really you would do better to accept my offer of a partnership or better still to get off the roads altogether for the winter is going to be a hard one and perhaps if we dropped our silly sullen silence and began to find out each others good points again who knows but what we might come to another sort of partnership anyhow i am delighted to open this lift for you but what the devil you are going to do in a field just being ploughed is what i shall watch with amusement jinny you perfectly unbearable mr flynt how mean of you to come spying into my empty cart if you want to know i am not out on business today at all its a little friendly call i am making on the farmer i havent like you to work all the week round to scrape together enough to feed my horses two days a week keeps me in luxuryay and granfer too and dont pretend to be so gay and happyi know what a grumpy runty chap you are at home and how youre still hankering after that blanche jones who has thrown you away like an old shoe or if its my refusal to be partners with you thats rankling and you are even thinking after all of a closer partnership then all i can say is you must be the village idiot if you fancy ill put up with blanches leavings dont imagine that silly old coach with the silly wantyhook and skewers painted on it is very attractive to me why if you were to come to me in a coach of gold like the lord mayor of london with six milkwhite steeds spruced up with flowers and ribbons like methusalem on may day and say i love you jinny come and sit in silks and diamonds on my boxseat i should up with my horn and blow a blast of scorn for i hate and despise you and how dare you come ogling me before all the coach and still retaining her sweet smile jinny gazed at the shirtsleeved ploughmen who though vaguely astonished at the invasion of their field continued their stolid operations jinny arrested her cart to watch with equal stolidity the white whirls and long lines of fluttering gulls that followed the slowmoving ploughs with such a twittering and circling and looking so beautiful over the reddish earth and under the blue sky there was beauty too she felt in the youth who from his white basket sprinkled seeds with a graceful motion and when he smiled at her she did not hesitate to remark in her sweetest tone on the rainy autumn spinning out the hygrometric conversation till will felt it almost a flirtation fuming and fumbling with the top rail he took as much time as possible to readjust it in its slots but in this game of patience he knew he must be beaten however amusedly he might pretend to watch her pretences his passengers would compel him to go on and so in no amused state of mind at a moment when the gulls as by a magic clearance disappeared to a bird he followed their example when the whirlwind of his passing had died in the distance jinny came back again through the lift with the feeling that methusalem must think her a fool and wondering if he were not right soon after she fell in with a carter who was going her way with sacks of flour for his master and as they jogged along conversing pleasantly after the failure of his attempt to chaff and flirt she was surprised to learn that he had till recently plied as a carrier on this very road but had been ousted by the flynt flyer it had never occurred to her that there were other victims but as he went on to denounce will she found herself defending the rights of competition and pointing out the service the coach rendered to the neighbourhood and the carter fell back upon another grievance about which he was even more embittered on one of his last journeys a man he had carried from the creek had got off without paying and he had foolishly let him go thinking he was a brandy hole chap and would be returning by the same vehicle but he had vanished from his ken oi thought he was a brandy hole chap he kept repeating plaintively she was glad to shed him at the jolly bargee a small inn with a sanded taproom and no visible taps where amid a company she saw already gathered over frothing mugs he would doubtless bewail the competition of the coach and the trickery of the fare he had taken for a brandy hole chap noon was tolling from the square churchtower when jinny espied again her treasured picture of it rising from a harmony of golden ricks and lichenspotted tiles just as on that happy enchanted day when she had journeyed to the funeral of her mothers aunt susannah how quickly one cameshe thought with pleased astonishmentfree of the detours and delays of custom or the pretence thereof there would be ample time to visit the grave of her father and mother before going on to the watch vessel especially as it was thus on her way but remembering with a sad smile the dispute as to whether her grandfather could go to his sisters funeral in his cart she took care to draw up her shabby vehicle in a nook beyond the lychgate nip had vanishedlike the brandy hole chapshe found probably he was also at the jolly bargee leaving methusalem to his wellearned if not wellfilled nosebag she returned to the gate the monkeytrees and weeping willows were unchanged though in the path leading to the churchporch there was an avenue of young rosebushes which she did not remember and screened by them to the right a freshly dug grave which made her shudder she hastened towards the crumbling towerstill more crumbled nowwhich her memory connected with the sacred spot the blackberrybushes still swathed it though they were now stripped of their fruit and in its shadow she found again not without surprise the familiar stone the object of so much whimsical wrangling still roger boldero lay safely neaped in christ she was almost certain that her grandfather had sent a couple of pounds to commander dap to have the stone changed since the inscription it appeared could not well be emended otherwise yes surely he had ordered that neaped should be turned into asleep for she remembered counting the letters and rejoicing to find them the same in number but on the whole she was pleased the word had not been changed her angelmother had wanted it she remembered in memory of her happiness with roger boldero as she stood there musing on these two feeling her mothers soft cheek against hers and recalling that smokereeking hairier burlier yet somehow more shadowy figure many pictures flashed and waned and most vividly of all came the vision of her grandfathers strong shoulder supporting the coffin and the kindly old commander leading her off stealthily to this very spot and she heard the deathbell tolling again with its long solemn pauses and then suddenly with a queer little thrill she awoke to the fact that the deathbell was tolling that a company in black was bearing a coffin she moved farther behind the tower she was not in black and felt almost an interloper presently there came from the rosebushes the sonorous voice of a clergyman intoning the great words she did not want to be delayed further nor did she want to pass by the griefstricken group which consistedshe saw as she peeped from her hidingplaceof half a dozen men and women all elderly and all weeping with a small band of sailors in the background whose left arms bore black silk handkerchiefs tied in a bow she looked around for another way out of the churchyard and finding a side gate escaped almost happily jumped on her cart and drove off towards the shore thinking pleasantly of the genial little dap and the dinner she would not be too late for a meal which now after this long drive began to seem the paramount consideration the village rose russet from the trees and she curved round exquisite corners of white cottages with christmas roses in their gardens and presently she came out by the grasscovered seawall she hardly saw the sordidness of the shorethe litter of pigs poultry boats sheds barrelsso great a seascape burst upon her broken by a long narrow island that added subtle shades and hazes to the farspreading shimmer and fantasy the water glinting and moving dotted with redsailed smacks and barges even the slimy posts that stuck up from it near the shore had a romantic air being young treetrunks that still stretched odd limbs but all this glory faded into nothingness when catching sight of the watch vessel moored on the hard of gravel at the place where she had first patted methusalem she saw that the flag was at halfmast she scarcely needed to make the inquiry the flag the funeral the nautical handkerchiefs all rushed into a black unity dear old commander dap was dead v a perverse imp kept telling her that the funeral meats would be unusually abundant but she had no heart to board the watch vessel to encounter these unknown fellowmourners she wanted to mourn in solitude and her quest had failed the last hope for her grandfather had been extinguisheddap had followed sidrachand the best thing to do was to get home as quickly as poor methusalem could manage it he should rest not here where she might meet the returning daps and perhaps be recognized through daniel quarless cart but when they got to the jolly bargee where she must have a bit of bread and cheese brought out to her yet she could not tear herself away from this squalid sublime waterside and driving along the cartroute behind the seawall to a safe distance she got out near a little wooden pier and walked on the rough earth of the seawall which was luxuriant with pigweed and seabeet strewn with wisps of hay and straw from passing carts and covered with dead little whiteshelled crabs there was something akin to her mood in the pleasant pain of the acrid mudsmell at the jolly bargee she was jarred by the slow easy laughter from the taproomthe trickery of the brandy hole chap was still under facetious debate before her set face the gorged nip rejoining her at the inndoor with conscious drooping tail turned on his back and grovelled guiltily but she ignored his abasement and having gulped down her snack of bread and cheesean unwelcome and unforeseen expensedrove on with the same brooding air she was dazed by the wonder and pathos of the little commanders death the whole genial breathing mass become as insensitive as his glass eye would he get that back at the resurrection she pondered or would there be his original eye thence she passed to the thought of the dead sidrach the large handsome man of a hundred and five strong as a bull of bashan whom she was supposed to be visiting and she wondered dully what report of him she should bring back to her grandfather abandoning herself as usual to methusalems guidance in this deep brooding she discovered after an hour or so that in his ignorance of these roads he had gone miles out of their way down smugglers lane and when after half an hour of readjustment she had got on the right homeward road her own subconscious gravitation to the waterside took her back to it and while she gave methusalem a rest here the white moon and the early november sunset began to brood over the mudflats transfiguring them with strange scintillant gold and jinny felt a divine lesson in the transfiguration and the solemn voice of the clergyman echoed in her ears i am the resurrection and the life doubtless the commander was already in communion with the angelmother the problem of sidrach was still unsolved when the feedingfield she had seen preparing in the morning loomed again on her vision like a reminder of the urgency of that question she envied master peartrees sheep munching so imperturbably in their hurdles while she had been going through all these emotions and perplexities with their black noses and feet they looked she thought as though they had been drinking from a pool of ink and her thoughts wandered again from her problem and she let methusalem drink from a pool of water though it was only four oclock the moon had turned a pale ochre and was shining full and high in the heavens its continents clearly showing there was no sound save the chewing of the sheep the gulping of her horse the wistful tinkling of a wethers bell and from afar the fainter clanging of a cowbell even nip feeling unforgiven was subdued life was beautiful after all she felt as she watched the great splashes of sunset below the moon the glimmering rosetint on the horizon the glint upon the pool the tangle of magical gold in the branches somehow a way would be opened for her through this network of mendacity but by the time she got to her door the common was covered again with a grey mist just oozing rain and blackwater hall was a place of shrouded terrors no light was showing through the shutters or through the chinks in door or window and she had a sudden clammy intuition that her grandfather had solved her problem for her by the simple process of dying like sidrach and the commander silent and weird lay thatch and whitewash under the moon she hammered at the housedoor and then at the shutters her heart getting colder and colder she tried the door again then hearing nip barking mysteriously from within she went round to the kitchendoor to her joy and amazement it was wide open and a ray of moonlight resting on a little pool of beer on the brick floor showed that the tap of the beerbarrel which was kept there was dribbling even in that anxious moment her economical instinct prevailed and as she was tightening the tap there permeated through the livingroom door a heavenly snoreno lesser adjective could convey the relief it brought with a bound she was up the couple of stone steps and unlatching the door she sent a faint blue glimmer from the kitchen into the shuttered darkness that was relieved only by the flicker of an expiring lamp and a last spark from a dying log in that dim discord of lights she saw her grandfathers head on the thumbholed tray his hair and beard a dull grey spread dividing a darker jug from two beery glasses the absence of his biblepillow seemed symbolic of his degradation who had been with him she wondered what boon companion had tempted him from his habitual moderation she could not imagine she shook him to awaken him and lifted up his head but it fell back in a stupor and under the draught from the kitchendoor the lampflicker went out she groped about replenishing the lamp and trying to light it with a spill from the fire but the greying log only charred the paper she fumbled in vain among the china shepherdesses on the mantelpiece for her flint and the iron and steel gauntlet and going out to get her lightingup matches from her cart she overturned the other armchair that stood in a novel situation at the tableprobably the guest had drawn it up there but the noise left the gaffers snore unweakened well at any rate he had solved her problemat least for the momentshe thought bitterly as she groped her way back to the glimmering grate but even the chemical matches would not light whether by friction or when placed on the charred log evidently the long damp had impaired them and they even snapped under her fingers how lucky it was one need not rely on such newfangled gewgaws she thought whenby a happy inspirationshe found the solid steel and stone with the tinderbox in the gaffers pockets and soon the lamp was lit and the fire glowing ruddily under the bellows then she made herself some kettlebroth hot water with bread soaked in it which sipped before the fire was almost as cheering as the blazing logs and resisting the temptation to cook one of the bloaters she fed the still subdued nip from the bread when he was cosily couched in his basket and with a last summoning of her spent energies she had rubbed down methusalem she tried to fold her third charge but the old man still snored steadily and when she sought again to raise his head from the tray he swore inarticulately in his sleep and she was too worn out to persist or even to remove the tray and glasses she wanted to sleep herself after all these emotions and the long day in the air and her cracked mirror showed her a drawn face that yawned and closed weary eyes against itself but it now occurred to her that she could not get to bed with granfer in the room she must sleep in an armchair or on the settle or stretched on the floor with the cushion for pillow but the floor through her early start was unswept the settle was too narrow and the chair soon got so hard that after a last attempt to rouse the sleeper she put an old cloak over his shoulders a stout log on the fire turned out the lampsetting her shadow leaping monstrouslyand dragged herself up the dark fusty staircase to his room where she let herself fall dressed on his bed she did not dare get between the sheets for fear he might wake up in the night and come up to bed lying there muttering the prayers she was too tired to kneel for she had an underthought that providence was giving her a hint assuredly in the coming winter nights she must leave him in the room that was warmed all day by the fire exchanging bedrooms though not for the reason he had once suggesteda reason that made her last conscious thought a shamefaced memory but her next thought was one of pleasant wondersunshine splashing the whitewashed sloping walls through the undrawn blind of a little lattice what was this strange spacious room how came she there in her clothes then memory resurged and feeling she had slept dangerously long she sprang up unhooked the casement and drew a deep breath of fresh air as she gazed on this unfamiliar morning view of the common and the hoarfrosted fields dazzling her eye with floating colourspecks from the sun that cut redly through the foliage of a firtree particularly she relished the silver rim of the brad now descried on the horizon it made her feel sickish to descend from that space and freshness to the dark airless shuttered room with its musty beery smell and its allpervading snore swiftly she threw open the shutters and the casement and let the light and air stream in the chill draught and the noise she made seemed to rouse the gaffer at last for as she was returning from the kitchen with some kindlings for the fire in her apron he opened his eyes with a start and stared at her wheres sidrach she was taken aback she had not yet prepared her story indeed the waking in the big attic and the puzzle of his condition had driven her own problem out of her head sidrach she murmured should she out with his death and be done with it ay he got riled cause oi wouldnt let him smoke wheres he got to it was now her turn to stare at him nonsense granfer she said gently thats a dream youve been having mebbe he blinked in the sunlight mystified suddenly his face darkened why do ye tell me lies agen theres his tumbler he pointed to one of the beery glasses she had left still standing commonplace as the glass looked with its lees she was glad he had not pointed at it the evening before in the weird moonlight with her brain full of the poor dead dap dont tell me she said in a voice she tried in vain to make stern it wasnt sidrach that was drinking with you who was it it was sidrach oim tellin ye he protested oi put out his beer with his tumbler and his chair to be ready soon as ye brought him back he bein a rare one for his liquor but the hours passed slow as a funeral crawl it got owllight and you not back ne yet a rumble of your cart upon the road so at last molloncholylike oi lights the lamp and makes a roaring fire and drinks by myself and then oi locks and bolts up and stoops down to put on another log and when oi looks up there he sets in his chair in his best sunday smock all clean and white she thrilled again but how could he get in if youd locked up thats what oi says to him good lord sidrach oi says how did you get here come in the coach from chemsford says he the coach says oi wexed ye didnt want to back up the jackanips whats come competitioning here and jinny gone to fetch ye too but how did ye get through the door oi says you draw me some beer danny says he for oi count yeve finished the jug so oi goos to the kitchen with the jug and there sure enough stands the door wide openhappen oi hadnt shut it good tightlyand there passin along the road by the common oi catches sight of the coach lookin all black in the dusk and glidin away wery quiet same as ashamed to be in our cartracks you pirate thief oi says shakin my fist at the driver yell never come into this house save on your hands and knees but when oi goos back with my jug brimmin over sidrach warnt there sidrach oi calls sidrach no answer oi goos about beat out and crazy twixt here and the kitchen and then the clock strikes and that remembers me to look in the tother room and there oi hears him chucklin to hisself in one of they big empty boxes ye left at home this marnin out ye come says oi laughin too for he was allus up to his pranks was sid and oim proper glad to see you old chap oi says with that he comes out of his box with a little o the dust on his white smock and he hugs and coases mewery cowld his hands and face was from the long jarneyand oi drinks his health and he drinks mine and we clinks they glasses together and has rare sport gammickin of the times when oi was in my twenties and he taken me to see the cockfightin and that old christmas day his dog won the silver spoon in the bearbaitin at the black sheep and oi told him as annie were free now but seein as he was come to stay oi dednt want nobody else and he neednt be afeared hed be tarned out ef oi died bein as oid left the house to him by will and testament little danny says he youre a forthright brother but no fear o the poorhouse for neither on us for oi was born with that silver spoon in my mouth and oive got a stockin chockfull o gold and he shows me it hunderds of spade guineas each with the head of gearge iii fit to warm the cockles of your heart and we clinked glasses agen and sang threetimesthree merry as grigs and then the devil possesses him to pull out his pipe and baccar no ye dont says oi not for all the gold in babylon and oi runs to pocket the flint and steel on the mantelpiece and to block out the fire and he laughs and howds his pipe over the lamp and draws like a demon oi rushes to the lamp and tarns it out and then back to the fire but aldoe that give a goodish light sidrach he warnt there no more he was almost blubbering but how did he look said jinny whose kindlings had long since slid from her apron a hansum bonkka man oi keep tellin ye aint ye seen him nowhere wheres he got to just there he sat singin with his great old woice two bony frenchmen and one portugee one jolly englishman can lick all three the quavering melody ended with a big sneeze and jinny fearing the brothers would indeed be reunited rushed to close the window and light the fire though she felt confusedly that her grandfather waiting for sidrach and drinking too freely in his melancholy had probably dreamed it all she was not sure that he had not really seen sidrachs ghost how else would the flint and steel have got into his pocket in any case she was reminded that her secret was not safe in concealing a death one forgot to reckon with the ghost and sidrachs might at any time divulge it suddenly to his brother even if the present visitation was only a dream daps ghost too was another possibility that must be taken into account ill tell you where sidrachs got to she said desperately as a yellow flame leapt up hes got to heaven to heaven repeated the old man vaguely to heaven she said inexorably he hasnt been in chelmsford for weeks he was very old you see a hundred and five the gaffer began to tremble ye dont really mean sidrachs gone to heaven she nodded her head sadly he fell down she explained fell down to heaven he asked dazedly his body fell downstairshis soul went up to god then he come downstairs agen last night dear sidrach he said solemnly he come to have a glass and a gammick with his little brother jinny was not prepared to deny it and though the idea jarred it was after all difficult to see snoring senectitude with the poetry attaching to angelmothers she removed the dirty glasses silently and wheres his stockin o gold he inquired suddenly why didnt ye bring back that there wasnt any she said gently he died poorish theyve stole it he cried theyve robbed me twas me he meant it for no noall he left was used up in the funeral ay they aint satisfied with carts nowadays he commented bitterly like that doddy little dap did you goo to the churchyard to see the grave yes she replied unflinchingly sustained by the verbal accuracy ive got you a bloater for breakfast she added cheerfully thats the cowld chill he caught as a cad gatherin eggs on the mashes he said musingly ague they calls itnever got over it and tramped with his packhorses in all weathers and rollin about here and there and everywheres youll never make old bones sid oi says to him a hundred and five is pretty old granfer jinny reminded him king david only says seventy thats exactly one and a half lives your brother had give me the book he said brokenly with trembling hands she brought the great family bible he had inherited with the house but his object seemed to be neither verification of the text nor prayerful reading for he next asked for pen and ink and then having ascertained the exact date of sidrachs death he adjusted his spectacles and chronicled it with a quavering quill opposite sidrachs birthdate hes gone to heaven he said thats more than some folksll doeven on their hands and knees do ye warm my beer for me this marnin dearie for oi fare to be cowld and lonely in my innards and oid fain smoke a pipe myself same as oi hadnt promised the old man o god vi the year ended gloomily for jinny december was cold in the mornings the fields looked almost snowy with hoarfrost but the actual snow did not come till near christmas her grandfather refused to be moved from his bedroomone was safer from thieves up there he now urgedso a fire upstairs every evening was added to her work but the monotony of existence and of the struggle therefor was broken by two letters and an episode albeit all interconnected both letters were from toby the naval gunner daps eldest son and the one for her grandfather was enclosed in hers as toby was not sure the old gentleman was still alive one of his sisters having heard that there was a piece in the paper about his death at the age of a hundred and five he had only found her own address after the funeral he wrote a packet of letters from her having come to hand in the clearing up for although his poor father with his last breath had asked that his telescope be given to little jinny boldero as a token of love and remembrance he had died without telling them where to send it it would now be forwarded in due course for two months he had borne much pain with christian resignation she learnt with sorrow and respect the other letter addressed mr daniel quarles she had no option but to hand over but did so with anxiety for she had not yet broken the news of daps death and whether he received it with regret or with unchristian satisfaction it would assuredly agitate him as she watched him open it she saw a piece of paper flutter from it and she caught it in its fall thats mine he cried snatching it from her fingers pay the person naimed he read out dazedly whats that that must be a money order she explained though with no less surprise a money order he repeated youve seen postoffice orders surely she said not realizing that they had only become common a decade ago with the introduction of penny postage and that nobodynot even his childrenhad ever sent him one before tis a way of sending moneyyou can send as much as two pounds for threepence how much is yours for overlaid memories of his late eighties struggled to the surface oh ay he said not answering her that was a blow for the carriersthat and the penny post folks began to write to the shops dednt matter so much here but the chemsford carriers complained bitter as the tradesmen sent out their own carts with the goods but how much is it for repeated jinny impatiently he studied it afresh holding it away from her like a dog with its paw on a bone three pound he announced with rapturous defiance ye took away my foiver but this be for the person naimed on the enwelope and thats daniel quarles but whats it for she asked its for me he said conclusively and was going up to his room like a magpie with its treasure yes but read the letter she urged he consented to sit down and study it good god he blubbered soon poor daps dead dead echoed jinny mendaciously you read it for yourself dearie an awful pity a man in the prime of life tis from his boy in the navy as he ast to send me three pounds what he owed me that was wunnerful honest of him to remember seein as oi dont aldoe oi count the lord put it into his heart knowin oi wanted money terrible bad but oi allus felt he was a good chap underneath twarnt his fault he had a glass eye that made him look at the nose like and git frownin and quarrelsome three pound thats a good nestegg yes said jinny glad the death was passing off so peacefully and hes sending me his telescope he dont say that he said peering at the letter again she turned red i had a line toodidnt you notice yours had no stamp ill change your order for you at the post office she went on hurriedly mentally she had worked out that two of the pounds represented the price of the new gravestone the commander had never purchased and the third his idea of interest for all these years doubtless he had been too tactful to send them back in his lifetime anyhow she agreed with her grandfather that it was really all the lords doing for nothing could be timelier even her poultry was now being steadily sacrificed and this great sum would get her beautifully over christmas and new year and start that with a handsome balance in hand but she had counted without her grandfather no you dont the gaffers hand closed grimly on the precious paper thats a nestegg oim tellin ye but what are you going to do with it she inquired in distress thats for annie mr skindles mother but hes rich as rich he dont never buy her nawthen he come here and told me sow out of his own mouth the hunks oi had to pay for her packet o hairpins well anyhow shell have her christmas dinner and thats more than youre sure of she risked threatening youve got the telescope haint ye he urged uneasily i cant sell that thats for remembrance ye can remember him without a telescope and ef he had his faults taint for you to remember em seein as yed never abin here at all ef hed done his duty by emma and king gearge but oi reckon he couldnt see everythink with that glass eye and oi ought to ha carried silks and brandy myself stead o parcels and culch did oid agot a stockin like sidrachs and not had to deny myself bite and sup for your sake and he hobbled stairwards the postoffice order clutched in his skeleton claw do ye write to daps buoyoy and thank him for payin his dues and say as oi hope he wont put no fooleries on his fathers stone and hed best copy what oi had put on your fathers and mothers jinny duly wrote if not in these terms but when the telescope came she felt anything but thankful for welcome as it was in itself it came by the coach she had been too distraught to foresee this though she recognized that it was the natural way and apart from the sting to her own pride it agitated her grandfather profoundly he had been nodding at the hearth but the clamour of the coach aroused him and ere she could get to the door he had sprung up with an oath dont let him over my doorstep he cried pursuing her hes got to come in on his hands and knees he jostled her aside and seized the bolt but his hand trembled so he could not shoot it how can he crawl in if you bolt the door she said tactfully he was staggered the possibility of the opposition obstinacy relaxing had never even occurred to him recovering he urged that the enemy would try to rush over the sill no fear granfer hell never cross our threshold unless you carry him in she spoke with unconscious admiration of wills tenacity indeed the image of the young man crawling to her grandfather or even to herself would have been repellent had it been really conceivable carry him in the gaffer laughed explosively and that burst of derision made him almost goodhumoured he let himself be pushed gently towards the inner room while jinny with her pulse at gallop opened the door the tension and friction of nerves proved sheer waste the long narrow parcel was brought to the door by the hobbledehoy guard and the driver remained imperturbably important on his box looking almost as massive as an old stager in his new caped greatcoat and coloured muffler though the face under the broadbrimmed festively sprigged hat was very different from the mottled maltsoused visages of the coaching breed it seemed but an idle glance that jinny cast at it or at the christmas congestion of the coach overflowing with passengers and literal christmas boxes and with hares pendent even from the drivers seat nevertheless as ever when they met long invisible messages passed between jinny and will and not all her defiance could disguise her humiliation at this second triumph of the coach coming as it did when the fortunes of the cart were at their blackest for the gaffer refused sullenly to part with his piece of papershe did not even know where he had hidden itand with uncle lilliwhyte too poorly to forage for her she was almost tempted to apply for the christmas doles that were by ancient bequest more abundant at mr fallows church than applicants for them but her instinct of uprightness saved her better that the last of her poultry should be sacrificed for the sacred repletions of the season she did indeed dally with the notion of keeping christmas not with but from her grandfatherpossibly his failing memory might for once prove an advantagebut she had a feeling that apart from the profanity of ignoring it the festival was too ingrained in the natural order to be overlooked for did not christmas mark the pause in the year when with the crops in the ground and the little wheatblades safely tucked under the snow and the beer brewed and the pigs killed and salted the whole world rests and draws happy frosted breath no the old mans instinct would surely trip her up if she tried to run christmas as an ordinary day she might of course as he had originally suggested sell or at least pawn her telescope but even if she could have brought herself to that she could not have got it away from him for he had annexed it from the first moment and sat peering out of it from the vantagepoint of his bedroom lattice he was at his spyglass the moment he woke enchanted when he could descry people or incidents faroffit was as if his long seclusion from the outer world was overand he would call out like a child and tell jinny what he had seen sometimes it was master peartree and his dog sometimes bidlake ferrying on the brad or a couple seeking warmth in a cold lane now a woodman cutting holly branches with his billhook anon bundock bowed by his bag or mott with his fishingrod and once he cried out he could see annie coming out of beacon chimneys though jinny suspected that the tall figure with the wunnerful fine buzzom was really farmer gales new wife particularly protected did her grandfather now feel against thieves whose stealthy advent he would henceforward detect from afar delighted as she was in her turn with the new toy that kept him happy even on a reduced diet she had to keep his fire going all day now and to be up and down closing the window through which he would stick the telescope sometimes he directed his tube heavenward though not for astronomical purposes happen oill see sidrach coming down for a gossip he said just before christmas he informed her he had decided that the right thing to do with the nestegg was to purchase sidrach a gravestone with it and he instructed her to write a letter of inquiry to babylon but although this seemed to her a more logical use of it than he knew she disregarded his instruction the nestegg was too precious the time might come when he would ask for bread and was she to give him a stone vii neglected on the coast in favour of new year christmas was celebrated in the inland valley of the brad with the conventional accessories and every christmas the mummers had been wont to attend on the master of blackwater hall as well as the waits jinny with no coin to offer to either the last of her poultry doomed for the christmas dinner and uncle lilliwhyte also on her hands had this year to beg both companies to refrain alleging her grandfather was too ill the weather was seasonable the robin hopped as picturesquely on the snow as on the christmas card jinny had enclosed with her thanksgiving letter to gunner dap the cottage prankt with its holly and mistletoe had a fairylike aireverything was perfect even to the christmas pudding but only nip and methusalem were happy to the gaffer the breach of an immemorial tradition gave a troubling sense of void wheres the waits wheres father chrismus wheres st gearge he kept saying peevishly jinny put him off with vague replies or none once he alarmed her by asking suddenly wheres the doctor she was reassured when he began spouting oi carry a bottle of alicampane he passed on to imagine himself as st george and seizing the poker for a sword declaimed vigorously if imperfectly oill fight the russian bear he shall not fly oill cut him down or else oill die aint we agooin to see the mummers he inquired angrily as christmas day waned perhaps they are ill or its too cold she suggested feebly but theyre gooin around to other folk he protested oi seen em through my glass well then you have seen them she said still more feebly inwardly she wondered if he had detected herself on her way to church carrying off some christmas dinner to uncle lilliwhytes hut the telescope was a new terror added to life she had wanted to invite the prop of her larder to take his christmas dinner with them but her grandfather refused violently to sit down with such a ragamuffin his sense of caste was acute and as jinnys sense of smell was equally acute she would not have persisted even had renewed rheumatism not confined the ancient to his hut the day after christmas that year was friday and after the comparative festivity of the holiday it required no small force of will to go round uselessly in the north wind when one day a week would have more than sufficed for such odd commissions as still came her way the snow had fallen thicker in the night and robins starlings finches blackbirds little bluetits pickcheeses she called them and other breakfastless birds had all been tapping at her window for crumbs but the remains of the feast made a good meal for her grandfather and he was in the best of humours praising the acting of the mummers which he did not now remember he had not seen this christmas and remarking upon the wunnerful fine woice of old ravens grandson among the waits apparently his memories of other years had fused together into an illusion concerning the day before as jinny set out she found herself wishing he would forget his quarrel with will not of course that she could forget hers there were grey snowclouds in the sky and as she ploughed past the sheepfolds scarring the purity of the road with her carttracks she beheld patriarchal sheep standing almost silent with round snowwhite beards only a green shoot peeped here and there from the speckless white expanse methusalems muffled footsteps gave her a sense of dream and when the wind was not in her face she watched her breath rising white in the air with some strange sense of exhaling her soul but beneath this mystic daze went an undercurrent of wonder as to how she could meet the new year returned from her roundand she was glad having shown herself and got her meal to creep home under cover of the early darknessshe half expected to find the gaffer as ill as she had feigned but though he was still peering out into the night there was no sign he was in the grip of the cold on the contrary he seemed to have found fresh strength and brightness whether from the nestegg or this renewed ocular intercourse with his world oi seen you all along the road he chuckled in this new mood she was easily able to persuade him to exchange a goat for methusalems provender he would not part with his three pounds but they gave him a sense of security almost of gaiety indeed their existence made as wonderful a difference to herself as to him hidden away though the money order was she felt the old man would be forced to produce it if ever hunger got too keen and so the knowledge of it sustained her as the proximity of a boat sustains a swimmer it was scarcely a paradox that without its assistance she could not have got through the first month of the new year for january brought the hard winter foretold by the sloes outwardly it was a bright world enough with children skating on the ponds and ditches indeed the frost brought out a veritable flamboyance of colour in the animal creation and at one of her moments of despair when she had humbled herself in vain to offer lace to the new mrs gale jinny was redeemed by the motley pomp of the cocks shining on the farmyard straw and the glowing hues of the calves that bestrode it with them all overbrooded by the ancient mellow thatch her heart sang again with the row of chaffinches perched on the white stone wall and looking at the trees silhouetted so gracefully against the sky she decided that winter bareness was almost more beautiful than summer opulence but she changed her mind when she watchedwith a new sympathy born of fellowanxietythe struggle for food among the birds coots had flocked in from the coast to add to the competition of landspecies and frozen little forms or bloody halffeathered fragments but especially dead starlings with lovely shades of green and purple pathetically imponderable when picked up all skin and feathersometimes decapitated by sparrowhawksabounded on the hard white roads as she began to feel the same grim menace brooding over her grandfather and herself that social unrest which reached even bradmarsh in faint vibrations began to take possession of her and she arrived at a revolutionary notion which would have horrified farmer gale far more than her outrageous demand for a law that nobody should be paid less than ten shillings a week she actually maintained that every man should be pensioned off by the parish on reaching the age of ninety but the view found no sympathy in an age of individualism to which the poorhouse was the supreme humiliation even uncle lilliwhyte who was now on the mend againthough too weak to fend for anybody but himselftold her to her surprise that every man ought to put by for a rainy day it was this slavish sluggishness of the poor that was the real stumblingblock to reform she thought though remembering uncle lilliwhytes leaky habitation she treasured up his reply as a humorous example of the gap between precept and practice even more unsympathetic was mrs motts attitude she scoffed at the idea that every man should be pensioned off at ninety poisoned off at twenty was her emendation well you do your best jinny laughed mrs motts blue silk bodice crackled what do you mean dont you sell them liquor its good liquor said mrs mott flushing i was only joking but joking apart it doesnt do them much good and jinny thought of how even her grandfather had fuddled himself with or without ghostly assistance if i gave up my bar said mrs mott hotly who would pay the rent of our chapel well but the chapel got along before you joined jinny reminded her mildly heaping up debt shrilled mrs mott with flashing eyes then whats the good of poisoning off the men argued jinny smiling where would your bar be without them women could learn to drink said mrs mott fiercely and smoke too but the latter accomplishment seemed so comically impossible to jinnywho had never seen polly over her cigar and milkthat she burst out laughing at the image of it and her laughter made mrs mott fiercer and that lady said for two pins shed wear pink pantaloons like the bloomerites as jinny did not offer the pins but laughed even more merrily at the new picture presented to her imagination relations with mrs mott became strained and when at their next meeting jinny sensibly remarked that if the law really gave mr mott his wifes possessions it was useless going to it all that ladys indomitable spirit turned against her whilom confidante you take his part like everybody else she cried bitterly but dont think i havent seen him ogling you do you mean ive ogled him said jinny incensed i dont say that but you cant dislike his admirationwhy else are you on his side i am not on his sidei detest him mrs mott flew off at a tangent then you ought to be grateful to me for protecting you against him jinny was now as indignant as her hostess how have you protected me havent i kept you always out of his way oh is that why youve had me in the kitchen of course jinny felt at once chilled and inflamed its not true she cried recklessly when i first came to the kitchen mr mott was still in love with you and i only went there because you didnt like to show yourself such reminders are unforgivable and jinny would probably never again have enjoyed mrs motts hospitality even had she not then and there shaken it off it was only with an effort she could prevent herself declaring that mrs mott would have to carry her into the kitchen before she entered it again but when she got out in the cold air she felt suddenly as foolish as will and her grandfather had been with starvation bearing down on blackwater hall like some grim iceberg the loss of two full meals a week was a disaster she was not even sure that the courtyard as well as the kitchen would not be closed to her for mrs mott seemed a woman without measure whether in her religion her affections her politics or her quarrels possibly however the poor lady overlooked her use of it for the cart continued to draw up there with its air of immemorial and invincible custom but if jinny thus still kept up appearances it was with a heart that grew daily heavier in looking back on this grim period jinny always regarded the crawling up of the wounded hedgehog as marking the zeropoint in her fortunes it was actually crawling over her doorstep like will in her grandfathers imagination what enemy had bitten off its neckbristles she never knewshe could only hope it was not nipbut catching sight of the dark ugly gash she hastened to get a clean rag as well as some crumbs and goatmilk the poor creature allowed the wound to be dressed and seemed to nose among the crumbs but it neither ate nor drank she packed it in straw in a little box and placed it in a warm corner of the kitchen instructing nip sternly that it was tabu caught a pig said the gaffer with satisfaction stumbling into the middle of this lesson in the higher ethics thats a wunnerful piece o luck a change from rabbits too you wouldnt eat it she cried in horror why what else he asked in surprise theres bread and theres jelly she said misunderstanding and perhaps uncle lilliwhyte will be round with somethinghes about again there aint nawthen better than hedgehog the gaffer said decisively and tis years since oi tasted one sidrach doted on em roasted used to catch em in the ditchbrambles but weve got to cure this not kill it she protested ye dont cure pigs that size he laughed happily for once jinny failed to appreciate a joke it threw itself on our protection she insisted we cant take advantage of it like that besides its been bitten and might be unhealthy but he was contumacious and it was only on her undertaking to get him a chicken for his dinner that he consented to forgo the dainty in hand to acquire this in the absence of coin involved the barter of the remaining goats in a large and complex transaction with miss gentrys landlady and although this set jinny and methusalem up for weeks yet since it meant the exhaustion of her last reserves the wounded hedgehog became to happier memory a sort of symbol of desperation true there were still the telescope and the money order but one could not easily lay ones hand on themthey bristled even more fiercely than the poor hedgehog all jinnys care of that confiding beast proved wasted in vain she renewed the dressing on its neck in vain nip and her grandfather were kept off the third morning it was found on its back more helpless than uncle lilliwhyte with its hind paws close together but its front paws held up apart as though crying for mercy its nose and paws came up dark brown on the lighter spines around the eyes were closed and almost invisible buried like the ears amid the bristles the rag still adorned its neck jinny gave her poor little patient a decent burial and a few tears taint no use cryin over spilt milk the gaffer taunted her yeve gone and wasted good food and oi count the lordll think twice afore he sends ye a present agen the gaffer was mistaken little bradmarsh was about to flow if not with milk and honey with hares and rabbits and horses and sheep and haystacks and potatoes and mangolds and even chairs stepladders fences gates wateringpots casks boxes hurdles hencoops and wheelbarrows for after january had ended in a crescendo of rain wind sleet and the heaviest snowfall in his memory came a diminuendo movement of sleet thaw and rain though the wind raged unabated and after thatthe deluge chapter xii written in water for in a night the best part of my power were in the washes all unwarily devourd by the unexpected flood shakespeare king john i the floods of are still remembered in east anglia the worst and most widespread were in november but february filldyke brought the more localized catastrophe in little bradmarsh the village lying as it did along the left bank of the brad was caught between two waters the overflow of the streams to the north that ran down siltladen towards this bank and the backwash over the bank from the brad itself which already swollen by rain and by the waters pumped into it from the marshmills on its right bank was prevented overflowing southwards by the dyke that further protected long bradmarsh it was nip that brought jinny the news though she did not understand its purport till the service was over for it was to church that he brought it that ancient building standing isolated on its green knoll flaked with gravestones had begun to appeal to him as much as to jinny and despite her efforts to dodge or shake him off he had become a regular churchgoer nobody seemed to mind his sitting in her pew or squatting by the stove perhaps so exiguous a congregation could not be exigent and in that aching void even a canine congregant was not unwelcome but his mistress despite the sense she shared with mr fallow of divine glimmerings in the animal creation had always an uneasy feeling of indecorum especially when nip snored through the sermon like a christian and she was congratulating herself that the fifthly and finally had been safely reached without him when in he trottedfar wetter and muddier than on the day he had plumped on wills knees in the chapel the sight of him dripping steadily along the aisle towards the stove did not interrupt the hymn the worshippers though the morning had begun with a setback to snow were in no wise surprised by a return to rain only that saturday night it had rained cats and dogs one dripping dog was therefore no alarming phenomenon they did not realize that nip had largely swum to church but when at the churchdoor they began to fumble with their umbrellas they saw with wide eyes of astonishment and dismay that though a mere sleety drizzle misted the air below the lychgate a strange expanse of waters awaited their feet except for one broad finger of land pointing along the centre of a vast yellow lake their world was suddenly turned to water and jinny had a weird wonder as to what the dead would think could they rise and see the transformation wrought in the earthy spot where they had laid themselves so securely to sleep but the first impression of plumbless depth was contradicted by the hedgerows standing updespite their reflectionsmuch as before still with a light powder of the mornings snow and when jinny advancing to the gate amid a chaos of ejaculatory comment that would have done credit to a fullsized congregation probed the lake with the point of her umbrella she exhibited barely three inches of moist tip reassured except for sunday shoes the bulk of the worshippers plashed forwards more or less boldly but miss gentry refused to be comforted she was already half hysterical and clutching at jinny for she recalled her anciently prophesied doom of drowning what was the use of a lifelong refusal to set foot on the water the water was come to her as the clown opined of ophelia jinny could quiet her only by promising to see her safely to her door with a jump the girl reached the four steps by which the ladies anciently mounted to their pillions and running up she surveyed the vista of waters amid which the three pollarded limetrees before miss gentrys cottage rose like a landmark she could now make a mental map of the driest route for from this observationpost though she had a sodden sense of mist and rain and blowiness the sense of an unbroken aqueous expanse disappeared she could see water water but not everywhere nor were even the watery parts submerged uniformly it was like some infallible illustration of the ups and downs of little bradmarsh never before not even under the varying strains of methusalem had she realized how undulating the village was for all its apparent flatness she saw now how much a few feet counted and how the majority of the cottages and the farmhousesall the ancient ones indeedhad planted themselves along that dry finger the ridge they called it she remembered though the name had hitherto been a mere sound to her ear for so gradual was its slope that she had never felt the ascent nor put on the brake in descending but to see it culminating in the common and her own dear blackwater hall was now a cheering spectacle while a whiteflecked windwhipped waste of yellow water was spreading where yesterday blackened pastures had stretched here were brown fields quite untouched by the floodwater with their furrows chalked out in snow one field all winter white with thin blades just peeping up looked friendly rather than forlornsuch was the effect of contrast lower down the ridge were stretches covered with a deposit of silt and leafmould with ploughhandles sticking up and between these and the flooded regions was a halfandhalf world that reminded jinny of the saltmarshes a maze of pools and pondlets and waterpatterns in a greenish slime mottled with hillocks taking off her precious shoes and stockings jinny descended from her observationpost and plunged the little fitten admired of her grandfather into the chilling muddy lake which seemed to have risen since she gauged it miss gentry clenching her teeth followed her example but in the effort to grasp at once her skirt shoes and muff with prayerbook couchant and to prevent her umbrella from soaring off on adventures of its own she made more twitter than progress and when at their first stile nip plunging through the bars dived into the field and swam boldly forward miss gentry with a shriek perched herself on the stile and refused to come down jinny baring her legs still higher strove to laugh away her patrons fears but her very precaution of tucking up had driven the dressmaker into a new frenzy theres no risk so long as we dodge the ditches jinny pointed out and you can see those by the hedges and look up theretheres your limetrees signalling their feet are dry yes but i cant get to them oh jinny go and fetch me your cart do be a love sunday its a question of life and death very well jinny pretended if i cut through that field with the cows i shant be long she said with cunning carelessness but she had not gone many yards ere as she expected she heard miss gentry plashing desperately behind her with cries of wait for me jinny wait miss gentry did not reflect that the cows would not be out in that weather to face those fearsome inches under escort was a lesser evil than the possible dangers from panicstricken cattle that now rose before her mind and with one horn of the dilemma a bulls her choice was precipitated at the four wantz way new terrors arose for the poor lady it was not from the swirl of waters that met there for her road now stretched visibly upwards but from the fact that the pennymoles were occupied in moving their treasures to the high room the genial paterfamilias darting to his doorstepwith the kerchiefed owl he was rescuing in his handhad his own flood of authoritative lore to pour out but he could make no headway till miss gentry had blushingly apologized for her bare feet and been assured that no respectable man would look at them then though his hearers stood splashed and blown about he held even jinny spellbound with a description of long bradmarsh as he had known it in his boyhood before the embankment was put up and when his parents had often had even in summer to open the back door of their cottage to let the water pour out and what a work it had been clearing up the muck afterwards thats a terrible thing the power of water he said solemnly people dont know what it means who aint seen it and its rising every minute what did i tell you jinny cried miss gentry oh mr pennymole will my house be safe its one thing mum to be in the flood and another to be out of it he responded oracularly come along said jinny impatiently your cottage has got two steps to begin with and even if it gets up to your garden youll be safe inside beggin your pardon jinny corrected the oracle that fares to sap the foundations and then crack bang you think its a big gun and down comes walls and ceilings my granfer seen a whole row of cottages washed away and then theres flotsam what bangs about and smashes you in miss gentry clutched wildly at jinny dropping shoes and muff into the swirl and squibs does hate to get her feet wet she babbled alarmed at the effect of his pronouncement the oracle hastened to tone it down and to pick up her things no need to get into a pucker mum youre all right same as youre in the high room and oi count yeve got a grate upstairs which is more than were blessed with this weather that gret ole stove cant git up and you could sew in your bedroom jinny added soothingly youve never known it get higher than the ground floor have you mr pennymole not in my born days answered the oracle but theres always new things happening wailed miss gentry thats wunnerful true mr pennymole admitted smiling oi never thought oid fare to oversleep myself but the day there was that grand wedding at the church oi hadnt time to make my tea and then he had two teas put in mrs pennymole hilariously but before the story had proceeded far they all became aware of people hastening from every quarter towards the unsubmerged regions not for safety but for salvage carts and even wagons with teams began to come up and the bustle and cackle recalled mr pennymole to public duty leaving his wife to finish telling the story as well as transferring the furniture he joined a party hurrying on to farmer gales fiveacre field and as jinny and miss gentry passed along they saw potato clamps being dug up cattle driven higher corn and hay unstacked and transported and even threshing in hasty operation the sunday clothes of those who hadnt stayed to shiften but emphasized the profanity of the scene you see what dissenters are said miss gentry in disgust its a matter of life and death quoted jinny maliciously but miss gentry did not recognize her own words jinny went on to praise the true christianity of these labourers who though ground down to a miserable wage were now dashing to farmer gales assistance even in his absencefor he had apparently not yet returned from his place of worship at chipstone one cornstack saved she calculated would be worth more than he had paid mr pennymole in the last five years in this dreadful day of the lord its souls that want saving not stacks said miss gentry arrived at last on her own doorstep she collapsed in jinnys arms what was the use of not going to boulogne she demanded if she was to be drowned in her bed at least she might have had the hope of seeing her dear cleopatra again and surely the darling must have written must have sent her address bundock must have lost the letters or worse suppressed them he owed her a grudge because she had resisted his importunities yes jinnydead to passionhad no idea to what lengths people born under other planets would goeven though married but extricating herself jinny with that cold blood of hers left her patron to the consolations of squibs she must get home to her grandfather she explained he would be worrying over her fate ii she found him at his telescope as outraged as miss gentry and enjoying himself immensely over the spectacle that shattered his sunday dullness his big bible had been lugged upstairs and now lay on the bed open at the deluge and the bucket that received his ceilingdrippings had been kicked over in his excitement thats the lords punishment on they sabbathbreakers he said gleefully nor could all jinnys argumentsas she wiped up his private floodbring home to him his inverted logic the lord knowed twas in their hearts to break it he persisted and it repented the lord that he had made man oh its not so bad as the flood of said jinny airing her spellingbook chronology wait till the brad flows over the dyke he chuckled thatll spill all over long bradmarsh ay and run down towards chipstone oh you dont think it will get over the dyke she said anxiously mebbe to babylon itself he said voluptuously all the more reason they should try to save what they can she urged time and tide wait for no man and why should any man wait for the tide its like with shepherds and stockmen that cant ever have their sunday come down to dinner but the gaffers eye was glued to his tube thats as good as harvest he exclaimed in shocked exhilaration dash my buttons ef they aint thatchin the stack they carted over from pipits meadow and theyre makin new mangold and potato clamps so long as they dont get largesse jinny maintained the gaffer groaned largesse or no largesse oi never seen sech a sunday in all my born days what a pity sidrach dednt live to see it when she at last got him to surrender the spyglass she could not refrain from taking a peep herself she was astonished at the swift rise of the waters already the hedgerows were disappearing while an avenue of elms rising mysteriously out of a lagoon was the sole indication of a road she had passed on her way to church a swan and cygnets were now sailing upon it with darker and less distinguishable objects tossing around a bed of osiers seemed to be in its natural element as it rose from the waters that islanded a farm the black snowpowdered barn looked like the upturned hull of some squat galleon and the haystacks thatched as with hoarfrost had the air of cliffs crumbling before the sea one clump of bare trees rose out of the glassy void like the rigging of a sinking ship her world had suffered a waterchange into something rich and strange in which only the rare protuberances enabled her to trace out the original earthpattern even seagulls were floating and frankherons wheeling and kingfishers diving her grandfather watched her like one who had provided the show that makes me feel a youngster agen he cried tis like the good ole times when there warnt no drainagemills ne yet frog farms frog farm isnt swept away she cried with a sudden clamminess at her heart oi wouldnt give much for the farniture downstairs he said with sinister satisfaction thats the lowest house in the parish and then ye deny tis the lords hand achastenin the evildoers oi reckon though theyve packed their waluables in the coach the pirate thieves and scuttled off beacon hill way without replying she gazed through a tremulous telescope at the distant point where the brad seemed to wind immediately behind the roof of frog farm but the convolutions and dip of the land aided by an intervening copse hid everything from her except the quaint chimney though the smoke fluttering in the wind showed that if the gaffers hypothesis was correct evacuation must have been recent it was something though to see the farmhouse still uncollapsed though her imagination surrounded it with water like the more visible farm she was glad to remember that master peartree at least would have been in his hut on higher ground keeping vigil over the lambing ewes somebody ought to go and see if theyve really got away she said anxiously theyll be all right ef the lord dont want to punish em he said surlily and ef he do taint for nobody to baulk him after dinner he forwent his nap the lord had sent him not only a spectacle but a great new eye and had even denuded the trees that might in summer have blocked his view and he was not the man to sin his mercies jinny had ceased to be anxious about his catching cold at the casementevidently his life of driving had inured himso wrapping a blanket round his smock and the newknitted muffler round his throat she left him to enjoy himself while she cleared away the frugal meal suddenly she heard a roar as of distant thunder followed by a great shout from above its busted its busted she rushed up in alarm nearly upsetting his bucket herself behold he cried biblically handing her the glass thats busted a piece out of the bank she lookedand beheld indeed in the embankment that guarded long bradmarsh gaped a breach of some fifty yards while giant blocks of clay that must have weighed tons were swirling like childrens marbles towards the long bradmarsh meadows whence panicstricken labourers were now fleeing backwards its caught em the sabbathbreakers said the gaffer ecstatically that didnt wait to flow over the dyke ive got to go and give help on the ridge she said resolutely and not all his arguments or threats could stay her cart christ said the sabbath was made for man not man for the sabbath she urged and the text silenced him but it was not so easy to dispose of the pietism of methusalem whose blank incredulity before her threatened disturbance of the holy day was only overcome by the convincing commonplaceness with which nip barked around the poor horse must have imagined that he had overslept himself and that it was tuesday fortunately the ridge lay downwards for him and the crowds and the everyday bustle finally disillusioned him of his sunday feeling and he allowed his cart to be laden with the carrots swedes and mangolds that had lain in such snug rows packed betwixt hurdles and a sort of straw thatch kept down by long poles at first jinny kept looking round for the rival carrier but either he would not demean his coach to such service or he was waterbound jinny asked several people whether they had seen the flynts and whether frog farm would be safe but if nobody could supply any information nobody thought there would be any serious danger theyll be all right said farmer gale bitterly its my land there thats drowned and my stacks that are floating he was on the scene now directing operations cursing his looker for the first time the breezy cornishman doubted his fathers cuteness in buying up soil whose fatness was only due to its centuries of repose under water the landll be out of heart for years he lamented jinny could not help a secret satisfaction in seeing the hardhearted farmer confronted by a force as remorseless as that which had swept uncle lilliwhyte out of his cottage nor could she escape a still subtler pleasure in thus heaping coals of fire on his head but both these joys as well as her anxiety about frog farm were soon lost in the glow of service it was such a delight to be no longer shamming work while to give had become an almost forgotten pleasure when she returned to the field for a second load the flood was already creeping over it and the early darkness and a pale quartermoon threw a new weirdness over these unknown waters she found the lane outside still more flooded and as methusalem plashed homewards she encountered uncle lilliwhyte rising from the waters like a disreputable rivergod he was dexterously spearing mangolds as they floated past and stacking them mixed with drowned hares in a wheelbarrow itself apparently flotsam he had an air of legal operations there was none of the furtive look that goes with bulges in smockfrocks and jinny too thought he was justly avenged on his evictor though she refused to desecrate the sabbath by buying any of his spoils she could not help feeling rewarded when nip appeared with a rabbit gratis as he had not killed it she refrained from rebuking him and he came in subsequently for the bones but his pride at having thus at last achieved his ideal almost turned his head and all the more bitter was his humiliation when his next epochmaking capturea dead ratwas rejected with reproach iii if jinny had much to tell her grandfather over the rabbit stew he in his turn had no lack of material for excited conversation both were exhilarated rejuvenated by the metamorphosis of their landscape it seemed more pungently even than snow to recreate the wonder of the world it was a gay young grandfather that rattled off the farces and tragedies of the days drama a sodden haystack hurled into the brad a cart of mangolds overturned in a watery field a bullock swimming for dear life and landing safely on a mound where stampeded horses cowered dead ewes floatingand just in the lambing season toomen in boats rescuing pigs and poultry from the grounds of waterlogged cottages and hauling clothes and bedding through the windows theres hundreds o farmer gales acres drowned what was cropped with seed he said with gloomy relish and regiments o rats ha saved theirselves atop of his stacks when theyve goffled their fill they wentures down for a drink the warmints and then up again same as twixt the devil and the deep sea for they onfortunit stacks that night a white mist rising from the waters blotted out everything but the next morning when jinny went up to induce her grandfather to descend to breakfast she found to her surprise and relief that though the brad was still hurling itself through the breach the bulk of long bradmarsh was still unflooded still alive with salvage parties the low arms of the marshmills were still working with frantic efficiency what miracle had saved this village her grandfather explained that there must still be some righteous men there but jinny looking through his glass for herself discoveredafter a preliminary peep at the frog farm chimney whose smokelessness was a fresh reliefthat the breachwater instead of flowing evenly over long bradmarsh had half found half scooped out for itself a sort of riverbed turning aside before a slight rise it had veered round sharply eastward and then curving back westward when it met another obstacle three hundred yards later it had finally poured itself over the dyke back into the brad thats a mercy she said expounding it but now theres a chance of both they rivers flowin over he pointed out hopefully but as she gazed she grew aware of a new phenomenon why the brads going backwards she said he snatched the glass from her hand so it be he agreed but thats onny where the little river busts in agen the wrong way and pours along the top o the real river jinny was thrilling all down her spine again the sibylline prophecy of miss gentry rang in her ears when the brad in opposite ways shall course lo jinnys husband shall come on a horse and jinny shall then learn passions force overwhelmed by the uncanny divination of the dressmakera wise woman in good sooth it now appearedshe sank into a chair her whole being aquiver with a premonition that she had reached the crucial point of her destiny who was it coming on a horse who but will that incarnation of equestrian grace he was coming to rescue her the dear silly imagining her menaced by the flood as if she had not got methusalem as if blackwater hall was not an ararat but his foolishness was part of the fatemight he not even ride his horse through the doorway lying along its back to avoid the lintel and thus be practically on his hands and knees in her grandfathers present happy mood the old man might very well accept that solution and will himself would be carried in and might equally accept the compromise absorbed in her sophistic daydream she sat there till even the old man at his tube remembered breakfast nor did she again volunteer to help in the fields all day she stayed at home over her monday housework and washtub awaiting the horseman afraid to stir out and with equal patience her grandfather sat at his allday show engineers and gesticulating figures appeared on the broken bank for his delectation and a mile or so lower down labourers began to shovel gault culch he called it to jinny and lighters laden with it tried to sink themselves in the breach but some were swirled away like bandboxes and others turned turtlea comical sight that made him roar with laughter at last exciting operations with ropes stretched across the river succeeded in keeping some in place after that a bigsailed barge came to the rescuehe could even recognize the two punters with long poles who eked out the sail ravens grandson that neerdowell and ephraim bidlake whose grandfathers barge used to competition wuss than coaches he told jinny they had brought a cargo of the bluegrey stuffhundreds of sacksand dinged it into the breach wellnigh clogging it up and thenoh sidesplitting drollerythe dyke had gone and busted in another weak placenear the bridge and they were left like dickies with empty sacks while the folk in the newswamped fields went scurrying like rats so continuous were her grandfathers shouts of glee that jinny ceased to attend to them and would not come up to see even the new gap she was the more amazed when at supper he talked of having seen lijah skindle fishing from the window of frog farm oi called ye to come and see he said reproachfully when she expressed incredulity he got his line danglin from a broomstick the sight of miss gentry astride a broomstick seemed far likelier to jinny in the first place no window of the farmhouse was visible from theirs in the second how could elijah skindle be living there what would mr skindle be doing at frog farm she said so long as he aint taken annie there he answered oi shouldnt wonder ef the whole place comes tumblin down like they firtrees for the more oi set thinkin on it the more oi see as its to punish that competitioning pirate that the floods been sent dont talk like that granfer i expect youve been dozing oi tell you oi seen him and his broomstick he cried angrily and when he couldnt catch nawthen he tied his hankercher on it and signalled with it too she did remember now that elijah and will had become thicker than their respective relations to blanche seemed to warrant and she had shrewdly divined that will wanted to flaunt his indifference to his rejection and elijah to pose as the magnanimous conqueror it was not impossible therefore that the horsedoctor summoned to snowdrop or cherryblossom on the saturday afternoon had been caught by the torrential rain and the gale and persuaded to stay the night in that spare bedroom once occupied by mr flippance but more probably it was only another of the old mans illusions why there wasnt even any smoke from the chimney she reminded him mebbe there was too much water in it he chuckled jinnys blood ran cold but not on account of the flynts she was still too obsessed with the vision of will arriving on a horse to imagine him or his parents immured by the waters no the feeling that stole over her was that elijah skindle was not living at the farm but that while the occupants had evacuated it he had been drowned outside itswept away with his trapand that her grandfather had seen yet another ghost if anybody was signalling she pointed out the engineers and the wherrymen would have seen him they cant see through a brick wall he retorted crushingly frog farm aint got no eyes on the brad depend ont tis the lords finger she was still incredulous but the moment supper was over she ran up to examine the farmhouse afresh the wind had sobbed down the sky was sprinkled with stars seen through frequent rifts in the clouds and the moon though only a crescent emerging through a cloudrack shed a silver radiance over the watery waste and cast over it black rippling bands of shadow from the bare elms and poplars rising from it in such unearthly beauty and there in the region of frog farm perceptible even to the naked eye a mysterious reddishyellow light like some new star threw its farreaching beams upon the softened flood a closer examination revealed that some of the trees of the fircopse had been sapped and now lay heaving gentlythe old man she remembered had alluded to fallen firsand that the ruddy rays came from a farm bedroom no longer shut out by the foliage the smoke too was rising again it was clear that the house was not uninhabited and that her grandfather might very well have seen elijah skindle while the absence of smoke all day might be traceable to the inability of the occupants to get a light earlier from sodden matches but if they are starving and signalling she cried agitatedly we must tell people we must send a boat we cant get no boat he said philosophically but youve seen plenty of boats she urged i saw two myself rowing over the fiveacre field and theres that fowlingpunt on the bank that oi seen that fleetin bottom up ye cant goo out tonight yed be drownded why look there thats a dead cow from the farm meadow where i cant see anything there bobbin near the copse he pointed and snatched the glass from her why thats a hoss he shouted exultantly a black hoss that should be snowdrop ef it aint cherryblossom he was on his feet now quivering with excitement his blanket falling from his shoulders why how can you be sure in this light she said trembling no less it may be a brown horse or even a ploughhorse thats a black coachhoss sure enough black as his heart the pirate thief what did oi tell ye wengeance is mine saith the lord oi will repay he looked so solemn in the moonlight with his white beard and his whitesleeved arm pointing starward that she almost felt his standpoint had a prophetic justification but she shook off the spell sit down granfer she pleaded readjusting his blanket mr flynt was in his right ef he was in his right why has the lord drownded his hoss he demanded fiercely do ye set down yerself and he clutched her wrist with his bony hand let me go she cried theres mr skindle to be saved too there aint no danger for themtis your boat what ud come into colloosion with trees and cattle and fences andwhy just look at that he dropped her hand to scrutinize the strange object awash hallelujah he cried hysterically thats the top o the coach dednt oi say twas a funeral coach she shivered and a cloud coming just then over the moon seemed to eclipse her resolution to rouse the neighbours the sudden pall of darkness made the old man clutch her againhis own evocation of the funeral coach had frightened him oi wont be left alone by night he quavered and wiped a watery eye jinny refused to take it as pathos youll blind yourself with that telescope she said sternly but inwardly she felt he was not so wrong in that dim fitful light there was more danger to the wouldbe rescuers than to the party so snugly gathered round some bedroom hearth in frog farm that ruddy lamplight still brighter by the extinction of the moon beamed reassuringly over the waters skindles broomstickrod might have represented merely an effort to break the monotony of imprisonmentit was no proof that they had been cut off from their larder and with the waters now calmer the house that had stood the gale was not likely to subside in the night no they were probably safer where they were than if rescued she must wait till the morning a loud thumping at the kitchendoor shattered her speculations jinnys heart beat almost as loudly so the horseman had come at last unheard in their excitement choosing the back door as less of a surrender will had escaped then he was not waterlogged she flew down the stairs three at a time poor will poor snowdropor was it snowdrop that was saved and was now bearing his master to the heart that would give him compensation for all his shattered fortunes alas no proud cavalier waited to bear her off clasped to his breast no smoking steedonly a tatterdemalion before whose malodorous corduroys and battered beaver she recoiled in as much disgust as disappointment though uncle lilliwhyte bore in his grimy claws a plump partridge for which he demanded only twopence but the seasons over she murmured thats onny the tother day and twarnt me as killed it he said the lord dont seem to care about they game laws he killed even on sunday dont take the lords name in vain jinny rebuked him we cant understand his ways they do seem wunnerful odd admitted the nondescript ever since oi was a brat oive tried to puzzle em out but it git over me same as a man now perished in this here flood and went straight to hell wouldnt that be a curous change for the chaplike the lord larkin with him perhaps therell be a flood that will put out hell one day said jinny evasively martha flynt should be sayin there aint no hell to put out that looks as if yeve got to goo to heaven do what ye will oh i dont think she means that said jinny smiling despite her heavy heart thats what the humes sounded like as her and the looker used to sing of a sunday afore master will come home and stopped em oi used to listen to em chance timesput me in mind of my young days likebut oi dont howd with their doctrines with whose then asked jinny interested with nobodys dednt oi say git over me ef the lord was to offer me heaven or hell which dye think oid choose is there a catch in it she asked cautiously weve got to be catched in one or the tother he said misunderstanding but oi mislikes em both will you be buyin the bird as jinny produced two of her only three pennies she began to realize for the first time the revolution in her fortunes implicit in the destruction of the coach but her heart was aching too poignantly for any joy of victory she could not savour as her grandfather was savouring the miraculous collapse of the competition victory or defeatheaven or hellshe thought ruefully she misliked them both she was consumed with yearning anxiety and compassion for the young rival who had failed to come on a horse who had perhaps no longer even a single horse to come on nor did the fate of snowdrop or cherryblossomthat superb vitality turned into a floating carcaseleave her jubilant in the morning indeed she was to awake to a sense of her triumph but what endless hours of insomnia and nightmare had first to be lived through again queen victoria who was also quite intelligibly miss jinny boldero was saved by the father of the fatherless from the gins and stratagems of the redhaired villain who cut away london bridge just as her majesty was going over it in her gold coronation coach with its six black ponies and its canvas tilt struggling in the cold waters she was held up by henry brougham esq who helped her to scramble athwart the naked carcase of a black pony on which she floated to shore when it stood upon its feet and with queen jinny astride the saddle and miss gentry in bridal attire not at all surprisingly on the pillion galloped towards blackwater hall across the dry common where anglers sat with broomsticks and while she was lying along the ponys mane to get through the door to the redhaired young man now become the hero just as she was beginning to feel passions force that stupid miss gentry came crack with her neck against the lintel and off rolled her head on the floor its moustache dabbled in blood picking herself up and her scattered bedclothes and rubbing her bruised crown jinny congratulated herself on sleeping in a chest of drawers in such proximity to the floor but the bang slight as it was had cleared away the vapours of sleep and she awoke to a consciousness of victory brimming her veins with vital joy song so long strange to her lips unless simulated to lull granfer came back to them as she dressed and when she prayed give us this day our daily bread it was no longer an almost despairing cry to a deaf heaven running upstairs to see if frog farm was safe she was relieved to find it smoking imperturbably though up to its bedrooms in water and a glimpse of caleb at the casement serenely lowering a bucket into the flood was still more reassuring but she was thunderstruck when her grandfather gleefully pointed out that the bridge to long bradmarsh had broken down almost as in her dream and she half looked round for the coronation coach doubtless she felt surveying the broken bankside arch which lay in uncouth masses impeding the current and sending it swirling through the stillstanding central arch the breach hard by in the dyke had helped to sap the bridge and she was glad to see this breach being already repaired by her friends bidlake and ravens with a gang of labourers for they were clearly heavensent minions for the expedition to frog farm but if she sang on as she cleared the breakfast things her grandfather was in still higher feather not only had the morning brought to him as to jinny a keener realization of the collapse of their mushroom rival but he had discovered floating near the bridge a black horse which he persisted was the second horse and though jinny maintained it was the same horse the old man had more faith in heaven so occupied was he in gloating over this distant horse swirling against the ruined brickwork with its stiffened leg pointing skywards that he had not seen methusalem harnessing under his nose and it was not till nip started his hysteric prelude to departure that mr quarles was aroused to jinnys proceedings ye cant goo out in the flood he called down in alarm its tuesday she called up the blood was dancing gaily in her veins the frosty morning air was fresh and invigorating she was young and unconquered the long anxiety was over methusalem had survived the coach even as he had survived the murderous wiles of elijah she put her horn to her lips and blew a challenge to the world but there baint no bridge cried her grandfather daniel quarles hasnt been downed by a coach she said and he isnt going to be downed by a flood no by god he aint cried the old carrier delightedly oill goo round miles by the next bridge sooner than miss my day and they false customersll ha to come to me on their hands and knees ere oi takes em back goo to the coach ye warmints oim done wi ye and oi wish ye joy of your fine black hosses all ajinglin and atinklin he he he make muddles do oi oi never made no muddle like that stablin my hosses with the frogs do ye give a squint at that carcase jinny as ye pass by and yell see it aint the one but the tother and do ye dont squint into that spyglass no more she called up in merry earnest do yell get a glass eye he laughed no fear have they writ ye yet about sidrachs stone annoyed with herself at having called up that memory she feigned deafness youll find partridge for your dinner she called out and flicking playfully at methusalem she burst forth joyously there is hey there is ree responded the sepulchral bass from above and then as the old horse stepped out both voices declared in duet that twas methusalem bore the bells away jinny waving her whip with a last backward glance at her grandfather saw him wildly agitating his telescope to which his coloured handkerchief was tied like a flag of victory iv methusalem waded stolidly towards the river his cart nearly floating in places on the drier artificial slope leading up to the bridge she drew rein and jumping down walked cautiously over the two still standing arches to hail ephraim bidlake now some hundred yards down the opposite bank as she put her horn to her lips to summon him she saw quanted upstream another barge with a reinforcement of sacks and as it must pass under the bridge she moved to the other side to send her message by it as it came along but the posse of mudgrimed men with a last push of their submerged poles fell prostrate before her as in some oriental obeisance and she heard the tops of the gaultsacks scraping against the brickwork of the arch as the boat passed under it so high was the water it reminded her again of her nightmare but no heads came crack as they glided through and running to the other side she spoke the rising crew turning she became aware of bundock standing bagbowed on the dyke amid a mass of sodden straw gazing in horror at the ruins and the dead horse bashing against them swathed in yellow weed she advanced to the edge of the void and hailed him across some fifteen feet of eddying water ahoy bundock for gods sake jinny he cried startled go back thatll give way not with my weight she laughed you going across how can i theres boats barges wherries lighters punts and swimming called jinny and youve got to do your duty to the queen and havent i done it he said pathetically exhibiting his soused leggings but theres only three letters for little bradmarsh and all for the same man i can guess who that is she said and yet you wont kill three frogs with one stone bundock burst into laughter so youve heard my joke he said happily i do liven folks up dont i though few have the brains to appreciate aught beyond the bellmans silly puns then his ruddy pitted countenance resumed its melancholy mien but i cant joke about the flood jinny you mustnt expect me to theres poor charley mott why whats he got to do with water jinny jested havent you heard hes drowned jinnys laugh froze on her lips charley had obstinately gone to fish in the troubled waters of the brad the postman related despite the weather all the sunday morning he had fished from the dyke and was just walking off to dine with some pals at the king of prussia when the bank burst and he was caught by the torrent and smashed among the whirling blocks it was exactly like the moral of the spellingbook and jinny saw before her as on a scroll of judgment the grey blurred type of lesson xv harrys downfall true harry had been torn by wild beasts as well as shipwrecked on the coast of barbary but in a country without the larger carnivora a complete analogy could not be expected poor mr mott she sighed and then remembering the case put by uncle lilliwhyte had the luckless young man indeed gone straight from water to fire she wondered itll be a relief for mrs mott anyhow she said a relief gasped bundock why shes carrying on like mad says its all her fault for trying to drive him to chapel and that it was deacon mawhood that egged her on to drive him on the curb and that he was worth a dozen deacons and she wont have any more to do with you peculiars why when i brought her the letters this morning if she hadnt kept me such a time pouring out all charleys virtues i might have got across before this bridge broke down not that i could have delivered my letters anyhow i think it broke in the night said jinny then she fell silent disconcerted by these illogical manifestations of human nature and she did not remember where she was till she found nip tugging at her dress and cowering on the brink of the abyss as if afraid she would be walking on the wherry she perceived too was now coming up and young ravens voice was floating melodiously across the waters tis my delight of a shiny night in the season of the year theres your ferry bundock she called and whats the good of going across he asked by what i see i couldnt possibly get to frog farm but im going there what he gazed towards her side of the river the willows surging from which alone marked the former bank plover were flying with dismal cries over the unseen pastures he shook his head one inquests enough for chipstone ill take your letters she said with a sudden thought that made her happier bundock resisted the offer his repugnance to seeing the queens mail sacrilegiously carried by a member of her majestys sex was deepseated and it was only because he took seriously jinnys threat to write to his sovereign that he finally handed the three letters by a compromise to ephraim bidlake needless to say that as soon as bundocks pouched back was turned that faithful henchman transferred them to jinny when he took her little horse and cart on board his broadbuilt wherry he imagined she only wanted to be ferried across but she had soon spurred him to the great adventure across the drowned meadows it was a question of lifesaving she said and for the british navy as embodied in bidlake and ravens this was enough fortunately the females were now lodged on shore awaiting mrs bidlakes annual event moreover the wherry relieved by the other barge had a slack moment and with jinny to guide them from the vantagepoint of her drivingboard over hidden snags in the shape of submerged stiles sheds mounds or bushes the two men punted boldly over the left bank the mast had been lowered for apart from the danger of boughs catching in the sail the trees made a windscreen to the pastures it was odd as the barge passed between two willows on the margin of the river to see these trees reflected doubly at once in stream and in flood there was no difficulty in avoiding the larger flotsam though one of farmer gales haystacks was only staved off with bidlakes pole and it was not till they had quanted to the farmhouse itself that the steering became troublesome for there were no windows at the back at which they were arriving there were farmbuildings and floating stacks waiting to embarrass them at the front the socalled frog cottage presented a blank black wall at one side while the windowed sidewall from which martha had once beheld bundock marching through morasses was encumbered not only by the wreckage of the stable and the mangled body of the coach but by calebs wild orchard in whose mystically rising oakbranches and peartreetops poultry to which fear had restored wings were seen to be roosting but by taking a wide course over the wheatpatch so as to avoid the stacks the barge was able to double frog cottage safely to glide triumphantly into dock and lie alongside frog farm the exciting manuvre had been accomplished in grim silenceeven ravens forgetting to sing as they bumped over the chaotic remains of the old logdyke and raised wagonroadand it was not till it was over that jinny found breath to blow her horn and as she did so she was startled to see behind the diamond panes of the closed casement of the central bedroomnow on a level with her drivingboard and almost opposite ita head that vaguely recalled mr dukes but the next instant she recognized maria and the old black sow was pushed aside the casement flung open and a redhaired head flung out and if jinny had stared incredulously at the sight of the pig what word can convey the dilatation of wills eyes as they now beheld the little carrier perched on her accustomed seat whip in hand as though on the solid road it was some seconds before he even perceived the barge sustaining her cart what do you want broke harshly from his lips such ungraciousness after the perils of her voyage jarred upon her dont you want anything from chipstone she asked with a malice she had not intended no he barked well heres your letters ive carried she said demurely the postal service like the coach service has broken down she hurled the letters through the window just as he was banging it to but ere it could close it was thrown open again and elijah maria martha and caleb were tumbling over one another in their eagerness to greet her jinny came from all their mouths even it seemed from marias and she saw through dimming eyes that the bedroom was a chaos of furniture and fowls here catch hold of that rope one of ye cried ephraim bidlake tie it to a bedpost he had already fastened the stem of the boat to an oak but the current was swinging out the stern it was with a thrill that jinny found herself gazing for the first time into wills bedroom though its normal character was disturbed by its emergency use as a sittingroom poultryrun pigsty and salvage store the wet crinkled motto when he giveth quietness who then can make trouble was lying as if in ironic questioning atop a pile of parlour ornaments and marthas silk sampler lay stained and sodden on the very chair on which mr flippance had sat admiring it unstable as water human destinies seemed to jinny as she surveyed the jumble in the whitewashed attic but there was too much bustle for reflection nor could she even see clearly what will himself was doing for maria and elijah were jostling each other at the window in their efforts to get through and the vets cap fell on the deck in his agitation pigs first called jinny and as though obediently elijah clutching at the edge of her tilt scrambled on the footboard of the cart and thence to the deck nice behaviour leaving us to starve he grumbled in the same pachydermatous spirit as he clapped his cap on his chilled cranium how could you starve with all those fowls said jinny they werent for weekday eating the old woman said nothing since sunday but dry bread as long as it was dry jinny laughed it wasnt even that simply sopping well all prisoners get bread and water said jinny in mock consolation ravens had hastened to pull out a greasy package elijah waved it aside with a sniffy air thanksill wait till we land now elijah not fed by ravens laughed jinny outwardly she was in the gayest of moods bandying words again in quite her old vein but it was a feverish gaietyunderneath every nerve was astrain for wills reappearance with all it forboded of ecstasy and conflict come along maria she called for the barge had drifted out a little on its windowrope and the sows eagerness was damped now encouraged she allowed herself to be helped into the cart by caleb above and bidlake below after the fowls had been chivied beside her there was a delay the missus be in our bedroom packin some things for the night apologized caleb returning to the window she cant sleep without her nightcap it wouldnt be decent and she likes me to change my red shirt for bed but where will you sleep jinny now asked feeling suddenly responsible as for an eviction mr skindles kindly offered to put us all up till we looks round said caleb its the big house im furnishing for my wedding regardless elijah explained and im going to give them their food too and it isnt the sort of food theyve given me either but when youre cooped up with folks in danger of your life you get closer to them and dont grudge expense especially when theyre in low water in low water echoed jinny oh mr skindle you know what i mean elijah replied poor wills lost his horsessuch a comedown not that he ever had enough to appeal to a girl brought up to be a lady in my new house now theres three spare bedroomsill get my mother to make em all readythatll be one apiece for em if they care to spread themselves but then how about maria jinny jested maria he grunted its all her fault i always said she was the fussiest pig i ever attended a mere cramp through not taking exercise all this rainy weather fright cured her in a jiffy but think of the valuable time shes cost me i wouldnt have come but to oblige will no wonder they call the place frog farm i dont hear any croaking but yours flashed jinny why if time is all youve lost youre lucky wheres your horse you didnt think id risk jess on these roads in the weather weve been having i only agreed to come in the coach saturday night and go back sunday morning with farmer gale and his wife when they drove in to chapel poor blanche she must have been in a terrible twitter when i didnt turn up at the sunday dinner i wonder she didnt come out for you in a boat said jinny slyly shed be thinking id been called to another patient we medical gents can never call our time our own he explained but there was a tremor of uneasiness in his words he pulled out his empty pipe and stuck it between his blackened teeth caleb here appeared with uncouth bundles and martha embellished by sudden sunday clothes with a last frightened chicken and as the barge had now quite tautened its windowrope and left a watery gap marthas descent was a fluttering episode not so easy as the new jerusalem coming down gasped caleb when she was safely installed inside the cart with maria and the poultry and the dazed nip ephraim bidlake intimating he could not wait on this jaunt to lower any of the furniture had gone offin a little dinghy he carriedto rescue the fowls in the orchard branches and their fearful cackling and the excitement of his perilous quest now drew all eyes except jinnys which remained furtively bent on the window from which the drifting of the barge had carried her away it was with relief that she heard martha suddenly exclaim but wheres the boy oi count hes got such a mort o newfangled things scoffed caleb toothbrushes and underclothes and shavinstropshappen hell want a whole portmantle oi offered to help him with his poor arm but hes that fiery and sperritedye remember jinny how he lugged his great ole box all the way chipstone but whats the matter with his arm jinny asked anxiously didnt you see his sling called elijah proudly broken jinny murmured paling only a simple fracture he puffed complacently at his pipe forgetting it was empty youve got to go back caleb and help the poor lad said martha with renewed agitation then you might as well get my handbag from my room elijah added i didnt think of it in the rush ravens labouring mightily with his pole to larboard pushed the barge back to the window and as caleb obediently clambered in again martha growing calmer began telling jinny how will had swum out to the stable to save the horses but had only got his arm kicked for his pains and then of course he couldnt help her in carrying any of her furniture upstairsit was a mercy he got back at alland it being sunday flynt would help only to save life though youd have thought from marias squeals as she was haled upstairs that she was being slaughtered rather than saved as for mr skindle he seemed stricter with the sabbath than even the peculiars and would do nothing but try to light the fire you were at home i hadnt got but the clothes i stood in elijah explained what should i have done if id gone up to my neck in water heres your bag calebs voice broke in from the window but will wont come martha wont come shrilled martha and before jinny could stop her she was on the footboard and had disappeared through the casement hes an ungrateful illtempered fellow elijah commented picking up his bag and changing his collar as he talked i dont call him a gentleman he cant forgive that his arm was set by a vet and he sits about like a broody hen asked me not to mention it which of course as a gentleman i wont what good do you suppose it would do me to have it knowni said to himseeing ive already got the family connexion with maria but he got very cross elijah wound up innocently though i said i wouldnt even charge pigs price but would swap the fee and marias too against his horses provided i could recover the carcases ive got to stay here cried martha reappearing hysterically at the window he wont come what nonsense cried jinny losing her temper well all go and pull him out hes locked himself in my bedroomthe one with the side windowyou cant get in from here she wrung her hands these days of durance and danger had evidently told upon her nerves ill smash the door in and his head too growled ravens his foot on the windowsill no no jinny commanded swinging herself suddenly past him you take your wife down mr flynt shes too excited ill rout him out martha protested shrilly that where she had failed a stranger could not succeed no she must stay with her boy tend his poor arm but the men overruled her and were returning her gently but firmly to the footboard of the cart when she cried desperately wait wait ive forgotten something under my pillow ill get it jinny promised what is it but martha refused to say it was very precious it was in an envelope it wasnt for jinny to see in vain jinny declared she wouldnt open the envelope marthas hysteric protests mingled with the frenzied cackling of the fowls that ephraim bidlake was still chasing leaving the males to pacify martha and deposit her in the cart jinny stooped under the bargerope and threaded the litter betwixt the bed and the righthand doorthe other door she knew gave on the bedroom bisected by frog cottage pausing but a moment to look down the now literal well of the staircase in which dead mice floated she rapped imperiously at the connubial chamber under the gable go away mother came the fretful answer im not your motherif i were id slap you a nice state youve got her into what do you want he said in a changed tone your mothers left something precious in an envelope under her pillow i thought you said youd never cross my doorstep i didnti came by the windowsill but even as her lips gave the obvious repartee her mind beheld her grandfather scrambling into the room of the angelmother and it all seemed ineffably silly in view of the tragic realities of life as if she would not have crossed even an enemys threshold to bind up a broken arm well suppose you return the same way he retorted thats what i mean to do she said angry again ive got my rounds what in the barge i dont want a boat long bradmarsh has kept its head above water and methusalems going just as strong as before the flood then afraid she had recalled his own dead horses she added hurriedly hows your arm thats nothing thank you goodbye not without the envelope their words came muffled through the doorpanels and a barrier as obstructive seemed to divide their spirits though they yearned dumbly towards each other ill put it under the door he said surlily i dont wonder youre ashamed to look me in the face jinny was thinking of his behaviour to his mother but it was an unfortunate remark will was ashamed mortally ashamed of his defeat he had come along from over the seas he felt swelling and strutting and jeering poor little jinny poor comical little village carrier oho hed soon crush her oho hed soon make an end of her and now his coach smashed up his horses drowned his capital gone his savingsthe bulk spent on his fine clothesbarely sufficient to carry him along while seeking some new employment even his parents impoverished by the flood their very roof perhaps about to collapse over his head while she here she was with her invincible old cart walking the waters posing as the saviour of the whole family carrying on the postal service and the coach service blowing her triumphant trumpet on her immemorial tuesday round her old clients doubly at her mercy what humiliation could be more bitter and the worst of it all was that the ache of passion nourished by her rejection of his new advances had become intolerably poignant jinny jinny he seemed to hear it all around him jinny jinny from morning to nightand even all through the night floating through his dreams like a strain of music and jinny herself was ever before him night and day with her eyes laughing and her tongue stinging but now that she was there in the flesh with only a door between them he felt he could not open it he must never look in her face again till he had rehabilitated his fortunes no word of love had ever been spoken between them but could he see her stand near her now and not speak it and a fine story it would sound even if his lips proved spiritless enough to attempt it he had loved her from the first moment he had seen her in the courtyard of the black sheep nay from childhood and had tried to steal her business had loved her and might have driven her with the grandfather she supported to die in a ditch and now that it was he who was in the ditch could he come prating of love add her enhanced scorn to his selfcontempt no he had missed his opportunities a nice hand to offer hereven if there was any chance of her taking ita hand swathed in a sling symbol of his crippled fortunes he must set out on his travels againthat was clearwork his passageas soon as his bones had grown togetherto those new australian goldfields that everybody was talking of and then when his selfrespect had grown together too he would write to her and ask her to wait for him and if she still said noor had already said yes to a better manwhy what else had he deserved monkeying around with a flirt who was not worthy even of elijah as jinny now heard him moving speechlessly to get the envelope the voice of ravens carolling the popular gipsy king told her that martha had been quieted downunlike the fowls which were still squawking under bidlakes coaxings i confess i am but a man my feelings who pleases may know i am fond of my girl and my can and jolly companions a row suddenly she heard will laughing whats up she called more brightly well of all the and then an envelope was pushed under the door she hasnt opened it yet jinny stooped down it was the letter from will that martha would not let her read in the spring of well she knew what was in it said jinny her eyes misting and you oughtnt to laugh at such a proof of love nobody else would call that a precious treasure the word love sent vibrations through them both despite the woodwork between well theres money in the others anyhow he said and three opened envelopes came unexpectedly under the doorthe letters she had just brought to him what are these for she asked you may as well have themcommissions for the coach for me jinny said touched yes id be obliged if you helped me out oh will her voice was as broken as his pride seemed to be but his mood was less of meekness than of selfscourging well you said the coach service had broken down he reminded her i didnt mean to twit youim sorry what for you told me id get stuck and come to you to pull me out but im so sorry really poor snowdrop poor cherryblossom didnt you call it a funeral coach goodbye youve got the treasure youd better come too no thank you you neednt be beholden to the cart if thats whats sticking in your gizzard you can get off at the dyke not me you wont see me againnot for a long time rubbish i can see you now through the keyhole so long as i dont see you he said gruffly youll see me before youre a day older bet my bottom dollar i wont a dashing young lad from canada she carolled once a great wager did lay why have you buried your face in your hands she broke off i haventits to shut you out aha so i do come in all the same loud cries of jinny jinny now intimated like the silence of the rescued poultry that the barge was preparing to cast off just coming she called loudly goodbye you sullen runty idiot they cant wait any longer goodbye he growled her look was mischievous as she ran off but that he could not see he could only hear the noisy banging of the opposite door he had already forgotten his wager but by hook or crook she meant to lure him out if only for an instant that was why she came as noisily back and thumped at his door again you cant be left without food she said thats my business let me be not till i know you wont starve theres ravens dinnerpacket you can have take it away he roared her eyes twinkled he had played into her hands empty as they were i wont take it away she said there was a sound as of angry dumping outside his door then the opposite door banged and silence fell after a moment will drawing a sigh half of relief half of despair opened his door and the next momenthe never knew how it had happened exactly still less did he realize that there was no dinnerpacket there at all but since he had only one arm it seemed to him afterwards it could not be he that had enfolded her even if he had done so with his eyes when her merry mocking face shone so trickily upon the landing while jinny always felt that it was precisely the arm out of action that had come round her just as it was his not coming on a horse that had made her feel passions forcebut there they were by some irresistible flood in each others arms with jinnys flowersoft cheek pressed with a wonderful warmth to his own and her silvery little voice crooning oh my poor will oh my poor will he knew immediately that there had been nothing like this in all his motley experience nothing at once so pure so sweet so tender this was the love that lifted not degraded but jinny though she had no comparative lore of love and was all the more absorbed in the absolute wonder uniqueness and completeness of it knew more swiftly than her lover that this was no time for dallying in what seemed to him a mere flash of lightning the whole episode was cruelly over he was being helped into the barge while bidlake was in his bedroom untying the rope and jinny with motherly zeal and uncanny knowledge was scrambling together his things for the night for her too the moment of breaking away had been hard and as her face moved from his it seemed like passing from a sunny clime to a polar world but as she now busied herself with his little equipment the glow was back again at her heart and the transfigured world of that magic moment was hers again as the wherry began to move off at last and frog cottage was doubled again martha who had been laid snugly inside the cart surrounded by her live stock with blankets from the bed thrown over her threw them off stretched her arms to her receding farm and burst into a new passion of tears dear heart dear heart cried caleb almost as agitated shall we ever see our things again she sobbed thats nawthen to cry over dear heart even ef we dont weve got to thank the lord for givin us the use of frog farm all they long years but martha sobbed on unconsoled and wills been taken from me too no no martha caleb reassured her there he is by the starn smokin his pipe tis middlin clever to my thinkin to fill it onehanded still martha refused to be comforted so spasmodic were her gulpings that nip set up a sympathetic howl and maria a perturbed squeal but none of these soundsnot even ravens singingcould drown the celestial music will and jinny heard in their hearts chapter xiii the course of true love as john the apostel sygh with syght i syghe that cyty of gret renoun jherusalem so newe and ryally dyght as hit wacz lyght fro the heven adoun pearl fourteenth century i jinnys passage through long bradmarsh with her overflowing freight of fares and live stock was like a triumphal progress the loungers outside the king of prussia actually raised a cheer fresh from the excitement of the mott inquest they knew the adventurous significance of her dripping cartwheels and dry tilt and were quick to see the symbolic significance of her carrying the disabled driver of the flynt flyer though its destruction was still unknown to them at the instance of elijah she went round by foxearth farm so as to put up maria and the poultry there as well as to reassure blanche of his safety though the interview with the latter was naturally veiled from the occupants of the cart it was obvious to them that it was mrs purley who was doing the talking her voice wafted to them through walls which dulled the actual words was like an endless drone each sentence fusing breathlessly into the next in a maddening meaninglessness elijah returned with a dejected mien due not merely it transpired to the cascade that had broken over him but to the fact that blanche was just washing her head that generation did not speak of its hair and unable to see him as if you hadnt suffered enough from water said jinny sympathetically she had her first view that day of mr skindles bridal mansion its two stories rose in new red brick on the outskirts of chipstone in a forlorn field that was just being developed and its architecture from bowwindow to chimneystack was an imitation of the residence of dr mint the leading human doctor theres rosemary villa said elijah proudly and will smiled at the recollection of bundocks jape and blanches merriment ere elijah leaping down first could mount his beautifully whitened steps the door was opened excitedly and a gaunt greyhaired charwoman with a smear on her cheek dropped her grateblacking brush and fell upon elijahs neck in a spasm of emotion thank god thank god she sobbed here dont do that said elijah writhing in her grasp he was blushingly disconcerted by this assertion of maternity before company she had so long accepted the position of drudge that he had forgotten that his absence during the flood might reawaken the mother youre all black he explained disentangling himself thats mourning for you jinny called merrily from her cart and the jest relieved the situation she looked curiously at the lank aproned figure fancying she caught a hint of grace in the movement of the limbs and a gleam of fire in the dark eyes but this dim sense of the tragic passing of romance could not even faintly obscure her own happiness on which the imminent separation from will was the only cloud except for the thrilling contact achieved in helping him to alight she had to part with him less cordially than with caleb who to her surprise and marthas gave her a smacking kiss ere he stepped down thank you dearieyeve saved our lives he said jinny scoffed at thatthe gratitude was due to bidlake and ravens well the missusll have to kiss them he sniggered you do your own kissing said martha sharply and keep your kissing for your own too all this talk of kissing but aggravated the pang of the frigid parting with the one person who mattered goodbye see you soon was all will said you bet your bottom dollar on that she flashed with a relieved smile reading into his words a promise to come over the very next day oh ill pay you next time he smiled back and she had a delicious sense of his meaning to pay his lost wager in the currency with which caleb had just acquitted his debt she promised the old people she would come round on friday and tell them how frog farm stoodif it did stand but though her eyes exchanged with wills secret promises for the morrow an eternity of loneliness seemed to lie before her as she drove back to the town magnanimously blowing the buy a broom polka to apprise her faithless clients ii so many commissions clamoured for her from folk with relations in the flooded area that she had no difficulty in redeeming her dress from the pawnshop that very day but it was not on account of the many calls upon her that she arrived home in the dark it was because she had forgotten to command her faithful ferrys attendance and been forced to take the amazed methusalem miles round by the farther bridge her grandfather would be anxious she feared then it occurred to hernot wholly with satisfactionthat he might have followed her days movements by telescope but she found him as happy as she had left him and with the hearth blazing like a bonfire reckless of logs he had not observed her rescue of the flynts for as she had warned him his overtaxed right eye had become inflamed and throbbed with little darts of pain and he had been compelled to fall back on the voluptuous venom of his reflections supplemented by a text which he had hunted out with his other eye it come into my mind all of an onplunge he chuckled putting a bony finger on a verse the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea she saw with a shudder that wont be long afore he follows his hoss said the gaffer grimly as he polished his lens for the spectacle oi will sing to the lord he read out for he hath triumphed gloriously dont be so wicked granfer she cried wicked thats roighteousto sing to the lord you dont want people drowned dednt he want us to starve looks more like his starving now we can afford to forgive youre reading the wrong end of the bible granfer weve got to turn the other cheek sow oi would ef anybody was bussin me he cackled jinny flushed and turned both her cheeks away why the day oi met annie at chemsford fair he began i dont want to hear about annie she said severely she wasnt your wife thats why i tarned from iniquity but she aint nobodys wife now no poor thing she said and its a pity shes mr skindles mother for he makes her do all the chares of his big new house well but shes a woman aint she he asked with unexpected lack of sympathy shed have to do her husbands chares not at her age at her age annies a young woman compared with you perhaps she smiled git over me her having a lad that size oi count shes worritin over him cooped up in frog farm not now theyre all safely out of it what that pirate thiefs got safe thank god that aint gods dointhats some evil interferin sperrit what comes out o dead bodies says john wesley who took em off he demanded fiercely they came off in bidlakes barge she said weakly and dont you be so unchristian isnt it enough hes that aint right interferin with the texts he interrupted doggedly oi never could abide they bidlakes ephraims grandfather come competitioning on the canals wuss than willie flynt well mr flynt cant competition any more can he i expect she added with difficult lightness hell be coming round now to make friends come round will he just let him show his carroty head inside my doorwayhell be outside like fleck oi promise ye but if he wants to make it up hes got to goo down on his hands and knees fust perhaps he will she suggested indeed she had little doubt of it that wonderful moment with its climax of mouth to mouth had reduced this long foreseen obstacle to a grotesque bogy in the light of mutual and confessed love the perspective changed and if she had once thought that she could not have borne to see him grovel even for her sake that it would actually impair the love grovelled for she had now been uplifted into a plane of existence in which for him not to humour her grandfather seemed as childish as the nonagenarians own demand the old man now turned on her a redrimmed probing eye hed never come crawlin to me ef he warnt arter summat and hes been tryin to git round you fustdont tell me whats his game perhapshed likea partnership oi dessay he would he chuckled ironically hes got brass enough for anythin why the chap was arter you once ye dednt know it but there aint much hid from daniel quarles oi suspicioned him the fust moment he come gawmin to the stable and whatll he bring to the pardnership catsmeat and matchwood his coarseness jarred every nerve but she kept to his key of jocosity didnt you say he had brass he he he he cackled but its the wrong kind o brass ef he wanted to be a pardner why dednt he come when he had his coach and hosses he did dont you remember did he he said blankly then why dednt oi take em that was all my fault granfer no it warnt dearie it was cause he said oid made muddles oi remember now he come and swabbled and chucked a pot at me and hes got to goo down on his hands and knees for it jinny saw it was hopeless to unravel these blended memories of will and elijah as grotesquely interwoven as one of her own nightmares on whose formation it seemed to throw light she was glad though that the sharp edges of the actuality had now faded yes yeshe shall she promised soothingly and then there was that weddincake what mr flippance sent us burst up now from the labouring depths yeswasnt that a lovely cake she agreed oi offered him a shivershows twarnt me as wanted to swabble but he lifted his whip at me and oi snapped it in two like my ole pipe when john wesley stopped my smokin oi dont want no pardnerships of course not granfer daniel quarles its been for a hundred year and daniel quarles its agooin to remain of course daniel quarles and hes got to goo down on his hands and knees and so have i she laughed for weve let our bonfire die down poor mr flynthes got a great admiration for you spite that youve licked him oi guessed you and him been gammickin you cant hide much from daniel quarles and ef that little willie has got a proper respect for his elders and betters that shows oi larnt him a lesson you did granfer hes a changed man there isnt that a nice blaze again hes broken his right arm too poor fellow but here she had blundered the old mans face lit up not from the fire but with a roaring flame of its own thank the lord he shouted as hears the prayer of the humble the high arm shall be broken says the book and its come true the arm what dreft the hosses is broken like the coach he ended with a fresh cackle and rubbed his skinny hands before the blaze you didnt pray for that said jinny white and rebuking that was unchristian thats what king david prayed jinny and he was a man after gods own heart break thou the arm of the wickedoill show it you in the psalm i dont want to see itking david wasnt a christian yet and weve got to forgive and forget and not bear a grudge for ever especially when a mans down think of john wesley happen youre right jinny he said softening weve got to forgive the evildoer and ef the lords got him in hand oi count we neednt troublehell git all he desarves and with that jinny felt fairly content iii but though the ground was thus prepared for his advent will did not come what are you prinkin yourself for her grandfather asked in the morning it aint your day it was certainly not her day it was more like a nighta long agony of expectation with every rustle of wind on the dead leaves sounding like his footstep towards dusk she even swept the waterlogged landscape with the now neglected telescope if she did not find him she foundwhat was almost as soothinga reason for his not coming the broken bridge how could he go all those miles round joyfully she called herself a fool and awaited the letter he would send instead the letter would fill up the thursday and on the friday she would go to him but even this milder expectation of a visit from bundock went unfulfilled at first she thought with some relief that bundock was again shirking the circuit but no the glass revealed the slave of duty serving beacon chimneys throwing on her jacket but bonnetless she ran across the common to meet her letter but bundock only gave her grumbles at the overstrain on his feet and leaving him to hide her dismay she walked blindly up beacon hill till she was startled to come upon master peartree in the bosom of his newborn flock it did not even occur to her that this was a proof he had escaped the flood and that the occasion called for congratulation but the sight of his lambs bounding and his ewes scooping out mangolds brought to mind his old account of a sheep that had broken its arm in a roosh and at once a second rush of joy at her silliness and a still more paradoxical pleasure in wills broken arm flooded her soul how could he write the poor boy it was not that she had really forgotten the state of his armindeed she had thought of the sling as clogging the springiness of his walk and making it still more impossible for him to comeonly she must be going crazy again she felt just as in the days when she had taken home weddingcakes and brought elijah hairpins her eyes now filled with happy tears and joyous as the yeanlings whose tails vibrated with such voluptuous velocity as they sucked she gave chase to a little black lamb and kissed its sable nose that brought her thoughts back to the flood by way of mother ganders hostelry and its drowned landlord and she inquired at last about master peartrees losses they had been limited to one bullock she was glad to hear though no such glow of christian feeling possessed her as she had recommended to her grandfather when the shepherdcowman proceeded to estimate that what with stacks rootcrops and winterwheat farmer gale was the poorer by several thousand pounds other shepherds had been badly hit but he himselfthanks to the almightyhad got more twins and triplets than ever and taking her round his plaza of straw he showed her the yellowsplashed longlegged lambkins in the thatched pens one set of which he would have to feed by bottle for handsome mothers did not give the most milk he moralized she ran homewards as full of the joy of life as the leaping lambs though she was living only for the morrow through the frosty air she felt a first breath of spring birds were singing and even beginning to build and the flood she was sure was falling but when next day she reached rosemary villa the gaunt drudge informed her that only the old flynts were in her heart turned to lead so he had not stayed in for her though she for her part had raced to him by the shortest routes irrespective of business cutting through chipstone proper by a single sidestreet it was not till she had learnt that he was gone like elijah and all the world to mr motts funeral that her heart grew light againshe seemed to batten on tragedies these days of course will could not avoid this mark of respect he who had always put up his coach in the courtyard of the black sheep and perhaps she ought to have gone to the funeral too and would probably have encountered it had she not skipped the high street in her eagerness she remembered now some lowered blinds in the street she had scuttled through and a slow booming bell whose disregarded notes now at last donged their message to her brain but perhaps it was better soher redeemed frock was too gay her winter shawl and bonnet without a single touch of black she ought to have borne the inevitable funeral in mind though she told herself reproachfully in her present guise she could hardly station even in the courtyard it was fortunate mother gander no longer expected to see her within how embarrassing it would have been for the widow to meet the confidante of her unmeasured denunciations probably the whole place would be closed for the day though she supposed the chelmsford coach with the passengers from london would have to come in as usual apprised by the barking of nip the flynt couple had descended looking uneasy for they had been speaking of her not long before their hostessdrudge had started the ball as she closed the door upon will outward bound for the funeral youd think hed found a fortune not lost one the melancholy creature had commented warmed by that youthful sunshine i reckon he wasnt happy hartin jinnys business caleb had surmised and to be happy is as good as a fortune upon which martha who was equally in the passage to see will off had surprised them by a sudden sob shes thinkin of that poor drownded young man caleb had apologized leading her gently upstairs oi do hope willll keep a proper face for the funeral that appropriate face however had continued to be marthas and the explanation thereof when they were alone had surprised caleb more than the sob i knew shed rob me of will i knew it from the first moment she wanted to read his letter to me rob you of him theyre in love are you blind you dont say lord little jinny why shes a baiby a cunning woman came after him even when youd have thought he was safe behind the flood this letter will be all thats left to me you mark my words dont dear heart youre wettin the letteritll spile but dednt oi leave my mother to come to you as the book commands thats different hes all ive got i cant trust him to jinnyshes too flightyalways singing sows the birds but look what noice nests they make taint as if twas that purley gal as bundock warned us of allus lookin at herself like a goose in a pond we ought to be thankful as wills showed sow much sense theres plenty o good farmers along the road but theres no weeds to jinny even three fields back i dont wonder you go kissing her pity you cant marry her yourself oid have no chance agin wills looks dear heart he takes arter his mother ye see dulcifying as this jocose finale had proved it did not diminish the awkwardness of now meeting jinny but martha who had not even the consolation of finding an ecclesia flourishing in chipstone was anxious to hear how far the flood had subsided from their beloved frog farm they were both experiencing all the pangs of exile aggravated by the discomforts of a house with monotonously boarded floors forbiddingly fine furniture and light and water coming unnaturally out of taps and their grievances and yearnings for a return to reality now monopolized a conversation which jinny strove in vain to divert to will she was reduced to looking at her cart for indications of the depths she had splashed through unobservantly and could extract nothing about will except that he insisted on paying for their board and lodging and that this would surely take his last penny hell have to look for a job now hell have no time or money to think of foolishness martha told her meaningly but this broad hint conveyed nothing to her in her affection for the old woman it never occurred to her that she would not make a welcome daughterinlaw now the competition was over and knowing as a scientific fact that your ears burned if people had been talking of youwhereas hers had been tingling with the frostshe went away all unsuspicious in quest of the coveted young man the funeral was over now she saw from the many coaches returning singly or in procession through and from the high street surely the grandest funeral ever known she thought doubtless out of consideration for so tragic a passing though somewhat confusing to the moral of her spellingbook elijah whom she met changing from a coach into his trap confirmed her impression of grandeur and looked forwardon grounds of special informationto the toning up of the churchyard with a monument as big as money could buy surmounted by angels not weeping mind you but blowing trumpets like wills elijah wore a beautiful new tophat flatbrimmed and funereally braided very lucky i had just got it for my wedding he confided to her you wont forget to take off the braid she smiled and when is it to be were having the banns read next sunday blanche wont wait a day longer though im so frightfully busy through the floodits a regular goldstream and hows mr flynts arm she asked he wont let me see it nowi never knew such an obstinate pig hes gone to dr mint what just now no no hes gone hometo rosemary villa i mean as soon as he was out of sight jinny turned methusalems head back to the villa she hung about uncomfortably for some minutes in the thought that will might be coming along or would be looking out of a window but after ten unpleasant minutes she descended from her seat and fumbled shyly with the new brass knocker feeling far more brazen than it she almost cowered before the upstanding figure of the septuagenarian mrs skindleit vaguely reminded her of britannia with a broombut stammering out that she had forgotten to ask if the villa needed anything she ascertained that will had not returned to pitch her cart at the door was impossible to go to meet him might lead to missing him so there was nothing for it but desperately to prolong the conversation till he should reach home her tactics proved fatal for her cheerful reference to elijahs coming marriage loosed upon her a deluge of hysterical tears and she found herself the confidante of sorrows as tragic as mrs motts poor mrs skindle throwing herself upon this sympathetic outsider so providential a vent for her surcharged emotions vociferated that all her children had abandoned her that she was to be put away in the poorhouse in vain jinny standing in that bleak passage her heart astrain for wills coming strove to assuage a grief which irritated rather than touched her she could hardly bring her mind to bear upon this creature with the broom so inopportune and irrelevant did the outburst seem so sordid a shadow on her own romance with surface words she assured the poor woman that all this was only in her imagination but mrs skindle though admitting she had only divined it kept iterating that a nod was as good as a wink and that she wasnt even a blind horse her son had gone to see blanche on the wednesday and had come back with the announcement of his marriage next month and blanche had made it a condition that his old mother should be put away shed pison me if she wasnt afraid for her swans neck and so ive got to be put out o sight taint as if i cant earn my bread with this broom and duster but shes too grand to have me charin in chipstone well then what prevents you going somewhere else jinny asked impatiently i cant go traipsin about to new places and new faces at my age and i dont want to go agin lijah neitherhe ought to ha been married long since and wasnt it me spurred him on to look that high and wont he have the loveliest wife in chipstone whats your game trying to drive me away why if i leave chipstone id never see my grandchicks well but would you see them anyhow even supposing theyre hatched i reckon theres days id be allowed out and i could see em as they went by in their babycart well at that rate youd be happier in the poorhouse yes with a burst of weeping id be happier there happen id better go there but i dont believe your son will let you jinny reassured her and tore herself away miserably conscious of a sort of nemesis for her strategic lingering she dismissed the scene from her mind but it added to the heaviness of her heart as she drove slowly about the streets with never a glimpse of the face she sought and the ache of his absence began to be complicated by the fear that it was wilful or at least not unavoidable surely it was not possible for three days to elapse without their meeting had he been as keen as she even the funeral she now felt grimly was not an absolute necessity of life he could have got out of it no there was something behind more sinister than funerals she went anxiously over her one brief episode of happiness had she done or said anything to offend him was it that on reflection he had resented the little trick she had played at the flooded farm in luring him outside his door yes that must be it and she had sillily rubbed it in with her last words you bet your bottom dollar on that but no he could hardly be resenting the innocent device without which they would never have known the wonder of their first kiss the wonder but was it a wonder to him tumultuous thoughts of blanche and more shadowy others tore at her bosom he did not really care did not really need her the sport of elemental passions she drove vaguely around hoping against hope to espy him she was a creature of pure feelingunsophisticated by fiction or dramaand darkling images of death came to her for the first time and for the first time she let her work go undone it was no mere apprehension of meeting mother gander that finally kept her from the courtyard of the inn no mere sense that with the sweeping away of competition she could afford to neglect for once even the commissions she already held it was the absolute distraction of her mind she could have borne final separation more easily than this uncertainty as she jogged home she realized miserably that will had at last succeeded in stamping out her business if only for a day iv but on her way to church on the sundaythanksgiving was clearly due for her restored fortunes and the fastfalling floodall her misery which his saturday silence had only intensified melted away in a moment at the sound of his voice and the sight of his sling to add to her rapture came the thought that a turning later she would have encountered miss gentry but his exclamation why whatever became of you jinny its been hell radiated so much heaven that the closing of his lips upon hers was almost a retrogression perturbed as it was by her shyness in the open air and of course she ought to have gone to the innyard where he had been waiting she saw the moment he began explaining that was the natural station for her cart to have come to do forgive me making you suffer so she pleaded but i didnt like to go in with mrs mott in that state but mrs mott had not been in that state he corrected almost laughingly on the contrary with her usual unexpectedness and extremism she had reopened the bar immediately and served there herself in her handsomest dress with the gold chain heaving once more on the bereaved bosom will himself had been forced to clink glasses with her he wouldnt have liked to see us gloomylike them peculiars she had said he was always one for jollity and life the anecdote enhanced the lovers own joy of life and though jinny steered for church if by a zigzag path to avoid other worshippers they never got out of the firgrove where a tree sapped by the flood presented a comparatively dry seat amid the sodden gullhaunted ways perhaps it was the thrushes that encouraged themdespite the danknessto stick to it stick to it it was certainly more comfortable for kissing jinny shamelessly confessed snuggling into the cloak he had bought to cover his sling when we stand up youre too proud to stoop she laughed blissfully you make me crane my neck up thats only through the sling he apologized never mindyoure not such a goliathnothing so tall as elijah his eyes blazed fiercely why she laughed you dont mind not being tall of course not he said mendaciously only you havent been measuring yourself against elijah i hope measuring myself she began puzzled then her silvery laugh rippled out oh you jealous goose but his sizell be a bit awkward for blanche wont it then a sudden memory flushed both their faces and hastily drawing a copy of the chelmsford chronicle from his pocket he directed her attention to the thrilling accounts of the great flood and the greater funeral and her fitful attempts to peruse them constituted the only rational moments of the morning it was odd how the reflection of events in the mighty essex organ seemed to redouble their importance and how even will swelled in jinnys eyes when she saw him catalogued among leading citizens present at the last obsequies of the popular proprietor of the black sheep and if will failed to loom as large as charleywhose death fortunate in its journalistic opportunity instead of being swamped by the flood came as its climaxnevertheless he appeared in print no fewer than three times the second occasion was the destruction of the flynt flyer and this obituary was so long and complimentary that it almost made amends for his loss even though he knew the details to be highly imaginative in the third notice he owed his eminence to his father who jinny learned with surprise had been the beneficiary of a miracle among the most singular of the effects produced by the bradmarsh floods ran the paragraph that drew caleb from the long obscurity of his seventy winters and which was as prolix and breathless as a sentence of mrs purleys may be cited the fact of a small cornstack some four yards long recognized by a shepherd named peartree as belonging to mr caleb flynt of frog farm father of mr william flynt the lamentable destruction of whose coach and horses under sensational circumstances is recorded in another column having been lifted from its place by the waters that so suddenly burst upon this remote homestead and after floating about at their mercy like a dismasted and rudderless ship being deposited in safety in a higher field wholly uninjured save by the wetin as firm and compact a condition as before the floodand apparently without a single blade of straw in its body or its roof having been disturbed from its relative position while other stacks in the same field belonging to his former employer farmer gale were almost totally ruined oh will im so glad said jinny i dont mean about farmer gale i do mean hunks think what he paid dad all those years but is it true about our stack i wonder papers arent always correct arent they she nestled closer oh dear no you should have been in america havent you noticed it says elijah rescued us such a mixup with his housing us thats why i didnt tell poor old dad till i could run up and see for myself she moved back oh is that what you came for of course not darling but being here i may as well have a look well youll be able to while im at church i suppose you wouldnt come she added shyly church he laughed why its nearly over he pointed to a pale struggling sun that had well passed its zenith v mr fallow was in fact just at his fifthly and finally with nip for sole representative of blackwater hall that faithful congregant discovering that jinny had dodged him as usual had set out for church forthwith and was utterly disconcerted to find her pew vacant it was noted however that he remained awake during the sermon pricking up his ears at the recurrent word methuselah which no doubt sounded to him like his old companions name mr fallows timely sermon on noahs flood proved no less rousing to the human hearers though it began unpromisingly with the text and all the days of methuselah were nine hundred sixty and nine years and he died but miss gentry already ruffled by jinnys absence wondered why so much honour should be done to mr bundock why preach a sermon against a postman she asked jinny afterwards the fact was of course that those sceptical sophisms which mr fallow took the opportunity to traverse and confute came from the age of reason but as miss gentry had heard them only from bundock she did not know they were inspired by tom paine at any rate it was satisfactory to have them demolished and the veracity of the bible vindicated by the very arithmetical tests with which the atheists juggled they had set the story of noah and his ark as on a level with the arabian nights and the ages of the patriarchs as no less fabulous than the immortality of the giants of mythology well but here was the text mr fallow thundered and all the days of methuselah were nine hundred sixty and nine years and he died a statement splendidly barebare as truth alone could afford to be but let them follow it these dear brethren and sisters into all its ramifications trace the scattered threads of chronology and exhibit their marvellous congruity noahs grandfather lived nine hundred sixty and nine years and he died but at the age of he had begotten lamech and at the age of lamech had begotten noah methuselah was then just years old when the hero of the flood was born and the flood came we were told in a later chapter in the six hundredth year of noahs life added to made and all the days of methuselah were nine hundred sixty and nine years and he died had the figures made the bible would have indeed ceased to be the infallible word of god and atheism could have crowed unanswered for methuselah was not in the ark and every living creature outside was destroyed from the earth whether he himself perished in the flood or whetheras the preacher preferred to believe the aged patriarch had been removedlike his father enoch before himfrom the evil to come was a minor issue compared with the glorious certainty that added to made and not had lamech or noah been begotten one year later or the flood recorded as one year earlier what a catastrophe for mankind how the sophists would have gloated over their perverse arithmetic happily such discrepancies were the mere dream of the impious and all the days of methuselah were nine hundred sixty and nine years and he died nip refused to sit through the prayer for sceptics that followed with the cessation of the word methuselah his interest waned and the dismal conviction overcame him that jinny had gone back to the chapel tearing off at a great rate he soon however scented the truants homing across the common why where have you been said his mistress as if he were the sinner but his raptures at seeing united at last the twain he had done so much to bring together served to suspend a debate that had brought the first cloud on the mornings happiness having to walk smartly to blackwater hall with no time for dalliance they had come at last to a serious talk about their plans and it transpired that wills mind was playing about the new australian goldfields he seemed dangerously in the grip of the yellow fever which spreading from a mr hargreaves and summer hill creek had circled the world in less than nine months he recited to jinny the legends of the new diggings the quartz that was threefourths gold the aureous streams the nuggets the size of melons when he spoke of purchasing shovels and blankets it was not alas for their joint home nor were the cradles of his conversation indelicately domestic how could he talk of going away she asked with tears in her eyes when they had only just got to know each other well of course he didnt mean tomorrow with his arm like that she neednt begin to cry yet but obviously this hidebound old england was no place for a man without capital did she expect him to become a farmhand to farmer gale of course he could go on shearing sheep and doing odd jobs and sink into a ravens always singing with nothing to sing about but if they were to marry he must find a decent livelihood hard irrefutable truths if onlyshe thoughtthey had both been less silly while he still had his coach and horses impossible to suggest to a man like will that she might manage to earn enough for him as well as for her grandfather of course if he had lost his arm altogetherbut that was too wicked a speculation to gloat over had methusalem been younger and stronger the cart might perhaps have taken on extra rounds with will in command but even that would probably have jarred his pride no he was a ruined man and adventureas he truly urgedwas his only chance and yet she clung tighter to his one good arm glad of the respite the other had given her and hoping that the angelmother would somehow intervene to keep him in the countryif not the countyshe hovered over sufficient for the day was the good thereof here was will and nip and the sunday pie in the oventhe first good dinner since christmas the preparation of which for her lipsmacking elder had served to keep her sane during those days of torturing suspense how glad she was the meal would be worthy of their visitor a faint uneasiness did indeed begin to creep under her happiness as they crossed the rutted road that divided the common from her gate but she was hardly conscious what it was vaguely putting it down to nips dangerous attempts to caress them with his muddy paws here we are she cried gaily lucky granfer never asks about the sermon he drew her to him hurriedly ascertaining that there was no eye or telescope bearing upon her she submitted to the long ardour of his kiss then she drew him in turn towards the gate but ive kissed you goodbye he said goodbye she repeated blankly arent you coming in how can i come in even then she hardly realized the situation foreseen as it had long been it had so softened in her own mindespecially after her comparative success in soothing down her grandfatherthat she did not realize it remained in wills in all its original crudity youre not thinking of that nonsense she said smiling well just lift up the latch and walk in wont granfer be surprised but her smile was uneasy youve forgotten jinny he wont have me over his doorstep oh is that the reason you didnt come all the week the greyness creeping beneath her happiness began to spread out like a clammy fog well how could i have got to you i couldnt stand about the common in the wind and rain on the chance you might catch sight of me id have stood about for you she said simply and didnt i stand about at the black sheep yes that was my fault sweetheart but anyhow we wont stand about here and she tugged at his arm where else could you have dinner i can get some at the king of prussia ill be just in time if i go now you desert me to get dinner you know thats nonsense dearest considering i could get both if i came in then why dont you come in you know i cant because of those few high words how absurd we wont go into that now yes we will you dont want to eat humble pie but it isnt humble pie she laughed with a desperate attempt at merriment its steak and kidney pie so there but jinny he forbade me to cross his sill you old goose he never thought wed cross it arm in arm like this come alongwont he open his eyes and wipe his spectacles he shook off her arm its no laughing matter jinny an oath is an oath an oath she repeated dully the violence of that grotesque collision had blurred her memory of its minuti you cant have forgotten he laid his hand on the biblehe vowed to the almighty i should never cross your threshold she essayed a last jaunty smile unless on your hands and knees dont forget that part is it likely i could forget such an insult well then thats all right her smile became braver well crawl in together two little babies come along petsy and she stooped down comically how can you be so childish jinny isnt it all childish down you go willie but he stiffened himself physically as well as morally give in to such a humiliation you wont really be giving in she said with a happy thought with only one arm you can only come in on your hand and knees so youll outwit him after all come along poor little lopsided creature jinnyll help youand granfer will forget to count your limbs my poor brave boy its you that are forgetting he said harshly its impossible whats impossible that i should crawl to your grandfather i see its your pride you love not me no it isnt yes it is she snatched her hand from his nothing can bring you to your knees its not true id go on my hands and knees to you as if i was in chapel and id crawl on em across your threshold and thank god for what laid on tother sidebut you see jinny what breaks me up is that i made a vow too you you dont seem to remember anything i dare say i was a bit dazed at all the silliness but if you swore too not to cross our threshold why ill go and let you in by the lattice and perhaps granfer will be that tickled hell laugh and forget about his cranky old oath or perhaps hell reckon you have scrambled in on your hands and knees oh dear isnt it funny see you in a moment will she put her hand on the latch of the gate he shook his head neither by door nor by window didnt i say id never cross your doorstep she urged and yet i came you came through the window well ill come by the door there thats a fair offer im not going to stick to sillinesswhen its so silly all very well he said coldly but you know you cant get through my door goodness gracious have i grown so fat dont pretend you know its the flood besides it wouldnt be any good my going through the window what i said when i raised my hand to heaven was that your grandfather should never see me in his house just what i saidi remember now she interrupted i said youd never see me in frog farm and yet you didand lost your bet too her face was gay again so i gave in first you see sweetheart and now youve got to play fair you dont listenyou cut into my words what i swore was that your grandfather should never see me in his house unless he carried me in her gaiety grew hysterical ha ha ha she laughed grandfathers given up carrying ages ago im his deputy now oh dear she measured him with a rueful eye well i can but try and she put her arms round his hips dont make light of an oath jinny he pushed her off with his left hand twas you that made light of an oathtaking the lords name over trifles i never took the lords name he said sullenly i only lifted my hand well you cant lift it nowand serve you right you surely never expected granfer to lug a sulky lout over his doorstep of course not i never expected id want to cross it why jinny though you were there in the room i was that blind and his hand sought hers again leave me alone she cried you and your miserable vows id cut my tongue out if i could unsay the words you can unsay em more easily with your tongue in a man cant go back on his sworn word women dont understand so you said about horses and nicely you managed yours oh forgive me i didnt mean to crow that was your misfortune but this is your fault its your pride youre in love with not me goodbye granfer will be starving she lifted the gatelatch angrily but only goodbye for the moment he pleaded i cant cross your threshold but you can cross mine she answered more gently but her tone was tired and helpless and what would be the good unless you and granfer make it up im not marrying your grandfather something patronizing in the sentence jarred afresh youd better go back to blancheitll be too late soon i wouldnt touch blanche with bidlakes bargepole the magnificence of the repudiation had its effectit swamped in both the recollection that it was blanche who had done the refusing you dont expect me to give up granfer at his age she said more mildly well get him a minderwhen i come back from australia australia put the climax to her weariness oh yes i dont wonder its so easy for you to go it isnt easy for me to go even as far as chipstone he protested passionately but its your grandfather you love not me i love you both only think how old he is its like quarrelling with a child and he is in his second childhood almost though i wouldnt say it to anybody else there are times when he seems quite his old self wonderfully strong and sensible but there are moments when he quite frightens me he cant bear to be crossed and he forgets almost everything that happens nowadays then perhaps hes forgotten our upset no thats the unfortunate part but we must just make a little joke of it down on your marrowbones willie and she laid her hand on his shoulder with a last sprightly effort but even as his shoulder subsided it swelled up again like a pressed guttapercha ball its all grandfather with you your husband doesnt count husband indeed she withdrew her hand as if stung youre going quicker than your coach ever went oh very wellim off to australia as you please ill call for your box ill have no truck with a cart of yours theres no other way of getting things to chipstone she reminded him blandly ill shoulder it sooner he burst forth ah then you wont be going just yet damn my arm ill not stay in this wretched country another fortnight ill never look on your face again she began humming a dashing young man from canada his face grew black with anger and he strode away even before she had passed through the gate vi righteous resentment saved jinny from the collapse of the previous week that dreadful gnawing of uncertainty was over whatever she had said she was sure now that he did love her even if she came second to his pride that a way out of their difficulties would soon present itself to her nimble brain she did not doubt her one fear was that he would find the way to australia first and it was a comfort to remember his helpless arm and his empty purseno money to think of foolishness as his dear old mother had put it already on the tuesday after the unheard sermon she found a means of communicating with him without a lowering of her own proper pride for the fourteenth of the month was nigh upon them and the shopseven apart from the stationerswere ablaze with valentines a few sentimental but the overwhelming majority grotesque and flamboyant the british version of carnival after long search she discovered a caricature that not only resembled will in having carroty locks but carried in its motto sufficient allusiveness to the quarrel with her grandfather to make it clear the overture came from her not that the overture looked conciliatory to the superficial eye quite the contrary for apart from the ugliness of the visage the legend ran to such a man id never pledge my troth id sooner die i take my bible oath not a very refined couplet or procedure perhaps but jinny was never a drawingroom heroine and the valentine was dear to the great heart of the victorian people besides do not the grandest dames relax at carnival jinny half expected a similar insult from will by the same post and though st valentines day passed without bringing her one she still expected a retort in kind the day after and when bundock appeared with a voluminous letter directed simply to jinny the carrier little bradmarsh england her disappointment at mr flippances flabby handwriting was acute though otherwise she would have been excited not only by his letter but by the foreign stamp the first she had ever received so hes still in boulogne bundock observed casually lingering to pick up the contents i hope hes sending you the money to pay mrs purley why should he send it through me she said sharply well since hes writing to you it would save stamps wouldnt it i do think it was rough on mrs purley though a wedding breakfast like that though i expect he bought his own champagneand clinking stuff it was nigh as good as the sherry at poor charleys funeral however shes marrying her own daughter nowmrs purley i meanand lucky she is too to have escaped young flynt who is off to australia without a pennylooks to me almost as if theyre hurrying on the marriage so that will may be best man before he goes he and lijah are that thick he he he funny world aint it youve heard my riddle perhapswhy are marriages never a success because the bride never marries the best man he he well she came near doing it this timehe he he though whether shes the best woman for either of em is a question thats their own business jinny managed to put in so tis but with lijah a member of the chipstone temperance friendly society hell hardly like a wife who washes her head in beer what nonsense how can you know that fact its to make her hair wavy theres nothing her brother barnaby dont let out to my poor old dad she was at it the day you all came to the farm it wasnt that she had her bodice off and her hair down after the douchebundock seemed to savour these detailsshe didnt want him to smell it well you seem to smell out everything she said severely i do have a nose like nips he chuckled but although mr flippances letter was under it he was forced to go off without even discovering that it did contain a financial document very amazed indeed was jinny to see it drop out this iou which was for herself and not mrs purley and represented half a crown retiring to her kitchen she studied the largescrawled pages my dear jinnyi have just read in madame fs copy of her london journal which like mrs micawber she will never desert at least not till the present serial is finished an extract from the chelmsford chronicle about the miraculous saving of a cornstack belonging to our mutual friend mr caleb flynt i gather that a flood must have devastated little bradmarsh and i write at once to know if all my friends are safe especially your charming little self strange to think that the parlour in which i breakfasted on bacon and mushrooms in your sweet society may have been washed away but such is lifea shadowpantomime we are still at boulogne you see for one thingto speak franklyits a providential place to be at when funds are for the moment low and it appears that madame fs fortuneall that the villain duke left of itis in spanish bonds i need say no more i think i told you she was the niece of the famous cairo contortionist and doubtless it was during the stars sensationally successful season at madrid that she was thus misled the wily master of marionettes must have been aware of this when he got her off his hands appeared quite legibly here though scratched out with heavy strokes back his show over her head our present plans are before attempting london which though almost barren of talent calls for overmuch of the ready to launch an english season in boulogne itself where there is such a large english circle that saves so much by being here immune from sheriffs officers that it can well afford the luxury of the theatre not to mention the many french people here who must be anxious to learn english especially after their visit to the great exhibition between you and i i fear that madame fs hopes will be dashed by the fact that the french have no eyes or ears except for a jewess called rachel but as they have nothing near as good in the male line we may yetbetween usshow them something if this failsand i have seen too much of the public to be surprised at any ingratitudethere are always those wonderful new goldfields where men of our race and speech are flocking pickaxe on shoulder surely after their arduous toil for the filthy lucre they must be longing of an evening for a glimpse of the higher lifei understand they have only drinking shanties imagine it jinnya theatre for the rugged miners amid the primeval mountains with a practicable moon shining over the tropical scene pity i sold duke that theatretent but i suppose it couldnt be transported to australia as easily as a convict good gag that eh admission i suppose by nugget i dont see how you can give changeunless they take it in golddustand anyhow flush as they are they will probably hand in considerable chunks at the boxoffice reckless of petty calculation so do not be surprised if one easter morn you receive a golden egg laid by some australian goose i understand it is half a mole which reminds me to enclose herewith the halfcrown i owe you i dare say you have forgotten my borrowing it from you in the caravan of my bloodsucking soninlaw but players have long memories i suppose you see nothing of him or of polly for chipstone is a poor pitch but i am afraid from a christmas card polly sent me in reply to mine that the rascal is making her happy so i cant hate him as much as he deserves i hope i scribbled across the picture of the snowy mistletoe bough i sent her you are experiencing all that matrimony was designed for when this institution was introduced into eden lovely isnt it and where do you suppose it came from it was that delicious marthas farewell wish to me on my wedding morning i fancy she took it out of the number of the lightstand that i bought her poor dear martha do give her my love and tell her there is a branch of the new jerusalemites in boulogneno best make it two while you are about it a french branch as well as an english branch mutually emulous in upbuilding and how is her dashing cavalier of a son who posed as an american i expect hes married by now to the queen of the waspkillers judging by the warm way things were going at my own weddingparty if so pray hand him back his mothers christadelphian weddingwish with my kind regards oh and dont forget to say amiable things as they put it here to miss whatsaname the young and lovely bridesmaid tell her i havent forgotten about her becoming wardrobe mistress though if we go to australia im afraid itll be too rough for her at her age and even madame f may shrink from the snakes and the blacks and the convicts and the desperado diggers in which case we shall have boys to do the female parts and revive the glories of the shakespearean stage heavens how i have let myself chatter on my paper is nearly at an endlike youth and hope believe me dear jinny in this world or the next dont be alarmed i only mean australia your ever devoted tony flippance psi am so sorry but i find i cant find excuse my irish any way of sending the halfcrown by post so i am compelled to send you an iou but if you send it to polly dukes marionettes england is sure to find her some day i have no doubt she will honour it on my behalf safest address for me by the way is poste restante boulogne as madame f likes trying different hotels ppsthere is a game here called little horses most fascinating many and mixed were jinnys feelings as she ploughed through this bulky document swollen by the opulent handwriting having no notion about investments she vaguely imagined that spanish robbers had impounded cleopatras money and it added to her sense of the unsettled state of the continent as for the iou she was angrily amused to think that he had already paid her the halfcrown on the very morning of the bacon and mushrooms so fondly recalled and that she had bought him his wedding presenta biblewith it to pay little debts twice over while defrauding the big creditors and she had reason to think miss gentry as well as the purleys had been left unpaid seemed to her only an aggravation of fecklessness but perhaps the flippances had not meant to be dishonest it was those spanish freebooters that were to blame who had captured the gold destined for little bradmarsh the humiliation of his reference to blanche was hard to bearit made her want to dismiss will altogetherbut oddly enough a still keener emotion was kindled by mr flippances obsession with australia yes australia was in the air it was a net into which everybody was being swept will was going from herand to a place bristling with blacks and snakes and convicts and desperado diggers never had she received so perturbing a letter vii in the menacing silence of will she began to study this interloping and kidnapping australia for it was not only his silence that menaced through the hundred threads of her carrying careerantenn always groping for news of himshe learned that his resolve was fixed indeed frog farm was almost the only place on her rounds where his departure was not talked of at the fountain head she could collect no information for martha was the only person she now saw there and the old lady seemed anxious after receiving her parcels to rush back to the clearing up of the colossal mess of the receded flood a work in which the scrupulously invisible will was understood to be lending a hand almost as vigorous as his fathers albeit a single hand but if the other was still in its sling it was getting dangerously better she gathered from bundocks father that he would go without another word to her was highly probable was there not in finchingfield a hottempered farmer who had kept silence for seven years after his wifes death miss gentry who in her colchester days used to make his wifes gownsthe lady riding in behind him to be measuredsaid it was from remorse because he had once used an improper expression to her and this same essex obstinacy was liable to manifest itself in less noble forms as her grandfathers feuds had proved abundantly will would shake off the soil of old england as surlily as he had shaken it off in his boyhood as he had run away from his parents so he would now run away from her though far more unreasonably but this time she would at least know where he was going and her tortured soul reached out hungrily to picture his new world the spellingbook was absolutely blank about australiahow empty and worthless loomed that storehouse of information with this gigantic lacunabut from a bound magazine volume of miss gentrys borrowed for the first time she drew confirmation of her worst fears it was a place that needed many more stations and outstations of the society for promoting christian knowledge and there were mosquitoes that could only be kept off by lighted torches and biting spiders as big as your palm after frying at in the shade you might shiver the next moment in the icy blast of the southern buster and there were dustwinds to boot if you went to the cemetery of port phillip you would see that the majority of deaths were between the ages of thirty and forty this premature mortality was due to the excessive drinking of cold water natural in so droughty a country what a blessing that will was not like mr skindle a member of the temperance friendly society nor was the labour market congested as it was with ticketofleave men and bountyemigrants from england really superior to that of the old country while houserents were twice as high as for the interior another number of the magazine contained a story in which an illfavoured man with his arm in a sling was pursued by a bull amid mimosa swamps in a setting of blacks with tomahawks and whites with pistols the bull and the bush she murmured whimsically to herself but at heart she was cold with apprehension then by a strange coincidence she found reassurance calling on mrs bidlake in her confinement she found the mother well and the new child vigorous but it was not from their condition merely that emanated the novel atmosphere of happiness that radiated over the household perhaps indeed the wellbeing was only a consequence of the happiness for the bidlakes too were off to australia though not to the goldfields the cloud over the family had lifted at last not that hezekiah had been proved innocent but that he was become opulent released on ticketofleave the sturdy ploughman had got a position with a cottage and garden in that splendid suny clim as he now called it and then just as he was about to send for sophy and sally he had won six hundred and forty acres on the outskirts of port phillip in a lottery run by the bank of australasia if he could borrow the capital from the bank as was not improbable he would be able to cut up his prize into tenacre allotments and build houses on itby that you simply doubled or trebled your outlay in a few years his sister should have a house anyhow and in the meantime her husband could help him manage or farm the vast estate as for the dere gels there would be no need for them to work now though if they wanted pocketmoney they would be snapped up for service and get as much as sixteen pounds a year each he had already sent fifty pounds towards the passagemoney and would raise more when he knew if they would all come out and moreover he understood that there was a family colonization society in london to which ephraim might apply for an advance what a change this going out of theirs from that dreadful departure in the prison coach for the hulks and botany bay jinny sharing their tears of joy was vastly relieved on her own account at the paradise the grotesquely spelt letter conjured up and she rejoiced to reflect that all that ancient barbarous harshness of magistrates and judges had led under providence to the enrichment of britains new soil with the sweat of her skilled agriculturists and was even opening up new horizons for their innocent relatives for assuredly this was a paradise on earth if hezekiahs letter was not a shameless lure for his brotherinlaw think of tea at eighteenpence a poundeven a shilling if bought by the chestthink of sugar at twopencehalfpenny and neck of mutton at a penny a pound nay a whole sheep for five shillings think of pork at twopence and the best cows butter at sixpence and after one has been reduced to turnips and dry bread think of a land where oxtails can be had for the skinning and sheeps heads and plucks by the barrow for the fetching away a land where as he wound up rapturously any man who worked could have his bellyful and where everything was plentiful except women so that his girls would be able to pick and choose among the gumsuckers and have cornstalks for husbands they shouldnt marry among the prisoners please god for he didnt reckon himself in that set having done nothing to be ashamed of though he did see now that threshingmachines were necessary when you had a lot of land if they want women so badly i might do worse than go myself said jinny laughingly no no whatever would little bradmarsh do without you said ephraim they did without me well enough she said bitterly indeed her first fine faith in human nature could not be mended as easily as the broken bridge nor did the depreciatory allusions of her old customers to the deceased coach and their compliments at her return soften her cynicism and as she spoke she felt a sudden yearning to be done with them all the infection of the new world began to steal into her veins too but she knew her own exodus was impossible while her grandfather lived and though she played with the idea and asked if she might copy hezekiahs instructions for the passage her real design was to gather information for wills sake it was very worrying though to copy the recommendations in the original spelling of kors i dont now wot the shipps is like nowerdies but the nu chums ses they dont give no solt onni rocsolt solt is peny a pound here peper d nounc and youll want thik warm close and moor beding there was an elaborate list of provisions necessary to supplement the ships dietary during the four weary monthsit hardly needed copying since it embraced a little of everything edible that would keepbut she was glad again that will was not a temperance man when she found a bottle of brandy recommended as an indispensable medicine for the contingencies of the voyage neglecting even the last instalment of her debt to miss gentryhad not the dressmaker given her the alternative of working it outjinny began to acquire the longestlived comestibles storing them secretly in one of the anteroom chests and it was by this concentration on wills interests that she managed to live through his dreadful silence nay to enjoy long spells of daydreaming in which these edibles were for their joint australian larder the goldfields her imagination dismissed as bristling with desperado diggers it was on the more idyllic images of her magazine article written before the days of the discovery of gold that her imagination fed for though the writer denigrated the urban labour market he admitted that there was plenty of room for rural labour and thenwith what seemed so uncanny a prying into her affairs that it flushed her cheek and made her heart beat fasterhe postulated a young couple without capital setting up housekeeping together and instructed them to take employment with a farmer while saving up enough to buy a small farm or herd of their own the system it appeared was that the employer supplied rations as well as moneywages and that while the husband worked on the land the wife could do the farm cooking how lucky she had had so much experience jinny thought nay these rations said the article pursuing her affairs to what the blushing reader thought the point of indelicacy would practically suffice for the children too and when they grew upbut her delicious daydream rarely went so far as this calculation of them as independent labourassets the happy couple would also be permitted to keep a few cows pigs and fowls here the thought of methusalem would intrude distressfully and the difficulty of transporting him to the antipodes but when he had been left at frog farm in the loving hands of caleb and martha become almost his parentsinlaw under promise of leisurely grazing for the rest of his life with perhaps a rare jaunt to chipstone market for their household needs this ideal solution only reminded her of the phantasmal nature of the whole scheme for frog farm could certainly not be saddled with her grandfather but lest she should remember too cruelly its visionary character the daydream would at this point dart off swiftly on the journey through the bush in quest of an idyllic spot free from blacks and provided with a generous employer fortunate that this journey was to be so inexpensive there being no inns not even the bull and bush but every settler being compelled by a wise decree of this wonderful state to give the bona fide traveller board and lodging for nothing what a lovely journey that would beif only one dodged the blacks and the diggers and the swamps with the alligators she saw herself and will bounding along like kangaroos with nip of course in attendance she did not intend to take up with a dingo instead through mimosabushes like the scrub on the common only gaudier and eating their dinnerpackets under giant gumtrees so enchantingly blue whose tops five hundred feet high one might climb so as to survey the route for signs of native camps or friendly farmers if there was no settler in sight by the time darkness fell they would just perch themselves like birds in a nest of high branches out of all danger and go to sleep under the starry heaven which she saw vividly with the old constellations closer to the real was her picture of the tenement with which the ideal farmer when found would provide his young couple there would just be a few poles driven into the ground to support the roof of gumbark with its hole to let out the smoke but of course one need not live much indoors in that climatedespite the occasional vagaries of the southerly busterand it would be all the easier not to have to spend money on furniture why put in nips basket lay out wills razor and slippers set out her spellingbook and the peculiar hymnbook the young rebel had thrown into the bushes hang up his hat and her bonnet and the place already begins to look like home as for wills boxpresumably conveyed to the chosen spot by the local carrier in a bullockcartit is so large it will crowd out everything else and furnish the place of itself decked with a rug it will serve as sofa covered with a cloth it becomes a table lucky she has not brought a box of her own but has squeezed her things into hisin that wonderful incredible fusion of two existences it was hard to wake from these daydreams to the wretched reality and yet uncle lilliwhyte profited from one of these awakenings for her australian hut had reminded her of his english specimen and she hurried to see it and him she found them both in a bad way his wading overmuch in the flood in quest of salvage had brought back more than a touch of his rheumatism while the winds and rain had left his shanty leakier than ever they were both breaking up the ancient and his shell and she now did her best to patch both up already in her new affluence she had called in young ravens to mend her grandfathers bedroom ceiling and redaub the gaps in the walls and it was simple to turn this jackofalltrades and fountain of melody on to the derelict hut in the woods the poor old uncle had hitherto built his fire as well as he could on the ground on the leeward side of his hut jinny now installed an old stove which she bought up cheap at the pawnbrokers and conveyed to the verge of the wood but the hole in the roof that might serve for australia would not do for england and after ravens had rethickened the walls with fresh faggots and rethatched the hut with shavings presented by barnaby jinny was amused to find that what seemed an iron chimney turned out on closer inspection to consist of three old tophats where the ancient had picked up these treasureswhether in the flood or in his normal scavenginghe refused to say happen oive got a mort o culch ye dont know of he cackled enjoying her admiration of his architecture she wanted to have a floor to the hut but this like the exchange of his sacking for a palletbed he opposed strenuously gimme the smell o the earth he said yeve shut out the stars and thats enough he accepted however a bolster for a pillow by such interests and devices aided by her regular rounds jinny staved off too clear a consciousness of the inevitable parting which would not even have the grace of a parting but the inexorable moment was like a black monster bearing down upon herand yet it was not really advancing it was rather something retreating it could not even be visualized as a shock against which one could brace ones shoulders there was the horror of the impalpable in this silent drift away from her but when at last the day of departure was named and came vibrating to her across a dozen subtle threads the negative torture turned to a positive that was still more racking it was on the fridayunlucky daythat will was to leave for london and here was already tuesday some of her threads conveyed even the rumour that in order to save a little cash for his start at the antipodes he meant to work his passage and here was she unable to pack his box or even to slip her provisions into it doomed by all the laws of sex and proper spirit to watchbound hand and foot as in a nightmarethe receding of the mate whose lips had sealed her his by the wednesday morning even her grandfather observed something was wrong ye aint eatin no breakfus yes granfer lots do ye dont tell me no fibs oive noticed your appetite fallin lower and lower like the flood and now theres amos nawthen o neither and ye used to be my little mavis you dont want me to eat snails or worms tis your singin oi mean there is hey she chanted obediently yere the most aggravatin galminds me o your greatgranmother ye need your mouth for eatin not singin after a sleepless night unable to bear this inactivity she ran round to the bidlake lodgings to suggest that as young mr flynt seemed to be sailing for australia it might be a neighbourly action to show him hezekiahs hints to travellers but she gathered from the happy mother that the absent ephraim had already talked to will about the heavier clothes and the bedding and that will had said how fortunate it was he had sold off his summer suits so as in any case to get the latest make at moses sons on his passage through london jinny suspected he had sold them off to raise funds for the voyage still the bravado of this pretence of a london outfit did not displease her she learnt too that there had been a question of wills convoying the exconvicts daughters to their impatient parent as the ephraim bidlakes would not be ready for ages but it had been thought scarcely proper in view of their age and looksa decision jinny thought wise indeed the idea that he was not to be thus companioned almost reconciled her by contrast to his departure when she got home she found to her surprise that her grandfather was entertaining martha flynt who was far from the spruceness she usually achieved for outsiders of the other sex she looked draggled and worn after her long and windy walk what astonished jinny most was that the old rheumatic woman should have trudged so far and she opined that her business must be pressing and must be with herself for it could hardly lie in the christadelphian texts with which martha seemed to be battering and bemusing the nonagenarian whose great bible lay open between them and who was disconcerted to find her texts really there martha had never set foot in blackwater hall before so far as jinny could remember and very strange it was to see her sitting over her cup of tea which she must have made for herself at her hosts invitation with all his perturbation over the texts he seemed only too brisked up by this amazing visit from a female the first unwhiskered being save jinny he had met for many moons it was a fillip he did not need jinny considered the old good food again the sweet security the satisfaction of revenge had made his eyes less bleared filled out his flacked cheeks and given him a new lease of strength and sanitya sort of second windand this visit might only overstimulate him she did not like the undercurrent of excitement that showed itself in the twitching of his limbs and eyelids especially when martha declared he could not be really accepting the book as allinspired if he believed mans heaven lay in the skies whither i go ye cannot come she repeated well see about that said daniel quarles fiercely and clenched his fists as if he meant to storm the gates of cloudland and aint ye forgittin lijah what went up to heaven with a chariot and bosses o fire that wont happen to lijah skindle damn himhell have the chariot o fire but he wont git no higher he he he martha was momentarily baffled by elijahs ascension but recovering her nerve she dealt john iii no man hath ascended up to heaven partly to soothe the old man partly to give martha a chance of speaking out jinny here intervened with the suggestion that he himself should ascend up to his room and bring down the telescope to amuse his guest withal obviously relievedfor he felt himself in a tight textual cornerhe hastened upstairs it was then that the old woman bursting into tears and clutching at jinnys arm sobbed out oh jinny youve got to come back with meyouve got to come back at once jinny turned cold and sick what had happened to will but what for she gasped to willie her worst fears were confirmed is he hurt i wish he was a little martha sobbed but even his arms all right now what martha went on to say jinny never remembered for she was suddenly sobbing with martha but hers was the hysteria of relief and when she at last understood that what martha was asking was that she should come back and marry will so that he should stay near his mother her heart hardened again it was not that she made any attempt to deny her lovethings seemed suddenly to have got beyond thatbut martha she felt knew not what she asked seeming to have divined from her boys demeanour a lovers quarrel but without any inkling of the real tangle and deadlock even if she humiliated herself as martha half unwittingly suggested it was all a blindalley my making it up wont keep him in england she urged hes got no money and no more have i she might have been more willing to make a last desperate dash of her head against the brick wall had she understood how martha had fought against her from the first and how pitiable was her surrender now but no suspicion of that underground opposition had ever crossed her mind nor did martha now confess what indeed she no longer remembered clearly but theres room for you in frog farm dearie wed love to have you weve always loved you i cant jinny moaned its all no use and ive got granfer indeed marthas passionate plea had curiously clarified and steadied her mind reconciling her to the inevitable to go to will was exactly what she had been yearning to do but when the plea for such action came through marthas mouth she could see it from outside as it were realize its futility and cleanse her bosom of it she felt strangely braced by her own refusal but ive got some provisions for the voyage she said that you might smuggle into his boxi know its big enough and i do hope mrs flynt hes not going to work his passage i only wish he was for he mightnt find a ship but you see flynt would go and advance him the money and insist he must go steerage like a gentleman hes got no heart hasnt flynt she wept he only wants to settle down in peace after will and the flood and sit under his vine and figtree dont cryheres granfer coming down i tell you what i will do mrs flynt i will call for his box oh bless you jinny martha fell on her neck if you come he wont go thats as sure as sunrise and then i can bring him his provisions jinny pointed out sceptically as she disentangled herself from marthas arms then both females were dumbed by the sight of the gaffer returning in his best smock and with his beard combed he tendered martha the telescope with a debonair gesture but martha her mission comparatively successful departed so precipitately that the poor old man felt his toilette wasted not to mention his telescope shes a flighty young woman was his verdict as full o warses as our thatch o warmin sets herself up agin john wesley as searched the scriptures afore she was born and laying down his telescope he turned over the pages of his bible and perpending her textual irritants and questing for antidotes fell quietly asleep he was delighted when she returned the next afternoon and he played genesis v with a snort of triumph by way of greeting martha tremulously countered with acts ii and denied that enoch had gone up to heaven but it was obvious her heart was not in the game and jinny was glad when ravens ladder was clapped against the casement and his padded knees appeared in an ascension of a purely terrestrial character however celestial the melody that accompanied it for the gaffer had grown fond of this birdofallwork now in the rle of thatcher and would hasten to hover about him fussily directing the operations of his club shears or needle correcting the words and airs of his songs and even joining him in duets ravens encouragement of the older bird had become almost as alarming to jinny as his shameless delay in sending in his bill and his positive refusal to charge for uncle lilliwhytes repairs but this afternoon his advent was welcome though the noise and jingle of the duets outside made her conversation with martha difficult he mustnt gohe mustnt go mrs flynt sobbed its like the new jerusalem coming down and going up again jinny quite appreciated that i thought he wouldnt let me call for his box she said quietly no the pigheaded mule hes going to carry it himself in what its not easy to get anything but me he knows that thats why hes carrying it on his shoulders i mean with his arm just healed there wont be much insidehes going to buy his things in london but the box itselfwhy its big enough to pack himself in i know i know dearie but caleb says he carried it himself all the way from chipstone and chockfull too jinny suppressed a faint smile i remember she said but perhaps hell break down before he gets it to chipstone she added encouragingly oh do you think so dearie then marthas face fell but he only means to carry it to the king of prussia theres a commercial traveller going from there in a trap to catch the same coach then let us hope hell never get to the king of prussia martha shook her head you see flynts offered to bear a hand oh well said jinny then its all settled but he wont have his father either nearly bullied his head off so flynts going to keep behind him all the way in case of a breakdown the picture of caleb slinking furtively along the roads behind his boy and the box moved jinnys risible muscles and she burst into a laugh that was not far from tears dont jinny i cant bear it you cant love him or you wouldnt sit there and laugh i always knew you werent the right girl for him jinny took this as the babbling of a mind distraught youll get over it she assured the old woman patting the thin hand with the worn weddingring and hes bound to come back the necessity of quieting martha was fortifying jinny was like a queasy passenger saved from seasickness by having to look after a still worse sailor she was the soul of the company at tea staving off the duel of texts and sending ravens into ecstasies over her quips and flashes there was one bad moment however when daniel quarles candidly remarked to mrs flynt ravens should be tellin me as your willies gooin furrin yell be well riddy o the rascal willies an angel cried martha hysterically how could there be angels ef there aint no heaven he queried with a crafty cackle noa noa mrs flynt it aint no use kiverin up as hes a bad egg but one bad in a dozen or sow is fair allowance yere luckier than me what hadnt even one good un now ef ravens here had been my buooy jinny saw martha a bit of the way home she had now found a new compromise tell will that ravens will come with my cart and what will be the good of that it will save him the strain of carrying the box and then as tomorrows my day i shall have to meet my cart at the king of prussia oh jinny then you will yesbut dont tell him only say ravens will call for the box at eight oclockthat will give him time to walk if he jibs at the cart for himself it had all been arranged with the obliging birdofallwork and ravens had left blackwater hall that evening carolling even more blithely than usual when jinny foundevidently pushed under the housedoora mysterious cockedhat addressed miss boldero with trembling fingers she opened it her heart thumping to hell with ravens you can keep him this utterly unexpected flash of an utterly unforeseen jealousy and the thought that he had been drawn so spatially near again was all that stood between her and despair that last dreadful night viii when the fateful friday dawned it found jinny fast asleep worn out after long listening to a wind that would soon be tossing a ship about in those harsh hours she had felt it would be impossible to get up and go on her round in the morning but no sooner were her eyes unsealed than there sprang up in her mind the thought that did she fail her customers today gossip would at once connect her breakdown with wills departure so far she had reason to believe marthas guess at their relations had not penetrated outside but eyes were sharp and tongues sharper and she must not be exposed to pity under this goad she sprang up instanter and did her hair carefully before the cracked mirror and dressed herself in her best and smartest she would go around with gibe and laughter and fantasias on the horn and whatever was consonant with celebrating the final retreat of the coach the morning was quiet after the blustrous night but the year like her fate was at its dreariest momentno colour in sky or garden no hint of the springand at breakfast a reaction overcame her but this time her grandfather did not observe her depression he was too full of the crime of lijah whoaccording to marthawas putting his mother in the chipstone poorhouse prior to installing his bride in rosemary villa so garrulous was he this morning that jinnyher mind morbidly possessed by a story of a miner who was found dead of starvation in the bush with a bag of gold for his pillowceased to listen to his diatribes retaining only an uneasy sense that he was twitching and jerking with the same excitement as when martha had first come and oi count yell be doin the same with me one day she heard him say at last for he was shaking her arm but oid have ye know its my business not yourndaniel quarles carrier jinny wearily assured him that there was no danger of her ever marrying and she felt vexed with martha for coming and starting such agitated trains of thought in his aged brain possibly the foolish mother might even have broached to him her desire to rob him of his granddaughter ye ought to be glad oive give ye food and shelter and them fine clothes yeve titivated yourself with he went on unsoothed bein as there aint enough in the business for myself tis a daily sacrifice jinny and do ye dont forgit it the prompt arrival of ravens made a break but she had to cancel with thanks her request for his services with the cart and then when the old man was settled at his bible and her bonnet and shawl were on she collapsed in the anteroom sinking down on the chest in which she had hoarded wills provisions and feeling her resolution oozing away with every tick of the dutch clock impossible to whip up a pseudogaiety to make the tour of all these inquisitive faces and through the lassitude of her whole being pierced every now and then her grandfathers voice crying tush you foolish woman she knew it was not meant for her but for an imagined martha whose texts he was confuting but it sounded dismally apposite and when once he declared wiser folks than you knowed it all afore you was born she bowed her head as before the human destiny when the clock struck nine he came stalking in why jinny aint today friday she raised a miserable face yes but im going tomorrow instead tomorrow be dangnationed he cried upset oive never missed my friday yet but i dont feel like going today thatll never do jinny yell ruin my business with your whimwhams and mulligrubs and it dont yarn enough as it is theres no competitionit doesnt matter now and is that your thanks to the lord for drowndin pharaoh and his chariot and hosses but she put her head back in her hands do let me be she snapped dont ye feel well jinny he said with a change of tone have ye got shoots o pain in your brainbox im all right but i dont want to go today i should only make muddles we dont make muddles he said fiercely let me be i cant harness well then oill do it dearie you just set thereoill put the door a bit ajar and once youre in the fresh air youll be all right she heard him shuffle back into the livingroom and thence into the kitchen as the shortest way to the stable and then almost immediately she became aware of a little noise at the gardengate she was sitting opposite the clock and through the slit at the doorway she beheld to her amaze a redheaded figure outside the gate sitting on a box and mopping its brow as it gazed sentimentally at the cottage even in the wild leaping of her pulses the grotesqueness of their both sitting gloomily on boxesso near and yet so fartickled her sense of humour but as she sat on smiling and fluttering she saw him rise cast a cautious look round open the gate and steal towards the livingroom in a bound she was within and waiting by the closed casement and as his expected peep came the lattice flew back in his face and her hysteric mockery rang out i thought youd never look on my face again it was almost a greater surprise than when she had appeared with methusalem walking the waters for he had counted her just as surely set out on her friday round as the sun itself and his sentimental journey safe from misunderstanding or was it understanding oh dont cackle he snarled i might have guessed youd try to catch me she gulped down the sobs that were trying to strangle her speech how glad she was that she had on her best frock i overslept myself she said gaily granfers harnessing i see youve brought your box youre just in time i havent brought my box he snapped do ye dont tell me no fibs she parodied i mean its going from the king of prussia really well ill take it over the bridge for you thank you im taking it there myself this dont seem the shortest cut to long bradmarsh she observed blandly he glowered shows how easily i can carry it im having a goodbye look at all the old places but below this surface conversation they were holding one of their old silent duologues jinnys heart was beating fast with happiness and triumph as her eyes told him he would never get away now and he hypnotized by that dancing light in them dumbly acknowledged he was selftrapped yet how they were going to get out of their impasse and how his pride was to be reconciled with their reconciliation neither had the ghost of an idea i see she replied as if accepting his explanation of his visit but as to this old place im afraid ravens has rather changed the look of it with his new thatch he snorted at the name but youll find it unchanged inside she added affably if you come in dont begin that again you know i cant dear me i had forgotten that old nonsense well you can come nearer and peep in her face shone at the window his face worked wildly with the struggle not to approach hers i did have a peep goodbye ive got the coach to catch well the cart will be ready in a moment granfer is so slow harnessing hark nips getting impatient he raised his hat thank you but i told you i was my own carrier goodbye then pity you came so out of your way he turned and his feet dragged themselves hopelessly gateward she waved her hand desperately through the casement good luck will hope youll strike plenty of nuggets thank you jinny he opened the gate youll let me know how youre getting on if you like the gate clicked behind him her motherwit leapt to stave off the moment beyond which all her frenzied questing for some solution would be waste oh dear me will where is my memory going put your box in the porch a moment will you what for ive got a few little things for the voyagei really forgot oh jinny he came back through the gate but i dont need to bring the box to the door ill take the things from you through the window but i want to pack them in properlyi cant on the road theres nobody passing you never can tell we dont want bundock but ill pack them in myself id never trust a manin fact i expect ill have to repack all the rest look at mr flippance but still he hung back theres lots of room i know like a sensible man youre getting your outfit in london bring it along or shall i lend you a hand no no he hurriedly shouldered the huge box and jinny heard its contents shifting like a withered kernel in a nutshell it was the same american trunk with the overarching lid and as he swaggered up the garden with it it seemed to her as if time had rolled back to last spring but what comedies and tragedies had intervened between the two boxcarryings all sprung from the same obstinacy and yet she felt she did not love him the less for his manly assertiveness how sweet would be the surrender when their sparring was over and her will could be legitimately embraced in his held like herself in those masterful muscular arms her mind was really in her australian hut as he dumped the box at her feet no it would hardly do for a table she thought with that lidcurvature then she braced herself for a tricky tussle well wheres the goods he said lightly dont be so unbelievingtheyre in that sprucehutch four months you know youve got to provide against i know he said glumly unlocking his trunk and throwing up the lid violently he would have liked to smash the springs but the lid lined with cheap striped cloth stood up stiffly refusing to give him a pretext for postponing his journey jinny from her doorway gazed at the jumble in the great void shove it forward a bit she said carelessly moving backwards within what for your end of the box is not under cover why should it be it might rain and spoil your thingsim sure i saw a drop she tugged at the handle and the trunk slid along the porch and some inches over the sill unostentatiously he pulled it back a bit but she jerked it in again do leave it where i can see the things she said with simulated fretfulness good gracious she drew out the frockcoat he had sported for the flippance wedding whats this grandeur for oh for funerals and things like that in the bush and fancy packing it next to the blanket its all over hairs ill brush it and sell it for youravens will be wanting one for the wedding what wedding he demanded fiercely mr skindles of course werent you invited he winced and unrebuked she threw his wedding raiment over the provisionchest wed best keep this on top she said drawing out the blanket else you wont get at it i expect youll be married by the time im back he remarked with aloofness not i ill never marry now ive seen too much of mens foolishness going to be an old maid if i live long enough her vaunt of youth was dazzling well i hope you wont he said fervently wont live oh will wont fade into that you know what i mean the sweetest rose must fade so will this mufflerfortunately havent you taken your dads muckinger by mistake no noyou leave that be what a let of sunday collars weekdays too i like a clean collar ow this onrighteous generation she said in calebs voice all one to them sundays or no sundays she pulled up his cloak you leave that cloak be he said laughing despite himself but now your slings off you dont need it yes i do let it be please but she unrolled it mischievously and a packet of letters fell outher letters about the great horn well didnt i say men were silly she cried fancy taking that to australia and she made as if to hurl them towards the livingroom fire give em to me he reached for them angrily and that gave her an idea but theyre mine standing at the end of the box which made a barrier between them she held them mockingly just beyond his reach he came forward then perceiving one foot was right across the forbidden sill he jerked himself back violently then balancing himself well on his soles with a sudden swoop he curved his body forward to the utmost it only resulted in his nearly falling athwart the open box he recovered his balance and the perpendicular with some difficulty and no dignity take care she cried in almost hysterical gaiety you nearly crossed that time you give me my property he cried furiously theyre as much mine as yours not by law youve no legal right to detain my property and whos detaining it youve only got to come and take it his anger was enhanced by the sounds of daniel quarles returning with the cart a carolling lumbering barking medley it would be intolerable to be caught as though trying to cross the threshold give it me he hissed i dont want to meet him and as she tantalizingly tendered the packet nearer he lunged towards her at a desperate angle and overreaching himself as she deftly withdrew it fell prone into the open box his legs asprawl in the air curl em in quick she whispered with an inspiration tucking his legs in before he knew what was happening but as the lid closed on him he was not sorry to be spared the encounter get rid of him he implored through the keyhole business pouring in granfer she cried cheerily as the gaffer came up astare bear a hand no no not into the cart its to wait here there is hey she began chanting there is ree came his antiphone as he grasped the other handle lord thats lugsome he panted dropping it as soon as it was inside and letting himself fall upon it whew he breathed heavily nip too all abristle leaped on the box and yapped hysterically as though nosing for a rat this was the last straw will whose head the gaffer was pressing through the far from inflexible lid and who already felt asphyxiating gave a vigorous heave why its aloive cried the gaffer jumping up nervously then as the lid flew up nip was hurled into space and wills red poll popped up its a willinthebox cried jinny willie flynt gasped the gaffer yes granfer she said in laughing triumph and you carried him in ha ha ha a great roar of glee came from the jubilant junior and in the act of scrambling up his knees relaxed in helpless mirth and he let himself fall forward once more in the box in a convulsion of merriment daniel quarles carrier ha ha ha and see granfer cried jinny in still greater triumph he came in on his hands and knees daniel quarless bemused countenance changed magically ho ho ho he croaked on his hands and knees ho ho ho wills spasms froze as by enchantment come along will said jinny hauling him out its a fair draw and youve got to shake hands will manfully put out his hand you nearly squashed me mr quarles he said ruefully ye wanted settin on said the gaffer chuckling and he took the fleshy young hand in his bony fingers ye sot yourself to ruin us but what says the book he demanded amiably he that diggeth a pit shall tumble into a box wound up jinny merrily oi never knowed he was there did oid atarned that key said her grandfather guffawing afresh and everybody would have thought me in australia and then after long years a skeleton would have been found said will with grim humour jinny clapped her hands just like mr flippances play the mistletoe bough she had closed the housedoor a timid tapping at it which had gone unobserved now grew audible theres your dad said jinny wills eyes widened my dad he breathed incredulously git in the box whispered the gaffer almost bursting with glee git in the box his sinewy arms seized the young man round the waist will struggled indignantly i nearly choked he spluttered sh jinny with her warning finger and dancing eyes stilled him just for funonly for a moment her instinct divined that to let the old man have his way would be the surest method of clinching the reconciliation he could then never go back on her later never resent the trick played upon him it would become his trick his farce it would provide a fund of happy memories for the rest of his life and as she cried come in and the latch lifted and calebs whiterimmed cherubic countenance was poked meekly through a gap while her grandfather stroking his beard composed his face to an exaggerated severity jinny felt that life was almost too delicious for laughter hullo young chap was the gaffers genial greeting what brings you here oioi happened to be passin explained caleb awkwardly while his puzzled eyes roved from the girl to his senior and then towards nip who was cowering in a corner too nerveshattered to leap on the lid again you aint seen my willie he moved forward questingly the older man tried to answer then a guffaw burst from that toothless mouth and turning his back he blew his nose thundrously into his handkerchief while his lean sides shook like a jelly why ever should we see your willie cried jinny saving the situation aint he gone furrin caleb rubbed his eyes but oi seen him at this doorhell be late for the coach at this door the gaffer succeeded in saying and then his handkerchief came into play again and he sneezed and coughed and blew like a grampus oi seen him just by the sill swingin forth and back like a parrot on a perch at that jinny had some pains to keep a stiff lip and even the boxlid quivered but not with laughter she surmised im afraid you must have dreamed it she replied lord quoth caleb and dropped dazedly on the box to see the gaffers face when the lid shot up under his visitor was worth more than mr flippances finest show the very soul of old english mirth was there you would have thought that this crude device had never entered human brain before was as fresh as the first laughter of eden and what heightened the humour of the situation was that caleb was by no means overpleased to find will had no intention of catching his coach nor did he begin to enter into the spirit of the thing till admitting that martha would exult in gladness it occurred to him what a surprise for her it would be to get her boy delivered back to her inside the box eagerly the two old men imagined the scene catching fire from each other improvising marthas dialogue for her from her amazement at seeing the box back down to the colossal climax till the mere idea had them both rolling about in helpless quiverings and explosions nor could will though he said hed be danged if hed stuff himself in again and groused hed got cramp in every limb altogether escape the contagion while to witness the roisterous merriment of the two hairy ancients gave jinny such an exquisite joy of life as not even her lovers first kiss had given her such an assurance streamed from it of life being sound at the centre a bubbling fount of sweetness and love and innocent laughter it wiped out for ever the memory of that morbid doubt of the nature of things that had assailed her as she sat under the gaze of the stuffed owl in mrs pennymoles cottage the day of the rape of methusalem tears welled through her smiles as will at last bade his father lend a hand in transporting the box to the waiting cart it must return to frog farm even if he was not inside it and i dont believe there ever were any provisions jinny he grinned with an afterthought oh yes there are said jinny look and a bottle of brandy too you dear he began but jinny cut him short with warning signals the sudden revelation of their relations might undo all the good of the spree by reviving her grandfathers apprehensions of desertion indeed when the hurlyburly was over he could scarcely fail to ask himself what this sportive intimacy of the young couple portended especially as he had even in the past suspected the answer the truth must be broken to him cautiously and with that reflection came the chilling remembrance that all this hubbub and laughter had solved nothing that the situation though superficially eased was essentially the same as before that the problem had only been postponed putting will in a box was not keeping him in england he would probably have to sail just the same and the pain of parting be borne afresh and even if he remained she could not abandon her grandfather but she shook off these thoughts enough for the moment that will was hers again oive never laughed so much since oi seen that andraa at chemsford fair the day oi fust met annie said her grandfather wiping his eyes as she set off on her delayed round with will at her side and caleb and the box in the cart and nip bounding like mad along the muddy road but it was impossible to keep caleb in mind will was too impatient and too famished a lover for that and it is not often that you sit at your sweethearts side when you ought to be whirling towards the antipodes caleb could not help seeing happy backs circumplicatedin the more solitary roadsby arms and the hope first implanted by martha that he would be relieved of will after all and in so desirable a fashion grew more and more assured though the occasional rigidity of the bodies under observation unsettled him afresh arent you late for the coach he heard bundocks voice inquire at one of these prim intervals no too early laughed will but youre going the wrong way the first time ive gone right said will and with magnificent indiscretion he turned and kissed jinny oh dear jinny gasped red as fire itll be all over chipstone by tonight i wanted the banns proclaimed as soon as possible he said unabashed then they became aware of a curious gulping sound behind them which drowned even methusalems ticktacks they turned their heads calebconvinced at lasthad buried his face in the famous muckinger mentioned between them only that morning whats up dad cried will sympathetically got a toothache its the joy at you and jinny he sobbed apologetically and to think that some folk are nearsighted and cant see god their friend meaning me dad asked will not untouched meanin mother willie lord what a state oi left her inall blarin and lamentation have faith oi says to her but oim afeared shes got too much brains and booklarnin oh i say dad laughed will wouldnt bundock like to hear that bundocks of the same opinion said caleb meaning the bedridden bundock few texts and much faith he says to me once and faith cometh by hearin dont one of em tell us singafies the ear cant take hold of a clutter o texts oh but surely mrs flynt has faith protested jinny shes too taken up with other folks faith caleb maintained stoutly wanted mrs skindle to break bread with her and look for the new jerusalemshe aint found much of a jerusalem poor lone widder and wanted to baptize that flip genleman but he never would come to the scratch and tried her tricks and texts on your poor old granfer she let out but when it comes to takin a sorrow from the hand of god her friend she sets and yowls like a heathen what runs naked in the wilderness oim done with that christy dolphin stuffit dont bring the peace of god and oill tell her sow to her head the next time shes at me to be a jew he mopped up the remains of his tears and same as oi did jine the sin agog he added pensively how do oi know she wouldnt goo on gooin forrard ix if in the very heart of the romp at blackwater hall jinnys insight could perceive that this reconciliation of her two males or her two mules as she called them to herself had left her marriage problem unsolved still more did afterthought bring home the sad truth there was no way of leaving the old man no way of adding will to the household the latter alternative she never even suggested it would bring her husband into public contempt to be thus absolutely swallowed up by the female carrier and supported as in a poorhouse so far off seemed the possibility of marriage that the gaffer was considerately left in ignorance of the engagementthe only man in a radius of leagues from whom it was hidden though will was constantly about the cottage having supplanted poor ravens as a house repairer but ever since the gaffer had clapped him in the trunkand the old man had forgotten he was not the first to do sohis affections had passed to the victim of his humour and he often recalled it to will with grins and guffaws as they sat over their beer ye thought to git over daniel quarles he would chuckle poking him in the ribs but ye got to come in on your hands and knees ho ho ho he seemed to imagine will called on purpose to be thus twitted with his defeat though as a matter of fact the privation of his pipe was a great grievance to the young man and supplied a new obstacle to his taking up his quarters there as soninlaw but outwardly will had fallen into jinnys way of humouring the old tyrant and this parade of affection rather shocked her for she felt that will was more interested in the veterans death than in his life once when recalling the delectable memory the gaffer remarked lucky ye aint as bonkka as sidrach oi count they had to make him a extrasized coffin she caught an almost ghoulish gleam in her lovers eyes he had indeed lugubriously drawn her attention to a paragraph in the paper saying that six thousand centenarians had been counted in europe in the last halfcentury evidently the age of man was rising dangerously he implied the worst of it was that jinny herself though she would have fought passionately for the patriarchs life found shadowy speculations as to the length of his span floating up to her mind and needing to be sternly stamped under for she had told will definitely that so long as her grandfather lived she could neither marry nor leave england gloomily he cited old parrhe seemed to have become an authority on centenarianswho had clung to existence till at that rate i shall be over eighty he calculated cheerlessly oh it isnt very likely she consoled him well its lucky we arent living before the flood thats all i can say he grumbled fancy waiting six hundred years or so i wish we were living before our flood she said then youd have your livelihood and what would have been the good of that without you youd have stuck to your grandfather just the same no there was no way out australia resurged black and menacing and finally she even wrote herself to the london agents about his ship consoled only by the entire supervision of his wardrobe and the famous trunk and the only wedding that followed on their engagement was elijahs foraccording to bundocks fathertill that had become certain blanche had refused to marry despite the calling of her banns i didnt think that a man who once aspired to me could ever keep company with a common carrier was her final version to miss gentry it shows how right you were to spurn him said that sympathetic spinster who had transferred her adoration of the beautiful from the faithless cleopatra to the clinging blanche and figured at the altar in her now habitual rle of bridesmaid and it was on that very weddingdayso closely does tragedy tread on the sock of comedythat poor uncle lilliwhyte fell asleep in a glorious hope of resurrection jinny had not suspected the imminence of his last moments till the evening before though she and will had paid him several visits at his now weathertight hut but she had become rather alarmed about him and returning from her round one tuesday she set off alone as soon as supper was over will had seen sufficient of her during the day and it was understood he was to give his mother his company that evening for martha had fallen into a more distressful state than ever wills got to go just the same she kept moaning when jinny came and flynt vows hell never be baptized into the ecclesia and turns round and tells me i lack faith me whove learnt him all the religion he knows there was a full moon as jinny set out with a little basket for the invalid nip trotted behind her and the trees and bushes cast black trunks and masses across her path almost like solid stumblingblocks the bare elms and poplars rose in rigid beauty in the cold starry evening death was far from her thoughts till she reached the hut and saw the sunken cheeks in their tangle of hair illumined weirdly from the stove which lay so close to the patriarchs hand he could replenish it from his bed of sacks just in time jinny he said joyfully oi was afeared you wouldnt be his excitement set him coughing and frightened she knelt and put her jug of tea to his lips there dont talk nonsense she said as a faint colour returned to his face he shook his head tis the tarn of the worms at last not for twenty years look at granfer oi cant grudge em he persisted oive took many a fish with em and oive been about the woods from a buoyoy master of beast and bird and snake and oi knowd oid be catched myself one day and thats onny fair aint it dont talk like thatits horrible yere too softyhearted jinny or ye wouldnt be here fussin over the poor ole man in the trap and ef yed been more of a sport yed ha understood its all a grand ole game catchmeefyoucan oi calls it its dreadful i thinkthe hawks and weasels eating the little birds then why do the little birds sing so tell me that its all fun oi tell ye and theyre havin it theirselves with the flies and the worms take your nip now nip hearing his name wagged his tail oive seen that animal what looks so peaceful squattin there by the fire stand aroarin like when you shuts the flap o the stove time he tries to git at a rathole ten men couldnt howd him hes never got a rat anyhow said jinny with satisfaction more shame to his breed oi count hes frighted away my fox all the same theres one what comes and looks in at me every evenin just like nip there onny wild about the eyes like oi reckoned hed be squattin there tonight for a warm too friendlylike but hell find both on us cowld soon the fire and me and a racking spasm of coughing accented his prognostic you mustnt talk like that you mustnt talk at all ill send dr mint tomorrow he raised himself convulsively on his sacking throwing off the rags and tags that covered him and revealing the grimy shirt and trousers that formed his bedcostume his grey hair streamed wildly almost reaching the bolster ef ye send me a doctor he threatened oill die afore he gits here do lie down she pressed him towards his bolster oi wont take no doctors stuff he gurgled as his head sank back but why she said covering him up with his fusty bedclothes youre not one of us surely a peculiar noa thank the lord oi told ye oi dont believe nawthen of all they religions git over me the whole thing but if you wont have medicine you must pray like we do ye dont catch me doin the one ne yet the tother oi count oi can git along without em as much as the other critters in the wood they dont have neither yes they doat least nip and methusalem have medicine when theyre sick i give it em myself oi reckon thats what makes em sickrelyin on skindles and sech oi never seen a stoat nor a squirrel take physic and ye dont want nawthen livelier and oi never seen a animal goo down on his knees unless twas a hoss what slipped he he he when the cough into which his gaggle passed was quieted jinny reminded him sternly that men were not animals that he had an immortal soul and she asked whether he would see mr fallow or one of the various chapel ministers that proved the most agitating question of all he sat up again his face working in terror none o that oi tell ye oi aint afeared o the old black un hell end all my pains though oi aint tired o life even with emno not by a hundred year but do ye dont come scarin me with your heavens and hells for oi dont want to believe in em but i remember your saying once weve got to have one or the other and oi told ye oi mislikes em both not really you wouldnt really dislike heaven he shuddered lord save me from it oive thought a mort lately about that charley mottoi used to see him drunk with his matesand ef hes in heaven among they parsons and angels oi warrant hes the most miserable soul alive lie down i oughtnt to have let you talk she said so shocked that she charitably supposed his wits were going this apprehension was enhanced when just as her hand had pressed his relaxing form back to his bolster she felt him grow rigid again with an impulse so violent that she was jerked backwards wheres my wits he exclaimed in odd congruity with her thought oive nigh forgot the teapot she hastened to offer again the halfsipped jug which she had stood by the stove he waved it away not that gimme the spade the spade ay it stands in the corneroi aint used it since my old lurcher died dye think hes in heavenroverand all they rats we digged up together youre not going to dig up a rat she said in horror no fear but oi wont have nobody else ferret it out and from his bed he tried to shovel away the earth near the stove but his strength failed she took his spade ill do it what is it tis in the earth he panted like oill be and oi reckon oid as soon be buried here as anywheres she turned faint did he mean her to dig his grave this isnt consecrated ground she said feebly oi count its got as lovely a smell as the churchyard earth he said but let em bury me where they will so long as oi dont wake up ye aint diggin jinny mystified and trembling and wishing she had not come without will she stuck the spade in deeper and threw up the clods set her teeth as she might she could not shake off the thought that she was digging his grave and they began to chatter despite the warmth from the stove the lurid glow streaming from it seemed sinister in the darkness of the windowless hut and she paused to let in a streak of moonlight through a gap in the door but the night outside in its vastness and under its blue glamour seemed even more frightening and the cold blast that blew in made the ancient cough again she reclosed the door and with trembling spade resumed her strange task suddenly her blade struck a metallic object thats it he cried gleefully and ye wanted to put boards over it more mystified than ever she drew up a heavy old teapot of britannia metalnever had she handled such a weighty pot pour it out pour it out he chuckled she held the spout over her jug which made him laugh till he nearly died but by thumping his shoulders she got his breath back she understood now what moved his mirth for though nothing had issued from the spout the lid had burst open and a rain of gold pieces had come spinning and rolling all over the hut it seemed like the stories the old people told of the treasures of gnomes and pixies there seemed hundreds of them glittering and twirling all for you jinny he panted with his recovered breath all for you why wherever did you get all this she replied dropping on her knees to gather the shimmering spilth thats all honest jinny dont be scat tis the pennies oive put together man and buooy this sixty year and more but what for she gasped for you and fowrpence or fipence a day tots up no i mean why did you do it her brain refused to take in the idea that all this fabulous wealth was hers why didnt you live more comfortablewhy didnt you get another cottage oi aint never been so happy as since farmer tarned me out to lay on the earth thats what oi wanted all my lifeonny oi dednt know it then what was the good of the money a crafty look came into the hollow eyes and overspread the wan features theyd have had me they guardians ef oi dednt have money oi wasnt agooin to die in the poorhouse like my feyther time they sold him up ef ye got the brads they cant touch ye do the master ould git into trouble they put mother and me seprit from feyther and when oi seen her cryin oi swore in my liddle heart oid die sooner than stay there or tarn prentice oi dropped through a window the night o feythers funeralfor the master had thrashed mebut oid promised mother oid come back for her and twarnt many year afore she was livin with me upright in the cottage happen you seen her though she never seen you yes i know said jinny softly she was blind cried her eyes out to my thinkin but oi says to her marnin and night cheer up mother oi says so long as weve got the dubs they cant touch us and ef they parish gents tries to lay hands on me theyll git such a clumsy thump with the teapot theyll know better next time she never seen the teapot mother dednt but she used to waggle her fingers about in it and laugh like billyo jinny felt nearer weeping as she culled these spoils of a lifetime many of the coins were curious mintage of an earlier reign she was peering in a cobwebbed corner when the barking of nip as well as a familiar footstep in the clearing announced a welcome arrival how glad she was will had not been able to keep away and then suddenlyat lastcame the realization of her riches of the solution of her financial problem quick quick whispered the old man hoarsely and signed to her to hide the teapot to soothe him she put it swiftly in her basket youre sure theres nobody else ought to have it she asked anxiously oi aint got no friend cept you and the fox and ye dont catch him in the poorhouse but oill die happy knowin as oive saved you from it dont let em come in he gasped as a tapping began its only young mr flynt willie dye mean she blushed in the friendly obscurity hes come to see me home he mustnt come in ill tell him she set down the basket and went out into the blue night it was no longer terrifying will with his ash stick seemed a match for all the powers of darkness but she drew back from his kiss death was too near in whispers she explained the situation forgetting even to mention the gold i oughtnt to leave himhe oughtnt to die alone nonsense sweetheart you cant stay all night with a dirty old lunatic dont talk so unchristianly will you dont deserve but she shut her lips she could not go now into the happiness the dirty old lunatic was bringing them make him up a good fire and say youll be back first thing in the morning ill come and take you there couldntcouldnt you stay with him will me you said he wouldnt have me and i havent got enough baccy on me she went back tentatively she found uncle lilliwhyte lying on his back on his sacks with closed eyes and there was blood on the bolster the earth had been shovelled in again and the soil flattened tidily with the back of the spade the superfluous precautionautomatic effect of lifelong habithad evidently cost him dear he can come in now he said feebly but he doesnt want anything she explained you lie still oid like him to come she went softly to the door and called here i am uncle cried will cheerily taint you oi want but happen ef your mother ud come and talk things over my mother said will startled martha he knew would have the same repugnance as he to this feckless grimy impossible creature an aversion which even the wasted features could not counteract it dont seem to git over she he explained but oi never could hear proper bein at the keyhole in a manner o speakin but ef shed come and explain yes she will said jinny she must will ill tell her he murmured hell bring her in the morning she promised emphatically you take a little more tea now and get to sleep she covered him up carefully and stuck a great log in the stove do ye take that fowlinpiece young flynt he said opening his eyes and be carefulits loaded thanks ill take it in the morning and theres the coppers and silver jinny thats at the bottom o the sack oim on and old tradesmens tokens too in the morningyou go to sleep now she said tenderly but she still lingered reluctant to leave him and was very relieved when ravens now become a woodman with an adze looked in to see the old man and unembittered by the sight of the lovers consented to pass the night in the hut he had mended x swinging home through the wood through aisles flooded only with moonlight the young lovers soon left the thought of death behind them indeed from the hut itself there had soon come following them the careless strains of the incurable caroller tis my delight of a shiny night in the season of the year what a hefty basket said will at last whatever have you been carrying the old codger its what im carrying off she laughed but give it me if its too much for your poor arm its not so heavy as my box he smiled but it saves carrying that she said happily how do you mean thats your farm in thereyour english farm australia is off she enjoyed his obvious fear that the scene in the hut had been too much for her brain goose she cried goose with the golden eggs just take a peep theres only your jug and teapot he was more mystified than ever but her happiness waned again when the riddle was read you surely dont expect me to pocket your money he said as soon as his slower brain had taken in the situation oh will surely what is mine is yours not at all what is mine is yours but thats what i said dont turn and twisti know youre cleverer than me her hand sought his dont let us have a storm in a teapot but he rumbled on with all my worldly goods i thee endowits the man says that youve been reading the marriage service and how would you know it if you hadnt that suspended the debate on a kiss you see id be almost as bad as poor charley mott he pointed out i see she said humbly indeed she felt herself so much a part of him now that she wondered how she could have failed to look at it from his point of view her defeat of his coachunder providencehad humiliated him enough to have turned suddenly into an heiress was an aggravation of her success now to make him appear a fortunehunter would be the last straw but couldnt i buy the farm and you rent it of me she ventured with a memory of hezekiah bidlake everybody would think just the same well but somewhere elsewhere nobody knows us you wouldnt come somewhere elsenot till im eighty dont be absurd anyhow youll look beautiful with a white beard why not get him a minder with the money then we could go to australia together leave him to a stranger hed die but so long as the farm was in england it wouldnt be so bad even if i couldnt come just yet he did not answer and as they walked on silently her daydreams resurged her nipped buds began bursting into wonderful flower they parted at her door without further reference to money questions but her face was brimming with happiness as the pot with guineas in that rosy moodwhen her grandfather nidnodding over the hearth roused at her returnshe could not refrain from pouring out her teapot on the table and changing his grumbles at her absence into squeaks of delight she meant to pour out her story too but he cut her short thats mine he cried exultant thats the gold sidrach brought me no no granfer that comes from but theres the wery spade guineas he dabbled his claws in the coins oh is that what they are but theres heads of victoria too thats what he saved in babylon dednt oi say as he died warrum but you must listen granfer uncle lilliwhyte she recapitulated the story theyre mine anyways he scooped them up in his skinny palms and let them fall into the pot with a voluptuous clang ye gits quite enough out o my biznus this seemed so exactly the reverse of wills attitude that she found herself smiling ruefully at the way she was caught again between her two mules but she could not thus lose her marriageportion uncle lilliwhyte gave them to me for myself she said firmly and dont ye owe me back all the money oi paid when your feyther died jinny was taken aback how much did you pay hunderds and hunderds dednt hed abeen a disgraced corpse and your mother too jinny was silent the angelmother seemed rustling overhead the gaffer closed shutters and bolted doors with rigorous precautions and hugging the teapot to his bosom stumbled up to bed depressed by this unexpected seizure of her windfall she found herself too utterly weary after her long days work and excitement to open the shutters again much as she disliked an airless room she had scarcely energy to pull out her chest of drawers for a few minutes she watched from her bed the blue flickering flame of the log then knew no more till suddenly she saw above the dead fire a monstrous shadow curling over the chimneypiece and along the ceiling in another instant she traced it to something still more horribleher grandfathers legless trunk appearing over the hearthstone with his nightlight in one hand and the teapot in the other the rushcandle shook in its holed tin cylinder and set his grisly counterpart dancing jinnys blood ran cold evidently some one had murdered him for the gold and this was his ghost then she told herself it was one of her nightmares and she looked around for henry brougham esq to clear up the situation but with a soft thud the trunk dropped as through a trapdoor and there was nothing left but a great glimmering hole where the hearthstone should have been instantly she realized that it was only a secret hidingplace in which her magpie of a grandfather was bestowing the treasureyes there was the hearthstone slewed round as on a pivot this must be that old smugglers storehouse he and gossip had sometimes hinted atwith perhaps the long underground passages of ancient legend reaching to beacon chimneys nay to the parsonage itself she closed her eyes carefully as his shadow heralded his reascent he came up almost as noiselessly as that giant spectre and between her lids she saw him scrutinize her reassured to see his shanks again she emitted one of his snores wondering whimsically if she did snore or if any other girl had ever heard herself snore and a smile almost broke the impassivity of her cheeks satisfied with the snore he stooped down and she saw the hearthstone veer back to its place well i can always get it when i want it she thought cheerfully as his slow stockinged feet bore him and his more sinister shadow upstairs for some time she lay awake pondering over the fate of her money which seemed like cleopatras to be in bonds and wondering whether poor uncle lilliwhyte was still alive then everything faded into a vision of mr flippance jogging marionettes for rugged miners who poured out their teapots at the boxoffice reducing it to such a swamp that its boxes floated in the tea at breakfast finding her grandfather abnormally restless she asked him a little maliciously if he had slept all right oill sleep better tonight he said and chuckled a little he seemed indeed very happy at having his treasure so well warded and though his exuberance was alarming she felt that the excitement of happiness was a lesser danger than that long depression of penuriousness if the defeat of the coach had seemed to give him a second lease of life what might not his new wealth do for him he might really become an old parr and poor will be kept waiting till the twentieth century it was thus with only a moderate uneasiness that she left him stealing with her basket to the rendezvous at the hut in the wood she met ravens hurrying to find breakfast and he sang out that martha and will had relieved him and that uncle lilliwhyte was better as she approached the clearing she saw the old woman come out of the hut with a bottle in her hand and a face absolutely transfigured the whining peevish latterday martha was gone a radiance almost celestial illumined her featuresit seemed to transcend even the bonnet and to rim it with a halo this was a woman walking not on the dead dank leaves of a frostgrey wood but through the streets of the new jerusalem behind her came will with a little cynical smile playing about his mouth till he espied jinny when his face took on the same ecstatic glow as his mothers jinny could not but feel enkindled in her turn by all this spiritual effulgence and it was three glorified countenances that met on this march morning hes broken bread with me breathed martha and ive helped him put on the saving name she displayed her bottle with drops of water beaded on the mouth she had baptizedalbeit only by an unavoidable reversion to sprinklingher first convert the dream of years had been fulfilled at last and the apostolic triumph had lifted her beyond humanity fired her with a vision in which a conquistador of faith she was to turn all little bradmarsh nay chipstone itself into one vast synagogue this were indeed the new jerusalem and it was will that led my feet she said kissing him to his disconcertment and go where he may now jinny he cant take that away from me and i shall always have his letter to inspire me to win other souls she touched the left side of her bodice and poor jinny suddenly reminded that her grandfather had robbed her of her last chance of keeping will in england felt envious of marthas exalted source of consolation ive got to go now and cook flynts dinner said martha but he wont have much appetite for it if hes got any right feeling left when he hears that another man a stranger has been before him in the path of righteousness maybe youll write to the lightstand willie to say theres a new brother in little bradmarsh ill tell em the ecclesia has doubled its membership said will with a faint wink at jinny to which the girl did not respond do you think mother he asked with mock seriousness the new jerusalem will come down in australia same as here of course said martha again will winked at jinny but she frowned and shook her head her study of australia had instructed her sufficiently that it was on the other side of the globe and she knew that will was having fun with the idea of the golden city coming down two opposite ways at once but she felt it criminal to break marthas mood and indeed was not certain she herself understood how the australians escaped falling off into space discouraged by her stern face will murmured hed put his mother on the road and be back she smiled and nodded at the promise but her heart was heavy with a sense of inevitable partings as she went in to the lingering ancient the deathbed conversion was evidently a success for she found him almost as radiant as martha though with a more unearthly light while the gleaming as of dewdrops on his dishevelled hair and the stains of damp over his bolster seemed to convict his spiritual preceptress of a dangerous recklessness but he was probably beyond saving in any case jinny reflected and what other medicine could have given him that happy exaltation the logs roared in the stove and all was joy and warmth that rimy morning oive tarned a christy dolphin he announced jubilantly yes im so glad drink this before it gets cold he waved it away oi suspicioned all the time as that be the right religion no hell at all ye just goos to sleep and when the new jerusalem comes down for they righteous ye dont git up youll wake upyou and your mother she assured him standing her jug by the stove thats what mrs flynt says ye aint done no harm she says and when the trumpet blows for the saints your bones will git their flesh agen same as now there was little enough on them to go through eternity in she thought gazing at his shrunken arms which he had left outside the coverings in repudiating the tea wont that be wonderful she said the tears in her eyes thatll be wunnerful wunnerful he agreed that fares to be what oi calls a real heavenyour own body not a sort o smokecloud ye wouldnt know was you ef you met it your own flesh and blood livin on this lovely earth with the birds and the winds and the sun and the water all asingin and ashinin for ever and ever and no bad folks ne yet angels to worrit ye no liddle boys to call arter yewhy its just ginnick oi reckon oill choose this same old spot yes its a lovely spot said jinny but she wondered whether he had not made his own version of marthas new jerusalem which she herself had always understood to be more jewelled than natural your mother will be able to see it too she added gently as she put the tea to his lips a beautiful smile traversed the sunken features but suddenly a frenzy of terror swamped it he sat up with a jerk that dashed her jug to the stove shivering it into fragments but ef oi waked oid need my money agen he shrilled what jinny always remembered most vividly when she recalled this tragic moment was the red lettering on the sacks he lay on exposed by his upright posture gay bird co colchester her eyes read mechanically when he fell back and hid that inscription his face was at peace again that acuteness of terrorthe quintessence of the morbidity of a lifetimehad stopped his heart she was terribly shaken by this sudden and grotesque end she felt his pulse but without hope she had never seen human death before but she had a vague idea that you closed the eyes and put pennies on them she had no pennies with her she remembered there were some in the sack he lay on pennies and shillings but she did not dare disturb him to get at them she was obscurely glad she had not to wrestle with the problem of whether she ought to get his teapot buried with him for the contingency of his resurrection her grandfather would never surrender it she felt and if she descended into his mysterious underground and abstracted it that might upset his wits altogether besides uncle lilliwhytes face was now taking on a strange beauty as though his pecuniary anxieties were allayed but her nerves were giving wayshe threw open the door and looked out eagerly not for the lover but for the man who seemed necessary in these rough moments the dead must not be left alone she knew that or she would have set out to meet will perhaps if she left him alone his shy friend the fox would come trotting in now he was so still the parish authorities must doubtless be summoned to take charge of him but ought he to have a pauper funeralought she not to steal back enough of his money to save him from that but she remembered with relief that he had expressed indifference as to what became of his bodyso long as it was restored to earth its good old mother as she moved a few paces without in her peering for will she saw the blue smoke rising through the three tophats and in spite of the dead mans doctrines and apprehensions she could not help fancying it was his spirit soaring towards the abode of the angelmother when will returned she was relieved to find ravens striding beside him that sunnysouled factotum who had meant to hie to the skindle wedding now found himself transformed instead into a corpsewatcher while will taking jinny a bit of his way went off by the shortest cuts to chipstone poorhouse as probably the centre of authority for parish funerals theres the coroner too ravens called after him will there be an inquest jinny asked must be said will and jinny alarmed for marthas sake ran back on pretence of her basket and surreptitiously wiped the bolster as they left the clearing they heard ravens singing in the hut xi when their roads parted jinny insisted on returning to her grandfather whose excitement now recurred to her mind she was still a little uneasy about the pauper funeral but will had emphatically agreed with her that the teapot could not now be recaptured nor could it be drawn upon he declared the old grabber would assuredly have counted the contents jinny suspected that will was pleased rather than sympathetic at her having ceased to be an heiress the death of uncle lilliwhyte so much the junior of daniel quarles could not but set both their minds on the thought of a similar cutting of their gordian knot but the thoughtdreaded or welcomewas not allowed to appear in their conversation finding expression only in wills aggrieved assumption of the gaffers immortality even if i was to strike a nugget as big as a prize marrow wed be no forrarder he had grumbled and jinny with jangled nerves had accused him of selfishness when that poor old uncle was lying dead as she approached blackwater hall a creepy conviction began to invade her that their knot was already cut after that scene in the hut she was aquiver with presages of death and disaster the absence of smokesurely granfers hearth was not already coldadded to her alarm she remembered again his effervescence at breakfast why should his heart not stop too and when she saw the broad gardengate open and the house door ajar her own heart nearly stopped her intuition she felt had not deceived her yet he was nowhere in the house anteroom livingroom kitchen all were empty of him the fire was out in the bedroom lay his telescope a discarded toy she was about to sweep the horizon with it when she had an inspiration the smugglers storehouse he had gone down to count his gold and the stone had rolled backthe mistletoe bough in another version tearing downstairs she managed after much fumbling with the poker to make it revolve and peered down into the dark clammy depths granfer granfer she cried but only the dank silence welled up he was undoubtedly dead lying there stark among his guineas she was scrambling down into the vault but no what nonsense he must be pottering about with a spud currycombing methusalem or doing some other odd job his renewed strength permitted she hauled herself upat any rate that would postpone the dread visionand rushed round to the stable that door too was openmethusalem was gone so was the cart nor was there any sign of nip in her relief it was almost a pleasure to trace the wheels on the road but soon she saw black again it was his last drivethe last drive of daniel quarles carrier that was the meaning of his excitement of the morning he had gone out for the last time on his old rounds and would meet death on his drivingboard face to face as he had met so many wintry storms and buffets staying only to roll back the stone she raced out in his tracks but his course led unluckily to the four wantz way and there she could no longer disentangle his cartruts however mrs pennymole reinstated in her scoured ground floor had reassuring news enough though it carried a new apprehension i couldnt believe my eyes when i catched sight of him with the may day favours all aflyin and aflutterin on whip and harness and lookin that strong with a great old smile over his dear old phiz and nip barkin fit to bust where be you off to i cries as he dashes by whippin past like flecki never seen methusalem go that pace seemin amost as if he was glad to have his old master back agen meanin no disrespect to you jinny no of course not said jinny impatiently but what did he say i didnt rightly hear im tellin you seein how he tore towards the bridge but twas summat about lijah i yeard that good heavens cried jinny and thanking mrs pennymole she tore equally towards the bridge wondering if she could get a vehicle at the king of prussia it was clear the old wretchthere was really no other name for himhad gone to sell methusalem again set up with all that gold he meant to retire and inflamed by it he could not resist the extra five pounds offered by the vet and this time mr skindle would not risk impounding her horse he would slaughter instanter yes her eerie premonitions had been justified but they were warnings about methusalem not about her grandfather at the repaired bridge farmer gales dogcart came along with himself and his wife but she was too shy to ask for a lift nor was there anything to be got immediately at the king of prussia she toiled on through footpaths greysilted from the flood till she reached the byway that branched off to foxearth farm here she paused wondering if it was worth while to go down it on the chance of finding barnabys trap available and while she hesitated there came bowling by from church the skindle weddingparty in grand carriages but though she cowered into the hedge their insolent prosperity only soothed her somewhat by reminding her that elijah had other work today than killing and that in any case there was now no motive for it unless perhaps revenge to her surprise in the rear of the procession sharing barnabys bepranked trap rode will his face beside barnabys seemed one large smile even the unexpected sight of herself would hardly explain such broad cheerfulness in a man who though profiting by a wedding had come from arranging a pauper funeral not to mention an inquest but perhaps he was rejoicing at his escape from that overblown blanche as if to corroborate this interpretation he jumped down and caught her to him in the open daylight while barnabys vehicle sympathetically disappeared after the others round the byway oh jinny jinny he cried such a lark but granfer she gasped extricating herself he burst into a roar of laughter have you heard it already heard what im looking for granfer havent you met him on the road he started back ahead of me she drew a breath of relief with methusalem and a fare he grinned i had to go on to the coroner or else i too but she no longer heard i must have missed him on the footpaths she said happily youll find him at mr fallows he said and then laughter caught him again and rapt his breath but do speak do speak whats this mystery your granfers eloped what he wiped the tears from his eyes do speak she almost shook him eloped with who lijah skindles mother annie she murmured involuntarily carried her off from the poorhouse i was only in time for the tailend of the fun but how could he get at her well i tell you i only saw it at the point the master came into it but others saw more and ive picked up spicy details from the paupers and the wretched porterjims you know yes i know mr jims a vision of the fat little man in his peaked cap and blue uniform rose before her the dismal brick building in its iron enclosure was half a mile before you got to chipstoneadministered under the gilbert act by half a dozen parishes clubbed together well your granfer rigged up to the nines with his best smock and beaver and ribbons on his whip and a bunch of wallflowers and primroses sticking out of the spout of the teapot he carried rings at the gate and when jims came to take in the parcel as he thought the old man pushes through and makes for the wards jims runs after him and when he asks him what he wants he answers annie ive come for annie whos annie asks jims we dont keep anniestheres only old women and it aint visiting day do ye dont tell me no fibs says your granfer and when jims tries to stop him he catches him in the stomach with his teapot and leaves him winded then off he scuttles to the stairs and wheres annie he cries to an old pauper woman sweeping them this creature happened to know mrs skindle was annie so she says shes washing mr robinson in his bedroom what shrieks your granfer swelling like a turkeycock with jealousy you just show me where that bedroom is the frightened old woman takes him up the stone stairs to the little yellowochred room where they had stowed the old dotard all by himselfi dont think hes as old as your granfer but hes quite a helpless drivellerand there the old woman told me your granfer gives a great cry annie and mrs skindle drops the flannel and there they were crying and laughing and kissing like two children and he calling her my darling my beautiful annie more than youve ever called me said jinny herself inclined to laugh and cry and even to kiss the story was interrupted by an idyllic interlude but i expect granfers rather shortsighted without a telescope she commented disentangling herself blushingly i was in the masters room resumed will speaking to him about the funeral and hearing a lot about the guardians and the parish authorities and suchlike grand folk when in rushes jims and pants out his tale and we all race around till we find the old couple coming down the staircase with arms round each others waists and your granfer tells us fiercely hes taking her away and opens the teapot to show he can support two wives if he wants to hold hard says the master i wont stop you though i ought to have twentyfour hours notice because i know the guardians havent made such a good bargain with mr skindle that theyll try to keep her but you cant take away the parish clothes for of course the old woman was wearing that blue cotton dress its got white stripes if you look close put in jinny well oi cant take her away without clothes roared your granfer he said he counted it unrespectable enough that they should allow her to wash a strange old man alone in a room and that if they didnt mend their ways hed have a piece put in the paper about it all well let em give me back my own clothes says mrs skindle ive got to have twentyfour hours notice about that says the master ha youve stole em says your granfer you be careful what youre sayin says the master bridling up who wants her rags and jags but in the end it was all settled friendlywiseyour granfer buying up some of the castoff grandeur of the matrons they drove a good bargain with your granfer the pair of screws but he was free and flush with his teapot and off the happy pair went at last the bride as spruced up as the bridegroom and i saw him hand her into the weddingcart with her bouquet while the old gentlemen in the corduroys and the old ladies in blue and especially the little orphans raised a cheer even jims waved i expect hed had a drop out of the teapot daniel quarles carrieroff laughed jinny half hysterically for scandalized and startled though she was a rosy light whose source was yet unclear to her seemed rising on her horizon i went up to the cart under pretence of patting nip will went on and asked the old boy where he was off to home of course he answers friendly you should be going to chapel first you old rip i told him were going to be married in church answers mrs skindle stiffly im church of england thats all right annie he says patting her hand well look in on mr fallow about they banns and singing oim seventeen come sunday drives off with her but jinny refused to sympathize with the course of true love hes not really going to marry her she now cried but thats dreadful you scandalous creature it would be more dreadful if he didnt but at his age why hes quite young yet laughed will one hundred and fiftytwo is his little span remember she let herself relax under his laughter will they ring a peal of grandsire triples at his wedding she asked whimsically then with renewed anxiety oh but i do hope it hasnt all excited him too much she cried id best get home as quick as possible home you dont mean blackwater hall where else you cant go there as your granfer remarked to the master thats no place for a respectable female she stared at him besides he said you dont want to interfere with the young couple but ive not cooked the dinner let the bride do that shes as strong as a horse its the best thing that could have happened for both of em after fending for all of us at rosemary villa blackwater hall will be a holiday to her but i must go and see about things she wont know where anything is and even if she cooks the dinner shell want my apron she cant spoil her fineries thats enough he said sternly i dont often quote my father but im bound to say some people are nearsighted and cant see god their friend youve done with blackwater hall but where am i to go then he laughed and what about frog farm he took her arm and we too must get tied up as soon as possible no jinny we cant do better than follow in your granfers footsteps the way he held that greyheaded old womans hand in the weddingcart while iyoure right i havent called you beautiful enough he paused to do so without words the old boys taught me a lesson dashing in like that while ive been sitting growling and grizzling and wasting our best years but you see will it couldnt be before and he was sacrificing himself to me poor granfer if he wanted her so badly all the time just see how he waited till he could support her on your money under the roof you rethatched for him it wasnt my money and it was ravens who did the roof you paid for it no i didnt she protested why not he wont send me in the bill oh wont he will clenched his fist ill jolly soon stop his singing if he dont hurry up with it and why didnt you ask me to mend your thatch you couldnt come in you dont come in to the roof that might have been a way of coming in she laughed it was so leaky anyhow you might have done uncle lilliwhytesit is his money that has saved us all in a roundabout way he admitted she snuggled to him happiness which had hitherto seemed like the soaped pig at village sports was seizable at last wont it be wonderful when were in the hut she said he opened his eyes you dont propose to live in uncle lilliwhytes hut with the three tophats of course not she said blushing its in australia theres just poles stuck in the ground why when have you been in australia never you mind you see ive already saved up a little towards my passage and but her words died on his lips i dont know that we need pull up our stakes he said when he released her farmer gales looking for a looker you dont really mean that she said he does anyhow i just met him in his dogcart and hes mad about his floodlosses you should have paid a good man i told the hunks to his head oh but will she said shrinking you dont like farmer gale well hes safely married now and after all my father had the place first it belongs to the family anyhow he broke off masterfully id pay my wifes passagemoney then ill be able to buy methusalem she said in cheerful submission hes only five poundsi suppose your father would take care of him rather it would be a refuge from the new jerusalem but well take nip with us sweetheartit wont be the goldfields you know just a farm and we can take over the bidlake girls too if you like lord what a crowd but i dont see nip on an emigrant ship havent i heard of dogwatches she smiled i guess youd smuggle him in somehow he laughed ive noticed you generally get your own way and captains are but men i thought they were seadogs she laughed you generally get the last word too he grumbled with adoring admiration but i tell you jinny though there may be more money all these new countries are terribly raw i knowno longer an egg not yet a bird only a smell she quoted with wistful humour and these words of his in the english wood last may evoked again for both of them all the magic of their love at its dawning they walked on in silence towards frog farm after all with their united treasure of youth energy and love their livelihood was no grave problem larks were carolling the little wrens piping and ringdoves calling calling for the spring was near after all and the daffodils had already come it seemed indeed a vain snapping of the heartstrings to leave such a homeland thatll be winter soon in australia mused will tenaciously not if we were together jinny whispered although the more she pondered during that wonderful walk the more the antipodes receded to their geographical distance the more shadowy grew the danger of falling off her planet but however they were to decide she could see no reasononce her grandfathers

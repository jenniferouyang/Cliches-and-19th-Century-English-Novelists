printers bread street hill clara vaughan book ii continued chapter xvii late in the evening of that same day i sat in my room by the firelight only for i could not work and tried to look into myself and find out the cause of my strange attraction or rather impulsion towards isola somehow or other i did not wonder so much that she should be drawn quite as strongly towards me although an impartial observer would perhaps have wondered far more alter puzzling myself in vain with this inquiry my thoughts began to move in their usual gloomy train eight years had now elapsed and what had i discovered nothing but at long dark intervals some impress of the deed itself more than of the doer had i halted in pursuit or had my vengeance cooled to the former question my conscience answered yes to the latter no gentle influences had been shed around me sorrow had bedewed the track of hate intercourse with happy harmless people and gratitude for unmerited kindness it was not in human nature however finely constitute for evil entirely to repulse these powers i could not deny that the religion of my heart during the last twelvemonth had been somewhat neglected for my devotion to dear mother no plea was required but the time since that what business had i with laughing children and snug firesides with dickybirds and sandy the squirrel even sweet isola caused me a pang of remorse but no i could not quite abandon her but now thank god i was in the right road again and plodding resolutely as my father could expect to his spirit ever present with me i knelt down and poured out my remorse and swore to make amends whatever it might cost me yet even then a gentle shadow seemed to come as well and whisper the words that calmed the face of death my musings if so mild a word may suit them were roughly interrupted by a loud step on the stairs inspector cutting who could walk when needful like a cat loved to redress this injury to the goddess echo by making double noise when not on business farmer huxtable a man of twice the weight would have come up those stairs at half the expense in sound when he entered the room he found himself in a semi official state again and i saw that he was not come for nothing in a few brief words he told me what he had done which was not very much or perhaps my suspicion was right that he only told me a part of it then he said abruptly miss valence i know pluck when i see it what do you mean mr cutting excuse me i forgot that you have been reared in the country what i mean is that i believe you possess an unusual share of courage as to that i cannot say having never been severely tried but in such a cause as mine i could go through a good deal and not lose your presence of mind even in real danger that again i cannot say and for the same reason but i am quite ready to make the trial i felt the colour mounting in my cheeks how glad i should be to prove to myself that i was not ignoble he observed me closely and appeared quite satisfied what i have to propose to you is attended with no little danger i will do my utmost not to be afraid i am more impulsive perhaps than brave but what is life worth to me i will try to think of that all the time no doubt you have a good reason for exposing me to danger certainly i have miss valence for your own purpose it is most important that you should be able to identify certain persons whom i shall show you to night that is unless i am misinformed to night so late as this and i began to tremble already yes we must go to night or wait for another fortnight and then it would be no earlier even if we got such a chance again and for your sake it is better than to be in a fright for a fortnight inspector cutting i am in no fright whatever at least i mean no more so than any other girl would be who felt a vague danger impending i hope and trust that my father's memory and the justice of god will be with me young lady i see that i may safely venture it if you had boasted i should have hesitated though i have had some proof already of your determination the chief and indeed the only danger is lest you lose your presence of mind and that most females would do if placed as you will be now i wish you to make deliberate choice and not to be carried away by impulse vindictiveness or the love of adventure which when the spirit is high like yours too often leads young females into trouble from which it is not always possible even for the most capable members of the force to extricate them of course i know all that how much longer are we to talk must i disguise myself when am i to be ready and where are we going now you are growing impatient that is not a good sign remember i can easily procure another witness but for your own sake i wish to give you the chance probably you will see to night the man who killed your father as he spoke my flesh was creeping and my blood ran cold then suddenly flushed through my system like electric fluid he began again as coolly as if he were reporting a case of some one discovered drunk and incapable from force of habit he touched his forehead and stood at attention as he spoke in consequence of information which i have received i have been induced to make certain inquiries which have resulted in the conviction that the criminal i am in search of will be present at a certain place this night at a certain hour it is therefore my intention to embrace the opportunity of catching him cried i in a breathless hurry to embrace the opportunity continued the inspector like a talking oak of conducting my investigations personally and in the presence of a witness the effect thereby produced upon my mind shall be entered duly the moral effect i should have said and the cause of justice will be promoted as rapidly as is consistent with the principles of our glorious constitution do you mean to say that you will let him go no i shall not let him go miss valence for the simple reason that i shall not apprehend him i see that you are inclined to take the law into your own hands that will never do for me oh no i am not a year ago i would have done so but i am older and wiser now i was thinking of dear mother and began to feel already that my character was changing chapter xviii inspector cutting gave me some minute instructions and in less than half an hour we set forth upon our enterprise i was wrapped in a loose grey cloak having a hooded cape and carefully hidden i carried for self defence a very keen stiletto i had procured it indirectly from the best cutler in london but neither workmanship nor material could be compared to that of italy the night was dark and cold the streets were almost deserted and all the shops except the chemists' and the public houses closed we walked straightway to the nearest cabstand where mr cutting ordered a vehicle and put me inside himself riding with the driver so little did i know as yet of london that after the first turn or two i could not even guess what direction we were taking i had such confidence in my guide a staid respectable man with a grown up family that i never thought there could be harm in my journeying with him at night and even had i thought so most likely i should have done it all the same ever since the time he wounded me or allowed me to wound myself his manner towards me had been most kind considerate and respectful though he found it his duty now and then to repress my impetuosity with all my perception alert i kept a sharp look out from the window but vainly strove to find anything that might serve for a landmark once we stopped for about five minutes at a police station somewhere in clerkenwell where by the light of a lamp i read without leaving the cab the ghastly descriptions of all the dead bodies recently found in london and waiting identification hereupon my courage began to ooze and the weather seemed much colder the type was hard to read at that distance and the imagination had fair play as it does when words come slowly anon the inspector reappeared so altered in dress and countenance that i did not know him until he made me a bow with a glance of encouragement and a little grin of dry humour he mounted the box again after another long drive in the course of which we ran silently over a wooden road probably high holborn we stopped in a broad but deserted thoroughfare very badly lighted here mr cutting opened the door helped me out and discharged the cab but whispered something to the driver before he let him go now take my arm miss valence if you please i have escorted many a lady of higher birth than yours of higher title perhaps mr cutting and their grandfathers money lenders or perhaps far worse i am sure i don't know we must take things as we find them i thought you despised such nonsense but the cabbage that runs to seed is the tallest in the field no englishman sees the nonsense of it unless he happens to be a detective or a grave digger do you mean to say that those of lofty birth are worse than those of low birth no i mean nothing of the sort but i do mean that they ought to be better and on the whole are not so nature holds the balance and temptation and education chuck into the opposite scales and i think the first chucks fastest at any rate i would rather have a good drunken navvy than a lord to take to the station i mean of course when my own rank was not what it is this little dissertation was meant to divert my thoughts i made no reply being ignorant of such matters neither did i care to talk about them then nevertheless i believe inspector cutting was wrong as we entered a narrow street he suddenly turned and looked at me poor child how you tremble draw your cape more forward the bitter cold requires it are you trembling from fear no only from cold but i tried in vain to think so a steady hand and steadfast nerve are wanted for your task if you cannot rely on them say so at once in five minutes you will have no retreat i shall be better directly but i am so cold inspector cutting it must be freezing hard ten degrees i should think it does not freeze at all i see we must warm you a little but no more 'inspector cutting' if you please until to morrow hereupon he led me into a little room fenced off from the bar of some refreshment house a glorious fire was burning by which he set and left me presently he returned with a small glass in his hand drink this young lady it will warm you and brace your nerves i saw by the firelight that it was brandy or some dark coloured spirit no i thank you do you suppose that i require dutch courage i threw such emphasis on the personal pronoun and looked at him so indignantly that he laughed outright i thank you in turn you suppose that i do i will justify your discernment and with that he tipped it off and then returned to business all the graver for the interlude now if you are really warm we will start again stop one moment i have heard you cough two or three times can you keep it under i assured him that i could very easily do so and that it was nothing but the sudden effect of the cold forth we went again into the winter night after i had learned from him that we were now in whitechapel not far from goodman's fields after another short walk we came to the end of a narrow by street where there was an archway passing through this archway we descended some steep and broken steps then the inspector produced a small lamp brightly burning which he must have lit at the public house it was not what is called a bull's eye but a reflector lamp by its light i saw that the chief entrance to the house must be round the corner and perhaps in another street with a small key which he took from his pocket mr cutting unlocked a little iron gate and we entered a narrow passage at the end of it was a massive door studded with great nails here my guide gave a gentle knock and hid the lamp as before presently we heard a shrill sound from the keyhole like a dryad's voice the inspector stooped thereto and pronounced the password not without some difficulty the lock was turned and the bolts withdrawn and we stood inside a child under sized and unnaturally sharp stared at us for a moment then dodged away from the lamp as if more accustomed to darkness mr cutting closed the door and refastened it then led me through some basement rooms unpaved and unfurnished until we came to an iron step ladder this he ascended and helped me up and we found ourselves in a small dark lobby containing no furniture except a high three legged stool when he closed his lamp all around was dark but on the rafters overhead a faint patch of light appeared ceiling there was none do you see that light he whispered to me pointing as i could just perceive to a narrow glazed opening high in the wall whence the faint gleam proceeded then jump upon this stool and do your best to see through he cast the light of his lamp upon the stool for a moment while i did as he bade me standing there i found that i was tall enough to look through but the narrow pane which formed the window was thickly covered with size or some opaque integument all i could tell was that the space beyond was lighted i know you can't see now he said as i came down despairing but you shall see by and by the fools who were here before sized the glass on the wrong side and this lot though much sharper have not corrected the error they keep that window for escape in the last resort now take this bottle and this camel's hair brush it will make the glass transparent without the smallest noise the men are not there yet we could easily rub it clear now but they will examine it when the time comes use the liquid most carefully and lightly and don't spread it higher than an inch from the bottom of the frame the lights are at this end the shadow of the sill will allow you just an inch and how far may i go horizontally the whole length of the glass to command as much view as possible the effect will pass in three or four minutes but you must not do it again if you do the glass will fly and you will be in their hands desperate men they are and though i shall be near i might be too late to save you see all you can to be able to swear to them all how shall i know the one i cannot tell you i must leave it to your instinct or your intuition i only know myself that he is one of the four my information such as it is was obtained very oddly and i trust to this night's work to make it more precise one thing more no noise if you value your life keep the bottle stopped don't let the stuff drop on you don't put your eyes to it or it will blind you for ever there is very little of it because it is so deadly when shall i do it in one hour from this time take this repeater i have shown you how to use it look well at it now while you have the light i looked at the watch it was nearly midnight am i to be left in the dark all in the dark here by myself yes i must be seen elsewhere or the whole thing fails they know me even in this dress and they watch me as i do them but for to night i believe i have misled them when it is over wait here till i come for you or the little girl you saw oh i wish i had never come and all so vague and indecisive you can go back now if you please though ever that would be dangerous i will not go back no doubt i shall know him when will you secure him when my evidence is completed now remember you have to deal with men keen as hawks and stealthy as tigers but there is no real danger if you keep your self command observe all four as narrowly as you can both for your own sake and for mine be careful to stand on the centre of the stool but you had better not get upon it until they have searched the room now good bye i trust to your courage if any harm comes i will avenge you a comfort that what good will it be to me if vengeance is no good what are you doing here thank you that is no business of yours don't let me detain you he told me afterwards that he had vexed me on purpose to arouse my mettle and i am sure i needed it ah now you are all right if your caution fails you the man who slew your father will be sure to escape us if it fails me 'twill be from anger not from terror i know it let me look at you he threw the full light on my face the burnished concave was not brighter or firmer than my eyes pale as death and quite as resolute rely only upon yourself god and myself i whispered as he glided out of sight along the vaults below i could see no other entrance to the place in which i sat but how could i tell for a minute excitement kept me hot but as the last gleam of the light died upon the wall below my heart began to throb heavily and a chill came over me the pulse thumped in my ears like a knocking in the cellar was it fear i asked myself in scorn that i should ask no it was not fear but horrible suspense the balance of life and death of triumph and disgrace swung there before me in the dark as if my breath would turn it no dream of a child no vagary of the brain the clear perception of strong will and soul poised upon this moment the moment was too long the powers began to fail the senses grew more faint and confused at every heavy throb little images and little questions took the place of large ones in vain i looked for even a cobweb or the skeleton of a fly where the dull light flickered through the pane of glass in vain i listened for a mouse even a rat much as i hate him would have been welcome then the repeater was purposely made so low of tick that i got no comfort thence all was deep unfathomable silence except the sound of my rebel heart as a forlorn hope i began to reckon sixty slowly as a child keeps with a ticking clock it would not do my heart was beating louder than ever and my hands were trembling even my teeth rattled like dice in a box as the time approached the nerves will not be hoodwinked the mind cannot swindle the body i once slapped the cheeks of my governess i cannot treat nature so try the sweet influence and the honest coin of reason it will not do all trembling i strike the repeater five minutes more and the trial must come my heart is fluttering like a pigeon's throat the long suspense has been too much oh why was i submitted to this cruel ordeal the walls are thick i can hear no movement in the secret room there comes a creeping fingering sound as of one whose candle is out groping for the door it passes along the pane of glass and a shadow is thrown on the rafter who can it be what stealthy hand but that of my father's murderer the word the thought is enough what resolution reason justice all in turn have failed to do passion has done at once passion at myself as well as at my enemy is it clara vaughan who for eight long years of demon's reign has breathed but for this moment is clara vaughan to shake like the wooden legged blackbird now her chance is come a rush of triumph burned like vitriol through my veins every nerve was braced every sense alert and eager against the light of that window dull as it was i could have threaded the finest needle that ever was made i struck my repeater again it was the hour the minute when my father died with the mere spring of my instep i leaped upon the stool i could see it clearly now i dipped the broad camel's hair brush in the flat phial holding it carefully at arm's length and then drew it lightly along the pane quite at the bottom from corner to corner one more dip one more stripe above a steam hovered on the glass and there was a gazing place clear as crystal and wide enough to show most of the narrow room of the room itself i took no heed the occupants were my study only four in all one man at a high desk writing rapidly three men sitting round a small table talking earnestly and with much gesticulation but the tone too low for me even to guess their language from the appearance manner and action of the speakers i felt sure that it was not english and i thought that it was not french why i cannot say but my attention fixed itself upon the man who was writing at the top of the room perhaps it was because i could see him best for he stood with his face full towards me he was a man of middle age and stature strongly framed closely knit and light of limb with a handsome keenly oval face broad forehead black eyes glancing quickly and scornfully at his three comrades long hair of an iron grey falling on his shoulders and tossed back often with a jerk of the head his hands were white and restless quick as light in their motion on the left thumb flashed a large red jewel though i could not see the paper i knew by the course of the quill that the writing was very small but one minute i watched him for the film was returning upon the glass and i must scan the others yet in that time he had written several lines half of them without looking at the paper but with his eyes upon the other three i knew him now he was in clear light i could swear to him anywhere again the last glance i could spare him sent a shudder through me for in his impatience he shifted one foot from the shade of the desk it was small pointed and elegant the film was thickening like frost upon the pane when i began to observe the others but i saw enough to print their faces on my memory or those at least of two the third i could not see so well he seemed older than the rest all the men wore loose grey tunics with a red sash over the left shoulder i judged that the three were debating hotly as to some measure upon which the fourth had resolved every now and then they glanced at him uneasily at him i gazed again with deadly hatred cold as ice upon my heart i felt my dagger handle oh for one moment with him in my fury i forgot the inspector's warning the film was closing over i touched the glass with my lashes a flash of agony shot through my eyes with a jerk i drew back the stool rocked under me one foot of it struck the wall i clutched the window sill and threw my weight inwards down came the foot of the stool loud as the bang of a door i thought it was all over how i stifled a scream i know not had it escaped me i should never have told this story i had the presence of mind to stand still and watch though my eyes were maddening me what the cut throats would do through the agony and the dimness i could just see them all start and rush to the door at the side of the room the writer stood first with his papers thrust anyhow into his bosom a pistol in one hand a poniard in the other did i know the shape of it the other three were armed but i could not see with what they crouched behind a heavy screen presenting i supposed their pistol muzzles at the door finding no attack ensue they began to search now was the real danger to me if they searched that window before the size returned my life ended there fear was past desperation seized me if i was doomed to blindness just as well to death but i clutched my dagger my left ear was against the wall i heard a hand graze the partition inside then a chair placed under the embrasure and a step upon it i was still upon the stool stooping close beneath the window frame suddenly the light streak vanished the size flew over it as the breath flies over glass in the hardest frost the hand felt along the window frame the dull shadow of a head flitted upon the beam it was within a foot of mine the searcher passed on without suspicion strange it was but now the deadliest peril was over triple fear fell upon me the heat flew back to my heart just now so stanch and rigid my hair seemed to creep with terror dear life like true love scorned would have its way within me quietly i slid down from the stool and cowered upon it in a storm of trembling my eyelids dropped in agony i could not lift them again but blue and red lights seemed to dance within them i had made up my mind to blindness but not oh not just yet to death how long i remained in this abject state scorning myself yet none the braver is more than i can tell or even cared to ask may it never be the lot of any not even the basest murderer worn out at last in a lull of pain and terror i fell into deep sleep from which i was awakened by a hand upon my shoulder i tried to look up but could not sight was fled and as i thought for ever but i felt that it was a friend ah i see how it is the voice was inspector cutting's my poor child there is now no danger give me your hand he tried to lift me but i fell against the wall take a sip of this we must restore circulation it is the cold as much as anything another sip miss vaughan he used my true name on purpose it helped to restore me he was most humane and kind he did not even remind me of dutch courage clara vaughan book iii chapter i in the morning i dreamed of isola across a broad black river i saw her lovely smile thick fog rose from the water in which two swans were beating a dog and by snatches only could i see my darling she waved her little hand to me and begged me with that coaxing smile which bent cast iron and even gold to come across to isola in vain i looked for a boat even in my dream i knew that i could not swim and if i could the lead upon my eyelids would have sunk me so i called to her to come to me and with that cry awoke it was striking ten my own little clock which my father gave me i counted every stroke what was mrs shelfer doing that she had not called me yet what was i doing that i lay there so late for i always get up early and what was the sun about that no light came into the room i knew it was ten in the morning i felt all round i was in my little bed the splinter at the side of the head board ran into my finger as usual there i was and nowhere else was it a tremendous fog if it was they should have told me for they knew that i liked fogs at least they thought so from the interest i felt i groped for the little bell pull a sleezy worsted cord which meant to break every time but was not strong enough to do it i jerked with all my strength which seemed very little somehow what a pleasure the bell rang like a fire peal i fell back on the pillow exhausted but determined to have it out with mrs shelfer i put my hands up to arrange my hair to look a little more like clara vaughan when the light should enter and to frighten mrs shelfer there was something on my head i never wear a night cap my long black hair would scorn it am i in a madhouse is this put to keep me cool cold it is and my brain so hot all wenham lake on dives and he will only hiss while i am pulling at it and find it streaming wet in comes i know her step mrs shelfer but there is no light from the passage mrs shelfer what do you mean by this by what my dear good soul i have done all the blessed things i was told to do for you you might have put a ostrich feather or a marabout to my mouth miss valence and tucked me up and a headstone and none the wiser when uncle john brought you home last night i suppose i am dreaming but i am sure i rang the bell miss valence you did so and no mistake bless me i started in my shoes a good job shelfer wasn't home he's so nervous he'd have gone for gin straightways now get up that's a dear good soul and when you have had some breakfast we'll talk over it miss valence let me see how your eyes are uncle john said they was bad and i was to keep them covered i expects him here every minute now turn them up to the light what large eyes you have to be sure bless me where are your long black lashes mrs shelfer there is some strange mistake let the light into the room i had risen in the bed and her breath was on my forehead light dear child i can't let more the sun is on your face i fell back upon my pillow and could rise no more the truth had been tingling through me all the time she talked i was stone blind i flung the bandage from me and wished my heart would break mrs shelfer tried some comfort she seemed to grieve for my eyelashes more than for my eyes and addressed her comfort more to my looks than sight of course i did not listen when would the creature be gone and let me try to think poor little thing i was very sorry what fault was it of hers who and what am i blind i to find fault with any one who means me well i drop my eyelids i can feel them fall i lift them i can feel them rise a full gaze a side gaze a half gaze with both eyes with one it is all the same gaze there may be but no sight henceforth i want no eyelids the sun is on my face i can feel his winter rays though my cheeks are wet what use is he to me i have the dagger somewhere by which my father died let me find it if i can i could have sworn that the box was in that corner carefully concealed i strike against a washing stand ah now i have it the box is locked my keys are in the top drawer i bear the box to the bed and go groping for the chest of drawers already i can tell by the sun warmth on my face which way i am going surely if i wait i shall have the instinct of the blind what care i for that the coward love of life suggested that poor solace now i have the keys quick unlock the box at length i throw the cover back the weapon handle is to the right i stoop to seize it i grasp a square of colour pretty instinct this i have got my largest drawing box oh paints my paints so loved but yesterday that ape the colours i shall never see my hot tears make you water colours indeed if god has robbed my eyes of sight he has not dried my tears the gushing flood relieves me what right have i to die even without asking if my case be hopeless who knows but what these lovely tints may glow for me again may i not once more intone the carmine damask of the rose the gauzy green of april's scarf softening scenes before me rise i lay my box of colours by and creep into my bed for warmth presently the doctor comes inspector cutting has chosen him and chosen well from his voice i know that he is a gentleman from his words and touch instinctively i feel that he understands the case when he has finished the examination he sees me trembling for the answer which i dare not seek young lady i have hopes strong hopes it is quite impossible to say what course the inflammation may pursue all depends on that at present there is a film over the membrane but the cornea is uninjured perfect quiet composure so far as in such a case is possible cold applications and the exclusion of light are the simple remedies all the rest must be left to nature avoid excitement of any kind diet as low as possible do not admit your dearest friends unless they will keep perfect silence even so they are better away unless you pine at loneliness oh no i am quite accustomed to that that is well i shall make a point of calling daily but shall not examine your eyes every time the excitement and the effort would strain the optic nerve our object is to keep the inflammation from striking inwards i should not tell you all this but i see that you have much self command on that and your constitution under providence the cure depends one question i am not a professed ophthalmist would you prefer to have one oblige me with your opinion it is a delicate point for me there is no operation to perform it is a medical not a surgical case i have dealt with such before were you my own child i would call in no ophthalmist but as you are a stranger to me i wish you to decide for yourself then i will have none i have perfect confidence in you he seemed gratified and took his leave please god miss valence you shall look me in the face ere long chapter ii composure is my only chance what chance have i of composure until i know the meaning of what i saw last night blind though i am one face is ever before me no thickening of the membrane can exclude that face inspector cutting is still below i will send for him at once mrs shelfer remonstrates it will excite you so my good friend the doctor said perfect quiet just so i can have none until i have spoken to your uncle john let him stay in my sitting room open the folding door a little and then mrs shelfer please to go down stairs i hear the inspector's step not so heavy this time he asks how i am and expresses his sorrow i feel obliged to him for not reminding me that the fault was all my own then i implore him if he wishes me ever to see again to tell me all he knows about the men i saw last night thus entreated he cannot refuse me but first looks up and down the stairs as i know by the sound of his steps then he shuts the door of the sitting room all he knows is not very much they are refugees italian refugees two political and two criminal exiles leaders now of a conspiracy to revolutionize their country but why does he not arrest them' simply because he has no right as for the political refugees of course we never meddle with them as for the two criminals they have not been demanded by their government wonderful now isn't it the two fellows who have committed murder their government would not give sixpence for them but the two men who have only spouted a little it would give a thousand pounds for either of them he can't understand such a system and inspector cutting sucks his lips i know it by the sound he always does it when he is in a puzzle being a true englishman he knows no more of serfdom than of the dark half of the moon i mean of course political serfdom of social slavery we have enough to last ten generations more would he be afraid to arrest them he said they were desperate men he should rather hope he wouldn't they had got their knives and pistols and all that humbug but it was more show than fight they were desperate men in a private quarrel particular when they could come round a corner and when women were concerned but as for showing honest fight he would sooner come across three of them than one good irish murderer what was his proof against my enemy i need not ask him which it was the excitement of this question sent needles through my eyes and i could not see him to probe his pupils well his proof was very little in fact it was no proof at all as yet but he was not like a juryman he was quite convinced and his eyes should never be off that man until he had him under warrant and the whole case clear would that satisfy me he spoke with such hearty professional pride that i could not help believing him but as for being satisfied why should his evidence be a mystery to me catch him at once was my idea but a hot and foolish one get up the evidence first was inspector cutting's i can catch him at any time that was the whole gist of it could he always catch him he scorned the idea of there being any difficulty about it the man could leave for no part of the continent he was a political refugee america was his only bourne beyond the inspector's jurisdiction and thither he could not try to go without the police being down upon him at once by this time i was worn out though my reasons were not exhausted in a word i was only half satisfied but i could not help myself if in my helpless blindness i offended inspector cutting the whole chance disappeared only one question remained why did he take me thither for excellent reasons as to the one it was most important that i should always know him again moreover it saved my energies from waste as to the other three he had his own reasons for requiring an intelligent witness about their proceedings i thought of the thousand pounds and said no more inspector cutting was an englishman and proud in his way of english freedom but like nine tenths of us he thought that we alone understand what freedom is what good was it to such fellows as those they would only be free of one another's throats and like all of us with most rare exception next to freedom he valued money for our love of this many foreigners jeer us all we can say is that with us it is second with them it is first but we are of such staple our second is stronger than their first when the inspector was gone i formed a very sensible resolve since there was nothing more to be done or learned at present my only care should be the recovery of my sight if i were to be blind till death the purpose of my life was lost and i might as well die at once but now the first blind agony the sudden shock was over and i had too much of what the inspector denominated pluck to knock under so in the afternoon when all was quiet lovely isola came strict orders had been given that no one should be admitted but mrs shelfer was not proof against the wiles of isola she smiled so bootiful when i opened the door miss it fetched out all my hair pins and when i told her you was ill in bed and struck stone blind along of some chemical stuff two big tears came out of her long blue eyes same as the wet out of a pennorth of violets miss and as for stopping her she threw her muff at me and told me to stop that if i liked and to run and tell you that she was coming quick quick to be sure and here i am cried the cheery voice i loved so well oh clara dear dear clara the little darling flung her soft warm arms around me utterly forgetful of her dress forgetful of all the world but that little bit of it she held her delicious breath came over my fevered cheek her cool satin flesh was on my burning eyelids what lotion could be compared to this how long she stayed i cannot tell i only know that while i heard her voice and felt her touch blindness seemed no loss to me she pronounced herself head nurse and as for doctors what were they compared to her own father if she could coax him he should come next day and deliver his opinion and then the doctor might betake himself to things he understood if indeed he understood anything which she did not believe he did because he had said she was not to come my drawings too she admired much more than they deserved and her brother conrad must come and see them he was so fond of drawing and there was nothing he could not do she was so sorry she must go now but old cora must be tired of patroling and she herself had a lecture to attend upon the chemical affinity of bodies what it meant she had no idea but that would not matter the least some of the clever girls said they did but she would not believe them it took a man she was sure to understand such subjects she would bring her work the next day such as it was and the nicest bit of sponge that was ever seen it could not be bought in london and she would answer for it i should be able to paint her likeness in a week and she would not go till it was dark and then the professor should come for her when his lectures were over and examine me he knew all about optics and retinas and pencils of light and refraction and aberration and she could not remember any more names but she felt quite certain this was a case of optical delusion and nothing else how i wished i could have seen her when she pronounced this opinion with no little solemnity she must have looked such a sage the thought of that made me laugh as well as the absurdity of the idea but i only asked how the professor was to examine my eyes if he did not come till dark to be sure she never thought of that what a little goose she was but she would make him come in the morning before his work began and then old cora would fetch her home to tea and she had very great hopes that if she could only persuade her papa to deliver a lecture in my room it would have such an effect on my optic nerves that they would come all right directly at any rate i should know how to treat them delighted with this idea she kissed me and hugged me and off she ran after telling me to be sure to keep my spirits up and the bandage not too tight the latter injunction was much easier to obey than the former she had enlivened me wonderfully as well as nursed me most delicately but now that she was gone the usual reaction commenced moreover although as the saying is the sight of her would have been good for sore eyes the effort at seeing her which i could not control when she was present was i already felt anything but good for them and the loss when she was gone was like a second loss of light light what million thoughts flash through me at that little word swiftest thing the mind has met too like itself to understand is it steed or wing of mind nay not swift enough for that is it then the food of life prepared betimes ere life appeared the food the blind receive but cannot taste if so far better to be blind from birth well i know the taste from memory shall i never taste it else has beauty lost its way to me the many golden folds of air the lustrous dance of sunny morn the soft reclining of the moon the grand perspective of the stars long avenue to god's own home are these all blank to me and night made one with day oh god whose first approach was light replenisher of sun and stars whence dart anew thy gushing floods solid or liquid we know not whose subtle volume has no bourne or track light the dayside half of life leaping flashing beaming glistening twinkling stealing light oh god if live i must grudge me not a ray chapter iii low fever followed the long prostration to which the fear of outer darkness had reduced my jaded nerves this fever probably redeemed my sight by generalizing the local inflammation to which object the doctor's efforts had been directed tossing on my weary bed without a glimpse of anything how i longed for the soft caresses and cool lips of isola but since that one visit she had been sternly excluded the professor had no chance of delivering his therapeutic lecture in fact he did not come once for all said dr franks when he heard of that proposal choose miss valence between my services and the maundering of some pansophist if you prefer the former i will do my utmost and can almost promise you success but i must and will be obeyed none shall enter your room except mrs shelfer and myself as to your lovely friend of whom mrs shelfer is so full if she truly loves you she will keep away she has done you already more harm than i can undo in a week i am deeply interested in this case and feel for you sincerely but unless you promise me to see i mean to receive no one without my permission i will come no more it sounded very hard but i felt that he was right no crying my dear child no crying dear me i have heard so much of your courage too much inflammation already whatever you do you must not cry that is one reason why i will not have your friend here when two young ladies get together in trouble i know by my own daughters what they do you may laugh as much as you like in a quiet way and i am sure mrs shelfer can make any one laugh under almost any circumstances can't you now to be sure my good friend i have seen such a many rogues that is when i know charley's a coming home now good bye miss valence but i would recommend you not to play with your paints so there is an effluvium from them oh what can i do what am i to do to pass the endless night i was only trying to build a house in the dark sleep as much as you can i am giving you gentle opiates when you can sleep no longer let mrs shelfer talk or read to you and have a little music i will lend you my musical box which plays twenty four tunes have it in the next room not to be too loud and then play on the musical glasses not too long at a time you will soon find out how to do that in the dark he most kindly sent us both the boxes that very day and many a weary hour they lightened of its load poor isola came every day to inquire and several times she had her brother with her she made an entire conquest of mrs shelfer who even gave her a choice canary bird i was never tired of hearing the little woman's description of her beauty and her visit to the kitchen formed the chief event of the day mrs shelfer who had irish blood in her veins used to declare that the ground was not good enough for them to walk on such a pair miss to see her so light and soft and loving tripping along and such eyes and such fur and him walking so straight and brave and noble i am sure you'd go a mile miss to see him walk you forget mrs shelfer i may never enjoy that pleasure no no quite true my good friend but then we may all the same exactly so there lay all the difference to me but none to any other this set me moralising in my shallow way a thing by no means natural to me who was so concentrated and subjective but loss of sight had done me good had turned the mind's eye inward into the darkness of myself i think the blind as a general rule are less narrow minded than those endowed with sight less inclined i mean to judge their neighbours harshly less arrogant in exacting that every pulse keep time with their own if eyes are but the chinks through which we focus on our brain censoriousness and bigotry if rays of light are shafts and lances of ill will then better is it to have no crystalline lens far better to be blind than print the world distorted puppets of myself i that smallest speck of dust blown upon the shore of time blown off when my puff shall come a speck ignored by moon and stars too small however my ambition leap for earth to itch whate'er i suck and yet a speck that is a mountain in the telescope of god shall i never learn that his is my only magnitude shall i wriggle to be all in all to my own corpuscle chapter iv is there any mocha stone fortification agate or scotch pebble with half the veins and mottlings angles flux and reflux that chequer one minute of the human mind was ever machine invented to throw so many shuttles at present i am gauged for little threads of thought two minutes since the smallest thing i could think of was myself now it is the largest must i grope from room to room shall i never be sure where the table is where my teacup stands never read or write or draw never tell when my hands are clean except by smelling soap never know though small the difference how my dress becomes me or when my hair is right never see my own sad face in which i have been fool enough to glory never and this is worst of all never catch another's smile here am i a full grown girl full of maiden's thoughts and wonderings knowing well that i am shaped so but to be a link in life must i never think of loving or of being loved except with love like isola's sweet affection very sweet but white sugar only when my work is over and my object gained when my father's spirit knows the wrong redeemed as a child i used to think i would lay me down and die but since i came to woman's fulness since i ceased to look at men and they began to look at me some soft change i know not what has come across my dream is my purpose altered is my tenor broken not a whit of either rather are they stronger set and better led as my heart and brain enlarge yet i see beyond it all a thing i never used to see a glow above the peaks of hate a possibility of home saw i should have said for now what have i to do with seeing on the fourteenth morning i had given up all hope they told me it was bright and sunny for i always asked about the weather and felt most cruelly depressed upon a sunny day by this time i had learned to dress without mrs shelfer's aid still from force of habit i went to the glass to do my hair and still drew back as far as was allowed the window curtain off with my wet bandage i am sick of it let me try no longer to delude myself suddenly a gleam of light i am sure of it faint indeed and like a will of the wisp but i am quite sure it was a gleam of light i go nearer the window and try again no there is no more for the present it was the sudden change produced it never mind i know what i have seen a thing that came and cheated me in dreams this time it has not cheated me it was a genuine twinkle of the sun i can do nothing more i cannot put another stitch upon me i am thrilling with the sun like memnon i fall upon my knees and thank the father of light when the doctor came that day and looked into my eyes he saw a decided change miss valence the crisis is over with all my heart i congratulate you another fortnight and you will see better than ever i laughed and wept and blind as i was could hardly keep from dancing then i wanted to kiss the doctor but hearing mrs shelfer's step made a reckless jump and had it out upon her bless me why bless me my good soul if i was a young gentleman now why miss valence i am perfectly astonished said doctor franks but i knew he was laughing if i had been requested only two minutes ago to pick out the most self possessed equable and courageous young lady in london i should have said 'i don't want any looking i know where to find her' but now upon my word if you are asked to point out the most delighted grateful and happy girl in london you know where to come for her let me kiss you dr franks only once i won't rob your daughters it is to you i owe it all no to providence and yourself and an uncommonly good conjunctiva now be prudent my dear child a little ecstasy must be forgiven but don't imperil your cure by over excitement it is as i hoped it would be a case of epiphytic sloughing i think that was what he said and it may become chronic if precipitated the longer and more thorough the process the less chance of recurrence oh i am satisfied with one eye or half an eye can you promise me that if you will only follow my directions i can promise you both eyes more brilliant than ever and mrs shelfer says they were wonderfully bright but what i order must be done slow and sure he gave me short directions all upon the same principle that of graduation and now miss valence good bye henceforth i visit you only as a friend in which i know you will indulge me from the interest i feel in the case and in yourself mrs shelfer's wonderful young lady may be admitted on thursday but don't let her look at your eyes girls are always inquisitive if there is any young gentleman lucky enough to explain your strange anxiety to see you will make short work of him when your sight returns your eyes will be the most brilliant in london which is saying a great deal but i fear he will hardly know you till your lashes grow and all your face and expression are altered for the time one thing will never alter though it can find no expression my gratitude to you that is very pretty of you my dear child you kissed me just now now let me kiss you he touched my forehead and was gone he was the first true gentleman i had met with since the loss of farmer huxtable chapter v when isola came on the thursday and i obtained some little glimpse of her she expressed her joy in a thousand natural ways well worth feeling and seeing not at all worth telling i loved her for them more and more i never met a girl so warm of heart many women can sulk for days most women can sulk for an hour i believe that no provocation could have made isola sulky for two minutes she tried sometimes at least she said so but it was no good and yet she felt as keenly as any of the very sulkiest women can do but she had too much warmth of heart and imagination to live in the folds of that cold blooded snake neither had she the strong selfishness on which that serpent feeds in the afternoon as we still sat together in rushed mrs shelfer with her bonnet on quite out of breath and without her usual ceremony of knocking at the door i could not think where she had been all the day and she had made the greatest mystery of it in the morning and wanted to have it noticed up she ran to me now and pushed isola out of the way got 'em at last miss got 'em at last and no mistake no more dr franks nor bandages nor curtains down nor nothing save a deal of trouble and do it in no time but what a job i had to get them to be sure if the cook's mate hadn't knowed charley they would not have let me had 'em after going all the way to wapping she holds up something in triumph what is it mrs shelfer i am sorry to say i cannot see and right down glad of it i am my good friend yes yes or i should have had all my journey for nothing but miss idols knows i'll be bound she does or it's no good going to college let me look at it first says isola we learn almost everything at college mrs shelfer but even we senior sophists don't know every thing without seeing it yet then put your pretty eyes on them miss idols i'll be bound it will make them caper i never see such fine ones nor the cook's mate either why they're as big as young whelks mollusca or crustacea or something exclaims isola with more pride than accuracy what queer little things i must take them to my papa now young ladies cried mrs shelfer in her grandest style i see i must explain them to you after all them's the blessed shells the poor sailors put in their eyes to scour them out and keep them bright and make them see in the dark against the wind only see how they crawls there now miss valence i'll pick you out two big lively fellows and pop one for you in the corner of each eye the cook's mate showed me how to lift your eyelids how kind of him to be sure' and it will crawl about under the lid you must not mind its hurting a bit and it won't come out till to morrow when the clock strikes twelve and then it will have eaten up every bit and your eyes will be brighter than diamonds charley has seen them do it ever so many times and he says it's bootiful and they don't mind giving five shillings a piece for them when they are scarce did mr shelfer ever try them his eyes are so sharp perhaps that is the reason no i never heard that he did miss but bless you he never tells me half he does no nor a quarter of half at this recollection she fetches a little short sigh her nearest approach to melancholy for she is not sentimental care killed the cat is her favourite aphorism then when he comes home mrs shelfer pop one of these shells a good big one into each of his eyes and let us know the effect to morrow morning and i'll give you a kiss if you do it well this is the bribe isola finds most potent with everybody lor miss idols bless your innocent heart do you suppose he would let me why he thinks it a great thing to let me tie his shoe and he won't only when he has had a good dinner well cries isola i am astonished catch me tying my husband's shoes i shall expect him to tie mine i know and he shall only do that when he is very good with a regal air she puts out the prettiest foot ever seen mrs shelfer laughs lor miss it's all very well for girls to talk and they all does it till they knows better though for the likes of you any one would do anything a most pray miss idols if i may make so bold how many offers of marriage have you received let me think oh i know it's one more than i am years old eighteen altogether mrs shelfer if you count the apothecary's boy and the nephew of the library but then they were all of them boys papa's pupils and that a deal too young for me they were all going to die when i refused them but they are all alive so far at any rate isn't it too bad of them well miss idols if you get as good a husband as you deserve and that is saying a deal he'll tie your shoe may be for a month and then he'll look for you to tie his and long he may look even if he has shellfish in his eyes why look mrs shelfer they're all crawling about bootiful isn't it bootiful i wish miss valence could see them and look at the horns they goes routing about with how they must tickle your eyelids and what coorious eyes they has ah i often think miss idols i likes this sort of thing so much what a pity it is as i wasn't born in the country i should never be tired of watching the snails and the earywigs and the tadpoles why i likes nothing better than to see them stump legged things come to table in the cabbage i have not seen one now for ever so long oh that charley what dreadful lies he do tell what about mrs shelfer why my good friend he says them green things with stripes on and ever so many legs turns to live butterflies after they be dead but i was too many for him there yes yes the last one as i boiled i did not say a word about it to him but i put it by in a chiney teacup with the saucer over in case it should fly away bless your heart young ladies there it is now as quiet as anything and no signs of a butterfly and when he tells me any lies about where he was last night i just goes to the cupboard and shows him that and never another word can he say and so miss valence you won't try these little snails after my journey and all of course i won't mrs shelfer but i am sincerely obliged to you for your trouble as well as for all your kind nursing which i can never forget now let me buy those shellfish from you and miss isola will take them as a present to her papa no no unless he will put them in his eyes miss i won't have them wasted charley will sell them again in no time he knows lots of sailors most likely he'll get up a raffle for them and win them himself away she hurries to take off the bonnet she has been so proud of for the last two and twenty years though i declined the services of the ophthalmist snails my sight returned very rapidly how delicious it was to see more and more every day plenty of cold water was the present regimen vision is less a vision every time i use it in a week more i can see quite well though obliged to wear a shade one morning dear isola runs upstairs out of breath as usual but what is most unusual actually frowning has cora tyrannised or what through the very shade of her frown comes her sunny smile as she kisses me oh i am so vexed i have brought him to the door and now he won't come in who my darling why conny to be sure my brother conrad i had set my heart on showing him to you directly you could see why won't he come in because he thinks that you ought not to see strangers until you are quite well he has not got to the corner yet i can run like a deer send word by me that you are dying to see him not quite that but say how glad i shall be i'll say that you won't get well till you do say what you like he will know it's only your nonsense off she darts she is quick as light in her movements and soon returns with her brother i lift my weak eyes to his bright ones and recognise at once the preserver of my mother and myself but i see in a moment that he has not the faintest remembrance of me my whole face is altered by my accident and even my voice affected by the long confinement when he met me in the wood he seemed very anxious not to look at me when he saved my life from the rushing mountain he had little opportunity very likely he would not have known me under another name even without this illness so let it be i will not reveal myself i thanked him once and he repulsed me no doubt he had a reason for i see that he is a gentleman let that reason hold good i will not trespass on it he took my hand with a smile the counterpart of isola's he had heard of me so constantly that i must excuse the liberty a dear friend of his sister's could be no stranger to him a thrill shot through me at the touch of his hand and my eyes were weak he saw it and placed a chair for me further from the light on his own face not the sun for the drawing room windows look north but the strong reflection of the noon day light was falling how like he is to isola and yet how different so much stronger and bolder and more decided so tall and firm of step his countenance open as the noon incapable of concealment yet if he be the same and how can i doubt it then at least there seemed to be some mystery about him isola with the quickness of a girl saw how intently i observed him and could not hide her delight there now clara dear i knew you would like him but you must not look at him so much or your poor eyes will be sore little stupid as i felt my pale cheeks colouring i could almost have been angry even with my isola but she meant no harm in spite of lectures and college she was gentle nature personified and no professors could make anything else of her all these things run in the grain if there is anything i hate i am sure i hate affectation but there is a difference between us probably it is this i am of pure english blood and she is not that i know by instinct what blood she is of i am sure i cannot tell gentle blood at any rate or i could not have loved her so how horribly narrow minded after all my objectivity well what i mean is that i can like and love many people who are not of gentle but i suppose of ferocious blood still as a general rule culture and elegance are better matches for nature after some generations of training my father used to say so about his pointers and setters the marvel is that i who belong to this old streak seem to have got some twist in it my grandmother would have swooned at the names of some people i love more than i could have loved her my mother would not but then she was a christian probably that is the secret of my twist all this has passed through my mind before i can frown at isola and now i cannot frown at all dear little thing she is not eighteen and she knows no better i have attained that englishwoman's majority three weeks ago and i am sorry for isola to break the awkwardness her brother starts off into subjects of art he has heard of my drawings may he see them some day i ask him about the magnificent stag yes that is his and i have no idea how long it took him to do he speaks of it with no conceit whatever neither with any depreciation for the purpose of tempting praise as he speaks i observe some peculiarity in his accent isola's accent is as pure as mine or purer her brother speaks very good english and never hesitates for a word but the form of his sentences often is not english especially when he warms to his subject and what struck me first for i am no purist as to collocation of words his accent his emphasis is not native the difference is very slight and quite indescribable but a difference there is perhaps it is rather a difference of the order of thought than of language as regards the cast of the sentence but that will not account for the accent and if it would it still shows another nationality there is a loud knock at the door i am just preparing with isola's help my little hospitalities if london visits mean much talk and no food i hold by gloucestershire and devon i have a famous north devon ham and am proud of its fame surely no more visitors for me no but one for mrs shelfer the professor has heard of the eyeshells and what politeness humanity love of his daughter failed to do science has effected he is come to see and secure them his children hear his voice of course we must ask him to come up mr conrad rises isola runs to fetch her father isola loves everybody i do believe she loves old cora conrad is of sterner stuff but surely he loves his father as for me we were just getting on so well i wanted no professor isola's brother will not tell a lie he does not remember all at once any pressing engagement he holds out his hand saying simply miss valence i heartily beg your pardon for leaving so suddenly and just when we were giving you so much trouble it would be impertinence for me to tell you the reason it is a domestic matter i trust you will believe me that no light reason would make me rude may i come again with isola to see your drawings soon he meets the professor on the stairs the latter enters the room under evil auspices for my good opinion chapter vi if professor ross entered my room under evil auspices it was not long before he sent the birds the other way for the first time since my childhood i met a man of large and various knowledge a man who had spent his life in amassing information and learning how to make the most of it a little too much perhaps there was of the second and more fruitful branch of the sour sweet tree once i had been fool enough to fancy that some of my own little bopeeps at nature were original and peculiar to thomas kenwood farmer huxtable and even mr shelfer a gardener i had been quite an oracle as to the weather the sky and the insects about moreover in most of the books i had read there were such blunders even in matters that lie on nature's doorsteps that looking back at them i thought i had crossed her threshold as the proverb has it nature always avenges herself and here was i a mere gappermouth i use a devonshire word to be taught that i had not yet cropped even a cud to chew true i did not expect like mr and mrs shelfer that a boiled caterpillar would become a live butterfly neither did i believe with farmer huxtable that hips and haws foretell a hard winter because god means them for the thrushes but i knew no more than they did the laws and principles of things my little knowledge was all shreds and patches it did not cover even the smallest subject odd things here and there i knew but a person of sound information knows the odd and the even as well my observations might truly be called my own but instead of being peculiar to me nearly all of them had been anticipated centuries ago i was but a gipsey straying where an army had been all this i suspected in less than ten minutes from the professor's entrance he did not leave me long in doubt about it it is just to myself to say that the discovery did not mortify me much my little observations had been made partly from pure love of nature's doings partly through habits drawn from a darker spring at first i had felt no pleasure in them but it could not long be so now they were mine as much as ever though a thousand shared them with me as the professor laid bare my ignorance and my errors and proved that the little i did know was at second hand which it certainly was not i attempted no reply i was too young for argument and too much interested to be impatient so he demolished my ham and myself with equal relish and equal elegance of handling he seemed to have no intention of doing either but managed both incidentally and almost accidentally while he opened his mental encyclopaedia at length isola who was tired of lectures such as she got and forgot every day felt that it was high time to assert her prerogative and come to my rescue come pappy you fancy you know everything don't you he was just beginning to treat of mosses and i knew that he was wrong upon several points but did not dare to say so my dear child of the million things i never shall discover one is the way to keep you at all in order i should hope not indeed come now here is another thing you don't know how long did it take to boil this delicious ham clara knows and so do i upon that matter i confess my total ignorance hear hear pappy you can lecture by the hour upon isothermic laws and fluids and fibrine and adipose deposits and you can't tell how long it took to set this delicate fat i'll tell you what it is pappy if you ever snub me in lecture again before the junior sophists as you dared to do yesterday i'll sing out 'ham pappy ham' and you'll see how the girls will laugh no novelty my dear for them to laugh at you i fear you never will learn anything but impertinence his words were light and he strove to keep his manner the same but his eyes belied him isola ran round and administered her never failing remedy there was that sweetness about her nobody could resist it returning to her seat she gave me a nod of triumph and began again now papples when you are good again you shall have a real treat clara will show you her cordetto won't you dear it is twice as big as yours and more than twice as pretty i took it from my neck where it had been throughout my illness isola told me continually that it had saved my sight and so old cora devoutly believed crossing herself and invoking fifty saints long afterwards i found that cora knew it to be the heart of the blessed virgin perpetuated in the material which her husband used if so it had been multiplied as well dr ross took my pretty gordit and examined it narrowly carrying it to the window to get a stronger light beyond a doubt he said at last it is the finest in europe i have only seen one to compare with it and that had a flaw in the centre will you part with it miss valence no i have promised never to do that then i must say no more but i should have been proud to add it to my collection to carry it about with you you mean pappy you know you are a superstitious old pappy in spite of all your learning weak as my eyes were i could see the scowl of deep displeasure in his isola was frightened she knew she had gone too far she did not even dare to offer the kiss of peace no more was said about it and i turned the conversation to some other subject but when he rose to depart i found a pretext for keeping isola with me good bye for the present miss valence dr ross said gracefully he did everything but scowl with an inborn grace i hope that your very first journey in quest of natural history will terminate at my house i cannot show you much but shall truly enjoy going over my little collection with you whenever you find that your sight is strong enough meanwhile let me earnestly warn you to abstain from chemical experiments this was the cause of my injury assigned by mrs shelfer until you have a competent director isola good bye i will send cora for you in good time for tea your attendance at lecture will be excused all my interest in the subjects he had discussed and in his mode of treating them all my admiration of his shrewd intellectual face did not prevent my feeling it a relief when he was gone he was not at all like his children about them there was something so winning and unpretentious few could help liking them at first sight they did all they could to please but without any visible effort but with the professor in spite of all his elegance and politeness i could not help perceiving that he was not doing his best that he scorned to put forth his powers when there was neither antagonist nor in his opinion duly qualified listener nevertheless i could have told him some things he did not know concerning lichens and mosses when i was left with my favourite isola that gentle senior sophist seemed by no means disconsolate at her papa's departure she loved him and was proud of him but there were times as she told me when she was quite afraid of him would you believe it dear that i could be afraid of old pappy his age was about four and forty it is very wicked i know but how am i to help it were you like that with your papa when he was alive no i should think not but i am not at all sure that he wasn't afraid of me oh how nice that must be but it is my fault isn't it i could not well have told her even if i had known it that the fault in such cases is almost always on the parent's side chapter vii that same evening when dear idols was gone and i felt trebly alone mrs shelfer came to say that her uncle john was there and would be glad to see me though he had been several times to ask how i was he had not seen me since the first day of my blindness after expressing his joy and surprise at my recovery he assured me that i must thank neither myself nor the doctor but my luck in not having touched the liquid until its strength was nearly expended have you any news for me i asked abruptly as my strength returned the sense of my wrong grew hotter yes and i fear you will think it bad news you will lose my help for awhile in your pursuit how so you talk of my luck i am always unlucky because i am ordered abroad on a matter too nice and difficult for any of my colleagues to morrow i leave england how long shall you be away i cannot tell perhaps one year perhaps two perhaps i may never return over and above the danger i am not so young as i was i felt dismayed and stricken down was i never to have a chance all powers of earth and heaven and hell seemed to combine against me then came a gleam of hope obscured immediately by the remembrance of his words are you going to italy no to australia thereupon all hope vanished and for a time i could not say a word at last i said inspector cutting the least thing you can do before you go and your absolute duty now is to tell me every single thing you found out in the course of your recent search something you must have learned or you would not have done what you did all along i have felt that you were hiding something from me now you can have no motive now i am your successor in the secret i and no one else to no other will i commit the case how much i have suffered from your secresy none but myself can know henceforth i will have no help three months you have been on the track and i almost believe that you have discovered nothing i spoke so partly through passion partly in hope to taunt him into disclosure his chief weakness as i knew well was pride in his own sagacity you shall suffer no more i had good reasons for hiding it one of them your own hastiness now i will tell you all i know in fact as you well said it has become my duty to do so unless you will authorise me to appoint a successor before i go certainly not my confidence in you cannot be transferred to a stranger one chance more let me report the matter officially it is possible that my superiors may think it more important than my new mission which is to recover a large amount of property no i will not allow it i have devoted myself to one object i alone can effect it it shall not pass to others i feel once more that it is my destiny to unravel this black mystery myself by my own courage in asking your aid i was thwarting my destiny since then i have had nothing but accidents there is a proverb in some language 'who crosses destiny shall have accident' miss valence i could never have dreamed that you were so superstitious now tell me all you have done all you have discovered and your own conclusion from it he told me all in a very few words and his conclusion was mine to any other except myself the grounds on which he had based it would have seemed insufficient i took good care to secure every possible means of following up the frail clue ere he wished me good bye he offered one last suggestion if during my absence miss valence you press your evidence far enough to require the strong hand or if before you have done so you require a man's assistance apply at once to my son you can always find him through patty shelfer he is only a serjeant as yet and not in the detective force but he has qualities that young man has he has got all my abilities and more ah he will be at the top of the tree when i am in my grave please god his shrewd eyes softened as he spoke and i liked him ten times as well for this little flaw in his sheathing of course he knew that i could not entrust myself to a young man as i could to him when he was gone with many good wishes on both sides and a little keepsake from me i felt that i had lost an intelligent honest and true friend chapter viii vigorous and elastic as i am i cannot deny that the air and weather have great dominion over me it was always so with my own dear father two days spent indoors without any real exercise would make him feel as uneasy as a plant in a cellaret crusty and crabbed nothing could ever make him not even gout i believe if he had lived long enough for it but when he had lost his fishing or shooting or bit of gardening too long he was quite unlike himself it was a bad time then to coax for anything no song no whistling no after dinner nap i too am not of a sedentary nature though upon due occasion i can sit writing or drawing for some hours together but how fine a thing all the while to see any motion outside a leaf that can skip or a cloud that can run how we envy a sparrow his little hop even across the gutter it is now a long month since i have been out of doors except just to sniff the air without any bonnet on i have never been boxed and pannelled so long since first i crawled out of my cradle it is a sharp bright frost it seems to freeze harder in london than in the west of gloucestershire but not half so cleanly isola comes like a tea china rose bedded in poplin and ermine her close drawn bonnet of velvet mazarin blue is freaked with snowdrops nod nod nodding not too many of them i hail the omen of spring and my spirits rise already idols is up for a lark as the junior sophists express it and she has set her heart upon leading me such a dance shall she ever set that sweet heart upon anything and not obtain it at once who knows never i am quite sure when another heart is the object come you grave old grandmother you are younger than me i believe in spite of all your stories and you are old enough in your ways for old mother hubbard that lived in a cupboard oh my tippets and furbelows if i wore as tall as you and half as long in the waist what a dress i would have fifteen guineas at least come along you bed ridden dump of a clara it's freezing like bricks and silica and i am in such spirits and giudice is frightening tom out of his life in the kitchen she danced round my little room like a leaf when the wind is rising the pixie king of my gordit could not have been lighter of foot nor half so lovely of form how she managed to spin so between the sticks none but herself can tell what would poor mrs shelfer have said in spite of her fears for the furniture she would have laughed i believe and blessed the pretty feet come along clara child do you think i am going to stand still here all day if you call that standing still pray give me the senior sophist's definition of motion oh i want to skate so dreadfully and pappy and conrad won't let me they say it isn't becoming but what on earth can be more so wouldn't i skim on one foot i'll skate in spite of them clara if you'll only keep me in countenance can you imagine me skating no i know you won't do it you are so fearfully grave but there's more fun in you when you like or when you can't help yourself as i've seen you once or twice than there is in a hundred such merry andrews as me at any rate we'll go and see them on with your bonnet now i cannot wait a minute have something to cover your eyes conny ' be there i know on went my bonnet nothing loth to have an airing again it was fading in the box now lots of warm things darling you have no idea how cold it is and scarcely sun enough to thaw the long frost in your eyes let me look at them donna oh if mine were half as bright you can't have got them in england now idols don't talk nonsense every inch of me is english and not an inch of you although your eyes are so blue you are scotch all over or else you are all swiss for answer she began singing the merry swiss boy and was going to dance to her song when i danced her off down stairs giudice was in the kitchen with tom from the top of the coffee mill sputtering anathemas at him a magnificent dog he was of the race of maltese bloodhounds now so scarce fawn coloured long in the flank deep in the jowl pouch eared and grave of eye he regarded tom no more than if he had been an old hat brushed the wrong way and the birds who were all in a flutter he took for british butterflies he came leisurely to me walking one side at a time and solemnly deposited his great moist nose in my hand i knew him then as the friend who addressed me long since in the villa road why you graven images a popular person always has fifty nicknames isola had a hundred at least and she liked them all what depth of secresy and statecraft is this you know how i love dogs and you never even told me of this splendid fellow's existence well donna dear don't look so indignant he doesn't belong to me and he won't come with me unless he is told and then he makes such a favour of it see his long supple stride he walks just like a leopard don't you you pious panther i wonder he took to you so he is not fierce at all except when he ought to be but he hardly ever makes friends whose dog is he' conrad's to be sure and i do believe conny thinks more of him than he does of me get along you yellow mammoth why he would keep his head there all day all dogs love me idols it was so when i was a child they know how honest i am well i believe you are donna and too honest sometimes but i am honest enough and giudice does not appreciate it come along judy are you going to stick there all day away we went and the great dog walked behind keeping his head most fairly adjusted between us never shifting its place an inch whether we walked or ran as we did where the street was empty and when we got into the park oh the cold air of heaven fresh from the clear north pole where the great bear stalks round the little bear with the vigilance of a mother how it tightens the clip of the joints puts a sting into every step flushes the cheeks with aurora and sparkles in young eyes for the nonce we forget who we are never think how our clothes blow about our spirits are on the north wind what are we more than snow flakes let us glisten and lift on the air crossing the park lightly furrowed with snow at the drains like our hair when we part it we came to a broad sheet of ice we had heard a long way off a crisp musical hollow sound like tapping a box with a hole in it the ice was not like the old ice at vaughan park but seamed and channeled and up and down and powdered light grey with scrapings from skates and shoes thousands of people were on it some skating some sliding some rushing about and playing hot game with crooked sticks some sweeping away with short brooms some crying things for sale and offering skates for hire many standing still and wistfully eyeing the land but all in the height of good humour laughing chaffing holloaing drinking and ordering more every now and then some great performer in his own eyes would sail by the women grandly like a ship heeling over with his arms folded and foot over foot and a long cigar in his mouth for these one devoutly desired a fall the skaters of real eminence scorned this common show off and each had his special admirers forming a ring around him where he had cut his own circus of smoother and greener ice along the brink of firm land stood nurses and children innumerable the maids on the giggle at every challenge borne to them from the glazed waters the little ones tugging and kicking and frantic to get on the background of all the cold scene whiter as it receded and broken by gliding figures was formed by some low fringed islets with open water around them and crane necked wild fowl wheeling about and warning boards and icemen pushing flat bottomed boats along in the far distance to the right were two or three canvas tents where they kept the range of the mercury and the list of the accidents the long vista was closed now and then as high as hats and bonnets by scuds of the drifting ice and snow here as we stood on the bank giudice forsook us shamefully and bounded over the ice with a levity quite scandalous for a serious minded dog towards one of the charmed circles where eminent skaters whirled like peg tops full of steam engines was it likely that we two girls of spirit would halt ignobly there first on the ice went i holding isola's hand and tempting her nothing loth in spite of her boast about skating idols was frightened at first and held very tightly by me and wanted to run back but the little feet grew braver at every step and she ventured even to clap her hands and dance to me the thing was no novelty except from the number of people and the puckering of the ice i had even the courage to slide with one foot but never with both at a time as for the cracking and bending when some heavy man scoured by on purpose i dare say to frighten us i laughed with my heart in my mouth isola was amazed she never could have conceived that i had so much effrontery what cared i if a hundred people stared at me i was doing nothing unseemly and dozens of ladies were there the scene and the air and the spirits of youth set my blood all on the bound and oh blessing of blessings my blessed sight was come back how manly and stirring to feel that a slip and a limb may be broken a crack and one may be drowned but as usual i suffered for my temerity first we followed giudice and found him in the centre of the ring where the greatest throng was gathered the dog skating with his master who was one of the very best skaters in the world giudice was graver than ever but wistfully glanced as he whirled round at every point of escape with his heavy fore feet on his master's shoulders and his tongue lolling out and his eyes rolling sadly at each reluctant caper and his poor tail between his jerked legs it was impossible not to see that his dignity and self respect were suffering so when conrad came to speak to us i earnestly begged that giudice might be set free which was done in a moment to the great disappointment of the bystanders and the boundless delight of the dog who came and gratefully kissed my hand why donna cried isola in a small pet giudice takes you for his mistress he would never do that to me if i coaxed him a hundred years through the colour the north wind had spread on my cheeks i felt the warm blood rushing and bent over the dog to hide it then much as i longed to see isola's brother skate i dragged her off rather rudely towards the rougher part of the ice conrad looked rather surprised and hurt but resumed his figuring with much apparent philosophy idols and i with the flush in our cheeks and the flash in our eyes and our forms all buoyant with innocent fun came suddenly round a corner on a party of low looking men who were casting flat stones bowling or curling or playing at drake with a great tin can for their mark we turned and were off in a moment but we had been observed by the sharpest and slyest eyes in london a man gave chase in half skating fashion having bones tied under his boots in lieu of skates we could easily have escaped in spite of his bones but was i going to run away like a skittish servant maid i drew up miss isola sharply whether she would or no and confronted the enemy it was mr shelfer himself the man so modest and bashful who could never bear to look at me though a dozen more came after him i felt no alarm at all knowing his wonderful shyness and diffidence but his first address amazed me now's your time lads at 'em i say here's the two prettiest gals in london the low scoundrel i saw that he was quite tipsy but frightened as i was for none but they were near i could hardly help laughing at him he had his usual slouch and the long sly nose and the pent house gleam of the eye and his gaunt cheeks drawn as if he was always sucking them and the chimneypot hat that had once belonged to some steady going churchman with the crown flapping in like the gills of a fish all this was balanced by the skill and comical courage of bacchus upon a pair of grating marrow bones behind him his countless pockets yawned and looked brown on the wind and this was the being bowed down to by mrs shelfer clara dear stop clara the impudent sot cried out i had stopped without that and was already facing him for a moment he was abashed for my eyes were full upon his but the others were coming up now this is what i calls harmony dashed if it isn't why look at the trees and the bushes there's harmony in them trees ay in every one on 'em fine trees and pretty gals them's the jockeys for me that's what i calls natur' and something like houses lor there's no harmony in houses and pantiles fine trees is all harmony and so is lovely woman don't tell the old gal at home she never would understand why idols there is a pretty duck as ever swam on the ice but clara's a fine swan and no mistake ducks is all very well but a swan is the jockey for me there's something to lay hold on there give me a swan i say and the harmony of them trees bob ridley i'll lay you a tanner i kisses that there swan ever see such eyes bob and look at the way she stands wonder there's a bit of ice left here the low rogue had a long pipe in his head as farmer huxtable expressed it and at every leering sentence blew out a puff of smoke bet you a tanner charley you don't kiss that stunnin' gal cried his friend as drunk as himself here goes neck or nothing and the niddering made a dash at me i drew my clenched hand from my muff where it had been tingling in my glove and in his tipsy rush his face came full against it it was a very odd thing and i know not how it happened he reeled on his bones from the collision and staggered in staring amazement before he had time to recover conrad dashed up like a hawk at an owl by some wonderful back stroke he stopped in an instant wrung shelfer's crooked stick from his hand hooked him under the collar struck out again and towed the poor wretch away backward at the speed of a mile in a minute the fire flew from his skates as he dashed towards the open water giudice at full gallop behind tried in vain to keep up every man and woman there turned to watch the issue shelfer threw out his hands wildly and screamed he was utterly helpless his teeth rattled more than the bones on his boots at the edge of the open water three hundred yards away conrad stopped suddenly like an engine in collision unhooked mr shelfer and let him go with full impetus sprawling and yelling in vain he flung up his arms and fell backward into the water headlong the icemen came running with boats and ropes and grapnels but before the first splash was over another was seen giudice at a sign from his master plunged in drew the poor man of harmony out and laid him high and wet on the ice he was taken at once to the tent where as i afterwards heard he made a fine afternoon of it with the society's men most of whom it is needless to say he knew be that as it may the lesson did him good he never insulted a lady again or what is still worse a poor honest girl with no education and no one to defend her as for me i really believe he never durst blink his sly eyes in my direction again i love good justice in or out of the pod the bean is as sweet to me from the rough air of heaven as from a juryman's pocket but i thought master conrad had overdone it this time he had no right to risk the poor man's life and so i told him when he came back as calm as if he had cut a spread eagle he assured me that he had not risked the man's life at all he knew the depth of the water there by the island it was five feet and no more then i felt all of a glow and longed to give him the kiss which had cost mr shelfer so much the next minute i felt humiliated and burst into a passion of tears to think what my father would say at his pet of grace and luxury being insulted like that idols and conrad not knowing my story could not understand it at all they came home with me at once conrad under the circumstances ventured to offer his arm which i under the circumstances ventured to accept at the door he left me but idols came in with giudice commissioned to see her safe home she came in partly lest i should feel lonely partly to arraign mrs shelfer already condemned by both of us girls for daring to have such a reprobate drunken husband chapter ix when isola had told mrs shelfer everything and a little more than everything for her imagination was lively the dominant feeling in the little woman's bosom was not indignation as we had expected but terror terror of two evils the first and chief evil the possibility of charley catching cold the other the probability that he would crush conrad and tread him into the earth at the earliest opportunity i assured her warmly that mr conrad could well defend himself even if shelfer should dare to meddle with him oh my good friend you have no idea what a terrible fellow charley is why he broke the head of the skittleman at the load of hay so he told me himself ah he's a terrible fellow when he's put out but you forget mrs shelfer he hasn't been put out this time he was put in that isola always loved small jokes put in miss idols mrs shelfer never understood any joke but her own oh yes put into the water you mean true true and serve him right so long as he don't take cold for calling me his lawful wife who keeps him together 'the old gal at home' but charley's a terrible fellow terrible terrible coward more likely i cried or he would never have dared his low insolence to me i am sorry for it mrs shelfer utterly as i scorn him because it compels me to leave your house and you have been truly good and kind to me i thought of mrs huxtable but how different was the fibre of her kindness leave my house miss valence no no my good friend that will never do not to be thought of and us so used to you and all and tom and the blackbird and the new squirrel a likely story my good friend and with your eyelashes coming and do you know who would come instead of you of course not mrs shelfer why a nasty stinking hussy that would steal the feathers out of my best bed again the same as they did before my very best bed miss idols as dear miss minto left me by her will not a better bed in london unless it's the queen's and so i used to tell her when i helped to shake it up my mouth watered over it so that she said one day and the knife boy heard her on the stairs 'patty you've been a good girl to me and you deserves it and you shall have it when i am tucked up for good and all' and so i did very honourable and all above board yes yes i had a commercial gent one time a wonderful heavy man to be sure and he stayed with me three year for the sake of that same bed and he knew what beds was and no mistake it was bootiful to see when he was a getting up it began to rise up up the same as tom's back when he see your dog miss idols come mrs shelfer i fear we can hardly wait 'twas like dough put afore the fire miss there's no such dantzic now you couldn't put your fist into one side of it but out it would come the other oh lor i could cry that nasty sly minx she was softer than parsnips you'd say and one leg more than the other i couldn't think why it was she would always make her own bed 'thank you mrs shelfer' with her lips sucked in like a button hole 'thank you you are too kind it doesn't at all fatigue me and my doctor pronounces the exercise good for my chest and arms' thank god she got some exercise good for her legs as well six months on the treadmill charley got me an order and it did my heart good to see her but my twenty pounds of best feathers never came back again and that wasn't the worst of it neither oh dear no says idols the worst of it was the sin mrs shelfer the worst of it was that she stuffed it with sawdust and oakum and jovanna i do believe by the smell of it what do you mean mrs shelfer lor miss valence don't you know jovanna that the kingfishers lays on the top of the sea and the gardeners make water with it and what did she do with your feathers sneaked them out of the house in the crown of her bonnet and sold them at eightpence a pound and they worth three and sixpence every flue of them but the rag and bottleman got two months thank god for it ah it will never be a bed again under l at least is it the one i sleep on mrs shelfer yes my good friend the very same and you have put me to sleep on guano well i thought it smelt very odd no no my good friend wait a bit we got most of that out again and gave it to our geraniums she stole it out of a sack as charley kept in the washhouse there was feathers in it that put it into her head i suppose but as for your going miss valence that will never do never never will it now miss idols and to see her dress to be sure that baggage why my best tarlatan as dear miss minto give me to be married in wasn't good enough for her to sweep the stairs in sweep the stairs yes yes she did sweep the stairs when i see her last and she had afore i know she was so clever at it and that was why one leg was so much more than the other mrs shelfer do you expect us to listen to you all night true my good friend quite true but when i thinks of my feathers something comes over me i must out with my troubles or burst but you musn't go miss valence that will never do never ask miss idols now and she turned to isola who was quite ready to be turned to of course it won't mrs shelfer you are quite right my good friend i won't hear of it for a moment why mr shelfer was drunk i know it by the way he held his pipe quite 'drunk and incapable' you know and he will be so sorry and he'll never do it again and he did not mean to be drunk at all but the frost was very hard and the cold got into his head i am sure it would into mine if i had stayed much longer and he didn't understand brandy balls as we do at college you could not expect it you know the pure good faith of this last was too much for me i laughed outright having no husband concerned in it as for the dry little woman she actually cried i had never seen a tear in her quick shy eyes before though the feather bed nearly brought them and so did the death of the elder sandy the squirrel she turned away she was always ashamed of emotion bless your innocent heart miss idols if you don't marry a king not one of us is good enough to tie your shoes as you talked of you are that simple and good of heart is there any goodness more touching to a veteran than a soft young nature's disbelief in evil but for bitter experience i might have been sweet as isola thank god that in spite of all vinegar the ailment is still infectious isola could not make it all out to morrow morning miss valence began mrs shelfer again to morrow morning after i have wigged him well all night and then given him a good breakfast he'll come and beg your pardon like a child and be ashamed to look any higher than your flounces and i know you'll forgive him mrs shelfer i have forgiven him long ago i cannot bear enmity against such people these last three words had better been away for such little wrongs and i owe you a great deal for all your kindness to me the only question is whether self respect and prudence allow me to stay here i will leave the decision to miss isola young as she is and innocent and confiding she cannot be wrong on a question of delicacy as for prudence she knows more of london than i do hereon i sat down with a womanly air but i could hardly help laughing when the senior sophist jumped up proud to deliver judgment to look taller she shook her flounces down threw back her plump white shoulders her bonnet and cloak were off drew her rich flowing hair down the pearly curve of her ears and scarcely satisfied yet thought of mounting a stool then took her foot off the too convictive bema after all these anabolisms she began with much solemnity she was thinking of the college and her father in the rostrum miss valence and mrs shelfer since you have honoured my weak judgment by appointing me umpire and as i am led to believe without any right of appeal i will do my utmost to be discreet and impartial in the first place i award that miss valence remain in this house forget and forgive her wrongs in the second place i recommend in such a matter i will not presume to command that till mr shelfer has made a humble apology and promised faithfully never to be intoxicated again however cold the weather is mrs shelfer shall not permit him to have a single kiss nor a single bit of hot dinner now i have delivered my decree lor miss idols you are too soft for the old bailey he never kiss me unless it is when he knows i have got some money but he do like a good hot dinner right enough there my good friend so this knotty point was settled and giudice who was very loth to leave me escorted miss idols home before going he made another solemn deposit of his great jowl in my hand and looked at me with an air so tutelary and encouraging that i could not help laughing at which he felt hurt but condoned it isola told me that when he was put in charge of her he felt the responsibility so strongly that he would not stir from her side not even to speak to the most colloquially gifted dog though at other times he would stay gossiping near a lamp post for five minutes together one evening when he was thus commissioned a rude fellow pushed between them and said something to isola giudice had him down in an instant and stood over him like a tawny thundercloud with growlings so fearful and such flashing eyes that two policemen felt it wiser not to act as conductors idols herself was obliged at the entreaty of her prostrate foe to coax the great dog off but when the ungrateful man got up he insisted on giving giudice into charge and having him dragged to the station very good sir said the policeman we'll enter the charge when you bring him there let him go miss for the gent to collar him the gent was away in no time and giudice and his mistress walked off amid loud hurrahs from all the boys of the neighbourhood conrad called with his sister the day after mr shelfer's ducking to reassure himself as to my nerves which were never better he looked over some of my drawings and without seeming to give but rather to seek information afforded me many a hint which i afterwards found most useful i now learned what his profession was and it gave me pleasure to find that he was not as i had feared a mere lounger upon town instead of that he was working very hard being as he told me nothing more or less than a journeyman sculptor though as himself admitted by no means a novice he was going through the regular course of study and hand labour under an eminent artist but isola told me and no doubt it was true that he could beat his master out and out and that for any choice design where original power and taste were needed they always came to him of late the frosts had lightened his tasks for warm the room as they would the weather always affected the material and they feared to attempt the more delicate parts of the work during the rigours of winter so when the thaw came he must lose the pleasure of seeing me for a while unless dear isola wished to be escorted home on a sunday if indeed i allowed her to come on that day why that was the very day when i could best indulge in a walk with my gentle friend after going to church and i was sure her society did me more good than the sermons on her part isola found that the services always made her so nervous her nerves were as good as mine and that she did not much like walking about with a big dog on sundays and cora was always cross all the day after mass so conrad must promise upon his honour always to come for her rain hail or shine on a sunday this he promised so readily that for a moment i fancied it had all been preconcerted then i despised myself for the suspicion the trick would have been not out of the compass of isola but very unworthy of conrad chapter x soon as ever my sight was fully restored and i had dr frank's permission i took to my drawing again and worked at it till my eyes ached this was the symptom upon which i had promised immediately to leave off then out i would rush towards dusk and away into the great square full of the pure air of heaven round by the church at the top and six times round it till my breath was short the senior sophist reminds me that round a square is impossible after squaring the circle extract the square root dear idols by the binomial theorem you do learn so much at college but i write simple and often foolish english never mind i would rather write bad english than the best french ever written one is the tongue of power and multitude the other the language of nicety and demarcation which of the two is the more expansive even a woman may guess high time it was for me to recruit my exchequer dr franks had charged me far less than i even dared to hope how i trembled when i opened the envelope what quick terror is half so bad as the slow fear of gathering debt i was accustomed to medical charges of the time when i was an heiress but his appeared to me now to be even below reason the sum could hardly have paid him for his numerous walks to and fro then a wretched idea shot through me had he charged me so little because he knew i was poor i took mrs shelfer into my confidence she was likely to know what the london scale should be the little thing soon reassured me it was quite enough she declared if she were in my place she would demand a discount for ready money oh you dreadfully mean little woman i should lose my sight and deserve it if i did however in spite of all this money was scarce and scarcer every day and none of my grand revenues would fall due for ever so long so another visit must be paid to mr oxgall isola insisted on coming with me to my surprise i found that with all her soft simplicity she had much more idea of making a market than i had the reason probably was that she had much less pride no pocket would hold mine when a tradesman attempted any familiarity and whoso stands on a pedestal to sell is like to find the buyer's arm too short whether it were that or the golden charm of her manner or of something else let mr oxgall say certain it is that the man of crackly canvas for whom by the bye i have a sincere respect because he cheated me so little and so neatly this man i say regarded her with a wide mouthed brooch eyed admiration which he hardly ever expended on anything out of oils for the king of painters himself she was a vision sweeter than dreams of heaven such a tint in her lustrous eyes such tone in her dainty cheeks such perfection of line in her features and every curve of her exquisite shape and bounding and sparkling through all from the rippled wealth of her hair to the light curved arch of her foot the full play of her innocent joyous loving life no wonder the picture dealer shaded his eyes and gazed and rubbed them and gazed again i have frequently seen respectable elderly gentlemen whose rakishness has never been more than found vent in the cock of a hat magisterial men i mean who would no more think of insulting a girl in london or anywhere else than of giving their daughters as prizes for competitive skill in poaching such good men and true also simple hearted clergymen for some there still are from the country these and the like i clara vaughan have seen when they met my isola stop short wink frequently and without much presence of mind until she was gone by then shumble hotly across the street with hands in their tail coat pockets for these gentlemen always expect most to be robbed when there is least chance of it pretend to look at a shop then march at top speed fumbling all the while for their spectacles until they got well a head of us then i have seen them cross again some thirty yards in front with spectacles nicely adjusted and become again wholly absorbed by the beauty of metropolitan goods but when the light foot sounded from a fair gazing distance these same gentlemen have by some strange coincidence alway turned full upon us in an absent and yet nervous manner and focussed their green or pale blue eyes upon the rich violet orbs of isola i have even known them to look at me when they could see her no more to find some sympathy for their vague emotions idols knew it of course she did and she rather gloried in it she had much respect for a fine old gentleman and i know not how it was but nobody ever thought of insulting her when she could be clearly seen a pretty girl you would never call her though mr shelfer did the term would be quite unworthy even a beautiful girl sweetly beautiful though she was would hardly be your expression at least for a while but a lovely girl and the loveliest one ever seen that is what she would be called at once if you could take your eyes off to analyse your ideas isola knew it of course as i said before she knew all her wondrous gifts but as for being conceited a trull with a splay foot and a crop of short horn carrots has often thrice her conceit a certain pretty graceful pride she had which threw a rosy playful halo round her but never made other women look plain in her eyes she will not value her beauty much until she falls in love and blessed is he who shall be the object if she is allowed to abide with him meanwhile mr oxgall wished for nothing but to hear and see her talk and this she did to some purpose i like a man who at the age of sixty is still impressible to the gay vein of youth i know at once by his eyes whether his admiration is abstract and admissible if it be i reciprocate it what clearer proof can we find that his heart has not withered with his body that he is not a man of mammon tinsel or phylactery in a word no mummy shall i ever finish this bargain i have never been so reflective before and all the time no less a sum than five pounds hangs upon it five guineas which sounds better was the amount at which dear idols let off mr oxgall i believe she might have got ten but she had an excellent conscience it worked like a patent chronometer with compensation balance mine was still more sensitive i could hardly think my landscape perspective mare's nest and all worth that amount of money and i wished to throw off a guinea but idols would not hear of it miss valence i am your factor for this beautiful landscape which has cost you so much labour either accept my terms inadequate as they are or take the agency from me and recommence with mr oxgall 'de novo' as we say at college betwixt her beauty and my stately integrity poor mr oxgall knew not where he stood i heard him mutter that he would rather go through fifty auctions even if it was george robins but if she had come to sell him a picture the very next day he would have gone through it all again with the same infatuation so i took the money and now my evil demon who had chafed beneath all this trampling had his turn again we had foolishly brought the great dog giudice for our delight and the expansion of his mind in mr oxgall's shop he behaved to admiration with the air of a connoisseur he walked from picture to picture closed one eye and faintly wagged his tail then he found a scotch terrier scarcely worth a sniff and a mastiff whom he saluted with a contemptuous growl the only work of high art he could discover was an interior with a flitch of bacon in the foreground uncommonly well drawn before this he sat down and receiving no invitation bedewed the boards with a stalactite from either side of his mouth the dog was so well behaved he never took anything without leave and saying t a long grace unluckily mr oxgall mainly i believe to prolong his interview with idols insisted upon taking us to the shop of a carver and gilder close by where my first drawing which had been sold was to be seen in its frame he declared that we could not tell what a painting was like until we had seen it framed observing several large mirrors in this shop i begged that giudice might be left outside and so he was but he did not stay there scarcely had we begun to discuss the effect of the frame on my drawing when giudice pushed his way in and looked about with a truly judicial air the shop was long and the owner was with us at the further end i saw what would follow and dashed off to stop him but it was too late giudice had seen the very finest dog he ever beheld in his life a dog really worth fighting up went his crest and his tail one savage growl and he sprang at him crash and the largest mirror there was a wreck and giudice the rock beneath it for a time he lay quite stunned then to my great delight he staggered to me not isola laid his cut paws in my hands and his bleeding nose in my lap and explained it all to me with much entreaty for sympathy this i gave him readily even to tears and kisses isola wanted to scold and even to beat him but i would not hear of it he had seen another great dog between himself and us how could he help attacking him i ordered a sponge and some water at once and bathed his fore paws which were terribly cut then remembering the inspector i sent idols for some arnica but the blood was not stanched by it as i expected perhaps the drug was not pure or the hair obstructed its action so i held his paws in the basin and he whinged and licked me and made my face all bloody meanwhile the poor carver and gilder thought much more of his looking glass than of noble flesh and blood the picture dealer as well was in a great predicament mr oxgall i cried still sponging the wounded dog's nose let us hear no more about it tell me the full value of the mirror and i will pay for it what are glass and quicksilver or even gold compared to a noble dog like this not worth a wag of your tail are they my duck of diamonds give me another kiss you delicious pet of a dog the delicious dog was entirely of my opinion his beautiful eyes were unhurt his nose tasted wholesomely salt but isola was not half so romantic little she cared about money for herself yet she had no idea of seeing a friend disburse empowered by nature to wind all men round her finger she now called art to her aid and mr oxgall who was half way round already had no chance of escape she settled it thus the carver and gilder in consideration of his dealings with mr oxgall and his own careless exposure of the mirror should accept cost price for the article that amount should be paid in equal shares by all three of us by mr oxgall because he would drag us thither by herself as the mistress of the dog and by me as the cause of the expedition she had attended a course of lectures upon jurisprudence and her decision was better than that of a judge because she had seen the whole of it and because the dog was hers at least her brother's which was all the same as for the owner of the mirror he must think himself wonderfully lucky in having met with such honest people and in having sold his glass and hadn't he got all the pieces and she must have the largest one for judy to dress his hair by and so indeed she did after our dear portia had finished and the whole thing was settled it struck me that no lectures upon jurisprudence could turn wrong into right mr oxgall was quite blameless so was i so was idols except in bringing unlucky giudice with her which from the outset i had discouraged she as the temporary owner of the dog should have borne all the loss and so she would have done gladly only she did not see it in that light as it was she tried afterwards to force upon me her last three guineas that being the sum which i had paid as my third of the whole but of course i would not accept them she had no money with her so i paid her contribution but allowed her to repay me mr oxgall's third i made good to him without consulting her when he paid me for my next drawing so i had earned five guineas and lost six is it always to be so when i labour to make a little money at my earnest entreaty idols could refuse me nothing when i was in earnest darling giudice was brought home in a cab to my lodgings i knew that he would not be cared for at the stables where he was boarded and his wounds were very serious as for home professor ross who detested dogs in general would not admit him into the house he even thought it a great stretch of grace to allow old cora to watch the dog back to the stables after he had been patrolling all the afternoon with his mistress how i hate such low ingratitude an animal is to serve us body and soul to crouch and fawn for our notice not that giudice ever fawned to him but growled awfully and we are to think it well off with a curse or a kick which we durst not give it but for its loyalty to us what pleasure i had in nursing that poor giudice and how grateful he was when we got home i washed his wounds again with warm water this time as the bleeding was stanched and then i exhibited as the doctors absurdly say a little friar's balsam oh it does smart so giudice exclaimed with his eyes but i know it's for the best and you won't see me give one wince neither did i then a nice soft bandage over his lovely paws and a plaister across his nose and he lies snugly at the proper distance from the fire as proud as possible of being nursed and with an interesting air of pallid refinement on his features he will hardly notice idols but exclaims at length with the petulance of an invalid isola can't you let me alone clara understands a dog and i like her much the best so he followed me all round the room with his eyes and begged me to come and talk to him which i would not do because he needed quiet and composure chapter xi beloved giudice remained many days under my care until he became convinced that he was my dog absolutely and had no claim on any other human being he more than paid for his board and medical attendance by sitting repeatedly for his portrait in which at last i succeeded to his and my own satisfaction though by no means a conceited dog there was nothing he loved better than having his likeness taken and directly after breakfast he always assumed the most becoming attitude and watched intently for the appearance of the pencil with his massive head a little on one side and his dark brown eyes full of dignified interest and his great ears curving down through russet tufts like tawny cascades in autumn he seemed fit study for a real artist who should quicken as well as copy him however he was too much of a gentleman to sneer at my weak efforts for he saw that i did my best oftentimes he would gaze steadfastly at the portrait and then at me and hobble up and nudge me and whine a little and then sigh in self abasement at his want of speech whenever he did this i knew that he wished to have something altered but it was long before i could discover what that something was i tried every change of line or colour that i could think of all to no purpose at length it struck me that as he criticised more with nose than eyes the defect must be in the smell happy idea i satisfied my giudice at last and did it thus after shading around the nose and mouth before laying on the colour i took a clean dry brush and passed it lightly round the hollows of his own sweet saltish nostrils carefully avoiding the cut then one turn of the brush not on the palette but on a dry square of colour and with that i expressed the dear dog's nose so well that he would have spoiled it in a sniffing ecstasy if i had not pulled it away his portrait now possessed the life which he required meanwhile i received almost daily visits from isola and her brother the latter was of course very anxious about his poor dog and could only relieve that anxiety by long interviews with him it happened strangely enough yet more and more often as time went on that isola during these interviews felt an especial desire for mrs shelfer's society which she could only enjoy by betaking herself to the kitchen there with all the pets except old tom who was constancy itself and the lame blackbird who was all gratitude her influence began to supersede mine and even mrs shelfer's for this i cared but little so long as giudice kept to me over that great dog as he turned upon his side and lifted one hind leg the canine mode of showing submission to the will of god over him we bent conrad and i in most interesting diagnosis until it seemed the proper thing that our hair should flow together and our breath make one soft breeze from this position we would rise with a conscious colour in our cheeks and a flutter at the heart and a certain awe of one another then it would be ever so long before either of us dared to seek the other's eyes haply when those eyes were met unwitting yet inevitably they would drop or turn away or find some new attraction in the dog or clouds then some weak remark would follow for which the hearer cared no whit yet feigned deep interest therein why labour thus to cheat ourselves each other we cannot cheat why feel we so confused and guilty why long so heartily to be a hundred leagues away yet knowing thoroughly that if it were so all the space between were void and heartache the reason neither we nor other mortal knows the cause is this that we love one another i have felt that it must be so at least on my part ever since the day he came with isola and knew me not though i knew him so well does he know me now as the clara vaughan whom he once avoided these eyelashes are as long and dark as ever the large eyes shaded by them are as deep a gray as twilight in a grove of willows my cheeks have regained their curve my hair was never injured let me hie to the glass now he is gone and see if i be like myself and whether i have face and form likely to win conrad's love no i am not like myself no wonder he does not know me the gloom habitual to my face is gone it is the difference betwixt a cavern well and a sunny fountain i see a laughing graceful girl with high birth marked in every vein and self respect in every motion her clear cheeks glowing with soft wonder her red lips parted with delight her arching neck and shoulder curve gleaming through a night of tresses her forehead calm and thoughtful still half belying the bright eyes where love and pleasure sparkle for a moment self approval heightens the expression at my silly self my foolish self is smiling but the smile has warmer source than maiden's light conceit i smile because i see that as regards exterior he who slights me must be hard to please and some one whom i think of is not hard to please straight upon the thought of him ah well my father used to quote from the hero and leander a beautiful verse which neither he nor any other could in english render duly greek aidous hyron ereuphos apostazousa prosopou v showering from her cheek the flowing carmine of her shame chapter xii but when conrad should have learned who it was that nursed his dog would he feel the tender gratitude and delight which he now displayed so freely would he say as in his fervour he now said every day miss valence i do believe there is no one like you in the world would he not rather say miss vaughan how basely you have deceived me giudice come away a whistle and the last sound of the foot for which i listened now by the hour this thought was continually with me it poisoned half the flavour and ruined all the digestion of my happy moments but what could i do how unmaidenly how presumptuous of me to imagine that he was likely to break his heart for me and if he did why then he should break my own as well i am not one of the drawing room young ladies who receive a modified proposal every sunday afternoon and think much more about the sermon afterwards i cannot play with the daffodils upon the brink of love sleepily thrusting my admirers in and lounging with half open breast which neither love knots may secure nor fluttering sighs unzone no here i am such as i am such as god has made me no usury no auction for my heart once for all i give it and my life goes with it so it must always be with a girl of any feeling who has trained her own existence but for my wild ignorance i would dare to say so it must be always with a girl of feeling twist and warp her as you will yet i am told by those who know the world that it is not so with nine girls out of ten among the lady caste if beneath the roc of fashion they prefer the diamond to the meat let them have it and starve thereon the choice is of their own young crops no parent bird can force the bauble down but what have i to do with this all i know is that neither i nor any child of mine will or shall be gulleted thus for life after every little burst of thought every feeble sally of imagination came as always is the case with me came the slow pusillanimous reaction all that i had any right to do was to paint earn money and be off for italy little as i knew about the expense of travelling i felt sure that it would be vain to start with less than a hundred pounds enormous sum how could i ever hope to win it though i painted day and night and lived on bread and water to this diet or what in london is quite synonymous bread and milk i had already reduced myself in my stern resolve to lay by two pounds every week farewell to meat so soon as my devonshire pegmate was gone and farewell to what i cared much more about a glass of good london stout i suppose there is something horribly vulgar in my tastes for i will confess that the liquid called black draught by mr dawe had much charm for me however i abjured it with all other luxuries and throve no whit the worse the kindly little woman whose summum bonum next to her sticks was plenty of good fare took it much to heart that i should live so plainly why miss valence you are the queerest young lady as ever i set eyes on all as ever i see and i've see'd a many they picks a little bit so dainty like a canary cracking a hemp seed when the gentlemen is by then off they goes when there's nobody looking and munches like so many pigs in a potato bury miss violante you know but as for you why bless me and keep me you feeds that great horse of a dog with all the fat of the land and you lives on a crust yourself now do come down that's a good soul there's a clod of beef a biling with suet dumplings and such lovely parsnips you can smell it all up the stairs galloping galloping my good friend and that rogue of a charley won't come home i know he's got along with that thief bob ridley and i expects the boy every minute with a little drop of stout and the best pewter pot for you now if you won't come down miss valence my dinner will all stick in my throat and i am so hungry so am i mrs shelfer you have made me so in her excitement she slipped from the edge of the chair whereon she always balanced herself when i made her sit down she thought it disrespectful to occupy too much room and cuddled herself in the smallest compass possible let no ill be thought of giudice who thinks ill of me i care not for i can defend myself if it be worth while so can giudice with his teeth the finest set in london but he has no tongue no merop tongue i mean it was true that giudice had good fare and thoroughly he enjoyed it that dog knew a juicy bit of meat short of staple crisp yet melting quite as well as i did true he had a love of bones transparent gristle and white fibres which i from inferior structure cannot quite appreciate yet all this was no part of his mind much less did it affect the greatness of his soul he kept as all of us do who are good for anything a certain alter ego a higher voice a purer sense a vein which fashion cannot leech or false shame tourniquet so the good dog used to come to me before he touched his breakfast lunch or dinner and entreat me to devour all i could there would be lots still left for him in my hurry to get start of time to spin a little faster the revolving moons i did a thing which i could ill approve to myself even at the moment i wrote to sally huxtable to obtain mr dawe's permission for me to sell my gordit professor ross had offered me no less than ten guineas for it as a gentleman he should not have made the offer after what i had told him but the love of science falsely so called by collectors drives men to discern propriety by the wire drawn line of their longings however i was not quite so blind upon right and wrong as to mean to keep all the money i offered mr dawe half if the plaything should be sold exiguo fine libidinum i knew not why but i could not bear the idea of a bargain and sale with conrad's father wide apart as the two always were in my mind i rather hoped that beany dawe though sorely tempted would refuse and now the time was almost come for news from tossil's barton dear sally must have filled the twelve copybooks at the rate of one a week ere i quite expected it the letter came but before its tidings are imparted i must in few words describe the visit of inspector cutting's son george cutting came one evening to see his good aunt patty for so he called mrs shelfer who was in truth his cousin though i had been so assured that my enemy could not escape i was not equally convinced and at times a deep anxiety and despair possessed me therefore i went to the kitchen to see the inspector's son and requested mrs shelfer to allow me five minutes of conversation with him he stood all the while and seemed rather shy and confused he had not heard from his father since the ship sailed but he had seen in the papers that she had been spoken somewhere the party as i knew of was still safe in london my blood ran like lava at the thought or i should have heard of it he george cutting had his eye upon him and so had two of the detective force but what were they in comparison with his father this he asked despite his shyness with so large a contempt that i began to think the cutting family admired the cuttings only upon me who am no cutting he left the simple impression that the qualities so lauded by his father lay as yet beneath a bushel however his aunt patty declared that he could eat three times as much as charley not unlikely if he only drank one third of charley's allowance mrs shelfer who knew that i was laying by a fixed sum every week began to look upon me as a fine young miser of course she quite fell in with what she supposed to be my ideas for she never contradicted any one unless it was a cabman oh i do love money my good friend gold gold it is so bootiful did you ever hear tell of the marrow bone i had oh dear what marrow bone mrs shelfer why a big beef marrow bone that long full of sovereigns and guineas after dear miss minto i stopped it with a bung and a piece of bladder and for better than a twelvemonth while they was executing her will i slept with that beneath my pillow for fear the priest should get it lord how they did fight over the poor old lady's rags and bones that leathery priest and three yellow kites of cousins they said they was as come from portugal at last they got a ministration with the testament and text and they robbed me shameful shameful my good friend never catch me going to mass again or you may tell me of it letters of administration cum testamento annexo and what became of the marrow bone mrs shelfer at this inquiry she winked both eyes rapidly and screwed up her little mouth oh what a thief that father banger was to be sure you see miss i had strict orders to shut him out when miss minto was near her end because he had kicked her dear cat filippina from the top of the stairs to the bottom after he had gived her unction what a pretty sight it was to see them seven dear cats all sitting round the fire each one on his proper stool with his name done on it in different coloured worsted i had so much a year left me on the bank of england honourable to the day for each one of those cats and change of diet every week and now there's only one of them left and that is my dear old tom but mrs shelfer about the marrow bone well my good friend i was going to tell you the way that father banger got into the house again to steal the poor old lady's money for building a school or some such villany he knowed how fond the poor soul was of cats so he borrowed a cat somewhere and he got two boys to let it down the area with a whipcord round its stomach and to jerk jerk jerk away at it and the poor thing did squeal sure enough 'pain patty' says my poor mistress and she could hardly speak 'oh patty there's some cruel englishman torturing a cat again' so out i runs into the area and in pops father banger who had his back to the wall with a great sheet of paper and he begins to make a list of all the things in the house i took the cat to dear miss minto and how pleased she was 'please god' says she 'to let me live a few days more till i make a catholic of this poor heretic' she always converted her cats the first thing 'and then it shall have a stool and a good annuity' but next day the poor thing went little mrs shelfer had so great a fear of death that like some ancient nations she shunned all mention of his name by euphemistic periphrase she had never known real illness and even a stitch or a spasm would frighten her for days when i spoke calmly as i sometimes did of our great inevitable friend whom we so labour to estrange up would jump mrs shelfer with a shudder and a little scream oh don't my good soul oh don't how can you let us live miss valence let us live while we can and not think of such dreadful things you make my blood run cold but mrs shelfer surely you know that we all must die of course my good friend of course but then you needn't remind one of it i met doctor franks to day and he said 'why mrs shelfer i do declare you look younger than ever' and a very clever man he is yes yes and not a gray hair in my head and my father lived to eighty eight and how old are you mrs shelfer now oh i am sure i don't know miss valence i don't keep no account let us talk of something else did you hear what tom did to your judy to day ah poor little thing but i am not going to moralise shall i ever know the history of that marrow bone i have now ascertained that a roving dog popped in and away with the marrow bone sovereigns guineas and all cv chapter xiii tossil's barton estimating the british post by the standard of joe queen's boy placed but little confidence in that institution moreover tossil's barton held that a papper scrawl as it termed a letter was certain to be lost for want of size unless it were secured in something large something as a man can zee and hold on to as the farmer himself expressed it therefore i was not surprised at receiving instead of a letter by post a packet delivered by the parcels van this packet was bound round like the handle of a whip and stuck at either end with a mass of cobbler's wax bearing the vivid impress of a mighty thumb within the wrappings first appeared an ominous crumpled scroll ye stars where angels so buffooned by eminent painters dwell once more i behold eli on the turnpike gate the great western steamer job with a potsherd of willow pattern plate the prodigal son and worse than all that hideous death and the lady recklessly i tumble out all the rest of the packet three great bolts with silver clasps three apostle spoons two old silver salt cellars marked whjh a child's christening cup a horn tobacco stopper with a silver tip an agate from the beach a tortoise shell knife with a silver blade half a dozen coins and a bronze fibula found upon the farm an infant's coral a neck pin garnished with a bristol diamond a number of mother of pearl buttons and blue beads and a mass of mock jewelry bought by the farmer from the cheapjacks at barum fair with the produce of his wrestling triumphs separate from the rest and packed most carefully were all but two of the trinkets i had sent as christmas gifts for the family touched to the heart by all this loving kindness i felt so ashamed of my paltry petulance at eli jonah and the rest that i would not indulge in a peep at sally's letter which came last of all until i had starved myself for a day that literary effort showed so much improvement both in writing and in spelling that any critic would have endorsed mr huxtable's conclusion that the gift must be in the family a few words still there were of rather doubtful texture but who can bind or bound the caprice and luxury of the english language moreover sally's stops were left once more to the discretion of the reader but if lord byron could not grasp the mysteries of punctuation how could sally huxtable yet that eager little maid would have learned in half an hour the art which might have mellowed the self tormentor's howling sally's was a healthy sweet and wholesome nature tossil's barton farm trentisoe the tenth day of march ad dear miss clara dear if you please father and mother and me and our little jack hope this letter will find you in good health as it leaves all of us at this present or when it will be finished thank god for the same and hoping no offence the baby as was born on the th

big boy now and button his own corduroys go down to the brook at once and pull off all his things and there he rake and feel among the stones for the biggest part of a day though the ice was on the edge but the water were quite clear and tabby badcock want to pull off her things and go in too but jack would not let her and be ashamed of herself and i sat on the bank and tabby and jack pull out nine beautiful things as were meant for father and mother and him and billy and little honor and bobby and peggy and the two weanies but he couldn't find nothing as were meant for me sally unless tabby stole it and she be quite equal to it i am afeared and we all returns you many many kind thanks and love especially the ones as had it and me our jack say no her wouldn't do it he'll go bail for that no fie but i shake my head though perhaps she never had the chance if so be there wasn't none marked sally and thank you every bit the same miss so long as there wasn't none for tabby poor little sally she must have cried bitterly to think of her being forgotten but the best of all next to the farmer's was for her and there was one for tabby too miss clara dear the things was not hurt at all by being under water for a week and father say they must be made of the very same gold as queen victoria's crown and sceptre is as never can rust with the briny waves and beany dawe feel cock sure as it was the fairy of the brook stole them from joe's breeches pocket and keep mine still he say because it be the prettiest but there he never know much any more than tabby does if you please miss asking your pardon when aunt muxworthy were here to the christening time she said she never see such writing in her life as mine and it wasn't my best copy neither and she said it was a sin to make a scholar of a honest wench like that and i should want to be the parson next and read the forty two generations and play the fort piano and i didn't know miss whether to laugh or cry so i began to eat an apple but father say quite slowly sister muxworthy you was never gifted with no eddication no more nor i jan uxtable and how be us to know if it be good or bad once i had a horse say father as afore ever he went into the field turned up his nose at the grass like and with turning up so much he died at last of the glanders but i never see that there horse persuade the others to starve aunt muxworthy toss her head and we thought she wouldn't eat no goose but the smell of the stuffing and the weather was too many for her and she eat a wing and a leg and one side of the breast and it do her good and afore she had had much brandy john she say you was right and i was wrong let the little wench crack on and some day they'll hear of her to tother side of hexmoor so father laugh and kiss her and the chillers was put to bed and we drink your health miss and clara's nine times nine and father say he'll learn himself some day when he give up wrestling only he fear it would make his hand shake terrible and then some laugh and some of us cry and they has more hot water and beany dawe set to and make so many poems he turn the stairs somehow inside out and suke and tim was forced to heave him into the tallat and keep him from going abroad by a rope of onions round him and two truss of hay on the top next day he make no poems at all till he drink more than a gallon of cider oh miss clara dear what ever is the matter with you father be in such a taking i never see to day your letter come about selling that knob thing of beany dawe's and we knows it must be all along of the crown jewels you bought for us as we meant to keep in the family to the end of all our time mother double up and cry into the churn and spoil all the butter and father were that upset he stamp out of the house a trying hard to whistle and he couldn't see no one there to let it off on but timothy badcock and he were a little saucy so he toss tim up on the linhay roof and his legs come through the thatch and father was forced to ease him out with the pitchfork tim was stiff a bit in the evening and serve him right say mother for laughing so at the cornishers but father give him some neatsfoot oil and cider and we knew us couldn't hurt him because he be double jointed and if you please miss clara dear we would not stoop to ask beany dawe and he nothing but a sawing poet so father go to the old oak chest with the whitewash on it and pull it open without the key and take out some old rubbish he saith and order mother to pack it without a word and mother want to put in a pair of linen sheets and the best table cloth but father say quite crusty like do e take our miss clara for a common packman and when i say please father what shall i say about it all he answer me quite low how ever can i tell child ask your mother there only give my best respects and most humble duty and tell miss clara i wishes i could find a man to throw me all four pins for being such a drunken hosebird

thank him for the same i never want it yet i should like to see the cornisher as could stand my grip and then father pull both his hands out of his pockets mother say he wear them out he do spraddle both his thumbs so it seems a curious thing miss clara dear father never get vexed or weist like but what he want to wrestle and other times he never think of it unless it be to fair or revel time when i asked mother and said as father tell me to the tears was in her eyes and she try to look angry with me and then she broke out crying as loud as suke when the cow molly kick her so between the both of them miss i can't know what to say so please to make it yourself miss for i am sure i can't find any thing only the best love of our hearts and a side of bacon us would like to send and the

this here paper if you please miss clara dear there come now just a very fine spoken gentleman with a long coat the colour of udder and blue flaps and blue at the hands and ever so many great silver buttons with a print like pats of best butter and gold ribbon round his hat we seemed at first he be an officer of dragoons till we see'd the flour in his hair and then us knowed he was the queen's

mother and me to hold our noise the gentleman say something sound very much like dang and father hoped he would be saucy because then he send his buttons in spite of mother and me but when he look at father he think better of it and go off very civil in the carriage he come by only say he would find out in spite of us and please miss clara dear mother say she be ashamed to send you a parcel all rubbage except the pictures but she do hope they wont cheat you about them there for they be the finest ever come to these parts and warranted real london made all the farmers hereaway want to buy them of us and father say dang the pictures tell miss clara to come to us and her shan't want beany dawe's things nor the queen's miller either oh do come miss clara dear the banks be yellow with primroses and white and blue with violets and i know three blackbirds nests already and an ousel's down by the river oh do come i have got such a lot to tell you things as i can't make head or tail of when i try to spell them and you shall milk my own cow sally and have all my black hen's eggs and the ducks too if they hatch and sling all the small potatoes from the plough field to the hazel hedge your best scholar as ever was and loving pupil sally huxtable chapter xiv from sally's eager description of the coat and buttons i concluded easily that a servant from vaughan st mary had been sent in quest of me my father hated showy liveries and loathed hair powder but mr edgar vaughan returned to the family usages or rather allowed them to re establish themselves for on such questions he was wholly indifferent now what could be his motive for sending so expressly to discover me i knew not neither cared very greatly but wrote at once to tossil's barton first to return their loving contribution which consisted mainly of ancestral relics prized for generations secondly to set free the secret of my address into my own self i returned once more somehow i seem to expand whenever i come in contact with the yeoman's family and their lowly greatness i am like a worm when it rains after the drought of summer surely the god who leaves us to stifle ourselves with the dust of fashion and convention has his own gracious times to breathe upon and scatter it at intervals we may see through the reek of our own exuding and inhale a more bracing air than sleeps in mausoleums but instead of being exalted and fed by the open breeze we shudder at the draught and replace our respirators i returned into myself and found little comfort there i do not live inside myself as most people live in theirs true i am apt to resent any slight to it offered from the outside true i seek its keep and comfort in a mechanical sort of way but as for crusting in its bottle ripening in its husk rusting in its watch case i have been too long the toy of wind and weather not to be turned inside out never can i moulder into the fungoid nucleus the british taste admires and yet there is about me if i must not say within me a stanch cleaving a cohesion a concrete will which is of genuine anglo saxon fibre so i thrust aside all dreams of tossil's barton and vaughan park and certain wilder sweeter dreams which have begun to flutter and thrill through me and in earnest i return to my task of money making giudice still is faithful and comforts much my solitude he has never asked his master's leave or mine he has never received any formal invitation yet here he looks all at home sleek and unblushing though long since quite convalescent and equal to livery stable diet once indeed as we passed the entrance he pretended to me that his conscience pricked him to ease it he sniffed about and halted just for a moment then turned his nose up recocked his tail and trotted jauntily on since then he has always avoided that left side of the street he is affable still to isola but clearly regards her as no more than a pleasant acquaintance whenever she enters the room he walks from his corner with a stretch and a yawn sniffs all round her dress to learn where she has been and what dogs she has spoken to then in the absence of any striking discovery he looks into her face with a grave complacence and brings me his conclusion tom and the birds the squirrel and the little marmoset mrs shelfer's newest and dearest pet he gazes upon from a lofty standing as so many specimens of natural history interesting so far but otherwise contemptible he is now allowed free run of the house understands all the locks and presents himself in every room at the proper meal time even the little dress maker is then honoured with his attentions everybody loves him he is so gentle and clever and true back he comes to me with his mouth rather greasy i must admit gives me one kiss as a form i am afraid and exclaiming dear me what a life this is' sits down on his rug to think no one can tempt him further than the corner of our street except his master or myself miss flounce with my permission granted not without jealousy once aspired to the escort of giudice although she carried a bag of his favourite biscuits made perhaps of bone dust and kept one of them in her hand judy flattered her only to the corner then he turned abruptly and trotted firmly rudely she called it home with his eyes upon my balcony i gave him more of his biscuits than he would have got from her all this was very delightful but there were two sad drawbacks in the first place giudice expected me to forego every other line of art and devote all my time to portraiture of himself this was unreasonable and i could not do it apart from other considerations mr oxgall after buying three studies of him declined to take any more until those three should be sold to giudice himself i had based my refusal upon more delicate grounds i had quoted to him although lest i profane your hallowed part queen nature chills the blood around my heart sweet dog permit me to indulge my dream of country valleys and the mazy stream but he took no heed and never would permit me so to do without the keenest jealousy the other drawback was still more serious either by maintaining the dog i placed his owner under an obligation or by engrossing the dog's society i laid myself under obligation to his owner either view of the case was unpleasant the latter which i adopted soon became intolerable so i spoke about it to isola for i could not well explain myself to her brother who ought indeed to have perceived my dilemma oh donna she cried what nonsense you do talk obliged to us indeed i am sure we are all greatly obliged to you and many a stir it saves us at home for the dog detests papa so and when conrad comes to see us he can't bear to have judy shut out like a thief and he the most honourable dog that ever wagged a tail to be sure he is you know you are don't you oh combination of bayard and aristides that union of justice and chivalry wagged his tail to me and nodded gravely to isola but i have said all along that conny should pay for his board and he feels it too but we could not tell how to propose it to you dear donna you are so very outrageous i should hope so indeed and then i am sure it would break poor judy's heart to go wouldn't it now judy giudice did not answer her but came and laid his great head on my lap and looked up at me as only a dog can look in that wistful look he said as plainly as possible you know i am only a dog but you clara happen to be a human being and so you know all we dogs know and ever so much besides only you can't smell you can talk as fast as you like both to each other and to us but we can talk to none except our fellow dogs now don't take a mean advantage of me i know that i was made only to be your servant and i love you with all my heart that i do i can't tell at all where i shall go when i die or if i shall go anywhere and i am sure i shall die if you cast me away like this so i kissed his dotty whiskers and promised not to desert him though i should go all the way to the stables twice a day to see him and another thing clara dear resumed his master's sister i consider him now more my dog than conny's you know he was given between us this was the first time i heard of it and i only lent conrad my half as long as he liked to pay for him lovely isola like most other lovely girls was keen about money matters not that she was ungenerous that impulsive little mortal would give away all her substance the moment her heart was touched and it was not hard to touch despite all the quick suspicions which her london life and native shrewdness had now begun to produce but as regards small dealings she was thoroughly qualified to keep a meat pie shop or go upon board wages or even to take furnished lodging by which climax i mean no disrespect to mrs shelfer who considering her temptations is the very pink of honesty especially since giudice can as to these small matters and as to many large ones i was dear isola's cardinal opposite she would make for most men a far better wife than i should although she will never love with a tenth part of the intensity she can't even hate like me when i hate i loathe and abhor i never hate any one lightly and hardly ever am reconciled or suppress it isola talks about hating but has never learned what it means spite she can carry and nurse like a doll and count it a minor virtue albeit she cannot be sulky hate is too heavy a burden scorn which is with women the hate of things beneath them isola hardly knows perhaps she will learn it when her knowledge of the world narrows and condenses as with most women it does another great difference there is between isola and me although she never would think of deceiving any one seriously and would on no account tell a downright malicious lie yet she is not so particular about telling little fibs or at any rate colouring matters so highly that others are misled this she can justify to herself in a charming warm hearted way and yet she rarely makes mischief her departures are half unconscious and always arise from good will and so now clara dear concluded the senior sophist as conrad has owned all the dog so long it is my turn to own every bit of him for an equal period and i must pay you half a crown a week for his keep and half a guinea for doctoring him so well i was much inclined to take her at her word it would have been such a surprise but what a disgrace to giudice and to me oh donna she continued you have no idea how fond dear conny is of you i am getting so jealous he thinks much more of you than he does of me i bent over my drawing with more carmine on my cheeks than was on the palette what folly to be sure and isola would come round in front why don't you answer me clara did you ever know such a shame well i do believe you like being admired every bit as much as i do in spite of all your sublimity why there comes conny himself and to my great relief she stepped into the balcony i thought so i knew the ring of his heel he will wear such clumsy boots though his foot is as pretty as mine i always know his step and so does judy alas and so do i how weak and paltry of me with a life like mine before me i will go and open the door cries his sister how rude he is to come when you are so busy clara away she runs then ushers him grandly in and away again to nurse the marmoset i know that i look slightly discomposed there is a glow upon me as if i had stepped into sunlight conrad fails to notice it or conceals the perception he stands before my easel how i long for his approbation that of course is only from his knowledge of art and his native taste yet i fear to look at his face but wait for him to speak with a stretch like a windlass and a cavernous yawn up comes giudice and pokes himself right in front of my work could i have foreseen that effrontery and execrable taste less bread and milk would he have had for breakfast conrad perceives my vexation and despite his good breeding is too natural not to smile the smile is infectious and i obtain no more than a look of commendation but that is enough for me i resolve to keep the drawing mr oxgall may bid what he likes as our eyes meet conrad's and mine i see that he is not in his usual spirits something has happened to vex him oh that i dared to ask what it is i also am heavy at heart and ill at ease with myself is it any wonder my nature is true and straight forward as well as proud and passionate but here have i been for weeks and weeks stooping below its level i have even been deceitful perhaps there was no dishonour in my change of name with such an object in view perhaps there was good excuse for maintaining disguise with conrad when first we met in london but was it right and honourable to persist in my alias when i could not help suspecting his growing attachment to me peradventure my conscience alone would not account for all the misery i felt about this had i no selfish misgivings as well now as i stood before him my breast began to flutter with fear not so acute but deeper than my alarm in the dark when i crouched from the conspirators miss valence at last he began i am grieved in my heart by hearing that you were not treated at all politely last night he was greatly moved and began to lose his command of colloquial english i had spent an evening at the professor's house in lucas street the second time only of my being there now i came to recollect it dr ross had certainly been a little overbearing but i did not feel hurt thereby because i cared not for him and knew it to be his manner isola had told her brother but without meaning any harm her father no doubt had been vexed because i could not sell him my gordit oh mr ross i replied i think nothing at all of that a learned man like your father cannot be expected to bear with every ignorant girl's curiosity to a lady's love of knowledge every gentleman should administer and be gratified all men of lofty science enjoy to meet with a gentle mind inquiring it was not the first time master conrad had disparaged by implication his father's great acquirements to me it seemed scarcely graceful and very far from dutiful but many of my sentiments are dreadfully old fashioned an awkward pause ensued how could i answer without condemning one or the other though i could not quite acquit conrad my heart was entirely with him for i had long been aware that he was not happy at home there he stood with an angry countenance having declined the chair i had offered him suddenly he took both my hands and looked me full in the face though his eyes were glistening i gazed full at him with vague apprehensions rising how or why i know not but at that very moment my hair which is always a trouble to me fell in a mass down my cheeks and neck he started back but still held my hands i am made certain that i have seen you long ago i will think i will think i saw at once how it was the fear on my face reminded him i meant to tell him some day but i never meant him to find out scorning myself for a hypocrite i looked stedfastly at him and smiled you will forgive me miss valence you know that i would not use a freedom he saw in my eyes that i knew it and dropped my hands and went on you will think me the weakest in mind and most wicked but i am most unhappy i started in turn and how i longed to console him what use is pride if it cannot even command one's eyes it is to me a disgrace to come to you with my troubles but i do it from no unmanly temper i do it alone for the sake of my precious sister isola i have no longer any one whom i dare to love but her and now i am compelled to abandon her at the last do you mean to be long away this i managed to ask pretty well though it was sore work i shall not be away from london but i shall be departed from isola the house where she lives i am no more to visit a long time i have gone there only a little and alone to see her she is ordered now to come no more to me this day i spoke very violently but i will not detain you with that i will confess i did wrong but i was richly provoked my object in burdening you is double first to implore you if i may without using liberty to endure well with the professor lest she should be interdicted from coming to visit you and then she would have no one remaining to love her second to ask a thing that i hesitate because i cannot narrate to you all things whether you would indulge me if there is no wrong to come now and then to see my own and my only sister of course you do not mean without her father's knowledge i would never insult you miss valence by asking a thing like that i desire nothing of what you call clandestine you are so free and open you would never have to do with any sort of concealment neither am i in the habit to do anything like that it has only been commanded that i may not go there or invite her to come to my house the professor has great power in the present but he does not pretend to interdict me from my sister his eyes flashed as he spoke with an expression quite unfilial remembering how differently i had loved my own dear father i felt disappointed and grieved but had no right to show it only one more thing i will entreat of you miss valence poor isola has never learned what means any grief if she is vexed by this i pray you to sustain and comfort her for i shall never make a wrong advantage of your most kind permission so as to see her very often he raised my hand to his lips in gratitude for what he called a kindness beyond all value to him and his voice was trembling as he turned away but i had done no kindness i had given no permission for i was not calm enough to distinguish right from wrong strange indeed it seemed to me that i for the most part so decided could not now determine but was all perplexity my great iceberg self reliance built in bleak and lonesome years was now adrift and melting in the bright sun of friendship and the warm sea depths of love chapter xv isola happened that day to leave me before the usual time being afraid that her father who was not in his sweetest mood would be angry with her she was grieved of course at the new dissension and thought me her ideas were of loose texture somewhat to blame somehow nevertheless she soon forgave me the crime i had not committed that day i could paint no more but sat me down to meditate suddenly a loud ring and a louder knock echoed through the house quickly mrs shelfer's little feet came pattering up the stairs and her grey eyes actually seemed to come in first at the door on the crown of her head her black cap hung like the top of a chaise doubled back oh my good friend look here i was never so frightened in all my life she held as far from her as she could reach a closed envelope addressed miss clara vaughan i tore it open and read mr vaughan is dying come instantly sent by mrs fletcher telegraph my good soul cried mrs shelfer electric telegraph company all screams the wires red hot and you must sign the message he says and is there any answer and they give him eighteen pence oh dear i shall never get over it never had such a turn since my brother john went and they tucked him up so bootiful and i said to the clerk at barbican out of my way if you please let me sign the form and leave me alone a minute there is no answer should i go or not bitterly as i disliked him could i let him die among hirelings and strangers i his brother's daughter a year ago i would have done so and thought it the judgment of god now i remembered my dear mother's death and doubted about going only because i knew not how he would take it my hesitation was very brief a cab was ordered giudice entrusted to mrs shelfer's care a short note left for isola a few things put together anyhow and i was ready to start even in this hurry a selfish terror smote me and i cautioned mrs shelfer strictly to conceal both name and destination she had only to say that some relative was suddenly taken ill somewhere down in the country the country being to her mind a desert marked with milestones my description did not seem unreasonably vague as i stood in the passage waiting for the cab the poor dog who had been quite flurried and scented indefinite evil commenced prolonged and would not conclude a howl of passing sadness oh my good friend cried mrs shelfer let me stop the cab all waste of money to go the good gentleman whoever he is is as dead as a crabshell now there was a terrier with a split ear next door but one when my poor brother john was ill his name was jack i think no tom bless me no what am i thinking of bob charley knows i dare say well send me his name by telegraph here's the cab mrs shelfer heavy thumps of weary wambling feet grating of wheels a needless whoa and we open the door giudice bolts first into the cab and sitting upright with his tongue out and a sprightly pant occupies the whole it takes the united strength address and authority of cabman landlady and myself to get him out again then he coils his tail to his stomach droops his ears and eyes and receiving two hot tears and a kiss is sidled and deluded into the narrow passage the last thing i hear is a howl that winds far round the corner and beyond the square in an hour and a half from the delivery of the message i was in a second class carriage and we shrieked away from paddington the hurry and rush overcame me for a while soon the april evening was spread with shadowy gray and we were rushing past the wooded waves of pangbourne and casting silver rings of steam on the many fingered spruce before i could collect and feel my thoughts again as we glided through plantations and between the winding hills with the partridge beginning his twilight call the pheasants come out of the coppice to feed and the late rook plying his dusky wings at length the dust and city turmoil lagged round the corner miles away and we sparkled in the dewy freshness of the silent moon though all alone in the carriage i vainly tried for prudence' sake to creep into the cloak of sleep every vein and every pore was full of gushing thrilling electric life the country the country the heavenly country's glory how had i breathed and groped in the city grave so long for every thought that dribbled there and guttered in my brain a hundred thousand now flow through me not of brain but soul thoughts i cannot call them for there is no volition neither have they sequence impress or seen image only a broad stream gliding whence and whither i know not how can i describe to others what i cannot tell myself glost' glost' change here for chelt'm c broke my dreaming suddenly it was eleven at night i had come unwrapped the heavenly country and nature's tide forgot to keep me warm out i came upon the platform and dreamily began to seek my carpet bag for i had no heavy luggage the moon was struggling with the gas lights as nature in me fought with modern life fly miss fly the lonely porter asked yes please said i where for miss vaughan st mary at this part of my life i dropped the grand vaughan park it seemed too fine for me and i was well content to be of conrad's class in the world oh there's a carriage waiting at every train if you please miss and with tenfold politeness the porter showed me across the square to one of the family hearses which my father and i so detested it so happened that the driver and footman were taking some light refreshment at the bar of a neighbouring edifice while the horses champed their bits and whinnied the men came out against their will and stared at me in the broad moonshine i was very simply plainly and cheaply dressed in deep mourning still for my darling mother but no servant of even slight experience could take me i think for anything but a lady little as it matters the men were half drunk very surly at being disturbed and inclined to form a low estimate of my dress and carpet bag you mean to say you be miss vaughan young 'ooman stuttered the reeling coachman with his hands beneath his flaps and a short pipe in his mouth now i tell you plainly there's no mistake about me mind i can't noway credit it it don't seem likely do it bob likely jacob yes like enough to a fool but nohow creditable to the like of us think i don't know now perhaps the young 'ooman will answer a few questions jacob ah let you alone let you alone bob specially for young women porter a cab at once if you please or a fly i think you call it here oh my london impudence to be sure miss the best in gloucester directly and miss confidentially if i was in your shoes i'd walk them chaps about their business to morrow how they have been carrying on here to be sure ever since the six o'clock train come in why in the time of the old squire vaughan thank you the fly if you please in two minutes i was off for my father's home with mighty rattle of glass and many jerking noises about three miles from gloucester we were passed by jacob and robert who were sitting side by side and driving furiously convinced at last by the porter of my genuine vaughanship they had set off full speed to secure first audience at length we passed the lodge where the gates creaked as of yore and dear old whitehead trembled at my voice and so along the great avenue where i had studied the manners and ways of every tree and where tulip nestor among deer came to stare at us with his grey face silver in the moonlight poor old friend he knew me as well as giudice did but i could not stop to talk to him soon as the bell was rung the broad bolt of the great lock which i was once so proud to draw flew back with suspicious promptitude albeit he had changed the cloth too ochrously described by sally for a suit of gentle gray and had drawn out his face to a most unjovial length and assumed an attitude of very profound respect there he was quite unmistakeable to observant eyes the bacchanalian bob and please miss after he had fussed awhile what train did you please to come by i understand that the carriage has been waiting there all day indeed i saw it come back from the pantry window myself and they said in the yard the last train was in afore they come away i came by the train that ought to be there at half past ten o'clock well to be sure that must be the very train as samuel and humphry said they waited for but they never has much judgment them two men and to let you come in a common fly miss i saw my father's carriage at the station and two low looking servants quite tipsy their names however were not samuel and humphry but jacob and robert strange servants now came thronging round with an obsequiousness so long unknown that it quite disgusted me no familiar face among them none whom i could bring myself to ask how my guardian was but from their servility to me i concluded that his time was short will you step into the small drawing room if you be so kind miss there is a good fire there miss and a lady waiting for you thank you take my things to my own little room if you please that is if you know which room was called mine tilly knows miss i'll run and fetch tilly cried the officious bob if matilda jenkins is still here let her answer my bell as long as i remain and therewith i was shown into the room where the lady was expecting me she sat with her back to the door and i could only see that she was richly attired in full evening dress there was a powerful smell of vinegar in the room and two pastiles were burning as i walked round the table she rose with some reluctance and i confronted mrs daldy chapter xvi we stood for a moment examining each other she was fattening nicely on what she called holy converse and spiritual outpourings at cheltenham she rushed forward with great enthusiasm why clara darling is it possible can this be you so grown and improved in every way i never should have known you i do declare why you have quite a brilliant colour and your eyes and your hair oh dear how proud your sweet mother would have been you lovely creature i must have a kiss what not even your pretty hand no mrs daldy never more my hand to a person who dared to insult my father me you might have insulted a thousand times and i would have forgiven you come now let bygones be bygones that's a dear oh for a little more of the essence of christianity let us stoop to the hem of the garment of the meek and lowly i will not write the sacred name she used let us poor grovelling fellow sinners don't couple me with yourself i beg i was losing my temper and she saw her advantage not even as a sinner dear i thought in my humility that we all were sinners so we are but not all hypocrites she kept her temper wonderfully in all except her eyes ah you impetuous young people cannot understand the chastened lowly heart which nothing but heavy trials and the grace of god produce you know clara you never could this last truth was put in the form of an exclamation and in such a different tone from the rest moreover it was so true that i could hardly help smiling since last i saw you i have been tried severely and chastised most heavily i bow to the rod all works together for our spiritual good until that blessed day when all the sheaves mrs daldy i as well have seen and suffered much since last we met if i could not be hoodwinked then by this sham religion is it likely that i can be now i wonder that you waste your time so the truth was that she talked in this strain less from hope than habit then if i must treat you miss vaughan but as a sister worldling let us at least combine for providence has seen fit to make our interests the same how so i was doing my utmost to bear with her awhile first before i tell you anything have you as keen an eye for the perception of your own sweet interest as for the discovery of what you kindly call 'hypocrisy' ah well it is all for my good her rolling compendious eyes glistened at the thought that she was about to catch me here i pretended to be caught already what of it if i have then i will tell you something sit down by me clara thank you i will stand now first before i tell you anything we must make some little arrangement for our mutual benefit and then resolve upon united action you must give me one little pledge that being done i will tell you everything and it is of the last importance to you is it about my father' no it has nothing to do with him it is about your uncle who now lies at the door of death all it is all for the best there is i fear no chance of his recovery and the disposal of this splendid property is in our hands if we know how to play our cards and if we act together but there is no time to be lost only think l a year for it is now worth every farthing of that besides this beautiful place why clara all the pleasures of life will be at our feet in her greedy excitement she forgot all her piety but i liked her better so in a moment she saw that she had laid her wicked heart too open in my eyes there was no co partner flash of avarice what is the matter with my poor uncle first a paralytic stroke since that low gastric fever and entire prostration do you remember when you came to your dear mother's funeral of course i do and could you help observing how altered he was even then the hour he heard of her death he was seized with violent illness yet he would go out of doors alone on the very day of the funeral something then excited him he came home worse and in the night was visited with a slight paralytic stroke however he quite recovered the use of his limbs for a time though never his former spirits if we can call them spirits for several months he went about as usual except that instead of a horse he rode a quiet pony he saw to the property received the michaelmas rents and invested large sums of money both in land and the funds he even commenced some great improvements for he has always been as you know a most skilful and liberal steward and manager that i never denied there could not be a better one but suddenly after no christmas festivities for he would hear of none for the sake of your dear mother he was found on the morning of the last day in the year bolt upright in his study chair and fully dressed with two pistols loaded and cocked on the table no sign of life in his face or pulse his body stiff yet limp like a sand bag tightly stuffed the man who found him described it better than i can 'poor master whichever way i put him there he stop like a french dog doing tricks'' how terrible yes but it was true at first they thought it was catalepsy only but when that passed off paralysis remained i wanted to send for you at once here she met for she could not help it but did not answer my gaze and i knew it was a lie however i was over ruled and your poor uncle lay bed ridden but in no actual danger until this horrid low fever came he must have a frame of iron to have borne up as he has the doctor says this fever is partly from the prostration of the nerves who is the doctor i felt almost as if i could love my uncle a very eminent man his name is churchyard that is not our old medical man where does this gentleman come from cheltenham i believe surely you must know that if he is an eminent man living there yourself i saw that she had brought him well she answered sharply it matters little where he comes from and i have not verified his residence i fear all the doctors in europe could not save your poor dear uncle and here from habit when death was thought of she fell into the hypocritical vein once more ah how true it is the thing that will most avail him now when his poor sinful frame is perishing and the old man with all its works thank you i know all that which room does my uncle occupy surely you never would think of disturbing him at midnight does death look what o'clock it is if he is really dying i must see him at once she seemed resolved to prevent me i was determined to do it it is needless to tell all her stratagems and needless to say unless i have failed to depict myself that they proved utterly vain i was only surprised that she did not come with me chapter xvii how vast the rooms appeared to me how endless the main passages after the dimensions long familiar at tossil's barton and mrs shelfer's i even feared to lose the way where my childish feet had measured every step first i hurried to my own snug room or rooms for i had parlour and bedroom adjoining in the western wing where mother used to live everything there was in beautiful order a lamp and a good fire lighted and matilda jenkins met me at the door directly after our departure for devonshire mr vaughan had thought fit to discharge all the old servants except the housekeeper and matilda they were all in league against him for they could not bear that the rightful owners whom they had known so long should be ejected moreover his discipline was far more stern than ours for my father and mother had always ruled by love the housekeeper a great friend of mine was retained from respect and policy and poor tilly who entered life through a dust bin from contempt of her insignificance by that time she had risen to the rank of scullery maid and deputy dishwasher now she had climbed in the social scale to the position of under housemaid why matilda how well you look and how smart i declare you are getting quite tall i suppose the new times agree with you better than the old oh don't say that miss clara please don't i'd tear the gownd off my back looking savagely at the neat print if i thought it make you think that no i gets a little more wages but a deal more work and i never gets a kind word oh it does my heart good to see you here again in your own house miss clara dear and evil to them as drove you out and she lifted the corner of her new white muslin apron and i have tended your rooms all myself though it wasn't in my part and never let no one else touch them ever since i was took from the kitchen and always a jug full of flowers miss because you was so fond of them thank you matilda how kind of you to be sure many's the time i've cried over them miss and the new shilling you give me when we was little girls together but please to call me 'tilly' miss the same as you always used i can't stop to talk to you now tilly how is mrs fletcher quite hearty miss all but the rheumatics ah she do suffer terrible from them us both waited up miss and i to and fro the door till the carriage come home and then she went off to bed and i was up with her and never knowed when you come but she's getting up now miss to come here to see you go and stop her at once i will see her to morrow stop show me first your master's room knock gently and bring out the nurse the doctor is gone i believe yes miss he left here at eight o'clock for he had a long way to drive and he couldn't do nothing more but you must not go miss oh pray miss don't go there we went along the passage until we came to the door i was surprised to see a new door across the lobby very closely fitted there was an inner door also and the nurse did not seem very wakeful instead of knocking again matilda retreated hastily at last the nurse appeared and i found her to be a very respectable woman who had been with my mother through several attacks of illness a dark suspicion which i had scarcely confessed to myself was partly allayed hereby after whispering for a few moments she led me into the dimly lighted room and to my uncle's bed i started back in terror prepared as i was for a very great change what i saw astounded me the face so drawn and warped aside withered and yet pulpy with an undercast of blue the lines of the mouth so trenched and livid that the screwed lips were like a bull's eye in a blue diamond pane and the hair so dark and curly when last i saw him now shredded in patches of waxy gray the only sign of life i saw was a feeble twitching of the bed clothes every now and then the poor eyes were closed hard and wrinkled round one wasted arm lay on the quilt the hand bent up at the wrist the fingers clutched yet flabby and as cold as death it was a sight for human pride to cower at and be quelled is he like this always no she replied but he has been so now for ten hours and more generally he is taken with pain and thirst every six hours and it makes my heart ache to hear him moan and cry does he say anything particular then god knows i was not pursuing my own fell purpose in asking this thank him i was not such a fiend as that all i wished was to relieve him whom i pitied so yes he opens his eyes and stares and then he always says and he tries to shake his head only he isn't strong enough 'my fault ah me my fault and to rob them too if i could but see her if i could but see her and die' he always says that first and then that exhausts him so he can hardly say 'water' after and then he moans so melancholy and then he goes off again the tears stood in her eyes for she had a tender heart i burst into my usual violent flood for i never have any half crying have you any medicine to give him no miss no more he has taken a shopful already though he can only swallow at the time he wakes up the doctor said to night he could do no more this awful black fever must end in mortification no medicine moves it at all did the doctor call it black fever yes the very worst form of typhus of the real irish type such as they have had once or twice in manchester it has settled most on the stomach but all the blood is poisoned and she sprinkled herself and the bed again with disinfecting fluid and threw some over me excuse me miss you wouldn't allow me so i am bound not to ask you you know you came in dead against my will and dead against all orders this was what the whispering had been about and if anything happens to you miss vaughan who is to have all the property but that bad mrs daldy oh in a moment i saw the whole though it was too black for belief blacker than any fever that festers the human heart this was the purpose with which that woman had sent for me she had lied to me as to the character of the disease she had opposed me because she knew it the surest way to urge me she had brought me too at night when fevers are doubly infectious you see miss we are forced to keep the three windows open and the passage doors all closed it's a wonder i had any of the fluid left for they never sent it up this afternoon but i had a drop put by no thanks to them for the same mrs daldy brought the first nurse but she ran clean away when the fever took the turn and they were forced to send for me for nobody else would come near him but my poor old man has no work and i've minded as bad a case as this and they say i be fever proof but you miss you i should never forgive myself if anything happened to you and in your youth and bloom though i could not stop you you know i did my best and they say you catch things most when you come off a journey jane whatever happens you are not to blame i have no fear whatever and now i am here i will stay it is safer so both for myself and others well miss so i have heard say once in for it keep to the air but come into this little room if you want to talk to me miss we can hear the poor gentleman move or even sigh and the air is a little fresher there but we must keep the window open she led me into the dressing room but even there the same crawling creeping smell pervaded as if a grave had been opened when the ground was full of gas instead of talking to the nurse i began to think it broke upon me vaguely that i had heard of some very simple remedy for a fever of this nature and that my dear mother who in her prosperous times was the village doctoress had been acquainted with the case but in the whirl of my brain i could not bring to mind what it was oh what would i give only to think of it now though not i am sorry to say at all of a pious turn at least if mrs daldy is so in the strong feeling of the moment i fell upon my knees and prayed for help so had my mother taught me and mother nature taught me now i will not be so daring as to say that my prayer was answered perhaps it was only that it calmed my mind jane have they been brewing lately alas the bathos but i can't help it yes miss last thursday and friday they won't let me go near the kitchen part but i know it all the same go and get me a nice jug of fresh yeast i will watch your master she stared and hesitated but saw that i was in earnest i don't know where to find it miss and none of them will come near me and they'll stop me too if they can why they won't bring my food to the door but put it half way down the passage they wanted to lock me in only i wouldn't stand that and they break all the plates and dishes and to day they sent word that my dinner must come in at the window to morrow low cowards and zanies now find the yeast jane if you have to search for an hour they must all be gone to bed now except matilda jenkins and she dare not stop you if you say you have my orders bless you miss she'll run away as if i was a ghost then call to her that i say she must go to bed directly after a few more words jane went her way stealthily like a thorough bred thief and i was left alone with my poor dying uncle wonderful as it seemed to me i felt now a tender affection for him i the resolute the consistent the bitter clara vaughan even if he had told me that moment that he had plotted my father's death i would have perilled my life for his because i should have known that he was sorry yet i was full of cold fear lest he should awake to consciousness and utter that awful cry while i alone was with him in the dead hour of night sooner than i expected the nurse came back with a jug of beautiful yeast smelling as fresh as daybreak we put it outside the window on the stone sill to keep it cool and airy she had seen no one except matilda who was waiting for me and crying dreadfully predicting my certain death and her own too if she should have to attend me she kept at a most respectful distance from jane and with all her affection was glad to be clear of me for the night for nearly two hours the nurse and i sat watching with hardly a spoken word except that i asked one question how often has mrs daldy been to see my uncle she would hardly leave his bedside until the fever declared itself since then she has not been once broad awake at that strange hour and in that strange way i began to pass through the stereoscope of my brain the many strange slides of my life of all of these the last for the moment seemed the strangest suddenly we heard a low feeble moan running into the bedroom there we saw the poor sick one with his eyes wide open vainly attempting to rise i put my arms around him and raised him on the pillow he tried to say 'thank you' for he was always a gentleman in his manners then he gazed at me with hazily wondering eyes then he opened his mouth in a spasmodic way and began that bitter cry ere he closed his mouth again i poured well into his throat a table spoonful of yeast handed to me by jane to my great pleasure it glided beyond the black tongue and i gave him two more spoonfuls while he was staring at me with a weak and rigid amazement no water jane not a drop of water it will work far better alone he doesn't know what it is and he thinks he has had his water keep him thirsty that he may take more as he lay thus in my arms i felt that one side was icily cold and the other fiery hot his face looked most ghastly and livid but there was not that mystical gray upon it like the earth shine on the moon which shows when the face of man is death's mirror and the knee of death on man's heart in a minute he slid from my grasp down on the pillow again and with a long drawn sigh became once more stiff and insensible my hope was faint indeed but still it was hope if he had hope's vitality he might yet be saved the rest of that night was passed by the nurse and myself in heavy yet broken sleep jane assured me that there was no chance of my poor uncle becoming conscious again for at least six hours i was loth to forego my watch and argued that the dose we had given might cut short this interval but lo while i kept repeating at weary and weary periods that i could do no harm since the physician gave up and i might do good sleep the lover of repetition laid his hand alike on my formula and myself dear judy's howl was in my dream and mrs shelfer's never ceasing prattle chapter xviii cold and fresh was the morning air and the open window invited the sounds of country life who could think of fever with the bright dew sparkling on the lawn the lilac buds growing fat enough to claim their right of shadow the pleasant ring of the sharpening scythe and the swishing sweep of the swathe from the stable yard round the corner came the soothing hiss of the grooms the short stamp of the lively steed i fancied i knew my own favourite lilla and the gruff stand still mare wull'e far down the avenue whistled the cowboy waddle footed on his way to the clover leys or the milkmaid sung with the pail on her hip and the deer came trooping and stooping their horns along was it not one of my own pet robins who hopped on the window sill peered bravely at himself in the jug and tried to remember the last of his winter notes but it is cold jane very cold indeed and we have never been to bed and now the mowers have descried us why do they stop their work and shake their heads together so and keep outside the ranunculus bed and agree that the grass beneath our windows does not require cutting why if they were papists they would cross themselves and that saves many an oath but the grass does want cutting jane it cannot have been cut for a week i will call to them no it might disturb my uncle there is no sound from the bed room yet all deep and deadly silence i will go and see there my patient lies just as when i saw him first except that i have arranged the wreck of his hoary locks and applied a lotion to his temple on the burning side and yet now i look closer the face is not quite so livid or is it the difference between the candle light and the morning ray even while i looked he started up as if my eyes revived him he did not moan or cry but opened wide his filmy eyes and gazed feebly and placidly at me for a time he did not know me then a great change gradually crept through his long faltering gaze fearing the effects of excitement upon him i tried to divert his attention by another good dose of yeast three times he took it with resignation like a well trained child but his eyes all the time intent on me presently they began to swim and swerve the effort of the faint blood tissued brain and the exertion of swallowing had been too much for his shattered powers he fell off again into the comatose state but with a palpable difference the pulse which had throbbed on the hot side only could now be felt most feebly moving in the other wrist and the tension of the muscles was relaxed circulation was being restored and balanced and the breathing could now be traced short as it was and irregular i have not time to describe all the symptoms of gradual improvement and i have not the medical knowledge needful to do so clearly enough that the six hour interval was shortened that day by half that the breathing became more regular and a soft perspiration broke through the clogged and clammy pores jane wanted to second this by an additional blanket but i feared to allow it in a case of so utter prostration when the perspiration was over then i prescribed the blanket for fear of a chill reaction at every return of consciousness our patient made an effort to speak but i hushed him with my hand on his lips and he even managed to smile when he found that i would be obeyed in the evening he tried to open his arms to me and then tried to push me away in some faint recollection of the nature of his disorder to me the interest was so intense and the delight so deep that if i had lost him now it would surely have broken my heart at sunset of that day as nurse and i sat near the dressing room window watching the slant rays flickering on the sward and the rooks alighting and swinging over their noisy nests a black cloud hung for a moment just above the sun a black cloud with a vivid edge of gold it tempered the light in a peculiar manner and seemed to throw it downwards peering through my fingers at it for it was very beautiful i saw a whitish mist or vapour steaming and hovering above the disk of the setting sun between my eyes and that golden marge i wondered what this could be there was no heat to cause strong evaporation nor any mist or dewy haze about nor was the sun drawing water but what i saw was like that trembling twinkle of the air which we often observe on a meadow footpath in the hot forenoon of july i drew jane's attention to it not expecting any solution but just for something to say dear me miss don't you know what that is i see it every evening it will be twice as plain when the sun goes down and then it will be quite white well what is it why can't you tell me is everything here a secret i was rather irritable but vexed with myself for being so too much excitement and too little sleep were the causes no miss there's no secret at all about that every one knows what that is it's only the scum that rises through the grass from the arched pool that takes all the drains of the house some of the arch fell in they say and the ground shakes when they mow it they are afraid to roll there is it possible and you knew it a practised nurse like you did my uncle know it i am sure miss i can't tell most likely not or he would have had it mended he hates things out of repair but it can't do any harm with the mould and the grass above it can't it indeed and you can see it rise shut all the bedroom windows in a moment jane i'll shut this she thought my wits were wandering from what i had gone through nevertheless she obeyed me it happened that i had attended at isola's urgent request one lecture of the many delivered by dr ross she forgot what the subject was to be it proved to be an unsavoury and unlady like one mephitis isola wanted to run away but i have none of that nonsense about me when human life is concerned and listened with great attention and even admiration for he handled the matter eloquently and well now jane throw all the doors open and the lobby window that looks in the other direction when do you think it will be possible to move our poor patient from these rooms the air here is deadly poison well i'm sure miss and he couldn't have a nicer nor a more airy room and all my things in order too and so handy and so many cupboards out of this poison he must go when can he be moved well miss he might be moved to morrow if we could only get plenty of hands and do it cleverly surely we can have plenty of hands there used to be twenty five servants here and i have not heard that my uncle has lessened the number no miss but save and keep us we shan't get one of them here nonsense i will have them or they leave the house of course i won't peril their lives we shall only want two or three and they may take a bath of disinfecting stuff with all their clothes on before they come and they may smoke all the while the nurse laughed grimly and shook her gray head and we will fumigate jane fumigate tremendously surely englishmen have more self respect than to be such babies and you a woman and i a girl shaming them out of face it doesn't matter miss they won't come i know them well the lot i mean that are in the house now very well jane we'll have gamekeeper hiatt and his eldest son they are men i know and if that is not enough we'll send to gloucester for thomas henwood but why don't you open the lobby door as i told you if you please miss i can't they have fastened it outside do you mean to say that they have dared to lock us in indeed i do miss we have been fastened in since the morning and pray why did you not tell me' because i feared to excite you miss i know your temper when you are wronged ever since you was that high and in this fever air excitement is sure to kill you brutes but i suppose they don't know it they know it well at least the master spirit does and for that very reason i will crush my indignation since i was that high jane i have passed through much tribulation and have dropped my lady heiress tone i can now command myself then miss i will show you what they sent this morning round the handle of the coffee jug i was afraid to let you see it before she gave me a twist of paper on which was written as follows for the safety of the household mrs fletcher orders that the persons in the fever room be allowed no communication with the other servants the intercepting door is fastened because a most sinful un christian act was perpetrated last night due supplies will be delivered once a day at am no empty vessels and no correspondence received any attempt to break these rules will be punished by suspension of supplies servants are forbidden to come beneath the sick room windows may the lord have you in his keeping in his tender mercy according to his holy will you are requested to read philippians i inclusive there are three holy bibles on the drawers and dressing tables when i had read this and perceived by the blasphemy at the end that it could proceed from no other than that awful woman i confess that my spirit was cowed within me not from selfish fear nor yet from the taming of passion but from the lowering thought that i belonged to the same race of being as the author of such satanity presently i became too indignant to speak or even think it added if that were possible to my indignation that i had seen her leave the house about nine o'clock that morning in our best close carriage she kept the windows up until she was past the lawn and the light iron gates beyond the arcade of roses then at the first turn in the avenue she let down the glass and gracefully kissed her hand to me i did not believe however that she was gone back to cheltenham with so much at stake in our house and depending on her direction she would surely stop in the neighbourhood if only to watch the course of events sooner than i dared to expect i regained the command of myself horror within me was stronger than wrath and stronger than either became the resolve to survive and win there can be no god i exclaimed in my presumptuous ignorance if this scheme of the devil is permitted to triumph first i tried the door which severed us from the rest of the house my uncle's rooms were in the western wing very near those which my dear mother had occupied and not very far from my own they formed one floor of the western gable the three bedroom windows and that of the dressing room looked to the west while the great lobby window from which i had seen mrs daldy's departure looked southward along the avenue the curve of which could be seen also from the bedroom windows an oaken door at the end of the main passage cut off the rooms in this storey of the gable from all the rest of the house this door jane had left locked from the inside fearing lest others should lock her in as they had threatened to do but now we found that a strong iron bolt had been fixed upon the outside while we were asleep in the morning and that we had no chance of forcing it next i asked jane whether she thought that the house now mrs daldy was gone would be still in the hands of our enemies would not mrs fletcher at once re assert her authority might not matilda jenkins be expected to fly to the rescue the nurse knowing all the politics of the servants' hall assured me that there was no hope of either of these events robert a drunken wesleyan turned out of the sect in cheltenham was mrs daldy's lieutenant and would take all care of matilda to whose good graces he had been making overture as for mrs fletcher she was probably in the same plight as ourselves from what i heard about robert i began to believe that he had private orders to disown me at the station for the double purpose of yielding a tit bit of insolence and warning of my arrival however that mattered very little but out of those rooms i must get either by door or by window and that too without delay do they expect to triumph so easily over clara vaughan and in her father's house the windows were about twenty feet from the ground as nearly as i could guess and the rooms beneath were empty at once i resolved to attempt an escape that way and to do so before the moon which was southing now should shine on the western aspect good jane was terrified at the thought and then upon my persisting implored me to let her make the attempt if it must be made at all now jane no more if you please we can't waste time about that you have a husband partly dependent upon you and several children to think of for me nobody cares but i hoped somebody did and you know i am far more active and much lighter than you are help me out with the feather bed the little bed in the dressing room which she had to sleep on was speedily brought to the window and dropped just underneath it it fell upon the grass with a pleasing and quiet flop then the two strong bell ropes already cut down and plaited together were tied round the bars of the double window sashes the lower sash being thrown up to the full extent the glass pressed quietly out with a pair of wet towels and the splinters removed so as not to cut the rope the latter still failed to reach more than half way to the ground but i would venture the drop if i could only descend so far after winding a linen sheet around my body and dress with the end tied round one ankle so as to leave me free use of my limbs i sat upon the window sill in the broad shadow and calculated my chances should i begin the descent with face or with back to the wall face to the wall i resolved on for though i should have to drop backward so yet what i feared most of all was having the back of my head crushed against the house next to this i dreaded a sprain of the ankle but all our family are well knit and straight in the joint so i launched myself off beginning as gently as could be jane having firm hold of one hand until i was well on the voyage though not well versed in calisthenic arts i got on famously almost as far as the end of the rope keeping away from the wall by the over saling of the window sill and the rapid use of my feet then i rested a moment on a projecting ledge called i believe a stringing course and away hand below hand again but i struck my knuckles terribly against that stringing course and very nearly lost hold from the pain of the blow then bending my body forward i gave one good push at the wall and shutting both eyes i believe let go the rope altogether backward i fell and rolled over upon the feather bed i was not even stunned but feared for a moment to try if my limbs were sound there i sat and stripped off the winding sheet presently up i got and in my triumph alas could not help crying all right hurrah like a foolish little child in a moment i saw that my cry had been heard where it should not have been a rapid flitting of lights along the lower windows and in the stableyard and i knew that chase would be given but after leaving my father's house in such a dignified manner was it likely that i would give in and be caught now clara you could beat all your nurses in running off and away like the wind away i went full speed towards the shade of the avenue while jane had the wit to scream out of the window help help here's the house on fire this made some little diversion i had a capital start and it was but half a mile to the lodge where old whitehead lived once there i should care for nobody i must have escaped very easily for my feet seemed as swift as a deer's but as my luck would have it the light iron gates between the lawn and the park were fastened what on earth should i do i saw men running across the lawn and what was worse they saw me in vain i pulled at the gates they rattled but would not yield had i owned true presence of mind i should have walked boldly up to the men and dared them to touch me fresh from the fever room in the flurry of the moment i never thought of that but darted into the shrubbery and crouched among thick laurels presently i heard them rush down the main drive and begin the search with some heavy swearing two of them came to the very clump i was hiding in and pushed a pitchfork almost into my side but the stupid fellows had lanterns which blinded them to the moonlight on they went with grumblings and growlings which told me exactly where to shun them judging at length from the silence that the search had passed to the right i slipped from my tangled lair and glided away to the left beyond the shrubbery spring where a little gate as i knew led to a glade in the park the deep ha ha which i had feared to jump in the dark because of the loose stones at the bottom was here succeeded by a high oak paling and probably through that gate had come the murderer of my father with a cold shudder at the remembrance i stole along through the shadowy places and had almost reached the little gate when i saw two of the searchers coming straight towards me to the right of me was the park paling on the left a breastwork of sod which i could not climb without being clearly seen to fly was to meet the enemy should i yield and be baffled after all insulted too most likely for i knew that the men were tipsy in my hand was the tightly wound sheet used as a rope to confine my dress i had folded it short and carried it on the chance of its proving useful in a moment i was under the palings in deep shadow with the white sheet thrown around me falling from my forehead and draped artistically over the right arm stock still i stood against the black boards and two great coils of long black hair flowed down the winding sheet the men came up tired of the chase and grumbling and by their voices i knew them for my good friends jacob and bob suddenly they espied a tall white figure of tremendous aspect they stopped short both tongue and foot and i distinctly heard their teeth chatter with a slow and spectral motion i raised my draped white arm and fetched a low sepulchral moan down fell the lantern and with a loud yell away went the men as hard as their legs could carry them laughing heartily i refolded my sheet and taking the short cut across the park to the lodge where old whitehead lived arrived without having met even my old friend tulip the old man in hot indignation drew forth his battered musket for he had once been in the militia and swore that he would march upon the rogues at once instead of that i sent him for the two hiatts and the village constable and soon without invitation half the village attended with my torn dress tucked up by good mrs whitehead and a hat on my head newly bought for her clean little grandchild i set forth again in the moonlight at the head of a faithful army to recover my native home hiatt easily opened the gate which had defied my flurried efforts and we presented ourselves at the main entrance a force that would frighten a castle it is needless to say that we carried all before us the state of siege was rescinded mrs fletcher and tilly set free all the ringleaders turned away neck and crop and what was far more important my poor uncle removed without being conscious of it to a sweet and wholesome room the sturdy gloucestershire yeomen scorned all idea of danger tired with all my adventures before i slept that night still near my uncle's bed two reflections came dreamily over my mind the first was a piece of vanity ah mrs daldy you little know clara vaughan the second was dear me how conrad would be astonished at this and how strange that his father should thus have saved my uncle's life for he must have died if left in that noisome room clara vaughan book iv chapter i before that week was over my uncle could sit up in bed for a short time every day being duly propped in a downy nest of pillows one arm however remained quite impotent and part of one side rigid and numb his recovery was slow and tedious as might well be expected with one who had been dragged not from the jaws but the very throat of death for a long time also his mind was feeble and dim a mirror overcast by the vapours of the body to me who am fond of observing in my own little childish way it was interesting as well as delightful to note how day by day the mind and body hand in hand rose stronger more than all was i taught and humbled in my own conceit by taking heed how tardily came back the power to guide and control the imagination that object glass of the mind not achromatic even in first rate intellects had long been out of the focal distance from the lens of reason's eye upon it had been glancing loose distorted images rendered home imperfectly if at all to the retina of the brain herein its state was the very opposite to that of my own phrenoscope i have no large imagination but the images it presents are vivid and i see well round them every one of them is not cast but cut on my sensorium whether i can strike them off in words whether my telegraph can print its message is quite another question and beside its purpose having rendered home to me the idols oftentimes inverted though distinct it leaves expression and judgment to do their best with the copyright now both in fabric and in mould my uncle's mind was different naturally his powers were far superior but he seemed to take no pride in them no dark and settled purpose had ever thrown its shadow and even its weight upon them nor had they felt so far as i knew the rough grasp of adversity therefore they were longer in recovering from the blow than i think my own would have been there were few things among the many desired by mrs daldy which she failed to reconcile with her strong sense of religion there is not one i have heard her say not one of the things we believe to be for our good which we should scruple to lay before the throne of grace even the throbbings of that little unregenerate heart clara vaughan's to wit who had kicked her that morning quite by accident of course even they are known and sifted there slight confusion of metaphor caused by strong conviction of sin infinite mercy knows the things that be for our edification and confirmation in the faith yes backsliding sinner the want of real heart felt spiritual life can be supplied by prayer alone is it not so in your experience elder prayer my dear madam and searching of the heart oh the depth of the wickedness of the unconverted heart and he took another glass of sherry that night i remember she worked very hard for her and the next day she presented me with markers the size of a gallows progged with many holes on one was done in cross stitch pray without ceasing and upon the other wrestle thou in prayer gen xxxii both of these i threw into the fire there before her eyes from this it will be clear that in her devotions she still remembered me and doubtless prayed in good scriptural phraseology for my release from this wicked world dr churchyard's last report had raised her terror to the highest pitch and instead of wrestling in prayer she had run away in high panic upon hearing that the fever nurse was seen at large the night before we must use the means of grace she said to mrs fletcher before she locked her in and accept the mercies vouchsafed to us and it would be sinful dear mrs fletcher in me to neglect such a warning as this it was wise as well as righteous in her to keep aloof for a time while her devices worked their consummation for the present it appeared to me that they were failing signally my uncle was regaining strength of mind and body while native air a sense of triumph and daily exercise kept me in blooming health my patient who otherwise could hardly bear me to leave him for an hour insisted upon my taking a long ride every day lilla was charmed and so was i with the sweet spring air and the rich familiar scenery and how it did make me eat thankful indeed i ought to be and am that it pleased god to spare me that awful and deadly pestilence but the worst injury done by canting hypocrites is that the repulsion they create drives away others from good truly i may say that for days after being in contact with that slimy sanctity i could not say my own prayers as a little child should do of that fever there had been three fatal cases in the village before it entered our house and i found that it was spreading rapidly with my uncle's authority i had the drainage surveyed and amended at once and so the pest was stayed of course we did not neglect our own weak point and the crawling noisome smell was no longer perceived in the room nor the white vapour on the grass and so three weeks went by no news from london or devonshire no explanation between my uncle and myself no arrangements as to my expectations in life as yet my uncle was too weak to bear any sort of excitement and seemed desirous only to be passive in my hands his eyes always followed me to every part of the room and he would even be propped on the sofa to see me ride down the avenue and there i always found him watching for my return meanwhile i yearned to be once more in a certain little room with a north aspect opposite a cheesemonger's shop in an obscure street of london nightly i dreamed of giudice and daily i dreamed of dear isola and conrad the dog in the stableyard who had hitherto owned no especial attractions for me suddenly found himself petted and coaxed and fed which he thought much more of to the scandal of mrs fletcher and the great alarm of the grooms who would rather not have me there moreover the dog himself though i strove to invest him with every chivalrous attribute was of a low and ungenial order adorned with no graces of mind and little taste except for bones and gravy but perhaps my standard was too high peradventure i even commenced with more prejudice than a bulldog's be that as it may and if i can see round things i ought to see round myself every day fell heavier and heavier from the fair balance of time and every night the stars for there was now no moon looked wearier in the heavens and less inclined for business how long how long shall you go round the pole in your steady pacing way as if the sky were for auction and you were pacing the lots while i with more fire in me than you can strike or steal am ditched like a glow worm kicked under a dock leaf and see no polestar at all here is may the height of may i am full of life and spirit the garb of death like an april cloud blows over let me see last birthday i was eighteen i have known more troubles than years and enjoyed no youth as yet last year i spent in growing and pining and starving now the power that balances earth and heaven has filled me with joy and light neither am i renegade to my life in opening wide my heart to this flood of love and happiness still am i set upon one strong purpose still am i sworn and will not repent that if filial duty demand it i will trample love under my feet and cut the throat of happiness during most of this time i had no idea where the queen of hypocrites was though doubtless she knew all that was happening to us as soon as he heard of my uncle's surprising rally dr churchyard came over and claimed all the merit for his own last prescription brought face to face with the awkward fact that the medicine had not been procured he was not in the least disconcerted but found that we had misunderstood him the prescription to which he referred was the one before the last at any rate he enhanced his own fame immensely and became instrumental under providence in killing more people than ever in reply to mrs fletcher for i would not deign to ask him he stated that the excellent and devoted mrs daldy had not been seen lately in cheltenham her son however was there and foremost in the ranks of pump room lady killers just what he was fit for the doctor entertained a belief and spread the report in cheltenham that dorcas was lodged in a humble cot among the haunts of pestilence imperilling her life and lavishing her substance to relieve the fever stricken this being more than i could stand i asked the worthy doctor who after all was a man of the world what three wealthy persons dorcas had carried with her at first he feigned not to understand me then looked sly and changed the subject cleverly of course i referred to the well known fact that she supported her grandeur and her son's extravagance by playing an admirable rubber she was playing a better one now dr churchyard finished by writing another prescription which after his departure i handed to the husband of venus legitimate disposer of mineral medicines chapter ii london london was still the cry of my heart and was i not summoned thither by duty long ago what might become during all this time of the man whom i was bound to watch at every turn and whom i was now in a better condition to deal with my first visit every morning was to my parents' graves and neither of them would be there but for his ruthless hand as i sat there how lonely i felt how sadly forlorn in the world be my lot wealth or poverty victory or defeat one morning as i sat there my spirit was moved by dreams of the night before and i vowed in that bodily but invisible presence that none except one whose name i whispered should ever kneel on that turf hand in hand with me borne out of my usual vein by the deed myself had done i entered the ancient church always left open for me and kneeling at the altar rails with many a vaughan supine in prayer pennons helms and trophies round me stately dames in marble white and old crusaders clutching still the cross there i made my vow upon the knee cupped stones that if he claimed me not the race should end with me it was a presumptuous and unholy act with all around me quelled by time with ages laid aside in dust with many a stouter heart and larger mind than mine helpless even to superintend the wasting of his tenement with all his bygone bliss and woe stanchest love and deadliest hate less eloquent now than the fly whom the spider has caught in his skull returning across the park after a warm interview with tulip who insisted mainly upon having his ears well scratched i found my uncle in his snug wheel chair waiting near the side door for me to help and accompany him forth this was our best way to take him out because of the steps at the front door he had not yet been in the open air since his terrible illness but judging by my own experience i thought that he pined for the breeze and after long council it was resolved to trust him forth this day with all his heart he was longing to be out but instead of expressing impatience smiled gratefully at me i now observed that he had a sweet and winning smile a gift bestowed not rarely on faces of a sombre cast in return for it i kissed him and we sailed smoothly out how he revelled to be sure in the first clear breath from the lips of heaven stretching one poor arm forth the other he could not move he tried to spread himself like a flower to the sun then he drew long draughts of liquid freedom and was for a time as one intoxicated in the glorious crystal bath he seemed to float away from earth coming to himself at length he looked at me and said now john may go if he pleases a year ago he would have said go john and no more but illness is a great refiner when john was out of sight he allowed free vent to the tears of joy and gratitude whereof in my opinion he had no call to be ashamed i kissed him many times my warm impassioned nature always felt for and delighted in any touch like this then he placed his better hand on the cold and rigid one lifting this with that and poured forth silent thanks to the giver of all things clara darling at length he said how can i ever show you a thousandth part of my gratitude for all the lovingkindness you have heaped on me coals of fire indeed and they have warmed my selfish heart with loathsome death before your face in all the pride and bloom of early youth and richest i will not repeat his words because it would not become me but i am forced by all that has happened to show what his feelings were and all this for me me who have been your bitterest enemy who have turned you out of your father's house and caused your mother's death here i stopped him lest he should be overcome dear uncle talk no more of this never even think of it the fault was all my own you know i would not stop often as you asked me there always was a bar between us and it was my obstinacy no it was my pride clara in my better mind i loved you all along how could i help admiring your truth and courage and devotion to your father although i own that you were very bitter against me yet if i had only used the proper means i might have got the better of it if i had told you all my story you would have pitied more even than condemned me but my pride forbade and i made the common mistake of regarding you as a child because you were that in years i forgot to allow for the forcing powers of grief even now pulled down as i am and humbled by the wisdom of heaven i cannot tell you my strange history without the acutest pain then i am sure uncle i will never let you do it yes it is my duty and the sooner done the better rescued though i am for the present by your wonderful courage and skill i feel that one more blow even a slight one now and time for me is ended but if it were god's will to cut me off to morrow i should die in happiness having made my peace and won your kind forgiveness you shall not tell me now at any rate and i won't have you talk so uncle mind i am head nurse still now come and see how lovely the ranunculus are getting i began to wheel him over the grass and gather flowers which he played with like a child to change if possible the current of his thoughts stupid thing i took the wrong way to do it oh uncle dear you will laugh at me and say i am as bad as ever but as soon as you get better i want to be off again kind and good as you are to me he trembled so violently that i feared the chair would be upset what clara can't you live with me even now everything shall be yours as it ought to be i will never meddle with you in any way but keep to some lonely corner and not see you very often oh clara dear clara don't go away you know i am quite helpless and i can't live long and you are all in all to me and i am so proud of you darling but it is not for myself i care i cannot tell much less can you what mischief may be done if you leave this house again that low crafty woman will be back again directly she who made cowards of all the household and acted the coward herself who left me to die in my lonely bed while she took all my keys if her treachery succeeds i shall rise from my grave and i know she will poison me yet if she gets the chance and can make anything by it it was the first time he had spoken to me of mrs daldy and i was amazed at his bitterness for i had heard of no quarrel between them what on earth did it mean don't go clara he implored me with the cold sweat on his forehead and every line in his poor thin face a quivering don't go my darling blessed clara i have had none to love for years and years and to love you is so sweet if you go i must die at once and worse than that die wretched in the knowledge that you will be robbed he fell back in the chair from which in his excitement he had striven to rise and for some minutes there he lay insensible when i had succeeded in bringing him to himself he looked at me so piteously with so much death in his eyes that i promised with a sinking heart never to leave him more except upon absolute necessity until he should be well or need my care no longer he even tried to persuade me not to go to london for the things i had left there but to send a trusty person to pack and bring them home to this however i could not yield feeling as i did that after all my love for isola and all her kindness to me i was bound to see her and say farewell and what harm could there possibly be in so short an absence my uncle wished me to bring her down for a good long visit but this at such a time could not be thought of moreover lively impulsive idols would have grown very long faced in a dull sick house which ours must be for the present it was settled at last that i should go to london the following monday stay there one entire day and come back the day after with all my trifling chattels one thing more my uncle proposed which i would not hear of it was that he should transfer to me by deed of gift all the estate both real and personal reserving only a small annuity for himself and a sum of l for some special purpose which he would disclose to me at leisure thus he said he should feel as if justice had been done and there would be some security against mrs daldy's schemes of the latter i felt no fear whatever and thought it the effect of a shaken mind that he attached so much importance to them under no circumstances would i think for a moment of allowing him so to divest himself money to any amount i could have though i wanted very little seeing that now once more a solemn duty would withdraw me from my long pursuit and from all the frivolities which many girls delight in i begged my uncle to appoint an honest steward for the estate and to assign me a moderate yearly allowance which would save much trouble to this he at last consented and proposed for me so large a revenue that after removing the last cipher i had more than i knew how to spend the first thing i did was to send the kind farmer the residue of the sum he had lent me together with interest at ten per cent which did not seem excessive considering that he had no security and now with the utmost anxiety i looked forward to the time when my poor uncle should be strong enough to tell me without risk that history of himself which he had distinctly promised me surely it must shed some light on the mystery of my own this thought as well as the sense of duty reconciled me in some measure to the suspension of my life long search he would have told me everything then and there in his warm gratitude for my undertaking but i durst not let him he was already fatigued with so much talking and when the stimulus of the fresh air was gone he suffered a serious relapse chapter iii on the following monday my poor uncle being rather better again i set off for london as had been determined and arrived there late in the afternoon it had been proposed to send a servant with me but i had been too long accustomed to independence and also had reasons of my own for refusing i was to receive on the morrow an account by telegraph of my patient's health and spirits and promised to give in return some tidings of myself mrs shelfer had not been apprised of my coming because she would have been sure to tell miss isola whom as well as her brother i wished to take by surprise dear isola had often inquired about my family but only knew that i was an orphan much reduced in the world poor and all alone much as i loved her i knew quite well that she could not keep a secret and whenever she teased me about my iron mask i retorted upon her that she had first to discover the secret of her own home as we rushed towards the mighty city what a flush was in my cheeks what a flutter in my heart whom might i not see even upon the platform or at any rate in the streets and poverty being removed what obstacle could there be between us not that i intended to resign myself to affection and lead a life of softness until i had discharged to the utmost my duty to the dead yet some sort of pledge might pass some surety there might be that neither of us would feel thereafter quite alone in the world but how could i tell that he even cared about me well i had a strong suspicion in some things the eyes are the best detective police only i had always been so unlucky was it not too good luck for me ever to be true mrs shelfer's door was opened at my knock not by her own little bustling self nor even by shock headed and sly charley but by a short stout man of affable self importance with a semi jewish face and a confidential air he had a pot of porter in one hand and a paper roll in the other a greasy hat on his head and one leg of his trousers had lost the lower half upon learning my name and object he took no notice whatever of me but put up his paper roll for a trumpet and shouted along the passage balaam here's a kick i'm bothered if it's all lies after all never dreamed the old gal could tell a word of truth had a higher opinion of her blowed if the young woman herself ain't come easy there balak the mouth of the speaker was full keep the door i tell you never gets a bit of time to my victuals she's up to a plant i doubt just let me have a squint at her out came another man with a like appearance and air and a blade bone in his hand whereat he continued to gnaw throughout the interview it was indeed a squint with which he favoured me and neither of them would move for me to pass pray what is the meaning of all this i asked in my grandest manner surely i have not mistaken the house i lived in this i believe is mrs shelfer's house instead of answering me they closed the door enough to put the slide chain on leaving me still outside where with boiling indignation i heard myself discussed the cabman looking on with an experienced grin well balaam now and what do you think of that party uncommon fine young gal and doosed mannersome too but it don't follow for all that that the thing is on the square you know have she got any luggage balak no mate and that looks fishy now one come to think on it stop let me have another look no leave that to me slip the chain out balak and keep your foot behind the door she can't push us both in without assault and battery to my shame and indignation i was subjected to another critical cross fire from half drunken eyes i turned my back and stamped in my vexation the cabman gave me an approving nod this little act of mine was so unmistakably genuine and displayed such very nice embroidery i do like a tasteful petticoat that the hard heart of balaam was softened at the same moment a brilliant idea stole through his cautious mind stop now balak put your foot there she can't push us both in i believe leastways not without battery and contempt of court now what do you think of this and he whispered to his grimy friend well that beats all i ever heer'd on let you alone for brains balaam and me for muscle and pluck now young lady began balaam in a diplomatic tone me and my mate here be in a constitution of trust or else you may take your oath and never a pervarication we never would keep an agreeable young female here he gave me two ogles intended for one on the flinty stones so long only we can't say if you mean honest and there be such a many bad ones going and we've got a leary file inside now listen to what i say there's a dog as big as a lion in the room as you calls yourn and he do show his teeth and no mistake we be afeared to show our noses there even at the command of dooty you can hear him growling now like all the strand and fleet street and my mate balak here leave half his breeches behind him saving your presence miss and lucky to get off so now if so be you undertakes honour bright to march straight into that front room my mate and self have concluded to let you in of course i will said i smiling at their terrors so i paid the cabman took up my little bag and ran right up the stairs balaam and balak feared to come round the corner you must unlock the door miss cried one of them we was forced to lock him in oh judy my darling judy my own pet love of a judy he let me say no more his paws were on my shoulders and i was in a shower bath of kisses in the ecstasy of my joy i forgot all about the two men and their mysterious doings and flung myself down on a chair while judy out of his mind with delight even tried to sit on my lap he whinnied and cried and laughed and yelled and could find no vent for his feelings until he threw his great head back and told all in a wow wow that must have been heard in oxford street a little familiar knock and mrs shelfer appeared looking rather better than ever why dear mrs shelfer how glad i am to see you and you look much younger i declare and miss you do look bootiful bootiful my good friend splendid things i was dressed a little better but still in sombre colours splendid miss vaughan and how you becomes 'em to be sure talk of miss idols after that why it's the queen to a gipsy and pray miss if i may make so bold what did you give for this it beats my sarcenet dress i do believe nothing mrs shelfer only a little kiss gracious me miss then you've been and got engaged and to a lord at least i heard you were come into your great fortune at last more than all middlesex they tell me regency park and all and that poor straight legged young man as come here every day to see judy and to ask for you now mrs shelfer don't talk nonsense my heart was jumping but i did not want her to see it i only hope you haven't said a word to him about these foolish reports me miss do you think i would now yes i know by your face you have you can't cheat me mrs shelfer never mind if you have not mentioned my name it never struck me that conrad would be frightened at my money no never miss as i hope to be saved and she crossed herself which i had never seen her do come mrs shelfer now i've got some pretty little trifles for you in this bag she jumped with pleasure she was so fond of knick knacks then she put her fingers on her lips and went to the door and listened presently she came back with a mysterious air pray miss as you are so very kind excuse my taking the liberty but would you mind giving judy the bag in his paws no fear of them getting it there why what on earth is the matter why didn't you let me in who are those nasty men oh it's nothing miss nothing at all to speak of only they knocks my sticks so in making the inwentory and the one they made last time and the time before would do every bit as well but they charges for it every time the rogues and they dare to put the chairs down lackered and american cloth good morocco as ever was and as if miss minto now mrs shelfer tell me in two words what it means is it a sale no no miss i should hope not only an execution and them two men are the bailiffs civil tongues enough and very good judges of porter and periwinkles they're the ones as come last time but i'd sooner have the old ones jolly fellows they were and knew how to wink both eyes but that cross eyed thief and have they got my things mrs shelfer no miss only what few was in the bedroom they daren't come here for judy it was as much as their lives were worth if i had known they was coming i'd have had him at the front door but they locked him in as soon as he got a piece out of the other fellow's leg bless me how he did holloa do you mean to say mrs shelfer that they have taken possession of my things in my bedroom to be sure miss i said they was yours and of course they wouldn't believe me and the folding door was shut but judy would have broken it down only they put the bedstead again it gracious me i never see a dog take on so in all my life he was like a roaring lion i should rather hope so giudice i commend you and i've a great mind to let you out and what is more i will if they don't give me back my things surely mrs shelfer they have no right to my property well so i say miss because it isn't for the landlord but they won't believe they are yours if they don't believe me pretty soon giudice shall convince them he is a judge you know and i've no idea of robbery any more than he has but who is doing all this and why do you seem so unconcerned about it i should cry my eyes out i am sure bless your pretty heart miss this makes the fifteenth time i've had them here in the last four years at first i was terribly put out and made myself a figure crying but now i only think it's company and they drink as if they was that's certain you must have seen the inwentories miss round the candles lots of times only one thing they does that don't strike me as wery honourable though it's law i b'lieve they charges me and wery high too for eating up my victuals and they will have meat four times a day why that balak him with his breeches gone who put them in mrs shelfer and how much is it for oh it's one of charley's bills or notes of course quinlan holds it him as keeps the little dust pan down maiden lane and charley says that all he got for it was ten shillings and a waggon load of water cresses now they'll be here directly miss with you to keep the dog in excuse me miss i see you have got one of them new wide things as go all round and up capital things i must have one before they come again and could you manage to sit upon the sofa miss and the three best chairs in your petticoat with the tea poy on your lap what on earth do you mean mrs shelfer why miss they can't lay hold of any article in use i believe and you have got so much room in your things do you suppose i intend to let them come here for a moment now let me look at my bedroom come judy oh miss they did have such a hunt here for charley's double barrel gun a regular beauty it is and that big rogue quinlan is after it they know it all round this neighbourhood it was made by a famous maker joe something i b'lieve and the best he ever made it was poor miss minto's brother's and they shan't have it not one of 'em i'd sooner shoot them with it i keeps it always in the safest place i knows on and twice a year i see that it don't get rusty what safe place do you keep it in she put her little mouth up to my ear and her little hand up to her mouth and whispered at the broker's miss in barbican he has had it now six years it's in for a quarter its value but that's all the better for me i have less to pay for keeping it and i carries the ticket night and day in my bosom and do you know my good friend they thought they had got it just now they got a key that fitted that box of yours that you always locked so carefully and they made sure that was it ha ha how i laughed at them when they opened it what have they dared to open my mahogany box it was the repository of my precious relics to be sure they did miss and they found such curious things there a lovely thing all set with jewels they said a baggonet fit for the duke of wellington and plaster shapes like a cobbler's last and coloured paper with queer letters on it and a piece of long black hair and a plan with distances on it lor miss what on earth is the matter water water you're like death balaam balak stop mrs shelfer i had fallen on the bed i would not for ten thousand pounds have had that box exposed to those low ruffians ransacked and even catalogued if i can punish them i will and you too you low miserly meddling inquisitive old crone she cared for nothing though afterwards she told me she never saw such eyes in her life until i luckily called her an old crone at that she fell back upon the towel horse and sobbed with both hands over her eyes as if her heart would break i had pierced her in the tenderest point her age i did not feel sorry for her at all for at least two minutes but let her cry away serves her right i thought even if she could not have stopped them from opening that box of mine at any rate she had no right to gossip about it and enjoy it all as she evidently had done furthermore i knew well that she had always been on the tingle to learn the contents of that box and many a time i had baffled her now she had triumphed thoroughly and i should not have been female if i had calmly allowed it but seeing her great distress through all of which she talked with sobs for affirmations i began to think what a pity it was then to wonder whether she deserved it all next to believe that she had done no harm lastly to feel that i had been a brute thereupon i rushed to coax and kiss her wiped away her tears with my own lawn handkerchief the feel of which consoled her for the edge was lace and begged her pardon fifty times in a thousand foolish words finally she was quite set up again by this i tell you my dear patty when i come to your age when i am five and thirty she was fifty two at least i shall fully deserve to be called an old woman for this and much older i shall look there is no doubt than you do right my good friend you are quite right there this expression showed me that she herself was right why the young man from the butcher's he said to me this morning and beautiful black hair reminded me of yours miss all stuck together with the fat from off the kidneys come mrs shelfer let me see about my box to be sure to be sure my dear miss vaughan but what do you think he said 'now william john' says i 'a good steak mind a tender juicy steak for the gentleman visitors here' balaam miss and balak if you please 'does like good juicy meat' 'mrs shelfer ma'am' he says a bowing with his tray like that 'you shall have a steak ma'am as fresh and as juicy as yourself' now wasn't that pretty my good friend beautiful mrs shelfer but see about my box surely surely miss vaughan but it was very pretty like a valentine don't you think it was now where is it downstairs miss in my little parlour then send it up at once by one of the men presently balaam came up looking askance at judy and with the mahogany box under his right arm he touched his dirty hat for mrs shelfer had filled him by this time with the wonders of my wealth and then he looked doubtfully and with sorrow at his burden put it here if you please and i pointed to some chairs the dog will not touch you while i am here now what is the amount of this execution debt fifteen pounds miss expenses up to five o'clock four pound ten here is the money now give me a receipt no miss you don't mean to pay all of course i do then miss i beg your pardon but i can't allow you i has a duty to my employer and i has a duty to the public too not forgetting mrs shelfer and charley an old friend and all so handsome in the way of victuals and i'm sure she wouldn't wish you to be cheated miss pay ten pounds for the debt miss and that's a deal more than it cost them or they expects to get 'twixt you and me miss every stick of this here furniture is in a dozen bills of sale already and we comes here more for practice like than for anything else in short i paid l for the debt and l for the expenses whereupon balaam looked at me with a most impressive and confidential glance now miss you won't think me rude but you have come down so handsome i can tell you something as you may like to know i've seed the very moral of that sword of yours before are you certain pray where was it i trembled with excitement it was in a place in somers town miss where i made a levy some eight year agone what was the name of the people dallyhorse or jellycorse or something of the sort foreigners they was and they had only just come to this country but i can tell you the name more shipshape from the books ah the very moral of it only there warn't no serpent do you know what has become of them no that i don't and don't want to come across them again a mean set of mongrel parlywoos i got starved amost but i did hear they was riding the high horse now and something about court are you quite sure that the weapon was exactly like this look at this again miss i can take my oath it was the fellow pea all but the little snake and he ain't a fixture i don't believe i would have sworn it was the very same only you tells me not i noticed it most particular for i never see one like it though i have had a sight of foreign weapons in my hands ere now and the gent had got it put away so we come across it only through a cat as happened to be confined and what became of it did your employer have it not he miss when the gent found we had got it he was put out and no mistake though he sham not away he goes and gets the money somehow and has us all away in no time how many were there in the family well let me see they was only living in lodgings and had but half the house there was dallyhorse himself and a queer looking lady and some children i don't know how many children for they kept them out of the way and a nice young woman as did the cooking for them and precious little it was what was his profession and who was his creditor' i don't know they called him an artist i think but he look to me more like a sailor it was a boarding house bill as i was on him for rum tempered fellow i thought he would have stuck me when i got his sword thing a tallish man he was slight build and active and such black eyes now balaam if you can trace that man and find out where he is living now i will give you two hundred pounds here's ten pounds for you as an earnest balaam was so amazed that he almost looked straight at me please miss may i tell balak i shan't be happy if i doesn't we always works together and it wouldn't be on the square like was he with you then and can he keep a secret yes miss he was with me and i'd trust him with a gallows secret i can't do no good without him then certainly you may tell him but not while in this house here is my country address that you may know who you act for keep clear of the police keep the whole matter to yourselves in two days i leave london if you discover nothing in that time write to me here and i will take good care to have the letters forwarded do nothing but find out that one thing and when i have verified it i will pay you the two hundred pounds would you mind miss putting it on paper yes for many reasons i will not write it down but you are at liberty to inquire who i am and whether i am likely to disgrace my word after taking his address balaam levison dove court chancery lane i allowed him to depart and heard him pause on every stair to ponder this strange matter presently mr shelfer came home and was delighted to see the bailiffs and the pleasure being mutual and my cash burning to be quenched a most hilarious evening was the natural result my health was drunk as i could hear too plainly to unfathomable depths and comic songs from three loud organs provided with patent nasal stops with even patty's treble pipe audible in the chorus broke from time to time the tenour of my sad and lonely thoughts chapter iv the bailiff's discovery and the pursuit commenced thereon appeared to me so important that in reply to the message received the next morning that my uncle was much the same and longing for my return i sent word that my journey was put off until the day after the morrow this allowed me one day more for tidings from my new scouts as to the success of their efforts i was very sorry to disappoint my poor sick uncle but it seemed still worse to run away all in the dark the next thing i did was to arrange with mrs shelfer about the money i had paid for her it was not the money i cared for but i had other views although she was politely thankful i perceived that she thought it a very bad job indeed and a most romantic transaction thirty per cent was the very largest dividend she had ever intended to pay but the plan which i proposed was so much for her benefit while it suited me who otherwise must have lost the money that it almost recovered her from the shock of having paid a debt the plan was simply this that she should reserve my rooms for me airing and cleaning them duly and always keeping the bed in a fit state to be slept on at an hour's notice my previous rent had been twelve shillings a week the utmost i could afford out of my narrow income attendance and linen and other troubles being now dispensed with i thought it fair to allow her ten shillings off her debt to me for every week i should so retain the rooms the l for the expenses of the execution i forgave her altogether inasmuch as i had paid without consulting her directly my payment should be exhausted to wit in twenty weeks i would send her a further sum if i still required the rooms she was delighted with this arrangement which in fact enabled her to have her sticks all to herself to pet them and talk to them every day and even to clean them if such a freak of destruction ever should enter her brain she could use the sitting room for her own pleasure and pride as much as ever she chose so long as it always was ready for me and already visions were passing before her mind's eye of letting the parlour downstairs with the onion room for its dormitory to me the arrangement was very convenient as affording a fixed and familiar resort in london and a pivot of ready communication nor was it a small consolation to feel that i still retained a stronghold in the neighbourhood of dear friends all this being comfortably settled giudice and i went forth to pay our visit in lucas street the whole of that street we found so utterly changed in appearance by a vigorous onset of painters grainers and decorators that it was not easy to know the house we were in quest of even the numbers on the doors which had been illegible or very nearly so had now been re arranged and painted over again upon the fashionable and very sensible mode of marking odd numerals on one side and even ones on the other finding myself in a difficulty and the houses all alike as the central peas of a pod i trusted to judy's delicate nose and rang the bell of the door at which he halted then he drew back and trembled and crouched upon the pavement to wait for my return as i heard the tinkle my heart began to flutter who could tell what new phase of my life might begin with that little pull after some delay poor old cora came looking as weird and woebegone as ever fierce would have been that look to any one but me i knew that i held her by my magic gordit like the slave of the lamp after imploring in some mumbled words which i interpreted only by knowledge of her desire gracious leave to kiss that potent charm she led me into the breakfast parlour where i found sweet isola in a passionate flood of tears at sight of me her beautiful smile broke through them and her quick deep sobs spent themselves in kisses oh i am so gug gug glad my own dear cla cla clara and i won't cuc cuc cry one bit more the moment i can stop she put her arms around me and her head upon my breast as if i had been at the very least her brother my pretty dear what is it all about i had never seen her look so lovely as now her violet eyes brimming with liquid brightness the velvet of her cheeks deepened to rich carmine and the only thing that sweet face ever wanted the expression of earnest feeling now radiant through the whole why dear i ought not to tell you but i must tell somebody or my heart will break here she pressed her little hand on that pure unfissured casket where sorrow was as yet an undreamed of robber you know dear it's all about papa and my darling conny the only trouble i ever have but a very great one big enough and too big for two little folk of my size half an hour ago i went in suddenly to get a book upon the politico economical science the very one papa is lecturing about so beautifully and i did not even know that conny was in the house there papa was white as death with passion and conrad with his eyes like coals of sparkling fire and what do you suppose my papa called his own son conny don't tell me if it's anything bad i can't bear it isola oh i knew you were fond of him and i am so glad this she said in such an artless way as if conrad and i were two dolls which she meant to put in one doll's house that instead of colouring i actually laughed oh but i must tell you clara it's right for you to know one of the leading principles of political economy don't talk to me of that stuff well i won't because i see that you don't understand it but he actually called him and his voice came from a depth like an artesian well he called our darling conny what and in my passion i flung off her hand and stood up a low bastard a renegade hound a scandal to his country and then he even said rimbecco she pronounced the last word almost with a scream as an insult beyond forgiveness what it meant i did not ask i had heard enough already i must leave this house where is your brother conrad gone i believe to inquire for you nothing but that composes him i wish he would never come here and he was ordered not to but it is about some business oh he never will come again and she began to cry at the thought of the very thing she had wished for neither will i come again where is your father now up at his lumbering cabinet where he always consoles himself whenever he is put out but if you are going dear child do let me come with you i shall cry till i die here all by myself and pappy never cares about me when he is in his black dudgeon in a few minutes we left the rude unpleasant house and even judy seemed relieved to get away from the door by the time we reached mrs shelfer's idols was in capital spirits again and pressed me for some account of the wonderful wealth and the grand house she had heard of no doubt this rumour had found its way through ann maples and the great lord what's his name dear donna i wouldn't believe a word of it though i'm sure you are a deal too good for all the house of peers but conny did and wasn't he in a way but he ought to be very glad you know wish you every blessing as they say in the plays and a peer is the very highest blessing to an englishwoman but one thing i am quite resolved on judy belongs to me now don't you lovely judy no said the judicious i belong to clara though conny pretends since he was left at your place that he belongs to him now i will give him to you and so will conny too you can afford to keep him now and i can't he does eat such a lot and he does not care a pin for me but he loves you with all his heart how do you know he does i was not attending much but thinking of some one else why can't you see that he does how he wags his tail every time you even look at him but i hope poor conny is here i should think he would stop when he finds darling clara come back i had jumped to that hope long ago before we even left lucas street and that had something to do with my walking so fast no he was not there he had not been there to day it was my turn now to cry what might he not have done after that fearful insult and from his own father too the tears which i confided to no one except the wooden legged blackbird for giudice would have made such a fuss about them were still upon my cheeks when i heard the well known step not half so elastic as usual i fled into my bedroom and pushed the boxes about to make a goodly noise and to account for the colour in my face then out i came at the side door and ran downstairs perversely though i knew that conrad and isola were in my sitting room but this first rate manoeuvre only outwitted its author for isola ran down after me and sent me upstairs alone all my little nonsense vanished the moment i looked in conrad's face his healthy brown complexion was faded to an opal white beneath his eyes such dark blue rims that i thought he had spectacles on and on either cheek a round red spot was burning so shocked i was that when he took my hand i turned my face away and smothered down a sob i felt that i had no right to be so fresh and blooming nor was it only in health that the contrast between us lay i was dressed with unusual care having fidgeted all the morning and with my utmost taste poor conrad was in his working clothes full of marble dust tumbled threadbare and even in need of mending his hair swept anyhow and his hands not over lately washed yet for all that he was as clearly a gentleman as i was a lady not so would he have been arrayed i fancy had he thought to see neat clara and yet who knows i trust that you will excuse me he began to say but such things have happened lately you will not account me rude i had no sense at all of this great pleasure i fear you have not been very happy i knew not what to say or how to keep my voice clear yes he replied as happy as i deserve it serves me aright for esteeming so much of myself before that i do anything but i will win my way and his own proud glance flashed out and we shall see how many will scorn me then no one in the world can scorn you i said very softly and my voice thrilled through him ah you are always kind and gentle am i though thought i but i will no more fatigue you with my different lot in life i am told that some great nobleman has won you for his own perhaps you will give me an order his throat was swelling with these bitter words and he looked at his dusty clothes somewhat rude i thought him but i knew not half his troubles whoever told you that has made a great mistake i am engaged to no one your sister knows me better and i turned away to the window for a minute he said nothing but i could hear his heart beat stedfastly i looked at the cheesemonger's shop oh for a flower or something on the balcony presently he came round the corner of the sofa without being rude i could not help turning round his face was much much brighter and his eyes more kind have i said any harm i would not for the world i knew not it was harm no harm i said to think so ill of me to believe for a single moment that because i am not so poor i would go and forsake at least i mean forget any one i cared for can i ever hope if i serve you all my life that you will ever care for me don't you know i do and i burst into my violent flood when i came to myself both his arms were round me and i was looking up at his poor sick face my hair quite full of marble chips and he was telling me with glad tears in his eyes which he never took from mine how he cared for nothing now not for all the world not for glory or fur shame so long as i only loved him with all my heart and soul i whispered him and no one else whatever whether in life or death all the folly we went through i am not going to repeat though i remember well every atom of it let the wise their wisdom keep we are babes and sucklings neither of us had ever loved before or ever meant to love again except of course each other and that should be for ever one thing i must tell you my own sweet love and yet i fear to do it but you are not like other girls there is no one like you nor has there ever been i think you will not scorn me for another's fault of course i won't my own pet conny what is this awful thing i am an illegitimate son one moment i sprang from him the next i despised myself but in spite of all my troubles there still lurked in my heart the narrow pride of birth down to the earth it fell beneath the foot of true love and i kissed away from his eyes the mingled reproach and sorrow assuring him that at least he should have a legitimate wife to make amends i leaned upon him one moment and put my hand on his shoulder and let him play awhile with the dark shower of my hair darling conny you have told me yours now you shall hear my secret only promise me you will give tit for tat you say you loved me ever since you saw me first then you must have loved your clara when you saved her life what do you mean my clara those low ruffians in the park were not going to kill you no dearest i don't mean that at all but there's a kiss for that i have owed it you ever since but what i mean no kisses can repay no nor a life of love you saved a life worth fifty of my own some dark alarm was growing in his eyes on which i gazed with vague increasing terror why dearest it is nothing only your own clara is not clara valence you must call her 'clara vaughan' with actual violence he thrust me from his arms and stood staring at me while i trembled from head to foot his face was one scarlet flame and pray sir what harm have i done am i to suppose that you special emphasis meant for illegitimacy that you are ashamed of my father and me yes i am accursed low licentious race if you knew what you have done you would tear your heart out rather than give it to me thank you i feel obliged my heart indeed to a bastard take back your ring if you please kindly restore me mine may i trouble you for room enough to go by and i swept out of the room and through the side door into my bed room where i crouched in a corner with both hands on my heart and the whole world gone away mad i heard him cry yes i must go mad at last away he rushed from the house and i fell upon the bed and lay in fits till midnight chapter v i believe that my heart would have burst if they had not cut my stays and how i wished it had when i came back to my unlucky self there was something shivery cold in the forehead wave of my hair was it conrad's finger i put up my hand to dash it away and caught a fine fat leech dr franks was sitting by me holding a basin and a sponge that's the last of them my dear child don't disturb him he is doing his duty by you his duty was it his duty to say such fearful things to break my heart with every word ashamed of me ashamed of my darling father low and licentious what have i done what have i done oh it i only knew what harm i have ever done no harm my poor dear no harm in the world let me bathe your pretty face come now you shan't cry another drop what is to become of the beautiful eyes i was so proud of saving oh i wish you hadn't how i wish you hadn't dr franks i have no father and no mother and no one in all the world to love me and i was just getting so nice and happy again so proud of myself and so much prouder of him and i began to think how glad my own dear father would be and dr franks i did love him so with all my heart perhaps it's not very large but with every morsel and atom of my heart and now now i must hate him as much as ever i can oh let me go home do let me go home where my father and mother are buried and i rose in the bed to start and the candles glimmered in my eyes please to go out of the room every one please to go and don't let isola come i can't bear the sight of her now it won't take me long to dress and i don't want any luggage and mrs shelfer please to go for a cab and i shan't want the rooms any more and it does not matter a bit about any letters i'll tell my father everything when i see him and then perhaps he'll tell me what harm it is i have done why don't you go when you see i want to get up' don't you see my dear child we are going only you must take this glass of wine first to prepare you for your long journey will you take it now while we fetch the cab yes anything anything i don't care what it is only let me get ready and i drank without even tasting it a glass of some dark liquid which saved me from wandering further either in mind or body when i awoke it was broad noon once more and dr franks was sitting by me with one of my hands in his magnificent constitution i thought i heard him mutter glorious constitution what good was it to me at the foot of the bed sat isola crying terribly slowly i remembered all my great disaster but saw it only through a dull gray veil the power of the opiate was still upon my brain but a cold dead pain lay heavy on my heart and always seemed to want a heavy hand upon it after he had given me a reviving draught dr franks perceived that i wished to speak to isola and accordingly withdrew poor isola came slowly and sat beside my pillow doubting whether she should dare to take my hand therefore i took hers drew her face towards me and covered it with kisses isola had done no harm to me whatever and i felt it something to have even her to love she was overcome with affectionate surprise oh clara dearest i am so very glad to find you love me still i feared that you would never care for me again what is it all about dear if you are well enough to tell me what is all this dreadful misery about that is the very thing i want to learn from you dear surely you must know better far than i do i would not even ask her what had become of conrad no i don't dear i don't know at all all i know is there must have been some dreadful quarrel between you and conrad i must tell you dear i was so anxious about something you can guess that i stole up to the door soon after he came in and you were so intent upon the window that you never even saw me put the door ajar and then i heard him tell you how very much he loved you and i was so glad and then i thought it was not quite fair of me and i knew all i wanted so i ran downstairs again and the next thing i heard was your bedroom door bang and then conny dashed out the house and judy came down to me looking very sorrowful and i ran up to you and here i found you shrieking so and rolling and clutching at the bedclothes and i was so frightened i could not even move and then judy came and made such a dreadful howling and mrs shelfer ran straight off for the doctor and i poured the water in the decanter over you and i can't tell any more but surely darling you have been home since that oh yes when dr franks came and you were a little better he would make me go home because he did not want two patients he said and his eldest daughter such a nice girl came with me and my papa didn't even know that i had been out of the house he was still upstairs brooding over his relics and all the sixth form at the college had to go to dinner without their lectures but i do believe the stupid girls were glad and did you hear no it doesn't matter no i never heard what became of conrad no doubt he went back to his favourite chip chipping he has got a splendid thing he is full of now and it prevents his sleeping something or other very horrible from dante and the leading figure is modelled after you i have seen the drawings and he has got you exactly how gratifying to be sure i will ask you no more questions pray let me know when i am for sale though i should call it a work of illegitimate art my eyes were on her face but she showed no consciousness whatever which she must have done had she known the fact referred to for she was quick of perception and open as the day i was angry with myself for the low and bootless sneer which was pretty certain to be conveyed to her brother now i will delay no longer let me speak to dr franks i shall go this afternoon poor isola turned pale she had looked upon the occurrence as only a lover's quarrel sure to be set right in a day or two she could not harbour any great resentment long and forgot that i could don't talk so dear and you so very weak it would be sure to kill you and what will conny think you must not go at any rate till you have been to see him i go to him i hope to see him never more until i charge him in another world with this bitter wrong no no more if you please i will not hear his name again how can he be your brother darling idols i never shall forget you take this my pet and think of me sometimes for you will never see me more i gave her an emerald ring set with lovely pearls small types of herself it was not the one i had reclaimed from her brother that was a plain keeper oh clara clara don't say that whatever you do because i know you will keep to it you are so shamefully obstinate and i never loved any one in the world like you no not even conny and not even your father or mother no not half so much i like pappy very well when he is good and kind but that is not very often now the poor little thing's eyes filled again with tears and as for my mother i never even saw her she died when i was born and i love you too my sweet best of all the world now nevertheless we must part and never see each other i don't call that loving tell me why do tell me why there seems some horrid mystery about every one i love and she was overcome with grief she had not been like me apprenticed young to trouble darling i will write to you sometimes you can come here for the letters i will have no secrets any more from you but you must never attempt to write to me only send your name on a bit of paper when my letters go but why on earth mayn't i write to you clara dear i can't tell you why only i cannot bear it the truth was i could never have borne to read about her brother so all that was settled and i said good bye with plenty of bitter crying as for balaam and balak from whom i expected tidings and george cutting whom i had thought it right to send for i had not the heart to attend to any of them dr franks had done his utmost to oppose my sudden journey but i told him truly that i should go mad if i stopped there any longer i could not bear the mere sight of the room where i had been in the height of delicious joy so trampled upon and outraged my brain was burning and my heart was aching for the only spot on earth where true love could be found the spot where lay my father and my mother seeing how the fever of the mind was kindling the doctor like a good physician knew that the best plan was to indulge and so allay it yet he begged me if i had any regard for him not to travel all alone while in that dangerous state with most unlooked for and unmerited kindness he even sent his eldest daughter at an hour's notice to see me home in safety the last farewell was said to judy whom i would not take away greatly as i loved him still and he received most stringent orders first to conduct dear isola home and then to go to his old quarters at the livery stables apparently he acquiesced though with wistful glances but at paddington as i was getting the tickets to my amazement in he rushed upset a couple of porters and demanded his ticket too under the circumstances there was nothing for it except to let him go with us or to lose the train so his ticket was taken and he dashed into the dog box with an enthusiasm which earned him a hard knock on the head chapter vi annie franks was exactly as isola had described her such a nice girl kind hearted like her father truthful ladylike and sensitive retiring too and humble minded with a well of mute romance in the shadow of her heart a wave of which she would not for the world display the only vent she ever allowed this most expansive element was novel reading or a little quiet hero worship her greatest happiness was to sit upon a lonely bank and read a slashing curtel axe and gramercy romance with lots of high born ladies in it and lots of moonlight love if history got hard thumps among them and chronology like an unwound clock was right but twice in twenty four simple annie smiled no less so long as the summer sun flashed duly on pennon helm and gonfalon and she could see bright cavalcades winding through the greenwood shade in coat and waistcoat novels her soul took no delight not a shilling would she squeeze from her little beaded purse for all the quicksilver of dickens or the frosted gold of thackeray yet she was not by any means what fast young ladies call a spooney she had plenty of common sense upon the things of daily life plenty of general information and no lack of gentle self respect ice tempered steel i had written but alas the great author is dead and they say that his kind heart was grieved by nothing so much as the charge of cynicism if he were a cynic would that we all were dogs greek kynos ommat' echon kradien d' elaphoio cv now she was wending through an upland meet for gray clad reverie where she might dream for days and days and none but silly deer intrude as we passed along in the gloaming of the may through bosomed lawn and bosky dell with lilac plumes for cavaliers and hawthorn sweeps for ladies' trains the soft gray eyes of annie ceased at last to watch me and her thoughts were in costume of chevy chase or crecy by reason of the message sent the day before no one in the house expected me so we stole in quietly lest my uncle should be alarmed and i requested gregory tipsy bob's successor to bring jane to meet us in my own little room annie being installed there to her great delight and allowed free boot of marry sir knight and now by my halidame i went to see my poor dear uncle who by this time was prepared for my visit very weak he seemed and nervous and more rejoiced at my return than even i had expected to me also it was warm comfort in my cold pride ailment to be with one of my own kin whom none could well disparage there was a dignity about him an air of lofty birth which my own darling father had been too genial to support soon i perceived from my uncle's manner that something had happened since my departure to add to his uneasiness but he offered no explanation and i did not like to ask him he in turn perceived the heavy dark despondency which in spite of all my efforts would at times betray itself pride and indignation supported me when i began to think but then i could not always think whereas i could always feel moreover pride and indignation are in almost every case props that carry barbs in a word though i would scorn the love lorn maiden's part it was sad for me to know that i could never love again with a father's tenderness he feebly drew my head to his trembling breast and asked me in a tearful whisper what had happened to me but i was too proud to tell him oh that i had not been what misery might have been spared to many but all the time my head lay there i was on fire with shame and agony thinking of the breast on which my hair had last been shed now good nurse clara he said at last with a poor attempt at playfulness i shall have no more confidence in your professional skill unless you wheel me forth to morrow with a cheerful face you are tired to night my love and so should i have been if you had not come home to morrow you shall tell me why you came so suddenly and saved me a day of longing and to morrow if i am strong enough i will tell you a little history which may be lost like many a great one unless it is quickly told stop one cup of tea dear and how proud i am to pour it out for you and then i will not keep you from a livelier friend to morrow you must introduce me i still like pretty girls and you should have brought that lovely isola with you i can't think why you didn't she would have been most welcome come uncle i shall be jealous the young lady i have brought is quite pretty enough for you he sighed at some remembrance and then asked abruptly do you mean to sleep my darling in the little room to night his voice shook so while he asked this question that i was quite certain something had alarmed him the little room was the one i had occupied between the main corridor and his present bedroom it was meant for an ante room not a sleeping chamber but i had brought my little iron bedstead thither to be sure i do dear uncle do you suppose because i have been off duty that i mean to be cashiered only one thing i must tell you i have brought home with me one of the very best friends i ever had you have heard me talk of giudice i cannot bear the thought of parting with him to night he will cry so dreadfully in the strange stables and in london he always slept on the mat outside my door may i have him in the lobby uncle you will never hear him move and he never snores except just after dinner to be sure my pet i would not part you for the world god bless you my own child and keep your true heart lighter if i had been really his own child he could not have been more loving to me than he had now become after giving annie franks her tea which she was far too deep in tournament to drink i paid a visit to mrs fletcher's room and learned from her that nothing so far as she knew had happened to disturb my uncle mrs daldy had not been near the house and there was a rumour afloat that she had been called to take part in a revival meeting near swansea so after introducing judy who was a dreadful dog for jam and having him admired almost as much as he ought to be i returned to annie and found her in high delight with everything and everybody and most of all with her tapestry writer leaving her at last under tilly's care judy and i were making off for our sleeping quarters when truant matilda followed me down the passage hastily oh miss please miss i want to tell you something and i did not like to name it before that nice young lady because i am sure she is timid like matilda looked not timid like but terrified exceedingly as she stared on every side with her candle guttering hold your candle up matilda and tell me what it is by this time we were in the main passage corridor they called it and could see all down it by the faint light of some oil lamps to the oriel window at the farther end whereon the moon now nearly full again was shining why miss the ghost was walking last night and the night before nonsense matilda don't be so absurd it's true miss true as you stand there pale gray it is this time and so tall and the face as white as ashes and a shiver ran through tilly at her own description you know miss it's the time of year and she always walks three nights together from the big east window to this end and back again so please to lock your door miss and bolt it too inside well done tilly does any one intend to wait up for the ghost what time does it come one o'clock miss as punctual as a time piece but could you suppose miss any one would dare to wait up and see it then how have they seen it in the name of folly why miss i'll tell you one of the carriage horses got an inflammation in his eyes and the farrier give orders to have it sponged never more than three hours between and so william edwards the head groom if you please miss tilly curtseyed here because this was her legitimate sweetheart he stops up till one o'clock to see to it and then job leyson goes instead so william come in miss on monday night to go to bed please miss and he took the short cut not that he were allowed miss or would think of taking a liberty on no account whatever but he were that sleepy he didn't know the way to bed so he went across the corridor for the short cut from the kitchen gallery to the servants' passage and there he saw he hadn't any light miss and the lamps all out goodness me whatever was that did you hear it miss yes and see it tilly it's a daddy in your candle go on tilly will you am i to stop here all night and get as bad as you are there william edwards a man who never swears or drinks there he saw all in the dark coming so stately down the corridor as if it hadn't room enough with one arm up like this a tall pale melancholy ghost and he knew it was the lady who was wronged and killed when the great wars was miss two hundred year agone well tilly and did he speak to it he was that frightened miss he could not move or speak but he fell again the wall in the side passage with his eyes coming out of his head and his hair up like my wicker broom and then she vanished away and he got to bed and did perspire so they was forced to wring the blankets capital tilly and who saw her the next night why that nincompoop job leyson miss our william was a deal too wise to go that way any more but he tell job leyson and he a foolish empty fellow perhaps you know miss 'ho' says job 'i often hear tell of her to night i'll have a peep' so last night when william went to bed on the servants' side down comes job and takes the front way pretty impudent of him i think and miss i don't know what he see i never says much to him but there they found him in the saddle room at five o'clock this morning with his heels up on a rack and his head down in the bucket and never a bit of sponge had come near the poor mare's eye oh thank you tilly perhaps you had better snuff your candle no ghost will have much chance that comes near my judy and with that i went to bed tired of such nonsense an hour of deep sleep from pure weariness both of mind and body and i awoke with every fibre full of nervous life the moon was high in the south east and three narrow stripes of lozenged light fell upon the old oak floor although my uncle had left the gable where the windows faced the setting sun he still kept to the western wing the house which was built in the reign of henry the eighth covered the site and in some parts embodied the relics of a much more ancient structure the plan was very simple at least as regarded the upstair rooms from east to west ran one long corridor crossed at right angles in the centre and near the ends by three gable passages although there were so many servants not half the rooms were occupied all the best bedrooms had been empty many a year no festivities had filled them since my father's days gloom and terror still hung over the eastern part where he had been so foully murdered in most of the downstair windows along the front of the house the rickety lattice of diamond panes had been replaced by clear plate glass but the old hall and the corridor and some of the gable windows still retained their gorgeous tints and heraldry as the shadows of the mullions stole upon my counterpane there began to creep across my mind uneasy inklings of the ghost a less imaginative man than william edwards i who had often enjoyed his escort knew well there could not be as for job leyson i could not tell with what creative powers his mind might be endowed but to judge from physiognomy a light ring snaffle would hold them thinking with less and less complacence of this apparition story and the red legend which lay beneath it for the spectral lady was believed to be a certain beatrice vaughan daughter of the cavalier who perceived the moss light and heiress of the house years ago thinking of this i say with more and more of flutter i sat up in the bed and listened my uncle's thick irregular breathing the play of an ivy leaf on the mullion the half hour struck by the turret clock were all the sounds i heard except that my heart so listless and desponding was re asserting some right to throb for its own safety with my hand upon it i listened for another minute resolving if i heard nothing more to make a great nest in the pillows i always want three at least and shut both ears to destiny but there came before the minute passed a low long hollow sound an echo of trembling expectation in a moment i leaped from the bed though i had never heard it before i knew it could only be the bloodhound's cautious warning i flung a long cloak round me gathered close my hair hurried velvet slippers on locked my uncle in and quietly opened the outer door there stood giudice in the moonlight with his head towards the far east window his ears laid back his crest erect and in his throat a gurgling sound a growl suppressed by wonder he never turned to look at me nor even wagged his tail but watched and waited grimly i laid my hand upon him and then glided down the corridor avoiding the moonlight patches giudice followed like my shadow never a foot behind me his tread as stealthy as a cat's before i reached the oriel window where the broad light fell something told me to draw aside and watch i withdrew and giudice with me into the dark entrance to my father's room here we would see what came scarcely had i been there ten throbs of the heart when between me and the central light where the moonbeams fell askance rose a tall gray figure i am not quite a coward for a woman at least but every drop of blood within me at that sight stood still even giudice trembled and his growl was hushed and every hair upon him bristled as he crouched into my cloak slowly the form was rising like a corpse raised from a coffin by the loose end of the winding sheet i could not speak i could not move much less could i think with a silent stately walk or glide for no feet could i see the figure came towards the embrasure where we lurked ashy white the face was large the eyes and hollow all the hair fell down the back the form was tall and graceful one arm was lifted as in appeal to heaven and the shroud drooped from it the other lay across the breast the colour of the shroud was gray pale unearthly gray for one moment as it passed i kept my teeth from chattering giudice crawled one step before me with his mind made up for death back the blood leaped to my heart as the apparition glided slowly down the corridor without sigh or footfall what to do i knew not my feet were now unrooted from the ground should i fly into my father's death room no i was afraid to stay where i was seemed best but how could i see it come back as i knew it would another such suspension of my life and all i felt would be over suddenly while still the figure was receding in the distance i saw a great change in the bloodhound he strode into the corridor and began to follow at the same time the deep gurgle in his throat revived in a moment it flashed through me that he had smelt the ghost to be a thing of flesh and blood it might be my father's murderer at any rate it had entered as he must have done close behind the dog i stole after the spectral figure the supernatural horror fled all my life was in my veins what became of me i cared not i who was so wretched almost to the end that gliding form preceded us then turned down a flight of steps leading to the basement triple resolution gushed through me at this this was the spot where the ghost was known to turn and glide back through the corridor when it had descended about half way down the staircase where the steps were on the turn and narrow standing at the head i distinctly heard a flop as of a slipper heel dropping from the foot and then caught up again what ghost was likely to want slippers and what mortal presence need i fear with judy at my side keeping him behind me by a gentle touch i hurried down the stairs luckily i stopped before i turned the corner for a gleam came up the passage the ghost had struck a lucifer it was a dark and narrow passage proof to any moon light and the spectre lost no time in lighting a small lamp to find the study door i mean my uncle's private study where he kept his papers the lamp was of peculiar shape very small and fitted with three reflectors to throw the light in converging planes still remaining in deep shadow i saw the person ghost no longer produce a key open the study door and enter then an attempt was made to lock the door from the inside but as i knew by the sound the false key would not work that way and the door was only closed whispering into judy's ear that if he dared to move for his honest wrath at these burglarious doings could scarcely be controlled i would make a ghost of him next day i left him in the passage and softly followed the intruder first i looked through the key hole the room was very dark and full of heavy furniture i could see nothing but must risk the chance so i slipped in noiselessly and closed the door behind me with the ghostly apparel thrown aside and a mask laid on an ebony desk stood intently occupied at the large bureau which i had once so longed to search my arch enemy mrs daldy i was not at all surprised having felt long since that it could be no other sitting upon a stiff backed velvet chair in the shadow of an oaken bookcase crouch i would not for her i waited to see what she would do already the folding doors of the large bureau were open their creaking had drowned the noise of my entry before her was exposed a multitude of drawers all the visible doors she had probably explored on the previous nights as well as the other repositories of various kinds which the room contained her search was narrowed now to one particular part of this bureau the folding doors were very large and richly inlaid with arabesques and scroll work of satin wood and ebony all the inside was fitted and adorned with ivory pillars small alcoves containing baby mirrors flights of chequered steps and other quaint devices besides the more business like and useful sliding trays with the lamp light flashing on it it looked like a palace for the queen of dolls a place for puppet ceremony and pleasure every drawer was faced with marquetrie every little door had panels of shagreen in short the whole thing would have been the pride of any shop in wardour street when that street was itself having never seen it open till now i was quite astonished though i don't know how often my father had promised to show it to me on my very next birthday if i were good probably i was never good enough without any hesitation mrs daldy pressed a fan or slide of cedar wood in the right corner of the cabinet the slide sunk into a groove and disclosed two deep but narrow drawers these she pulled out from their boxes and laid aside they were full of papers which she no doubt had already examined then she placed the diminutive lamp on one of the doll steps and produced from her pocket three or four little tools before commencing with these she probed and pressed the partition between the sockets of those two drawers in every imaginable way a last attempt to find the countersign of some private nook which had defied her the night before at length with a low cry of impatience she seized a small thin chisel and a bottle of clear liquid with the one she softened the buhl veneer upon the partition's face and with the other she removed it then after a little unscrewing she carefully prized away the stop of cedar wood while i admired her workman like proceedings so far as they were visible to me and the graceful action of the arms she was so proud of her shoulder came rather in my way but i got a glimpse of the narrow vertical opening where the cedar stop had been she drew a long breath of delight and pride then thrust a wire crook into this opening and hooked forth two thin and closely fastened packets eagerly she looked at them they were what she wanted no doubt she knew their contents her object was to get hold of them having placed them carefully in her bosom she prepared for a little more joiner's work to restore what she had dismantled her dexterity was so pleasing that i let her proceed for a while she soon refixed the cedar stop tapping it in the most knowing way with the handle of the screw driver then she screwed it tightly and spread the wood with some liquid cement to carry the veneer she had mislaid the narrow strip of tortoise shell and brass and was looking for it on the chequered steps when i called aloud shall i show you where you put it mrs daldy but where on earth did you learn your trade never was amazement written more strongly on any human face if the ghost had frightened me i now had my full revenge she dropped the bottle of cement and it rolled on the cabinet steps she turned with her face as white as the mask and glared round the room for i was still concealed in the recess i thought she would have blown out the lamp but she had not presence of mind enough otherwise among all that furniture it would not have been easy to catch her and she knew nothing of my sentinel at the door after some quiet enjoyment of her terror i came forth and met her fairly what clara vaughan is it possible i thought you were in london is it possible that i have found a christian so truly earnest about her soul so yearning over the unregenerate committing a black robbery in the dead of night is this what you call a wholesome conviction of sin low exultation i confess but the highest blood in the land if it were blood could scarcely have forborne it for how i abhorred that hypocrite for a time she knew not what to do or say but glared at me without much christian feeling then she tried to carry it off in a grandly superior style she drew herself up and looked as if i were not worth reasoning with perhaps you are young enough to imagine that because appearances are at this moment peculiar thank you there is no need to inquire into the state of my mind be kind enough to restore those packets which you have stolen indeed i am perfectly amazed at your audacity what i have belongs to me righteously and a stronger hand than yours is required to rob me she grasped her chisel and stood in a menacing attitude i answered her very quietly and without approaching nearer if i wish to see you torn in pieces i have only to raise my hand giudice and i gave a peculiar whistle thoroughly known to my dog he leaped against the door forced the worn catch from the guard and stood at my side with his great eyes flashing and his fangs laid bare mrs daldy jumped to the other side of the table and seized a heavy chair my dear child my dear girl i believe you are right after all it is so hard to judge for god's sake keep him back so hard to judge when one's own rights are in question the old unregenerate tendencies will lodge you in gloucester jail to morrow once more those papers or and i looked at giudice and began to raise my hand his eyes were on it and he gathered himself for the spring like a cannon recoiling in the height of her terror she tore her dress open and flung me the packets across the end of the table i examined and fixed them to judy's collar then we both advanced and penned her up in a corner it was so delightful to see her for once in her native meanness despoiled of her cant and phylactery like a pharisee under an oil press she fell on her knees and implored me in plain earnest english for once to let her go she appealed to my self interest and offered me partnership in her schemes whereby alone i could regain the birthright of which i had been so heinously robbed i only asked if she could reveal the mystery of my father's death she could not tell me anything or she would have jumped at the chance at last i promised to let her go if she would show me the secret entrance under the oriel window it was not for her own sake i released her but to avoid the scandal and painful excitement which her trial must have created when she departed now thoroughly crestfallen i followed her out of the house by the secret passage wherein she had stored a few of her stage properties giudice whom for fear of treachery i kept at my side all the time showed his great teeth in the moonlight and almost challenged my right to let her go after taking the packets from him i gave him a sheepskin mat under the window there and left him on guard although there was little chance of another attempt being made while the papers were in my keeping her mask and spectral drapery remained with me as trophies of this my ghostly adventure chapter vii next day when i showed my uncle the two sealed packets which i had rescued and told him all that had happened at first he was overcome with terror and amazement his illness seemed to have banished all his satirical humour and that disdainful apathy which is the negative form of philosophy he took the parcels with a trembling hand and began to examine the seals all safe he said at last all safe to my surprise dear child i owe you more than life this time you have defeated my worst enemy to your care only will i commit these papers one of which i hope will soon be of little value it is my will and by it your father's estates are restored to you while the money which i have saved by my own care and frugality is divided into two portions one for you and the other upon certain events for that worthless mrs daldy this must be altered at once when you have heard my story you may read the will if you like indeed i wish you to do so because it will prove that in spite of all our estrangement i have meant all along to act justly towards you but that you may understand things properly i will tell you my strange history only one thing you must promise before i begin what is it uncle dear that you will forgive me for my one great error although it was the cause of your dear father's death i could not answer for a minute then i took his hand and kissed it as he turned his face away my darling i am not quite strong enough now after all you have been telling me although i had dark suspicions yesterday that some plot was in action for i had observed that things in the study were not as i had left them and i had other reasons too but take me my precious child to the sunny bank this afternoon and please god i will at least begin my tale i begged him in vain to defer it there was a weight upon his mind he said which he must unload so in the early afternoon i wheeled him gently to the sheltered nook there with the breezes way lost among new streets of verdure tall laburnum dangling chains of gold around us and giudice stretching out his paws in sunny yawns of glory i listened to my uncle's tale and was too young to understand the sigh which introduced it how few may tell the story of their lives without remembering how they played with life alas the die thrown once for all but left to roll unwatched and lie uncounted though i cannot tell the story in his impressive way i will try to repeat it so far as my memory serves in his words and with his feelings solemnly and sadly fell the history from his lips for his mind from first to last was burdened with the knowledge that the end was nigh at hand that nothing now remained except to wait with resignation the impending blow story of edgar vaughan i have always been as you know of a roving unsocial nature my father being dead before i was born and my mother having married again before i could walk there was little to counteract my centrifugal tendencies i seemed to belong to neither family though i always clung to the vaughans and disliked the daldys the trustees of my mother's settlement were my virtual guardians for all the vaughan estates being most strictly entailed my father had nothing to dispose of and therefore had made no will my mother's settlement comprised only personal estate for no power had been reserved under the entail to create any charges upon the land the mortgages of which no doubt you have heard as paid off by your father were encumbrances of long standing the estates i need not tell you were shamefully mismanaged during your father's long minority an agent was appointed under the court of chancery and an indolent rogue he was meanwhile your father and myself went through the usual course of education no difference being made in that respect between us although we were only half brothers we were strongly attached to each other especially after a thorough drubbing which your good papa found it his duty to administer to me at eton it did me a world of good before that i had rather despised him for the gentleness of his nature at oxford after your father had left i kept aloof both from the great convivial and from the thinly peopled reading set and lived very much by myself soon as the humorous doings whose humour culminates in the title 'lectures' soon as these were over i was away from the freckled stones punting lazily on the cherwell with french and italian novels or lounging among the gipseys on the steppes of cowley hall i never frequented but dined at some distant tavern and spent the evening and often the night till tom curfew in riding through the lonely lanes towards otmoor aston common or stanlake it was strange that i never fell in love for i had plenty of small adventures and fell in with several pretty girls but never one i cared for gazing on the wreck i am it is no conceit to say that in those times i was considered remarkably good looking of course i was not popular that i never cared for but nobody had reason to dislike me i affected no peculiarity gave myself no airs behaved politely to all who took the trouble to address me and the world which i neither defied nor courted followed its custom in such cases and let me have my way at lincoln's inn my life was much the same except that wherries succeeded punts and evening rides were exchanged for moonlight walks in the park it was reported at home as it is of most men who are called to the bar that i was likely to do great things there never was a chance of it setting aside the question of ability i had no application no love of the law no idea whatever of touting and still more fatal defect my lonely habits were darkening into a shy dislike of my species you have heard that i was extravagant as regards my early career the charge is quite untrue money i confess was never much in my thoughts nor did i ever attempt to buy things below their value but my wants were so few and my mode of life so ungenial that i never exceeded the moderate sum allotted to me as a younger son afterwards this was otherwise and for excellent reasons during the height of the london season i was always most restless and misanthropic not that i looked with envy on the frivolous dust of fashion and clouds of sham around me but that i felt myself lowered as an englishman by the cringing the falsehood the small babooneries which we call 'society' i longed to be if i could but afford it where men have more manly self respect and women more true womanhood your parents were married my darling clara at the end of december six years before your birth upon that occasion your dear father the only man in the world for whom i cared a fig made me a very handsome present in fact he gave me a thousand pounds he would have given me a much larger sum for he was a most liberal man but the estates had suffered from long mismanagement and were seriously encumbered i do not hesitate to say that the gross income of this property is now double what it was when your father succeeded to it and the net income more than quadruple during the four years which elapsed between that event and his marriage he had devoted all he could spare to the clearance of encumbrances and therefore as i said the present he made me was a most generous one more than this he invited and pressed me to come and live on the estate and offered to set me up in a farm which i might hold from him on most advantageous terms upon my refusal he even begged me to accept at a most liberal salary the stewardship of the property and the superintendence of great improvements which he meant to effect i remember as if it were yesterday the very words he used he took my hand in his and with that genial racy smile which very few could resist 'come ned' he cried 'there are but two of us there's room for both in the old nest and you are big enough to thrash me now' at the sweet recollection of his eton drubbing as he called it my poor uncle's eyes grew moist so you see my child instead of grudging your father the property i had every reason to love and revere him however i refused this as well as the other offer but i accepted his present and invested it rather luckily after spending a pleasant month at home as i always called it i returned to london early in april there are no two minds alike any more than there are two bodies and yet how little variety exists in polite society surely it were more reasonable to wedge the infant face into a jelly mould to flute its ears and cheeks like collared head and grow the nose and lips and eyebrows into rosettes and grapes and acorns than to bow and cramp and squeeze a million minds into one set model yet here i find men all alike dane and saxon celt and norman like those who walk where snow is deep or alpine travellers lashed to a rope trudging each in other's footprint swinging all their arms in time looking neither right nor left and so on through life's pilgrimage a file some million deep who went first they do not know why they follow they cannot tell what it leads to they never ask i was marked and scorned at once because i dared to adopt a hat that did not scalp me in half an hour and a cravat that did not throttle me and even had the hardihood to dine when i felt hungry how often i longed for a land of freedom and common sense where it is no disgrace to carry a barrel of oysters or shake hands with a tradesman i know what you are smiling at clara you are thinking to yourself 'how different you are now my good uncle and wern't you a little inconsistent in sanctioning all this livery humbug here' yes i am different now i am older and wiser than to expect to wipe away with my coat sleeve the oxide of many centuries as for the livery it makes them happy it is an englishman's uniform and i have seen and suffered so bitterly from the violence of an untamed race that i admire less what i used to call the unlassoed arch of the human neck i have seen a coarse line somewhere 'and freedom made a deal too free with me' which expresses briefly the moral of my life however at the time i speak of nursing perhaps a younger son's bias against the social laws and fresh from the true simplicity and unaffected warmth of your father's character and the gentle sweetness of your mother's i could not sit on the spikes of fashion's hackney coach as becomes a poor briton till the driver whips behind finding of course that no one cared whether i sat there or not and that all i got at the side of the road was pea shots from cads in the dickey i did what thousands have done before me and will probably do again i voted my fellow britons a parcel of drivelling slaves and longed to be out of the gang perhaps i should never have made my escape for like most of my class i spent all my energy in small eccentricity if it had not been for what we idlers entitle the force of circumstances at a time when my life was flowing on calmly enough though babbling against its banks it came suddenly on an event which drove it into another and rougher channel early one afternoon in the month of april i launched my little boat from the temple stairs where i kept it and feeling more than usually saturnine and moody resolved on a long expedition so i victualled my ship like robinson crusoe and took some wraps and coverings it was then slack water just at the height of the flood i meant to have gone to richmond but being far too indolent to struggle against the tide i yielded to nature's good pleasure and pulled away down stream in a few minutes a rapid ebb tide was running and i made up my mind to go with it as far as ever it chose and to return with the flood whenever that pleased to meet me after rowing steadily for several hours i found myself a long way past my customary cape turn again with a strong ebb tide as well as a land fresh in the river i had got beyond barking reach and as far as the dagenham marshes here some muddy creeks pills and sluggish channels wind and welter among the ooze lands on the north side of the thames all around them stretches and fades away a dreary flat monotonous waste no dot of a house no jot of a tree to vary the dead expanse except that by the river side one or two low cabooses more like hoys than houses are grounded among the slime this so far as my memory serves was the state of these essex marshes in the year how it is now i cannot say it was high time for me to turn row as i would i could hardly get back to my haven by midnight outrigger skiffs were not yet known and an oarsman could not glide along at the rate of ten miles an hour just as i was working round a steam packet which had been moored a short way below crippled perhaps in her engines now at the turn of the tide passed up and was quickly out of sight as she passed me i hailed for a tow rope but either they could not hear or they did not choose to notice me there was nothing for it but to bend my back to the oars and keep a sharp look out presently the flood began to make strongly up the river and i gave way with a will my paddles bending and the water gleaming in the early starlight it was a lonely and melancholy scene the gray mist returning from some marshy excursion and hugging the warm sea water floated along in dull folds with a white flaw of steam here and there curdling over the current not a ship not a barge was in sight no voice of men or low of cattle broke the foggy silence but the wash of the stream on its sludgy marge or on some honey combed mooring post surged every now and then betwixt the jerks of my rowlocks the loneliness and the sadness harmonised with my sombre mind all is transient all is selfish all is a flux of melancholy if we toss and dance we are only boats adrift we are nothing more than crazy tide posts if we be philosophers suddenly a clear loud cry broke my vacant musings it startled me so that i caught a crab ceased rowing and gazed around at first i could not tell whence it came till my boat with the way she had on her shot round a low spit of the essex shore which from the curve of the river i was nearing rapidly louder and louder the cry was twice repeated and i heard in the still spring evening the oaths of men and the scuffling of feet within fifty yards of me was an ill looking house made of battens and raised on piles above high water mark a tattered sign hung on a pole and a causeway led to the steps while i was hesitating two figures crossed a lattice window as if in violent struggle and a heavy crash resounded three strong strokes of my oars and the keel grated on the causeway out i leaped with the boat hook threw the painter over a post and rushed up the slimy jetty and the narrow wooden steps the door was fastened i pushed it with all my force but in vain one faint scream reached my ears as of some one at length overpowered swinging the boat hook with both hands i struck the old door with the butt and broke it open in the lower room there was no one but a moaning and trampling sounded over head upstairs i ran and into the room where the villany was doing a poor girl lay on the floor at the last gasp of exhaustion two ruffians with a rope were bending over her down went one at a blow of my boat hook flat beside his victim the other leaped at my throat i saw and soon felt that he was a powerful man but in those days i was no cripple we were most evenly matched i wrenched his hand from my throat but twice he got me under him twice i writhed from his grasp like a python from a tiger's jaw clutched and locked in each other's arms in vain we tugged to get room for a blow throttle and gripe and roll which should be first insensible an accident gave me the mastery for a moment we lay face to face glaring at each other drawing the strangled breath loosing the deadly grip panting throbbing and watching my boat hook lay on the floor my enemy spied and made a sudden dash at it instead of withholding i jobbed him towards it with all my might and as he raised it the point entered one of his eyes with a yell of pain and fury he sank beneath me insensible shaking and quaking all over after the desperate struggle i bound him and his mate hand and foot with the twisted tarry junk which they had meant for the maiden at length i had time to look round on a low truckle bed at the end of the long dark room in which a ship lamp was burning there lay an elderly lady in a perfect stupor of fright and illness upon the floor with her head thrown back against the timbers and her black eyes wide open and fixed on me sat a girl of remarkable beauty though her cheeks were as white as death a magnificent ring for which she had fought most desperately was wrenched from its place on her finger and hung over the opal nail for her hands were clenched and her arms quite stiff in the swoon of utter exhaustion both ladies were in deep mourning for the rest a few words will suffice the poor ladies revived at last after chafing of hands and sprinkling and told me where to find the woman of the house who had been locked up in another room by her husband and brother there was no one else on the premises how came the ladies there what was their destination and why were they so outraged they were on their return to london from the continent being called home by tidings of death and had sailed from antwerp two days and a half before in the steamer which i had seen lying to steamers were then heavy lumbering things and all that time mrs green and her daughter had been knocking about on a pecky sea no wonder that the poor mother had cried out feebly to be landed anywhere anywhere in the world where things would leave off going round and before they came to that tedious halt in the river fair adelaide who had enjoyed her meals throughout renewed and completed her poor mamma's excavation by inquiring calmly with her mouth full of pickled pork where the peas pudding was now too miss adelaide soon recovered from her fearful battle for honour and life she was what is called now a days a girl of splendid organisation if she had not been so she would have lain ere now with her mother at the bottom of barking reach the two scoundrels of that lonesome hostelry had been ordered to send to barking for a conveyance but they only pretended to do so for they had cast foul covetous eyes on the wealth of their unknown guests and on brave adelaide's beauty beyond a doubt both ladies would have been murdered but for the gallant resistance the vigour and presence of mind of adelaide having restored their watches and scattered trinkets and led the poor things from the scene of the combat i was quite at a loss for means to convey them home barking was a long way off and the marshy track unknown to me and not likely to be found in the dark moreover there must be some hazard in leaving them still in that villanous den no matter how their cowardly foes might be bound at last and with great difficulty i embarked the two ladies in my shallop and wrapped them warmly from the night air then after relashing my prisoners and locking them up in separate rooms and the woman downstairs i pulled away stoutly for woolwich here i obtained a carriage and started my convoy for london and then returned with two policemen to the old row barge as the low caboose was called but both our birds were flown as i was inclined to expect most likely the woman had contrived to get out and release them at any rate the old row barge had no crew and the deserters had set it on fire the flames as we rowed away after vainly searching the marshes cast a lurid glow on the mud banks and on the slackening tide a true type it was of what soon befell me the burning of my caboose the two men were caught long afterwards by the thames police and transported for life on a conviction for river piracy at least i was told that they were the men and of course dear uncle you fell deeply in love with the beautiful adelaide green of course my dear a young lady would conclude so but at present i must not talk any more i had several times tried to stop him and what i have next to relate is matter of deeper feeling by jove to think how i battled with that strong man and now your little fist clara would floor me altogether he sighed and i sighed for him then i thought of mr shelfer and gloried in my prowess as i wheeled my uncle home chapter viii my uncle's tale as repeated here will no more be broken either by my interruptions which were frequent enough or by his own pauses but will be presented in a continuous form story of edgar vaughan on the following day when i called at the house in bloomsbury then a fashionable neighbourhood to which i had been directed i was met at the threshold with power and warmth by peter green himself an old acquaintance of mine who proved to be adelaide's brother my nature had been too reserved for me to be friendly with him at college but i had liked him much better than any one else because he was so decided and straight forward the meeting rather surprised me for green is not a rare name and so it had never occurred to me to ask the weary adelaide whether she knew one peter green a first class man of christchurch peter who was a most hearty fellow and full like his sister of animal life overpowered me with the weight of his gratitude which i did not at all desire or deserve as in spite of your rash conclusion my romantic clara i did not fall in love with adelaide who besides her pithsome health and vigour was in many respects astray from my fair ideal and more than all was engaged long ago to the giver of the sapphire ring i need not enlarge upon my friendship with peter green whom i now began to like in real earnest young as he was his father's recent death had placed him at the head of a leading mercantile house green vowler and green of little distaff lane and young as he was not more than seven and twenty his manners were formed and his character and opinions fixed as if he had seen all the ways and taken stock of the sentiments of all the civilised world present to him any complexity any conflict of probabilities any maze whose ins and outs were abroad half over the universe and if the question were practical he would see what to do in a moment if it were theoretical he would quietly move it aside i have known many learned judges sum up a case most lucidly blow away all the verbiage sweep aside all the false issues balance the contradictions illuminate all the obscurities and finally lift from its matrix and lay in the colourless sunlight the virgin truth without either dross or polish all this peter green seemed to have done in a moment without any effort without any reasoning process not jumping at his conclusion but making it fly to him he possessed what an ancient writer once highly esteemed at oxford entitles the wit universal which confers and comprises the wit of details for this power when applied to a practical purpose a great historian employs a happy expression not welcomed by our language he calls it the power to pontoon the emergency excuse my harsh translation perhaps it is better than paraphrase with all these business qualities my friend was as merry and unpretentious a man as ever made a bad joke or laughed at another fellow's liberal also warm hearted and not sarcastic in a word he was a genuine specimen of the noble english merchant who has done more to raise this country in the esteem of the world than would a thousand nelsons or wellingtons now this man discerned at a glance the wretched defects of my nature and position an active mind like his could never believe in the possibility of being happy without occupation and by occupation he meant not the chasing of butterflies or maundering after foxes but real honest anglo saxon work work that strings the muscles or knits the hemispheres of the brain and work he would himself ay and with all his energies not the man was he to tap the table with his pipe and cry out bravo altiora a little more gin if you please and chalk it down to the strike but he was the man to throw off his coat and pitch into the matter before him without many words though with plenty of thought now this man feeling deeply indebted to me and beginning to like me as my apathy and reserve went to pieces before his energy this man i say cast about for some method of making me useful and happy wonderfully swift as he was in pouncing upon the right thing i believe it took him at least five minutes to find out the proper course for an impracticable fellow like me and when he had found this out it took even him a week to draw the snail out of his hole years of agreeable indolence and calm objective indifference seldom ruffled except at fashionable snobbery had made of me not a sybarite or a supercilious censor much less a waiter on fortune but a contemplative islander a haytian who had been once to spain and would henceforth be satisfied with the view of her caravels but my adelantado was a man of gold and iron green vowler and green were largely concerned in the oil and dried fruit business they had ransacked the olive districts of continental europe and found the price going up and the quality going down so they wanted now to open another oil vein peter green observing my love of uncultured freedom the only subject on which i ever grew warm and rapturous espied the way to relieve me of some nonsense give my slow life a fillip and perhaps oh climax open a lucrative connexion he knew for he seemed to know everything done or undone by commerce that there was a glorious island rich in jewels and marble and every dower of nature and above all teeming with olives lemons and grapes and citrons and that this gifted island still remained a stranger through french and genoese ignorance to our london trade this was the island libelled by seneca idolised by its natives drenched with more blood than all the plains of emathia yet mother of heroes and conquerors of the world if that be any credit in a single word corsica once or twice indeed our countrymen have attempted to shake hands with this noble race so ruined by narrow tradition and in the end we shall doubtless succeed as we always do but the grain of the corsican is almost as stubborn as our own in fact the staple is much the same the fabric is very different bold they are and manly simple generous and most hospitable lovers too of their country beyond all other nations but oh fatal ignorance industry to them is drudgery and labour is an outrage worse than all is the fiend of the island the cursed blood revenge just the place for you vaughan said the indomitable peter every one there as dignified as an eagle after stealing a lamb no institutions to speak of but the natural one of vendetta splendid equality majestic manhood lots of true womanhood and it does all the work that is done which isn't saying much why my dear quixotic the land of sampiero and paoli and where rousseau was to legislate only he proved too lazy is not that the jockey for you after all these levees and masquerades that you so much delight in you need not scowl like a bandit it is only because they don't want you you are just the same as the rest or why do you notice the nonsense after all this london frippery monte kotondo will be a fresh oyster after devil'd biscuits true enough my friend but an oyster to be swallowed shell and all well is not that just what you want lime is good for squeamishness and more than that you are just the man we want you can talk italian with excellent opera style and sentiment and you won't be long till you fraternise with the corsicans perhaps they will drive out the french who don't know what to do with it and make you their king like theodore of neuhoff and then you proclaim free trade restricted to the navy of green vowler and green but in sober earnest think of it my dear vaughan anything is better than this cynic indolence some of your views will be corrected and all enlarged by travel a common sentiment yes the very thing you are short of all your expenses we pay of course and give you an honest salary and all we ask of you is to explore more than a tourist would and to send us a plain description of everything you have plenty of observation make it useful instead of a torment to you we know well enough the great gifts of that island but we want to know how they lie and how we may best get at them then you would expect me to make commercial arrangements peter laughed outright i should rather fancy not somewhat queer ones they would be platonic no doubt and panisic but not altogether adapted to double entry then in fact i am to go as a committee of inquiry i have told you all we want if you make any friends all the better but that we leave to yourself perhaps you'll grow sociable there though the corsican does not sing 'we won't go home till morning' and be going home all the time and how long would my engagement last till you have thoroughly traversed the country if you stick to it so long and then if you quit yourself well we should commission you for sardinia what an opening for an idle man though it would soon kill me so little to do but you may cut it short when you like plenty of our people would jump at such an offer but for a country like that we must have a thorough gentleman a coarse mannered bagman would very soon secure the contents of a fusil he would be kissing the corsican girls who are wonderfully lovely they say and their lovers amazingly jealous and every man carries a gun a timid man they despise an insolent man they shoot and most of our fellows are one or the other or both but will you undertake it yes or no on the spot and i ask you to say 'yes' as a special favour to me then of course i say yes when shall i go to morrow if you like next month if you prefer it we can give you introductions there is no real danger for a thorough gentleman or you should not go for all the olives in europe mind we want a particular sort very long and taper virgil's 'ray' in fact you shall have a sample of it as yet we know but one district of italy where it grows but have got scent of it in corsica glorious fellows they are if half that i hear is true glorious fellows but for their laziness and that vendetta to be brief i received very clear instructions in writing and was off for bonifazio the following week in a small swift yacht of my own a luxury to which i had always aspired and which i could now for a time afford but before i went your poor father clara protested most strongly against the scheme and even came to london in the vain hope of dissuading me he had some deep presentiment that it would end darkly and so indeed it did ned said he once more there are only two of us and my dear wife is very delicate i have been at genoa where those islanders are well known and even there they are rarely spoken of but with a cold shudder they are a splendid race i believe great heroes and all that but they shoot a man with no more compunction than they shoot a muffro i implore you my dear brother not to risk the last of our family where blood flows as freely as water and your temper you know is not the best in the world don't go my dear fellow don't go i shall have to come and avenge you and i don't understand vendetta ah me if i had only listened to him and yet i don't know after a pleasant voyage we reached the magnificent island about the middle of may my intention was to skirt round it from the southern extremity taking the western side first and touching at every anchorage whence i would make incursions and return to my little cutter as the most convenient head quarters of course i should have to rough it but what young man would think twice of that with an adventurous life before him i will not weary you my dear child with a long description of corsica it is a land which combines all the softness and the majesty all the wealth and barrenness all the smile and menace of all the world beside i could talk of it by the hour but you want to know what i did and was done to more than what i saw from the awful rock of bonifazio the streets where men should have no elbows and the tower of torrione along the fantastic coast which looks as if time were a giant rabbit we traced the blue and spur vexed sea now edged with white and now with gray and now with glowing red until we reached that paradise of heaven the garden of balagna chapter ix story of edgar vaughan let me hold myself weak as i am and crippled by premature old age not the shortness of my breath not the numbness of my heart not even the palsy of my frame can quench or check the fire rekindled by the mere name of that heavenly valley to live there only half a minute is worth a day of english life life it is a space to measure not by pendulum or clock hand not by our own strides to and fro the ordnance scale of the million not even by the rolling sun and nature's hail and farewell but by the well spring of ourselves the fount of thought and feeling every single breath i draw of this living air air the bride of earth our sire wedded to him by god creator air whose mother milk we fight for in clusters baulking one another every breath i draw dances with a buoyant virtue sucked in any other land but from mountain nipples bright air of a rosy blue where northern eyes are dazed with beauty where every flower cuts stars of light and every cloud is sunshine's step can even lovers parted thus believe themselves divided every rock has its myrtle favour every tree its clematis wreath under the cistus and oleander hides the pink to lace its bodice watched by the pansy's sprightly eye lavishly as children's bubbles hover overhead oranges and citrons lemons almonds figs varied by the blushing peach and the purpling grape far behind and leaning forth the swarthy bosom of the mountain whose white head leans on the heaven are ranks on ranks of glaucous olive giants of a green old age dashed with silver gray and oh the fragrance under foot the tribute of the ground which corsica's great son as we men measure greatness pined for in the barren isle where the iron of his selfishness entered his own soul these are said to be the largest olive trees in the world and of the very best varieties heaps upon heaps the rich fruit lies at the foot of the glorious tree nature is too bountiful for man to heed her gifts for this district of balagna and that of nebbio further north my attention had been especially bespoken by my shrewd and sagacious friend therefore and by reason of the charms around me here i resolved to pass the summer so my vessel was laid up at calvi and being quartered in belgodere at a little inn locanda it should be called but i hate interlarding i addressed myself right heartily to business and to pleasure first i had to study the grand palladian gift unless old seneca was as the corsicans say a great liar he cannot have been the author of that epigram which declares this land a stranger to the peaceful boon it is impossible to believe that a country so adapted to that tree so often colonized by cultured races can have been so long ungifted with its staff of life the island itself in that same epigram is utterly mis described as regards the inhabitants the first line of the well known couplet is verified by ages to the second it does not plead guilty now and probably never did law the first revenge law the second to live by robbery law the third to lie the fourth to deny any gods the corsicans on the contrary have always been famous for candour whose very soul is truth and for superstition the wen or hump of religion for my own part loving not that unprincipled fellow hard labour towards whom these noble islanders entertain a like antipathy and loving much any freedom not hostile to my own i got on with the natives admirably for a certain time time had reconciled me to their custom of carrying instead of cane or umbrella long double barrelled guns whose muzzle they afford the stranger full opportunity of inspecting first rate marksmen are they but they sling their guns at hap hazard on their backs and cheek to jowl we come upon the cold metal at the corner of the narrow streets tall and powerful men they are especially the mountaineers with all the spaniard's dignity and the italian's native grace the women are lithe erect and beautifully formed with a swan like carriage and a free and courteous bearing such as very few of our high born damsels own labor improbus of virgil the olive growers frankly gave me all their little information about that tree whose typical virtues they have never cared to learn the variety chiefly grown or rather which chiefly grows itself is one they call the genoese the owners afford them very little culture and many are too idle even to collect the fruit there are said to be ten million olive trees in the island at least they were reckoned up to that number by order of the government then the enumerators grew tired and left off counting whatever number there is might easily be tripled if any one had the energy to graft the oleasters with which the hills are covered there is also the saracen olive and the sabine the latter perhaps the regia of columella raggiaria of caesalpinus and radius of virgil however though not unlike my sample fruit it was not quite identical and as my employers wanted a very special sort for very special qualities i was as far from my object as ever one magnificent summer evening as i rode along the mountain side near the village of speloncato suddenly the track turned sharply into a wooded dingle steeped in the dream of nature's beauty i was thinking of nothing at all as becomes a true corsican when i received a sharpish knock in the eye something fell and lodged in my capacious beard smarting from the pain i caught it and not being able to see clearly took it at first for a spent and dropping bullet but when my eyes had ceased to water i found in my hand a half grown olive of the very kind i had so long been seeking i drew forth some of my london specimens which had been chemically treated to prevent their shrivelling and compared it narrowly yes there could be no doubt the same pyriform curve the same bulge near the peduncle the same violet lines in the skin and when cut open the same granulation and nucleus i was truly delighted at length i should be of some real service at least if there were many trees here of this most rare variety by riding up the dingle i soon ascertained that it was planted with trees of this sort only gray old trees of a different habit from any other olive afterwards i found that it requires a different soil and a different aspect full speed i galloped back to the hamlet of speloncato and inquired for the owner of this olive eldorado signor dezio della croce owner of all this lovely slope and of large estates extending as far as the road to corte in fact the chief proprietor of the neighbourhood he was said the peasant with some pride a true descendant of the great race of cinarca foremost in the island annals for a thousand years and of whom was the famous giudice della rocca count and judge of corsica six hundred years ago at the sound of his name giudice opened his great sleepy eyes and pricked his ears i promised not to interrupt but he gave no such pledge let the cinarchesi blood go for its full value but it was worth something to the della croce to be descended also from the tuscan malaspina for the lands of those great marquises were now in the possession of the signor dezio and the signor had such a daughter a young maiden ah madonna the loveliest girl in corsica and the vine dresser crossed himself as i listened to all this information i began to look through my unused credentials which i always carried it struck me that this name of della croce was quite familiar to me though i knew not how until a letter in the sprawling hand of young laurence daldy fell out from among peter's crabbed characters laurence daldy my mother's younger son was now in full career as a pigeon and a guardsman spending at full gallop his dead father's money these daldys were of italian origin the true name being d'aldis which after some years of english life they had naturalised into daldy and now i recollected that when we vaughan boys scorned them as ignoble sons of commerce they used to brag about their kinship to the ancient della croce riding up the forest hill on whose western bluff stands boldly the gray old tower of the malaspinas i began of course to make forecasts about the character of my host my host i knew he needs must be for corsica is of all the world the most hospitable spot although by this time well acquainted with the simple island habits i could not but expect to find a man of stateliness and surroundings of stiffness and some arrogance now the sun was setting and the western fire from off the sea glanced in spears of reddening gold into the solemn timeworn keep all things looked majestic but a deal too lonely where was i to apply how was i to get in the narrow doorway overhung with the wreck of some portcullis was blocked instead with a sort of mantlet like the roman vinea the loopholes on the ground tier were boarded almost to the top the high windows such as they were had their rough shutters closed everything betokened a state of siege and fear two or three magnificent chesnuts which must have commanded the front of the tower had been cut down and added to the defences of the approach over these i managed at last to leap my horse who was by no means a perfect hunter and there i halted at a loss how to proceed i had been long enough in corsica to know even without a certain ominous gleam from a loophole and the view in transverse section of a large double barrelled gun that the owner of this old mansion was now in the pleasant state of vendetta expecting every moment to be shot and nothing said about it i waved my letter as a white flag furiously above my head presently that frightful muzzle was withdrawn and the slide pushed back to reconnoitre me at leisure i tried for the first time in my life to look like a real briton my corsican ambition was already on the wane so i sat my horse and waited and what came was worth a thousand years of waiting round the bastion of the tower under the rich magnolia bloom towards me glided through the rosy shadow the loveliest being that ever moved outside the gates of heaven she seemed not to walk but waft along like the pearly nautilus a pink mandile of lightest gauze lit the sable of her clustering hair and wreathing round her graceful head deepened the tinge of the nestling cheeks the lithe faldetta of white cashmere thrown hastily over the shoulders half concealed the flowing curves of the slender supple form half betrayed them as it followed every facile motion but when she smiled oh clara i would have leaped from her father's tower or into the black caves of the restonica for one smile of hers the dark fringed lustre of her eyes seemed to dance with golden joy trusting hoping loving all things pleasure pleased at pleasing and the gleesome arch of her laughing lips that never shaped evil word oh my lily my own lily i shall see you soon again my dear clara i ought to know better i am ashamed of myself and after so many years but at the first glance of fiordalisa my fate was fixed for this life and the other i never had loved before i never had cared to look at a girl in fact i despised them all now i paid for that contemptuous folly loving at one glance loving once for all for ever my heart stood still like the focus of a hurricane my speech and every power but that of vision failed me i dared not try to leave the saddle such a trembling took me it was a visitation unknown in our foggy plains scoffed at by our prosy race but known full well in southern climes as the sunstroke of love my own darling i can call her nothing less my own delicious darling was quite startled at me whether she had a like visitation in a milder form is more than i can say but i hope with all my heart she had for then as the southern tale recites god placed her hand in mine how i got my horse tied up how i followed her through the side entrance and returned her father's greeting i have not the least idea all i know is that she smiled and i wanted nothing more but i could not bear to see her in the true homeric fashion still maintained in corsica waiting on us like a common servant with her beautiful arched feet glancing under the brown pelone and her tapering white arms laid demurely on her bosom then at her father's signal how she flew for the purple grapes or the fragrant broccio but do what she would it seemed to become her more than all she had done before as that form of love and elegance flitted through the simple room and those lustrous heavenly eyes beamed with hospitable warmth signor dezio della croce careworn man with beard of snow seemed at times no little proud of his sweet and only child but was too proud to show his pride as for me he must have thought that i spoke very poor italian end of vol ii london r clay son and taylor printers bread street hill

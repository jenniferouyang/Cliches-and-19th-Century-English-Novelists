crocker's hole by r d blackmore from slain by the doones by r d blackmore copyright dodd mead and company chapter i the culm which rises in somersetshire and hastening into a fairer land as the border waters wisely do falls into the exe near killerton formerly was a lovely trout stream such as perverts the devonshire angler from due respect toward father thames and the other canals round london in the devonshire valleys it is sweet to see how soon a spring becomes a rill and a rill runs on into a rivulet and a rivulet swells into a brook and before one has time to say what are you at before the first tree it ever spoke to is a dummy or the first hill it ever ran down has turned blue here we have all the airs and graces demands and assertions of a full grown river but what is the test of a river who shall say the power to drown a man replies the river darkly but rudeness is not argument rather shall we say that the power to work a good undershot wheel without being dammed up all night in a pond and leaving a tidy back stream to spare at the bottom of the orchard is a fair certificate of riverhood if so many devonshire streams attain that rank within five miles of their spring aye and rapidly add to it at every turn they gather aid from ash clad dingle and aldered meadow mossy rock and ferny wall hedge trough roofed with bramble netting where the baby water lurks and lanes that coming down to ford bring suicidal tribute arrogant all engrossing river now it has claimed a great valley of its own and whatever falls within the hill scoop sooner or later belongs to itself even the crystal shutt that crosses the farmyard by the woodrick and glides down an aqueduct of last year's bark for mary to fill the kettle from and even the tricklets that have no organs for telling or knowing their business but only get into unwary oozings in and among the water grass and there make moss and forget themselves among it one and all they come to the same thing at last and that is the river the culm used to be a good river at culmstock tormented already by a factory but not strangled as yet by a railroad how it is now the present writer does not know and is afraid to ask having heard of a vile culm valley line but culm stock bridge was a very pretty place to stand and contemplate the ways of trout which is easier work than to catch them when i was just big enough to peep above the rim or to lie upon it with one leg inside for fear of tumbling over what a mighty river it used to seem for it takes a treat there and spreads itself above the bridge the factory stream falls in again having done its business and washing its hands in the innocent half that has strayed down the meadows then under the arches they both rejoice and come to a slide of about two feet and make a short wide pool below and indulge themselves in perhaps two islands through which a little river always magnifies itself and maintains a mysterious middle but after that all of it used to come together and make off in one body for the meadows intent upon nurturing trout with rapid stickles and buttercuppy corners where fat flies may tumble in and here you may find in the very first meadow or at any rate you might have found forty years ago the celebrated crocker's hole the story of crocker is unknown to me and interesting as it doubtless was i do not deal with him but with his hole tradition said that he was a baker's boy who during his basket rounds fell in love with a maiden who received the cottage loaf or perhaps good households for her master's use no doubt she was charming as a girl should be but whether she encouraged the youthful baker and then betrayed him with false role or whether she consisted throughout as our cousins across the water express it is known to their manes only enough that she would not have the floury lad and that he after giving in his books and money sought an untimely grave among the trout and this was the first pool below the bread walk deep enough to drown a five foot baker boy sad it was but such things must be and bread must still be delivered daily a truce to such reflections as our foremost writers always say when they do not see how to go on with them but it is a serious thing to know what crocker's hole was like because at a time when if he had only persevered and married the maid and succeeded to the oven and reared a large family of short weight bakers he might have been leaning on his crutch beside the pool and teaching his grandson to swim by precept that beautiful proxy for practice at such a time i say there lived a remarkably fine trout in that hole anglers are notoriously truthful especially as to what they catch or even more frequently have not caught though i may have written fiction among many other sins as a nice old lady told me once now i have to deal with facts and foul scorn would i count it ever to make believe that i caught that fish my length at that time was not more than the butt of a four jointed rod and all i could catch was a minnow with a pin which our cook lydia would not cook but used to say oh what a shame master richard they would have been trout in the summer please god if you would only a' let 'em grow on she is living now and will bear me out in this but upon every great occasion there arises a great man or to put it more accurately in the present instance a mighty and distinguished boy my father being the parson of the parish and getting need it be said small pay took sundry pupils very pleasant fellows about to adorn the universities among them was the original bude light as he was satirically called at cambridge for he came from bude and there was no light in him among them also was john pike a born zebedee if ever there was one john pike was a thick set younker with a large and bushy head keen blue eyes that could see through water and the proper slouch of shoulder into which great anglers ripen but greater still are born with it and of these was master john it mattered little what the weather was and scarcely more as to the time of year john pike must have his fishing every day and on sundays he read about it and made flies all the rest of the time he was thinking about it my father was coaching him in the fourth book of the aeneid and all those wonderful speeches of dido where passion disdains construction but the only line pike cared for was of horsehair i fear mr pike that you are not giving me your entire attention my father used to say in his mild dry way and once when pike was more than usually abroad his tutor begged to share his meditations well sir said pike who was very truthful i can see a green drake by the strawberry tree the first of the season and your derivation of 'barbarous' put me in mind of my barberry dye in those days it was a very nice point to get the right tint for the mallard's feather no sooner was lesson done than pike whose rod was ready upon the lawn dashed away always for the river rushing headlong down the hill and away to the left through a private yard where no thoroughfare was put up and a big dog stationed to enforce it but cerberus himself could not have stopped john pike his conscience backed him up in trespass the most sinful when his heart was inditing of a trout upon the rise all this however is preliminary as the boy said when he put his father's coat upon his grandfather's tenterhooks with felonious intent upon his grandmother's apples the main point to be understood is this that nothing neither brazen tower hundred eyed argus nor cretan minotaur could stop john pike from getting at a good stickle but even as the world knows nothing of its greatest men its greatest men know nothing of the world beneath their very nose till fortune sneezes dexter for two years john pike must have been whipping the water as hard as xerxes without having ever once dreamed of the glorious trout that lived in crocker's hole but why when he ought to have been at least on bowing terms with every fish as long as his middle finger why had he failed to know this champion the answer is simple because of his short cuts flying as he did like an arrow from a bow pike used to hit his beloved river at an elbow some furlong below crocker's hole where a sweet little stickle sailed away down stream whereas for the length of a meadow upward the water lay smooth clear and shallow therefore the youth with so little time to spare rushed into the downward joy and here it may be noted that the leading maxim of the present period that man can discharge his duty only by going counter to the stream was scarcely mooted in those days my grandfather who was a wonderful man if he was accustomed to fill a cart in two days of fly fishing on the barle regularly fished down stream and what more than a cartload need anyone put into his basket and surely it is more genial and pleasant to behold our friend the river growing and thriving as we go on strengthening its voice and enlargening its bosom and sparkling through each successive meadow with richer plenitude of silver than to trace it against its own grain and good will toward weakness and littleness and immature conceptions however you will say that if john pike had fished up stream he would have found this trout much sooner and that is true but still as it was the trout had more time to grow into such a prize and the way in which john found him out was this for some days he had been tormented with a very painful tooth which even poisoned all the joys of fishing therefore he resolved to have it out and sturdily entered the shop of john sweetland the village blacksmith and there paid his sixpence sweetland extracted the teeth of the village whenever they required it in the simplest and most effectual way a piece of fine wire was fastened round the tooth and the other end round the anvil's nose then the sturdy blacksmith shut the lower half of his shop door which was about breast high with the patient outside and the anvil within a strong push of the foot upset the anvil and the tooth flew out like a well thrown fly when john pike had suffered this very bravely ah master pike said the blacksmith with a grin i reckon you won't pull out thic there big vish the smithy commanded a view of the river clever as you be quite so peart as thiccy what big fish asked the boy with deepest interest though his mouth was bleeding fearfully why that girt mortial of a vish as hath his hover in crocker's hole zum on 'em saith as a' must be a zammon off went pike with his handkerchief to his mouth and after him ran alec bolt one of his fellow pupils who had come to the shop to enjoy the extraction oh my was all that pike could utter when by craftily posting himself he had obtained a good view of this grand fish i'll lay you a crown you don't catch him cried bolt an impatient youth who scorned angling how long will you give me asked the wary pike who never made rash wagers oh till the holidays if you like or if that won't do till michaelmas now the midsummer holidays were six weeks off boys used not to talk of vacations then still less of recesses i think i'll bet you said pike in his slow way bending forward carefully with his keen eyes on this monster but it would not be fair to take till michaelmas i'll bet you a crown that i catch him before the holidays at least unless some other fellow does chapter ii the day of that most momentous interview must have been the th of may of the year i will not be so sure for children take more note of days than of years for which the latter have their full revenge thereafter it must have been the th because the morrow was our holiday given upon the th of may in honour of a birthday now john pike was beyond his years wary as well as enterprising calm as well as ardent quite as rich in patience as in promptitude and vigour but alec bolt was a headlong youth volatile hot and hasty fit only to fish the maelstrom or a torrent of new lava and the moment he had laid that wager he expected his crown piece though time as the lawyers phrase it was expressly of the essence of the contract and now he demanded that pike should spend the holiday in trying to catch that trout i shall not go near him that lad replied until i have got a new collar no piece of personal adornment was it without which he would not act but rather that which now is called the fly cast or the gut cast or the trace or what it may be and another thing continued pike the bet is off if you go near him either now or at any other time without asking my leave first and then only going as i tell you what do i want with the great slimy beggar the arrogant bolt made answer a good rat is worth fifty of him no fear of my going near him pike you shan't get out of it that way pike showed his remarkable qualities that day by fishing exactly as he would have fished without having heard of the great crockerite he was up and away upon the mill stream before breakfast and the forenoon he devoted to his favourite course first down the craddock stream a very pretty confluent of the culm and from its junction down the pleasant hams where the river winds toward uffculme it was my privilege to accompany this hero as his humble sancho while bolt and the faster race went up the river ratting we were back in time to have pike's trout which ranged between two ounces and one half pound fried for the early dinner and here it may be lawful to remark that the trout of the culm are of the very purest excellence by reason of the flinty bottom at any rate in these the upper regions for the valley is the western outlet of the black down range with the beacon hill upon the north and hackpen long ridge to the south and beyond that again the whetstone hill upon whose western end dark port holes scarped with white grit mark the pits but flint is the staple of the broad culm valley under good well pastured loam and here are chalcedonies and agate stones at dinner everybody had a brace of trout large for the larger folk little for the little ones with coughing and some patting on the back for bones what of equal purport could the fierce rat hunter show pike explained many points in the history of each fish seeming to know them none the worse and love them all the better for being fried we banqueted neither a whit did soul get stinted of banquet impartial then the wielder of the magic rod very modestly sought leave of absence at the tea time fishing again mr pike i suppose my father answered pleasantly i used to be fond of it at your age but never so entirely wrapped up in it as you are no sir i am not going fishing again i want to walk to wellington to get some things at cherry's books mr pike ah i am very glad of that but i fear it can only be fly books i want a little horace for eighteen pence the cambridge one just published to carry in my pocket and a new hank of gut which of the two is more important put that into latin and answer it utrum pluris facio flaccum flocci viscera magni with this vast effort pike turned as red as any trout spot after that who could refuse you said my father you always tell the truth my boy in latin or in english although it was a long walk some fourteen miles to wellington and back i got permission to go with pike and as we crossed the bridge and saw the tree that overhung crocker's hole i begged him to show me that mighty fish not a bit of it he replied it would bring the blackguards if the blackguards once find him out it is all over with him the blackguards are all in factory now and i am sure they cannot see us from the windows they won't be out till five o'clock with the true liberality of young england which abides even now as large and glorious as ever we always called the free and enlightened operatives of the period by the courteous name above set down and it must be acknowledged that some of them deserved it although perhaps they poached with less of science than their sons but the cowardly murder of fish by liming the water was already prevalent yielding to my request and perhaps his own desire manfully kept in check that morning pike very carefully approached that pool commanding me to sit down while he reconnoitred from the meadow upon the right bank of the stream and the place which had so sadly quenched the fire of the poor baker's love filled my childish heart with dread and deep wonder at the cruelty of women but as for john pike all he thought of was the fish and the best way to get at him very likely that hole is holed out now as the yankees well express it or at any rate changed out of knowledge even in my time a very heavy flood entirely altered its character but to the eager eye of pike it seemed pretty much as follows and possibly it may have come to such a form again the river after passing though a hurdle fence at the head of the meadow takes a little turn or two of bright and shallow indifference then gathers itself into a good strong slide as if going down a slope instead of steps the right bank is high and beetles over with yellow loam and grassy fringe but the other side is of flinty shingle low and bare and washed by floods at the end of this rapid the stream turns sharply under an ancient alder tree into a large deep calm repose cool unruffled and sheltered from the sun by branch and leaf and that is the hole of poor crocker at the head of the pool where the hasty current rushes in so eagerly with noisy excitement and much ado the quieter waters from below having rested and enlarged themselves come lapping up round either curve with some recollection of their past career the hoary experience of foam and sidling toward the new arrival of the impulsive column where they meet it things go on which no man can describe without his mouth being full of water a v is formed a fancy letter v beyond any designer's tracery and even beyond his imagination a perpetually fluctuating limpid wedge perpetually crenelled and rippled into by little ups and downs that try to make an impress but can only glide away upon either side or sink in dimples under it and here a gray bough of the ancient alder stretches across like a thirsty giant's arm and makes it a very ticklish place to throw a fly yet this was the very spot our john pike must put his fly into or lose his crown because the great tenant of crocker's hole who allowed no other fish to wag a fin there and from strict monopoly had grown so fat kept his victualing yard if so low an expression can be used concerning him within about a square yard of this spot he had a sweet hover both for rest and recreation under the bank in a placid antre where the water made no noise but tickled his belly in digestive ease the loftier the character is of any being the slower and more dignified his movements are no true psychologist could have believed as sweet land the blacksmith did and mr pook the tinman that this trout could ever be the embodiment of crocker for this was the last trout in the universal world to drown himself for love if truly any trout has done so you may come now and try to look along my back john pike with a reverential whisper said to me now don't be in a hurry young stupid kneel down he is not to be disturbed at his dinner mind you keep behind me and look along my back i never clapped eyes on such a whopper i had to kneel down in a tender reminiscence of pasture land and gaze carefully and not having eyes like those of our zebedee who offered his spine for a camera as he crawled on all fours in front of me it took me a long time to descry an object most distinct to all who have that special gift of piercing with their eyes the water see what is said upon this subject in that delicious book the gamekeeper at home you are no better than a muff said pike and it was not in my power to deny it if the sun would only leave off i said but the sun who was having a very pleasant play with the sparkle of the water and the twinkle of the leaves had no inclination to leave off yet but kept the rippling crystal in a dance of flashing facets and the quivering verdure in a steady flush of gold but suddenly a may fly a luscious gray drake richer and more delicate than canvas back or woodcock with a dart and a leap and a merry zigzag began to enjoy a little game above the stream rising and falling like a gnat thrilling her gauzy wings and arching her elegant pellucid frame every now and then she almost dipped her three long tapering whisks into the dimples of the water he sees her he'll have her as sure as a gun cried pike with a gulp as if he himself were rising now can you see him stupid crikey crokums i exclaimed with classic elegance i have seen that long thing for five minutes but i took it for a tree you little animal quite early in the alphabet now don't you stir a peg or i'll dig my elbow into you the great trout was stationary almost as a stone in the middle of the v above described he was gently fanning with his large clear fins but holding his own against the current mainly by the wagging of his broad fluked tail as soon as my slow eyes had once defined him he grew upon them mightily moulding himself in the matrix of the water as a thing put into jelly does and i doubt whether even john pike saw him more accurately than i did his size was such or seemed to be such that i fear to say a word about it not because language does not contain the word but from dread of exaggeration but his shape and colour may be reasonably told without wounding the feeling of an age whose incredulity springs from self knowledge his head was truly small his shoulders vast the spring of his back was like a rainbow when the sun is southing the generous sweep of his deep elastic belly nobly pulped out with rich nurture showed what the power of his brain must be and seemed to undulate time for time with the vibrant vigilance of his large wise eyes his latter end was consistent also an elegant taper run of counter coming almost to a cylinder as a mackered does boldly developed with a hugeous spread to a glorious amplitude of swallow tail his colour was all that can well be desired but ill described by any poor word palette enough that he seemed to tone away from olive and umber with carmine stars to glowing gold and soft pure silver mantled with a subtle flush of rose and fawn and opal swoop came a swallow as we gazed and was gone with a flick having missed the may fly but the wind of his passage or the stir of wing struck the merry dancer down so that he fluttered for one instant on the wave and that instant was enough swift as the swallow and more true of aim the great trout made one dart and a sound deeper than a tinkle but as silvery as a bell rang the poor ephemerid's knell the rapid water scarcely showed a break but a bubble sailed down the pool and the dark hollow echoed with the music of a rise he knows how to take a fly said pike he has had too many to be tricked with mine have him i must but how ever shall i do it all the way to wellington he uttered not a word but shambled along with a mind full of care when i ventured to look up now and then to surmise what was going on beneath his hat deeply set eyes and a wrinkled forehead relieved at long intervals by a solid shake proved that there are meditations deeper than those of philosopher or statesman chapter iii surely no trout could have been misled by the artificial may fly of that time unless he were either a very young fish quite new to entomology or else one afflicted with a combination of myopy and bulimy even now there is room for plenty of improvement in our counterfeit presentment but in those days the body was made with yellow mohair ribbed with red silk and gold twist and as thick as a fertile bumble bee john pike perceived that to offer such a thing to crocker's trout would probably consign him even if his great stamina should over get the horror to an uneatable death through just and natural indignation on the other hand while the may fly lasted a trout so cultured so highly refined so full of light and sweetness would never demean himself to low bait or any coarse son of a maggot meanwhile alec bolt allowed poor pike no peaceful thought no calm absorption of high mind into the world of flies no placid period of cobblers' wax floss silk turned hackles and dubbing for in making of flies john pike had his special moments of inspiration times of clearer insight into the everlasting verities times of brighter conception and more subtle execution tails of more elastic grace and heads of a neater and nattier expression as a poet labours at one immortal line compressing worlds of wisdom into the music of ten syllables so toiled the patient pike about the fabric of a fly comprising all the excellence that ever sprang from maggot yet bolt rejoiced to jerk his elbow at the moment of sublimest art and a swarm of flies was blighted thus peaceful therefore and long suffering and full of resignation as he was john pike came slowly to the sad perception that arts avail not without arms the elbow so often jerked at last took a voluntary jerk from the shoulder and alec bolt lay prostrate with his right eye full of cobbler's wax this put a desirable check upon his energies for a week or more and by that time pike had flown his fly when the honeymoon of spring and summer which they are now too fashionable to celebrate in this country the hey day of the whole year marked by the budding of the wild rose the start of the wheatear from its sheath the feathering of the lesser plantain and flowering of the meadowsweet and foremost for the angler's joy the caracole of may flies when these things are to be seen and felt which has not happened at all this year then rivers should be mild and bright skies blue and white with fleecy cloud the west wind blowing softly and the trout in charming appetite on such a day came pike to the bank of culm with a loudly beating heart a fly there is not ignominious or of cowdab origin neither gross and heavy bodied from cradlehood of slimy stones nor yet of menacing aspect and suggesting deeds of poison but elegant bland and of sunny nature and obviously good to eat him or her why quest we which the shepherd of the dale contemptuous of gender except in his own species has called and as long as they two coexist will call the yellow sally a fly that does not waste the day in giddy dances and the fervid waltz but undergoes family incidents with decorum and discretion he or she as the case may be for the natural history of the river bank is a book to come hereafter and of fifty men who make flies not one knows the name of the fly he is making in the early morning of june or else in the second quarter of the afternoon this yellow sally fares abroad with a nice well ordered flutter despairing of the may fly as it still may be despaired of pike came down to the river with his master piece of portraiture the artificial yellow sally is generally always as they say in cheshire a mile or more too yellow on the other hand the yellow dun conveys no idea of any sally but pike had made a very decent sally not perfect for he was young as well as wise but far above any counterfeit to be had in fishing tackle shops how he made it he told nobody but if he lives now as i hope he does any of my readers may ask him through the gpo and hope to get an answer it fluttered beautifully on the breeze and in such living form that a brother or sister sally came up to see it and went away sadder and wiser then pike said get away you young wretch to your humble servant who tells this tale yet being better than his words allowed that pious follower to lie down upon his digestive organs and with deep attention watch there must have been great things to see but to see them so was difficult and if i huddle up what happened excitement also shares the blame pike had fashioned well the time and manner of this overture he knew that the giant crockerite was satiate now with may flies or began to find their flavour failing as happens to us with asparagus marrow fat peas or strawberries when we have had a month of them and he thought that the first yellow sally of the season inferior though it were might have the special charm of novelty with the skill of a zulu he stole up through the branches over the lower pool till he came to a spot where a yard wide opening gave just space for spring of rod then he saw his desirable friend at dinner wagging his tail as a hungry gentleman dining with the lord mayor agitates his coat with one dexterous whirl untaught by any of the many books upon the subject john pike laid his yellow sally for he cast with one fly only as lightly as gossamer upon the rapid about a yard in front of the big trout's head a moment's pause and then too quick for words was the things that happened a heavy plunge was followed by a fearful rush forgetful of current the river was ridged as if with a plough driven under it the strong line though given out as fast as might be twanged like a harp string as it cut the wave and then pike stood up like a ship dismasted with the butt of his rod snapped below the ferrule he had one of those foolish things just invented a hollow butt of hickory and the finial ring of his spare top looked out to ask what had happened to the rest of it bad luck cried the fisherman but never mind i shall have him next time to a certainty when this great issue came to be considered the cause of it was sadly obvious the fish being hooked had made off with the rush of a shark for the bottom of the pool a thicket of saplings below the alder tree had stopped the judicious hooker from all possibility of following and when he strove to turn him by elastic pliance his rod broke at the breach of pliability i have learned a sad lesson said john pike looking sadly how many fellows would have given up this matter and glorified themselves for having hooked so grand a fish while explaining that they must have caught him if they could have done it but pike only told me not to say a word about it and began to make ready for another tug of war he made himself a splice rod short and handy of well seasoned ash with a stout top of bamboo tapered so discreetly and so balanced in its spring that verily it formed an arc with any pressure on it as perfect as a leafy poplar in a stormy summer now break it if you can he said by any amount of rushes i'll hook you by your jacket collar you cut away now and i'll land you this was highly skilful and he did it many times and whenever i was landed well i got a lollypop so that i was careful not to break his tackle moreover he made him a landing net with a kidney bean stick a ring of wire and his own best nightcap of strong cotton net then he got the farmer's leave and lopped obnoxious bushes and now the chiefest question was what bait and when to offer it in spite of his sad rebuff the spirit of john pike had been equable the genuine angling mind is steadfast large and self supported and to the vapid ignominious chaff tossed by swine upon the idle wind it pays as much heed as a big trout does to a dance of midges people put their fingers to their noses and said master pike have you caught him yet and pike only answered wait a bit if ever this fortitude and perseverance is to be recovered as the english brand the one thing that has made us what we are and may yet redeem us from niddering shame a degenerate age should encourage the habit of fishing and never despairing and the brightest sign yet for our future is the increasing demand for hooks and gut pike fished in a manlier age when nobody would dream of cowering from a savage because he was clever at skulking and when if a big fish broke the rod a stronger rod was made for him according to the usage of great britain and though the young angler had been defeated he did not sit down and have a good cry over it about the second week in june when the may fly had danced its day and died for the season was an early one and crocker's trout had recovered from the wound to his feelings and philanthropy there came a night of gentle rain of pleasant tinkling upon window ledges and a soothing patter among young leaves and the culm was yellow in the morning i mean to do it this afternoon pike whispered to me as he came back panting when the water clears there will be a splendid time the lover of the rose knows well a gay voluptuous beetle whose pleasure is to lie embedded in a fount of beauty deep among the incurving petals of the blushing fragrance he loses himself in his joys sometimes till a breezy waft reveals him and when the sunlight breaks upon his luscious dissipation few would have the heart to oust him such a gem from such a setting all his back is emerald sparkles all his front red indian gold and here and there he grows white spots to save the eye from aching pike put his finger in and fetched him out and offered him a little change of joys by putting a limerick hook through his thorax and bringing it out between his elytra cetonia aurata liked it not but pawed the air very naturally and fluttered with his wings attractively i meant to have tried with a fern web said the angler until i saw one of these beggars this morning if he works like that upon the water he will do it was hopeless to try artificials again what a lovely colour the water is only three days now to the holidays i have run it very close you be ready younker with these words he stepped upon a branch of the alder for the tone of the waters allowed approach being soft and sublustrous without any mud also master pike's own tone was such as becomes the fisherman calm deliberate free from nerve but full of eye and muscle he stepped upon the alder bough to get as near as might be to the fish for he could not cast this beetle like a fly it must be dropped gently and allowed to play you may come and look he said to me when the water is so they have no eyes in their tails the rose beetle trod upon the water prettily under a lively vibration and he looked quite as happy and considerably more active than when he had been cradled in the anthers of the rose to the eye of a fish he was a strong individual fighting courageously with the current but sure to be beaten through lack of fins and mercy suggested as well as appetite that the proper solution was to gulp him hooked him in the gullet he can't get off cried john pike labouring to keep his nerves under every inch of tackle is as strong as a bell pull now if i don't land him i will never fish again providence which had constructed pike foremost of all things for lofty angling disdainful of worm and even minnow providence i say at this adjuration pronounced that pike must catch that trout not many anglers are heaven born and for one to drop off the hook halfway through his teens would be infinitely worse than to slay the champion trout pike felt the force of this and rushing through the rushes shouted i am sure to have him dick be ready with my nightcap rod in a bow like a springle riser line on the hum like the string of paganini winch on the gallop like a harpoon wheel pike the head centre of everything dashing through thick and thin and once taken overhead for he jumped into the hole when he must have lost him else but the fish too impetuously towed him out and made off in passion for another pool when if he had only retired to his hover the angler might have shared the baker's fate all these things i tell you for they all come up again as if the day were yesterday so scared me of my never very steadfast wits that i could only holloa but one thing i did i kept the nightcap ready he is pretty nearly spent i do believe said pike and his voice was like balm of gilead as we came to farmer anning's meadow a quarter of a mile below crocker's hole take it coolly my dear boy and we shall be safe to have him never have i felt through forty years such tremendous responsibility i had not the faintest notion now to use a landing net but a mighty general directed me don't let him see it don't let him see it don't clap it over him go under him you stupid if he makes another rush he will get off after all bring it up his tail well done you have him the mighty trout lay in the nightcap of pike which was half a fathom long with a tassel at the end for his mother had made it in the winter evenings come and hold the rod if you can't lift him my master shouted and so i did then with both arms straining and his mouth wide open john pike made a mighty sweep and we both fell upon the grass and rolled with the giant of the deep flapping heavily between us and no power left to us except to cry hurrah

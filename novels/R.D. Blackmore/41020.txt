printers bread street hill clara vaughan book i chapter i i do not mean to describe myself already i feel that the personal pronoun will appear too often in these pages knowing the faults of my character almost as well as my best friends know them i shall attempt to hide them no more than would those beloved ones enough of this the story i have to tell is strange and short as my own its preamble the day when i was ten years old began my serious life it was the th of december and proud was the kiss my loving father gave me for spelling writing and pronouncing the date in english french and italian no very wonderful feat it is true for a clever child welltaught but i was by no means a clever child and no one except my father could teach me a single letter when after several years of wedlock my parents found new joy in me their bliss was soon overhung with care they feared but durst not own the fear lest the wilful passionate loving creature on whom their hearts were wholly set should be torn from their love to a distance greater than the void of death in a word should prove insane at length they could no longer hide this terror from each other one look told it all and i vaguely remember my hazy wonder at the scene that followed like a thief i came from the corner behind the curtainloops and trembled at my fathers knee for him to say something to me then frightened at his silencea thing unknown to mei pulled his hands from before his eyes and found hot tears upon them i coaxed him then and petted him and felt his sorrows through me then made believe to scold him for being so naughty as to cry but i could not get his trouble from him and he seemed to watch me through his kisses before i had ceased to ponder dreamily over this great wonder a vast event for a child of seven diverted me father mother and tootyfor so i then was calledwere drawn a long way by horses with yellow men upon them from enlarged experience i infer that we must have posted to london here among many marvels i remember especially a long and mysterious interview with a kind whitehaired old gentleman who wore most remarkable shoes he took me upon his lap which seemed to me rather a liberty then he smoothed down my hair and felt my head so much that i asked if he wanted to comb it having made up my mind to kick if he dared to try such a thing then he put all sorts of baby questions to me which i was disposed to resent having long discarded cock robin and little redridinghood unconsciously too i was moved by natures strong hate of examination but my father came up and with tears in his eyes begged me to answer everything meanwhile my mother sat in a dark corner as if her best doll was dying with its innate pugnacity my hazy intellect rose to the situation and i narrowly heeded every thing now go my dear the old gentleman said at last you are a very good little girl indeed thats a great lie i cried for i had learned bad words from a flighty girl taken rashly as undernurse the old gentleman seemed surprised and my mother was dreadfully shocked my father laughed first then looked at me sadly and i did what he expected i jumped into his arms at one word from him i ran to the great physician and humbly begged his pardon and offered him my very dearest toy he came up warmly and shook my fathers hand and smiled from his heart at my mother allow me mrs vaughanallow me my dear sirto congratulate you cordially the head is a noble and honest one it is the growth of the brain that causes these little commotions but the congestion will not be permanent the fits that have so alarmed you are at this age a good symptom in fact they are natures remedy they may last for seven years or even for ten of course they will not depart at once but the attacks will be milder and the intervals longer when she has turned fourteen for the intellect you need have no fear whatever only keep her quiet and never force her to learn she must only learn when it comes as it were with the wind she will never forget what she does learn hereupon unless i am much mistaken my father and mother fell to and kissed and hugged one another and i heard a sound like sobbing then they caught me up and devoured me as if i were born anew and staring round with great childish eyes i could not catch the old gentlemans glance at all henceforth i learned very little the wind perhaps being unfavourable and all the little i did learn came from my fathers lips his patience with me was wonderful we spent most of the day together and when he was forced to leave me i took no food until he returned whenever his horse was ordered miss claras little grey pony began to neigh and to fidget and miss clara was off in a moment to get her blue ridingskirt even when father went shooting or fishing tooty was sure to go too except in the depth of winter and then she was up at the top of the house watching all round for the gunsmoke ah why do i linger so over these happy timesis it the pleasure of thinking how fondly we loved one another or is it the pain of knowing that we can do so no more now the th of december was my parents weddingday for i had been born six years exact after their affectionate union and now that i was ten years olda notable hinge on the door of lifehow much they made to be sure of each other and of me at dinner i sat in glory between them upsetting all ceremony pleasing my father and teasing my mother by many a childish sally so genial a man my father was that he would talk to the servants even on state occasions quite as if they were human beings yet none of them ever took the smallest liberty with him unless it were one to love him before dessert i interred my queen doll with much respect and some heartache under a marble flag by the door which had been prepared for the purpose my father was chiefmourner but did not cry to my liking until i had pinched him well after this typical goodbye to childhood i rode him back to the diningtable and helped him and my mother to the last of the wests st peter grapes giving him all the fattest ones then we all drank health and love to one another and i fell to in earnest at a childs delight dearest father kept supplying me with things much nicer than are now to be got while my mother in vain pretended to guard the frontier it was the first time i tasted guava jelly and now even at the name that scene is bright before me the long high room oakpanelled the lights and shadows flickering as on a dark bay horse the crimson velvet curtains where the windows were gone to bed the great black chairs with damask cushions but hard and sharp at the edge the mantelpiece all carved in stone which i was forbidden to kick the massive lamp that never would let me eat without loose clouds of hair dancing all over my plate and then the great fire its rival shuddering in blue flames at the thought of the frost outside all these things and even the ticking of the timepiece are more palpable to me now than the desk on which i write my father sat in his easy chair laughing and joking full of life and comfort with his glass of old port beside him his wife in front and me his claricrops at his knee more happy than a hundred kings he wished for nothing better at one time perhaps he had longed for a son to keep the ancient name but now he was quite ashamed of the wish as mutiny against me after many an interchange a drink for father a sip for tooty he began to tell wondrous stories of the shots he had made that day especially how he had killed a woodcock through a magpies nest my mother listened with playful admiration i with breathless interest and most profound belief then we played at draughts and fox and goose and pretended even to play at chess until it was nine oclock and my hour of grace expired three times ann maples came to fetch me but i would not go at last i went submissively at one kind word from my father my mother obtained but a pouting kiss for i wanted to wreak some vengeance but my father i never kissed with less than all my heart and soul i flung both arms around his neck laid my little cheek to his and whispered in his ear that i loved him more than all the world tenderly he clasped and kissed me and now i am sure that through his smile he looked at me with sadness turning round at the doorway i stretched my hands towards him and met once more his loving laughing eyes once more and only once next i saw him in his coffin white and stark with death byandby i will tell what i know at present i can only feel the emotionsaway with long wordsthe passions which swept my little heart with equal power rend it now long i lay dumb and stunned at the horror i could not grasp then with a scream as in my fits i flung upon his body what to me were shroud and shell the rigid look and the world of awe such things let stepchildren fear not i when it was my father chapter ii how that deed was done i learned at once and will tell by whom and why it was done i have given my life to learn the evidence laid before the coroner was a cloud and fog of mystery for days and days my mother lay insensible then for weeks and weeks she would leap from her bed in fits of terror stare and shriek and faint as for the servants they knew very little but imagined a great deal the only other witnesses were a medical man a shoemaker and two london policemen the servants said that between one and two in the morning a clear wild shriek rang through the house large as the building was this shriek unrepeated awoke nearly all but me rushing anyhow forth they hurried and huddled together at the head of the great staircase doubting what to do some said the cry came one way some another meanwhile ann maples who slept with me in an inner room at the end of a little passage in the courage of terror went straight to her master and mistress there by the light of a dim nightlamp used to visit me she saw my mother upright in the bed and pointing towards my fathers breast my father lay quite still the bedclothes were smooth upon him my mother did not speak ann maples took the lamp and looked in her masters face his eyes were open wide open as in amazement but the surprise was death one arm was stiff around his wife the other lax upon the pillow as she described it in westcountry phrase he looked all frore the woman rushed from the room and screamed along the passage the servants ran to her flurried and haggard each afraid to be left behind none except the butler dared to enter whispering and trembling they peered in after him all ready to run away thomas kenwood loved his master dearly being his fosterbrother he at once removed the bedclothes and found the fatal wound so strongly and truly was it dealt that it pierced the centre of my dear fathers heart one spot of blood and a small threecornered hole was all that could be seen the surgeon who came soon after said that the weapon must have been a very keen and finelytempered dagger probably of foreign make the murderer must have been quite cool and well acquainted with the human frame death followed the blow on the instant without a motion or a groan in my mothers left hand strongly clutched was a lock of long black shining hair a curl very like it but rather finer lay on my fathers bosom in the room were no signs of disorder no marks of forcible entrance one of the maids a timid young thing declared that soon after the stableclock struck twelve she had heard the front balusters creak but as she was known to hear this every night little importance was attached to it the coroner paid more attention to the page a sharp youth from london who being first in the main corridor after the cry saw or thought he saw a moving figure where the faint starlight came in at the oriel window he was the more believed because he owned that he durst not follow it but no way of escape could be discovered there and the eastern window was strongly barred betwixt the mullions no door no window was anywhere found open outside the house the only trace was at one remarkable spot the time had been chosen well it was a hard black frost without as yet any snow the ground was like iron and an indian could have spied no trail but at this one spot twentyfive yards from the east end of the house and on the verge of a dense shrubbery a small spring scarcely visible oozed among the moss around its very head it cleared and kept a narrow space quite free from green and here its margin was a thin coat of black mineral mud which never froze this space at the broadest was but two feet and ten inches across from gravel to turf yet now it held two distinct footprints not of some one crossing and recrossing but of two successive steps leading from the house into the shrubbery these footprints were remarkable the one nearest the house was of the left foot the other of the right each was the impression of a long light and pointed boot very hollow at the instep but they differed in thisthe left footprint was plain and smooth without mark of nail or cue or any other roughness while the right one was clearly stamped in the centre of the sole with a small rectangular cross this mark seemed to have been made by a cruciform piece of metal or some other hard substance inlaid into the sole at least so said a shoemaker who was employed to examine it and he added that the boots were not those of the present fashion what he called ducks bills being then in vogue this man being asked to account for the fact of the footprints being so close together did so very easily and with much simplicity it was evident he said that a man of average stature walking rapidly would take nearly twice that distance in every stride but here the verge of the shrubbery and the branches striking him in the face had suddenly curtailed the step and to this most likely and not to any hurry or triumph was to be ascribed the fact that one so wily and steadfast did not turn back and erase the dangerous tokens most likely he did not feel what was beneath his feet while he was battling with the tangle above be that as it may there the marks remained like the blottingpaper of his crime casts of them were taken at once and carefully have they been stored by me the shoemaker a shrewd but talkative man said unasked that he had never seen such boots as had left those marks since the young squire he meant mr edgar vaughan went upon his travels for this gratuitous statement he was strongly rebuked by the coroner for the rest all that could be found out after close inquiry was that a stranger darkly clad had been seen by the gamekeepers in a copse some halfmile from the house while the men were beating for woodcocks on the previous day he did not seem to be following my father and they thought he had wandered out of the forest road he glided quickly away before they could see his features but they knew that he was tall and swarthy no footprints were found in that ride like those by the shrubbery spring i need not say what verdict the coroners jury found chapter iii thus far i have written in sore haste to tell as plainly and as briefly as possible that which has darkened all my life though it never leaves my waking thoughts to dwell upon it before others is agony to me henceforth my tale will flow perhaps more easily until i fall again into a grief almost as dark and am struck by storms of passion which childhoods stature does not reach when the shock of the household and the wonder of the county and the hopes of constables raised by a thousand pounds reward had subsided gradually my mother continued to live in the old mansion perhaps because none of her friends came forward to remove her under my fathers will she was the sole executrix but all the estates including house and park were left to my fathers nearest relative as trustee for myself with a large annuity to my mother charged upon them there were many other provisions and powers in the will which are of no consequence to my story the chief estate was large and rich extending three or four miles from the house which stood in a beautiful part of gloucestershire the entire rental was about l a year my father whose name was henry valentine vaughan being a very active man in the prime of life had employed no steward but managed everything himself the park and two or three hundred acres round it had always been kept in hand the rest was let to thriving tenants who loved as they expressed it every hair on the head of a vaughan there was also a small farm near the sea in a lonely part of devonshire but this was my mothers having been left to her by her father a clergyman in that neighbourhood my fathers nearest relative was his halfbrother edgar vaughan who had been educated for the bar and at one time seemed likely to become eminent then suddenly he gave up his practice and resided or rather roved abroad during several years sinister rumours about him reached our neighbourhood not long before my fathers death to these however the latter paid no attention but always treated his brother edgar with much cordiality and affection but all admitted that edgar vaughan had far outrun his income as a younger son which amounted to about l a year of course therefore my father had often helped him on the third day after that night my guardian came to vaughan park he was said to have hurried from london upon learning there what had happened the servants and others had vainly and foolishly tried to keep from me the nature of my loss soon i found out all they knew and when the first tit and horror left me i passed my whole time light or dark in roving from passage to passage from room to room from closet to closet searching every chink and cranny for the murderer of my father though heretofore a timid child while so engaged i knew not such a thing as fear but peered and groped and listened feeling every inch of wall and wainscot crawling lest i should alarm my prey spying through the slit of every door and shaking every empty garment certain boards there were near the east window which sounded hollow at these i scooped until i broke my nails in vain nurse maples locked me in her room held me at her side or even bound me to the bed my ravings forced her soon to yield and i would not allow her or any one else to follow me the gloucester physician said that since the disease of my mind had taken that shape it would be more dangerous to thwart than to indulge it it was the evening of the third day and weary with but never of my search i was groping down the great oakstaircase in the dusk hand after hand and foot by foot when suddenly the main doorbell rang the snow was falling heavily and had deadened the sound of wheels at once i slid as my father had taught me to do down the broad balustrade ran across the entrancehall and with my whole strength drew back the bolt of the lock there i stood in the porch unfrightened but with a new kind of excitement on me a tall dark man came up the steps and shook the snow from his boots the carriagelamp shone in my face i would not let him cross the threshold but stood there and confronted him he pretended to take me for some servants child and handed me a parcel covered with snow i flung it down and said looking him full in the face i am clara vaughan and you are the man who killed my father carry her in john he said to the servantcarry her in or the poor little thing will die what eyes and he used some foreign oathwhat wonderful eyes she has that burst of passion was the last conscious act of the young and overlaboured brain for three months i wandered outside the gates of sorrow my guardian as they told me was most attentive throughout the whole course of the fever and even in the press of business visited me three times every day meanwhile my mother was slowly shaking off the stupor which lay upon her and the new fear of losing me came through that thick heaviness like the wind through a fog doubtless it helped to restore her senses and awoke her to the work of life then as time went on her former beauty and gentleness came back and her reason too as regarded other subjects but as to that which all so longed to know not a spark of evidence could be had from her the faintest allusion to that crime the name of her loved husband the mere word murder uttered in her presenceand the consciousness would leave her eyes like a loan withdrawn upright she sat and rigid as when she was found that night with the lines of her face as calm and cold as moonlight only two means there were by which her senses could be restored one was low sweet music the other profound sleep she was never thrown into this cataleptic state by her own thoughts or words nor even by those of others when in strict sequence upon her own but any attempt to lead her to that one subject no matter how craftily veiled was sure to end in this the skilful physician who had known her many years judged after special study of this disease in which he felt deep interest that it was always present in her brain but waited for external aid to master her i need not say that she was now unfit for any strangers converse and even her most careful friends must touch sometimes the motive string as i recovered slowly from long illness the loss of my best friend and the search for my worst enemy revived and reigned within me sometimes my guardian would deign to reason with me upon what he called my monomania when he did so i would fix my eyes upon him but never tried to answer now and then those eyes seemed to cause him some uneasiness at other times he would laugh and compare them pleasantly to the blue firedamp in a coalmine his dislike of their scrutiny was well known to me and incited me the more to urge it but in spite of all he was ever kind and gentle to me and even tried some grimly playful overtures to my love which fled from him with loathing albeit a slow conviction formed that i had wronged him by suspicion edgar malins vaughan then about thirtyseven years old was i suppose a very handsome man and perhaps of a more striking presence than my dearest father his face when he was pleased reminded me strongly of the glance and smile i had lost but never could it convey that soft sweet look which still came through the clouds to me now and then in dreams the outlines of my guardians face were keener too and stronger and his complexion far more swarthy his eyes were of a hard steelblue and never seemed to change a slight lameness perceptible only at times did not impair his activity but served him as a pretext for declining all fieldsports for which unlike my father he had no real taste his enjoyments if he had anyand i suppose all men have someseemed to consist in the management of the estate which he took entirely upon himself in satiric literature and the news of the day or in lonely rides and sails upon the lake it was hinted too by thomas kenwood who disliked and feared him strangely that he drank spirits or foreign cordials in his own room late at night there was nothing to confirm this charge he was always up betimes his hand was never tremulous nor did his colour change chapter iv my lifechildhood i can scarcely call itwent quietly for several years the eastern wing of the house was left unused and rarely traversed by any but myself foolish tales of course were told about it but my frequent visits found nothing to confirm them at night whenever i could slip from the care of good but matteroffact ann maples i used to wander down the long corridor and squeeze through the iron gate now set there half in hope and half in fear of meeting my fathers spirit for such an occasion all my questions were prepared and all the answers canvassed my infant mind was struggling ever to pierce the mystery which so vaguely led its life years only quickened my resolve to be the due avenger and hardened the set resolve into a fatalists conviction my mother always full of religious feeling taught me daily in the scriptures and tried to make me pray but i could not take the mild teachings of the gospel as a little child to me the psalms of david and those books of the old testament which recount and seem to applaud revenge were sweeter than all the balm of gilead they supplied a terse and vigorous form to my perpetual yearnings with a childs impiety i claimed for myself the mission of the jews against the enemies of the lord the forms of prayer which my mother taught me i mumbled through while looking in her gentle face with anything but a prayerful gaze for my own bedside i kept a widely different form which even now i shudder to repeat and yet i loved dear mother truly and pitied her sometimes with tears but the shadowlove was far the deeper my fathers grave was in the churchyard of the little village which clustered and nestled beyond our lodge it was a real grave the thought of lying in a vault had always been loathsome to him and he said that it struck him cold so fond was he of air and light and freedom the change of seasons and weather and the shifting of the sun and stars that he used to pray that they still might pass over his buried head that he might lie not in the dark lockers of death but in the open hand of time his friends used to think it strange that a man of so light and festive nature should ever talk of death yet so he often did not morbidly but with good cheer in pursuance therefore of his wellknown wish the vaults wherein there lay five centuries of vaughan dust were not opened for him neither was his grave built over with a hideous ashbin but lay narrow fair and humble with a plain low headstone of the whitest marble bearing his initials deeply carved in grey through our warm love and pity and that of all the village and not in mere compliance with an old usage of the western counties his simple bed was ever green and white with the fairest of low flowers though otherwise too moody and reckless to be a gardener i loved to rear from seed his favourite plants and keep them in my room until they blossomed then i would set them carefully along his grave and lie down beside it and wonder whether his spirit took pleasure in them but more often it must be owned i laid a darker tribute there the gloomy channel into which my young mind had been forced was overhung as might be expected by a sombre growth the legends of midnight spirits and the tales of blackest crime shed their poison on me from the dust of the library i exhumed all records of the most famous atrocities and devoured them at my fathers grave as yet i was too young to know what grief it would cause to him who slept there could he but learn what his only child was doing that knowledge would at once have checked me for his presence was ever with me and his memory cast my thoughts as moonlight shapes the shadows the view from the churchyard was a lovely english scene what higher praise can i give than this long time a wanderer in foreign parts nothing have i seen that comes from nature to the heart like a true english landscape the little church stood back on a quiet hill which bent its wings in a gentle curve to shelter it from the north and east these bending wings were feathered soft as down with larches hawthorn and the lightlypencilled birch between which here and there the bluff rocks stood their ground southward and beyond the glen how fair a spread of waving country we could see to the left our pretty lake all clear and calm gave back the survey of the trees until a bold gnoll fringed with alders led it out of sight far away upon the right the severn stole along its silver road leaving many a reach and bend which caught towards eventide the notice of the travelled sun upon the horizon might be seen at times the blue distance of the brecon hills often when i sat here all alone and the evening dusk came on although i held those volumes on my lap i could not but forget the murders and the revenge of men the motives form and evidence of crime and nurse a vague desire to dream my life away sometimes also my mother would come here to read her favourite gospel of st john then i would lay the dark records on the turf and sit with my injury hot upon me wondering at her peaceful face while for her sake i rejoiced to see the tears of comfort and contentment dawning in her eyes i never grieved that the soft chastenment was not shed on me for her i loved and admired it for myself i scorned it utterly the same clear sunshine was upon us both we both were looking on the same fair scenethe gold of ripening corn the emerald of woods and pastures the crystal of the lake and stream above us both the peaceful heaven was shed and the late distress was but a night gone bywherefore had it left to one the dew of life to the other a thunderbolt i knew not the reason then but now i know it well although my favourite style of literature was not likely to improve the mind or yield that honeyed melancholy which some young ladies woo to me it did but little harm my will was so bent upon one object and the whole substance and shape of my thoughts so stanch in their sole ductility thereto that other things went idly by me if they showed no power to promote my end but upon palpable life and the doings of nature i became observant beyond my age things in growth or motion round me impressed themselves on my senses as if a nerve were touched the uncoiling of a fernfrond the shrinking of a bindweed blossom the escape of a cappinched bud the projection of a seed or the sparks from a fading tuberose in short the lighter prints of natures sandalled foot were traced and counted by me not that i derived a maiden pleasure from them as happy persons do but that it seemed my business narrowly to heed them as for the proud phenomena of imperial man so far as they yet survive the crucible of conventionthe lines where cunning crouches the smile that is but a brainflash the veil let down across the wide mouth of greed the guilt they try to make volatile in charityall these i was not old and poor enough to learn yet i marked unconsciously the traits of individuals the mannerism the gesture and the mode of speech the complex motive and the underflow of thought so all i did and all i dreamed had one colour and one aim my education it is just to say was neglected by no one but myself my fathers love of air and heaven had descended to me and nothing but my mothers prayers or my own dark quest could keep me in the house abstract principles and skeleton dogmas i could never grasp but whatever was vivid and shrewd and native whatever had point and purpose was seized by me and made my own my faculties were not large but steadfast now and concentrated though several masters tried their best and my governess did all she could i chose to learn but little drawing and music to soothe my mother were my principal studies of poetry i took no heed except in the fierce old drama enough of this i have said so much not for my sake but for my story chapter v on the fifth anniversary of my fathers death when i was fifteen years of age i went to visit as i always did upon that day the fatal room although this chamber had been so long unused the furniture was allowed to remain and i insisted passionately that it should be my charge what had seemed the petulance of a child was now the strong will of a thoughtful girl i took the key from my bosom where i always kept it and turned it in the lock no mortal had entered that door since i passed it in my last paroxysm three weeks and a day before i saw a cobweb reaching from the black fingerplate to the third mould of the beading the weather had been damp and the door stuck fast to the jamb then yielded with a crack though i was bold that day and in a mood of triumph some awe fell on me as i entered there hung the heavy curtain last drawn by the murderers hand there lay the bedclothes raised for the blow and replaced on death and there was the pillow where sleep had been so prolonged all these i saw with a forced and fearful glance and my breath stood still as the wind in a grave presently a light cloud floated off the sun and a white glare from the snow of the morning burst across the room my sight was not so dimmed with tears as it generally was when i stood there for i had just read the history of a longhidden crime detected and my eyes were full of fierce hope but stricken soon to the wonted depth of sadness with the throbs of my heart falling like the avengers step i went minutely through my deathinspection i felt all round the dusty wainscot opened the wardrobes and cupboards raised the lids of the deepbayed windowseats peered shuddering down the dark closet where i believed the assassin had lurked started and stared at myself in the mirror to see how lone and wan i looked and then approached the bed to finish my search in the usual place by lying and sobbing where my father died i had glanced beneath it and round the pillars and clutched the curtain as if to squeeze out the truth and was just about to throw myself on the coverlet and indulge the fit so bitterly held at bay when something on the hangings above the headboard stopped me suddenly there i saw a narrow line of deep and glowing red it grew so vivid on the faded damask and in the white glare of the level sun that i thought it was on fire hastily setting a chair by the pillar for i would not tread on that bed i leaped up and closely examined the crimson vein without thinking i knew what it wasthe heartblood of my father there were three distinct and several marks traced by the reeking dagger the first on the left which had caught my glance was the broadest and clearest to read two lines meeting at a right angle rudely formed a roman l rudely i say for the poniard had been too rich in red ink which had clotted where the two strokes met the second letter was a roman d formed also by two bold strokes the upright very distinct the curve less easily traced at the top but the lower part deep and clear the third letter was not so plain it looked like c at first but upon further examination i felt convinced that it was meant for an o left incomplete through the want of more writing fluid or was it then that my mother had seized the dark author by the hair as he stooped to incline his pen that the last drop might trickle down deciphering thus with fingers and eyes i traced these letters of blood one by one over and over again till they danced in my gaze like the northern lights i stood upon tiptoe and kissed them i cared not what i was doing it was my own fathers blood and i thought of the heart it came from not of the hand which shed it when i turned away the surprise for which till then i had found no time broke full upon me how could these letters in spite of all my vigilance so long have remained unseen why did the murderer peril his life yet more by staying to write the record and seal perhaps the conviction of his deed and what did these characters mean of these three questions the first was readily solved the other two remained to me as new shadows of wonder several causes had conspired to defer so long this discovery in the first place the damask had been of rich lilac shot with a pile of carmine which in the waving play of light glossed at once and obscured the crimson stain until the fading hues of art left in strong contrast natures abiding paint secondly my rapid growth and the clearness of my eyes that day lessened the distance and favoured perception againand this was perhaps the paramount causethe winter sun with rays unabsorbed by the snow threw his sheer dint upon that very spot keen level and uncoloureda thing which could happen on few days in the year and for few minutes each day and which never had happened during my previous search perhaps there was also some chemical action of the rays of light which evoked as well as showed the colour but of this i do not know enough to speak suffice it that the letters were there at first a great shock and terror but soon a strong encouragement to me my course was at once to perpetuate the marks and speculate upon them at leisure for i knew not how fleeting they might be i hurried downstairs and speaking to no one procured some clear tissue paper applying this to the damask and holding a card behind i carefully traced with a pencil so much of the letters as could be perceived through the medium and completed the sketch by copying most carefully the rest it was however beyond my power to keep my hand from trembling a shade flitted over my drawingoh how my heart leaped when i had finished the pencilsketch and before it was inked over for i could not bring myself to paint it red i knelt where my father died and thanked god for this guidance to me by the time i had dried my eyes the sun was passed and the lines of blood were gone even though i knew where to seek them having left a pin in the damask by measuring i found that the letters were just three feet and a quarter above the spot where my fathers head had been the largest of them the l was three inches long and an eighth of an inch in width the others were nearly as long but nothing like so wide trembling now for the rush of passion which stills the body was past and stepping silently on the long silent floor i went to the deep darkmullioned window and tried to look forth after all my lone tumult perhaps i wanted to see the world but my jaded eyes and brain showed only the same three letters burning on the snow and sky evening a winter evening was fluttering down the sun was spent and stopped by a grey mist and the landscape full of dreariness and cold for miles the earth lay white and wan with nothing to part life from death no step was on the snow no wind among the trees fences shrubs and hillocks were as wrinkles in a windingsheet and every stark branch had like me its own cold load to carry but on the left just in sight from the gablewindow was a spot black as midnight in the billowy snow it was the spring which had stored for me the footprints perhaps i was superstitious then the omen was accepted suddenly a last gleam from the dauntless sun came through the ancient glass and flung a crimson spot upon my breast it was the red heart centre of our shield won with coeur de lion oh scutcheons blazonments and other gewgaws by which men think to ennoble daylight murders how long shall fools account it honour to be tattooed with you mercy fellowfeeling truth humility virtues that never flap their wings but shrink lest they should know they stoop what have these won gaze sinister and their crest a pillory with that red pride upon my breast and that black heart within and my young form stately with revenge i was a true descendant of crusaders chapter vi to no one not even to thomas kenwood in whom i confided most did i impart the discovery just described again and again i went to examine those letters jealous at once of my secret and fearful lest they should vanish but though they remained perhaps unaltered they never appeared so vivid as on that day with keener interest i began once more to track from page to page from volume to volume the chronicled steps of limping but surefooted justice not long after this i was provided with a companion clara said my guardian one day at breakfast you live too much alone have you any friends in the neighbourhood none in the world except my mother well i must try to survive the exclusion i have done my best but your mother has succeeded in finding a colleague theres a cousin of yours coming here very soon mother dear i cried in some surprise you never told me that you had any nieces neither have i my darling she replied nor any nephews either but your uncle has and i hope you will like your visitor now remember clara resumed my guardian it is no wish of mine that you should do so to me it is a matter of perfect indifference but your mother and myself agreed that a little society would do you good when is she to come i asked in high displeasure that no one had consulted me he is likely to be here tomorrow oh i exclaimed the plot is to humanize me through a young gentleman is it and how long is he to stay in my house in your house i suppose that will depend upon your mothers wishes more likely upon yours i cried but it matters little to me he said nothing but looked displeased my mother doing the same i was silent and the subject dropped but of course i saw that he wished me to like his new importation while he dissembled the wish from knowledge of my character two years after my fathers birth his father had married again of the second wedlock the only offspring was my guardian edgar vaughan he was a posthumous son and his mother in turn contracted a second marriage her new husband was one stephen daldy a merchant of some wealth by him she left one son named lawrence and several daughters this lawrence daldy my guardians halfbrother proved a spendthrift and while scattering the old merchants treasure married a fashionable adventuress as might be expected no retrenchment ensued and he died in poverty leaving an only child this boy clement daldy was of my own age or thereabout and in pursuance of my guardians plan was to live henceforth with us he arrived under the wing of his mother and his character consisted in the absence of any if he had any quality at all by which one could know him from a doll it was perhaps vanity and if his vanity was singular enough to have any foundation it could be only in his good looks he was i believe as pretty a youth as ever talked without mind or smiled without meaning need it be said that i despised him at once unfathomably his mother was of a very different order longenduring astute and plausible with truth no more than the pith of a straw she added thereto an imperious spirit embodied just now in an odious meekness whatever she said or did in her large contempt of the world her ladyabbess walk and the chastened droop of her brilliant eyes she conveyed through it all the impression of her humble superiority though profoundly convinced that all is vanity she was reluctant to force this conviction on minds of a narrower scope and dissembled with conscious grace her knowledge of human nature to a blunt outspoken child what could be more disgusting but when upon this was assumed an air of deep pity for my ignorance and interest in my littleness it became no longer bearable this christian jezebel nearly succeeded in estranging my mother from me the latter felt all that kindness towards her which people of true religion when overcharitable conceive towards all who hoist and salute the holy flag our sweet pirate knew well how to make the most of this for myself though i felt that a hypocrite is below the level of hate i could not keep my composure when with affectionate blandness our visitor dared to discharge her sacred duty of impressing on me the guilt of harbouring thoughts of revenge of course she did not attempt it in the presence of my mother but my guardian was there and doubtless knew her intention it was on a sunday after the service and she had stayed for the sacrament my sweet child she began you will excuse what i am about to say as i only speak for your good and from a humble sense that it is the path of duty it has pleased god in his infinite wisdom to afflict your dear mother with a melancholy so sensitive that she cannot bear any allusion to your deeplylamented father you have therefore no female guidance upon a subject which justly occupies so much of your thoughts your uncle edgar in his true affection for you has thought it right that you should associate more with persons calculated to develop your mind now i hate that word develop and i felt my passion rising but let her go on under these circumstances it grieves me deeply my poor dear child to find you still display a perversity and a wilful neglect of the blessed means of grace which must humanly speaking draw down a judgment upon you now open your heart to me the whole of your little unregenerate heart you mysterious but i firmly believe not illdisposed lambkin tell me all your thoughts your broodings your dreamsin fact your entire experiences uncle edgar will leave the room if you wish it certainly not i said quite right my dear have no secrets from one who has been your second father now tell me all your little troubles make me your motherconfessor i take the deepest interest in you true i am only a weak and sinful woman but my chastisements have worked together for my edification and god has been graciously pleased to grant me peace of mind you dont look as if you had much i cried her large eyes flashed a quick start from their depths like the stir of a newlyfathomed sea my guardians face gleamed with a smile of sly amusement recovering at once her calm objective superiority she proceeded i have been troubled and chastened severely but now i perceive that it was all for the best but perhaps it is not very graceful to remind me of that yet since all my trials have worked together for my good on that account i am under providence better qualified to advise you in your dark and perilous state i have seen much of what thoughtless people call life but in helping you i wish to proceed on higher principles than those of the world you possess beyond question a strong and resolute will but in your present benighted course it can lead only to misery now what is the principal aim of your life my love the death of my fathers murderer exactly so my unhappy child i knew it too well though a dark sin is your leading star i feel too painfully my own shortcomings and old unregenerate tendencies to refuse you my carnal sympathy you know my feelings edgar indeed eleanor replied my guardian with an impenetrable smile how should i you have always been such a model of every virtue she gave him a glance and again addressed me now suppose clara vaughan that after years of brooding and lonely anguish you obtain your revenge at last who will be any the better for it my father and i your father indeed how you wrong his sweet and most forgiving nature this was the first thing she had said that touched me and that because i had often thought of it before but i would not let her see it though his nature were an angels i cried as i believe it was never could he forgive that being who tore him from me and my mother i know that he watches me now and must be cold and a wanderer until i have done my duty to him and myself you awful child why youll frighten us all but you make it the more my duty come with me now and let me inculcate the doctrines of a higher and holier style thank you mrs daldy i want no teaching except my mothers you are too wilful and headstrong for her come to me my poor stray lamb i would sooner go to a butcher mrs daldy is it possible are you so lost to all sense of right yes if you are right i replied and left the room thenceforth she pursued tactics of another kind she tried me with flattery and fictitious confidence likely from a woman of her maturity to win a young girl by inflating selfesteem she even feigned a warm interest in my search and wished to partake in my readings and secret musings indeed i could seldom escape her i am ready to own that by her suggestions and quick apprehension she gained some ascendancy over me but not a tenth part of what she thought she had won and i still continued to long for her departure of this however no symptom appeared she made herself quite at home and did her best to become indispensable to my mother clement daldy had full opportunity to commend himself to my favour we were constantly thrown together in the presence of his mother and the absence of mine for a long time i was too young and too much engrossed by the object for which i lived to have any inkling of their scheme but suddenly a suspicion broke upon me my guardian and his sisterinlaw had formed as i thought a deliberate plot for marrying me when old enough to that tailors block the one had been so long accustomed to the lordship of the property to some county influence and great command of money that it was not likely he would forego the whole without a struggle but he knew quite well that the moment i should be of age i would dispense with his wardship and even with his residence there and devote all i had to the pursuit of my monomania all his endeavours to make me his thrall had failed partly from my suspicions partly from a repugnance which could not be conquered of course i intended to give him an ample return for his stewardship which had been wise and unwearying but this was not what he wanted the motives of his accomplice require no explanation if once this neat little scheme should succeed i must remain in their hands clement being nobody until they should happen to quarrel for me to show what clement daldy was a brief anecdote is enough when we were about sixteen years old we sat in the park one morning at the corner of the lake clements little curled spaniel which he loved as much as he could love anything was gambolling round us as the boy lounged along half asleep on the rustic chair with his silky face shaded by a broad hat and his bright curls glistening like daffodils playing i thought what a pretty peepshow he made and wondered whether he could anyhow be the owner of a soul oh clara he lisped as he chanced to look upcouthin clara i wish you wouldnt look at me tho and did it look fierce at its dolly i said for i was always goodnatured to him dolly knows i wouldnt hurt it for its house full of sugarplums then do let me go to thleep you are such a howwid girl so i hushed him off with a cradle song but before the long lashes sunk flat on his cheeks like the ermine tips on my muff and while his red lips yet trembled like cherries in the wind my attention was suddenly drawn to the lake there was a plashing and barking and hissing and napping of snowwhite wingspoor juan engaged in unequal combat with two fierce swans who had a nest on the island the poor little dog though he fought most gallantly was soon driven into deep water and the swans kept knocking him under with rapid and powerful strokes seeing him almost drowned i called clement to save him at once i cant said the brave youth you go if you like theyll kill me and i cant bear it and the water ith tho cold in a moment i pushed off the boat which was near jumped into it and seizing an oar contrived to beat back the swans and lifted the poor little dog on board gasping halfdrowned and woefully beaten meanwhile my lord elect had leaped on the seat for safety and was wringing his white little hands and dancing and crying oh clarall be throwned and theyll say it was me oh what thall i do what thall i do even when i brought him his little pet safe he would not touch him because he was wet so i laid him full on his lap chapter vii the spring of the year was remarkable throughout the western counties for long drought i know not how it may be in the east of england but i have observed that in the west long droughts occur only in the spring and early summer in the autumn we have sometimes as much as six weeks without rain and in the summer a month at most but all the real droughts so far as my experience goes commence in february or march these are however so rare and april has won such poetic fame for showers and july for heat and dryness that what i state is at variance with the popular impression be that as it may about valentinesday and after a length of very changeable weather the wind fixed its home in the east and the sky for a week was grey and monotonous brilliant weather ensued white frost at night and strong sun by day the frost became less biting as the year went on and the sun more powerful there were two or three overcast days and people hoped for rain but no rain fell except one poor drizzle more like dew than rain with habits now so ingrained as to become true pleasures i marked the effects of the drought on all the scene around me the meadows took the colour of russian leather the cornlands that of a knifeboard the young leaves of the wood hung pinched and crisp unable to shake off their tunics and more like catkins than leaves the pools went low and dark and thick with a coppery scum in autumn it would have been green and little bubbles came up and popped where the earth cracked round the sides the taprooted plants looked comely and brave in the morning after their drink of dew but flagged and flopped in the afternoon as a clubbed cabbage does as for those which had only the surface to suck they dried by the acre and powdered away like the base of a bonfire the ground was hard as horn and fissured in stars and angles and jagged gaping cracks like a dissecting map or a badlyplastered wall it amused me sometimes to see a beetle suddenly cut off from his home by that which to him was an earthquake how he would run to and fro look doubtfully into the dark abyss then rising to the occasion bridge his road with a straw the snails shrunk close in their shells and resigned themselves to a spongy distance of slime the birds might be seen in the morning hopping over the hollows of the shrunken ponds prying for worms which had shut themselves up like caddises deep in the thirsty ground our lake which was very deep at the lower end became a refuge for all the widgeons and coots and moorhens of the neighbourhood and the quickdiving grebe and even the summer snipe with his wild and lonely cheep the brink of the water was feathered and dabbled with countless impressions of feet of all sortsdibbers and waders and wagtails and weasels and otters and foxes and the bores of a thousand bills and muscles laid high and dry for my own pet robins i used to fill pans with water along the edge of the grass for i knew their dislike of the mineral spring which never went dry and to these they would fly down and drink and perk up their impudent heads and sluice their poor little dusty wings and then as they could not sing now they would give me a chirp of gratitude when the drought had lasted about three months the east wind which till then had been cold and creeping became suddenly parching hot arid and heavy and choking it panted along the glades like a dog on a dusty road it came down the watermeadows where the crowsfoot grew and wild celery and it licked up the dregs of the stream and powdered the floodgates all skeletons now with grey dust it came through the copse and the young leaves shrunk before it like a child from the hiss of a snake the blast pushed the doors of our house and its dry wrinkled hand was laid on the walls and the staircase and woodwork a hot grime tracked its steps and a taint fell on all that was fresh as it folded its baleful wings and lay down like a desert dragon vegetation so long a time sick gave way at last to despair and flagged off flabbed and dead the clammy grey dust like hot sand thrown from ramparts ate to the core of everything choking the shrivelled pores and stifling the languid breath old gaffers were talking of murrain in cattle and famine and plague among men and farmers were too badly off to grumble but the change even now was at hand the sky which had long presented a hard and cloudless blue but trailing a light haze round its rim in the morning was bedimmed more every day with a white scudding vapour across it the sun grew larger and paler and leaned more on the heavens which soon became ribbed with white skeletonclouds and these in their turn grew softer and deeper then furry and ravelled and wisped one night the hot east wind dropped and next morning though the vane had not changed the clouds drove heavily from the southwest but these signs of rain grew for several days before a single drop fell as is always the case after discontinuance it was hard to begin again indeed the sky was amassed with black clouds and the dust went swirling like a mat beaten over the trees and the air became cold and the wind moaned three days and three nights and yet no rain fell as old whitehead the man at the lodge well observed it had forgotten the way to rain then it suddenly cleared one morning the th of may and the west was streaked with red clouds that came up to crow at the sun and the wind for the time was lulled and the hills looked close to my hand so i went to my fathers grave without the little green wateringpot or a trowel to fill the chinks for i knew it would rain that very day in the eastern shrubbery there was a pond which my father had taken much trouble to make and adorn it was not fed by the mineral spring for that was thought likely to injure the fish but by a larger and purer stream called the witches brook which however was now quite dry this pond had been planted around and through with silverweed thrumwort and sunclew waterlilies arrowhead and the rare double frogbit and other aquatic plants some of them brought from a long distance at one end there was a grotto cased with fantastic porous stone and inside it a small fountain played but now the fountain was silent and the pond shrunk almost to its centre the silver eels which once had abounded here finding their element likely to fail made a migration one dewy night overland to the lake below the fish in vain envy of that great enterprise huddled together in the small wet space which remained with their backfins here and there above water when any one came near they dashed away as i have seen grey mullet do in the shallow seaside pools several times i had water poured in for their benefit but it was gone again directly the mud round the edge of the remnant puddle was baked and cracked and foul with an oozy green sludge the relic of waterweeds this little lake once so clear and pretty and full of bright dimples and crystal shadows now looked so forlorn and wasted and old like a bright eye worn dim with years and the trees stood round it so faded and wan the poplar unkempt of its silver and green the willow without wherewithal to weep and the sprays of the birch laid dead at its feet altogether it looked so empty and sad and piteous that i had been deeply grieved for the sake of him who had loved it so when the sky clouded up again in the afternoon of that day i hastened thither to mark the first effects of the rain as i reached the white shellwalk which loosely girt the pond the leadcoloured sky took a greyer and woollier cast and overhead became blurred and pulpy while round the horizon it lifted in frayed festoons as i took my seat in the grotto the big drops began to patter among the dry leaves and the globules rolled in the dust like parched peas a long hissing sound ensued and a cloud of powder went up and the trees moved their boughs with a heavy dull sway then broke from the laurels the song of the longsilent thrush and reptiles and insects and all that could move darted forth to rejoice in the freshness the earth sent forth that smell of sweet newness the breath of young nature awaking which reminds us of milk and of clover of balm and the smile of a child but most of all it was in and around the pool that the signs of new life were stirring as the circles began to jostle and the bubbles sailed closer together the water the slime and the banks danced flickered and darkened with a whirl of living creatures the surface was brushed as green corn is flawed by the wind with the quivering dip of swallows wings and the ripples that raced to the land splashed over the feet of the wagtails here as i marked all narrowly and seemed to rejoice in their gladness a sudden new wonder befell me i was watching a monster frog emerge from his penthouse of ooze and lift with some pride his brown spots and his bright golden throat from the matted green cake of dry weed when a quick gleam shot through the fibres with a listless curiosity wondering whether the frog like his cousin the toad were a jeweller i advanced to the brim of the pool the poor frog looked timidly at me with his large starting eyes then shouldering off the green coil made one rapid spring and was safe in the water but his movement had further disclosed some glittering object below determined to know what it was despite the rain i placed some large pebbles for steps ran lightly and lifted the weed before me lay as bright as if polished that day with the jewelled hilt towards me a long narrow dagger with a haste too rapid for thought to keep up i snatched it and rushed to the grotto there in the drought of my long revenge with eyes on fire and teeth set hard and dry and every root of my heart cleaving and crying to heaven for blood i pored on that weapon whose last sheath had beenhow well i knew what i did not lift it towards god nor fall on my knees and make a theatrical vow for that there was no necessity but for the moment my life and my soul seemed to pass along that cold blade just as my fathers had done a treacherous blue threecornered blade with a point as keen as a vipers fang sublustrous like ice in the moonlight sleuth as hate and tenacious as death to my curdled and furystruck vision it seemed to writhe in the gleam of the storm which played along it like a corpsecandle i fancied how it had quivered and rung to find itself deep in that heart my passions at length overpowered me and i lay how long i know not utterly insensible when i came to myself again the storm had passed over the calm pool covered my stepping stones the shrubs and trees wept joy in the moonlight the nightingales sang in the elms healing and beauty were in the air peace and content walked abroad on the earth the may moon slept on the water before me and streamed through the grotto arch but there it fell cold and ghostlike upon the tool of murder over this i hastily flung my scarf coward perhaps i was for i could not handle it then but fled to the house and dreamed in my lonely bed when i examined the dagger next day i found it to be of foreign fabric ferrati bologna the name and abode of the maker as i supposed was damascened on the hilt a cross like that on the footprint but smaller and made of gold was inlaid on the blade just above the handle the hilt itself was wreathed with a snake of green enamel having garnet eyes from the fine temper of the metal or some annealing process it showed not a stain of rust and the blood which remained after writing the letters before described had probably been washed off by the water i laid it most carefully by along with my other relics in a box which i always kept locked so god as i thought by his sun and his seasons and weather and the mind he had so prepared was holding the clue for me and shaking it clear from time to time along my dark and manywinding path chapter viii soon after this a ridiculous thing occurred the consequences of which were grave enough the summer and autumn after that weary drought were rather wet and stormy one night towards the end of october it blew a heavy gale after torrents of rain going to the churchyard next day i found as i had expected that the flowers so carefully kept through the summer were shattered and strewn by the tempest and so i returned to the garden for others to plant in their stead my cousin clement as he was told to call himself came sauntering towards me among the beds his usual look of shallow brightness and empty selfesteem had failed him for the moment and he looked like a fantailed pigeon who has tumbled down the horserack he followed me to and fro with a sort of stuttering walk as i chose the plants i liked best but i took little notice of him for such had been my course since i first discovered their scheme at last as i stooped to dig up a white verbena he came behind me and began his errand with more than his usual lisp this i shall not copy as it is not worth the trouble oh clara he said i want to tell you something if youll only be goodnatured dont you see i am busy now i replied without turning to look wont it do when you have taken your curlpapers off now clara you know that i never use curlpapers my hair doesnt want it you know its much prettier than your long waving black stuff and it curls of its own accord if mamma only brushes it but i want to tell you something particular well then be quick for i am going away and with that i stood up and confronted him he was scarcely so tall as myself and his light showy dress and pink rose of a face which seemed made to be worn in the hair were thrown into brighter relief by my sombre apparel and earnest twilight look some lurking sense of this contrast seemed to add to his hesitation at last he began again you know cousin clara you must not be angry with me because it isnt my fault what is not your fault why that i should fallwhat do they call itfall in love i suppose you fall in love you dissolute doll how dare you fall in love sir without my leave well i was afraid to ask you clara i couldnt tell what you would say oh that must depend of course on who mrs doll is to be if its a good little thing with blue satin arms and a sash and a slip and pretty blue eyes that go with a string perhaps ill forgive you poor child and set you up with a house and a teaset and a motherofpearl perambulator now dont talk nonsense he answered before long i shall be a man and then youll be afraid of me and put up your hands and shriek and want me to kiss you i had indulged him too much and his tongue was taking liberties i soon stopped him how dare you bark at me you wretched little whitewoolled nursery dog i left him and went with my basket of flowers along the path to the churchyard for a while he stood there frightened till his mother looked forth from the drawingroom window between the two fears he chose the less and followed me to my fathers grave i stood there and angrily waved him back but he still persisted though trembling cousin clara he saidand his lisp was quite gone and he tried to be in a passioncousin clara you shall hear what i have got to say you have lived with me now a long time and im sure we have agreed very well and iino i dont see why we should not be married dont you indeed sir perhaps he continued you are afraid that i dont care about you really now i often think that you would be very goodlooking if you would only laugh now and then and leave off those nasty black gowns and then if you would only leave off being so grand and mysterious and stately and getting up so early i would let you do as you liked and you might paint me and have a lock of my hair clement daldy i asked do you see that lake yes he replied turning pale and inclined to fly theres water enough there now if you ever dare again to say one word like this to me or even to show by your looks that you think it ill take you and drown you there as sure as my father lies here he slunk away quickly without a word and could eat no lunch that day in the afternoon as i sat in my favourite bowwindow seat mrs daldy glided in she had put on with care her clinging smile as she would an indian shawl i thought how much better her face would have looked with its natural bold haughty gaze my dear clara began this pious tidewaiter what have you done to vex so your poor cousin clement only this mrs daldy he was foolish or mad and i gave him advice in a truly christian spirit entirely for his own good i hope my dear that some day it may be his duty as well as his privilege to advise you but of course you need not take his advice my clara loves her own way as much as any girl i ever knew and with poor clement she will be safe to have it no doubt of that i replied and then my pet you will be in a far better position than you could attain as an unmarried girl to pursue the great aim of your life so far i mean as is not inconsistent with the spirit of christian forgiveness your guardian has thought of that in effecting this arrangement and i trust that i was not wrong in allowing so fair a prospect under providence of your ultimate peace of mind to influence me considerably when he sought my consent i am sure i am much obliged to you i cannot conceal from you so clearsighted as you areand if i could i object to concealment of any kind on principlethat there are also certain worldly advantages which are not without weight however the heart be weaned by trials and chastened from transient things and your guardian has this arrangement so very much at heart my own dear child i have felt for you so long that i love you as a daughter how thankful i ought to be to the giver of all good things to have you really my own dear child be thankful madam when you have got it this is a good thing which under providence you must learn to do without it was coarse of me to hint at my riches but what could i do with her why clara she asked in great amazement you cannot be so foolish and wilful as to throw away this chance of revenge if only for your dear mothers sake as well as your fathers it is the path of duty let me tell you both she and yourself are very much more in your guardians power than you have any idea and what would be your poor fathers wish who has left you so entirely to his brothers care and discretion will you put off for ever the discovery of his murderer my father i said proudly would scorn me for doing a thing below him and myself the last of the vaughans to be plotted away to a grocers doll it had been a trial of temper and contempt was too much for hypocrisy through the rouge of the world and the pearlpowder of religion nature flushed forth on her cheek for she really loved her son she knew where to wound me the deepest is it no condescension in us that my beautiful boy should stoop to the maniacchild of a man who was stabbedstabbed in his midnight bedto atone no doubt for some low act of his own i sprang up and rang the bell thomas kenwood who made a point of attending me came at once i said to him calmly and slowly allow this person one hour to pack her things get a fly from the walnut tree inn and see her beyond the lodge if i had told him to drag her away by the hair i believe that man would have done it she shrunk away from me for the moment her spirit was quelled and she trembled into a chair i assure you clara i did not mean what i said you provoked me so not one word more leave the room and the house miss vaughan i will not leave this house until your guardian returns thomas i said without looking towards her if mrs daldy is not gone in an hour you quit my service how thomas kenwood managed it i never asked he was a resolute man and all the servants obeyed him she turned round once as she crossed the threshold and gave me a look which i shall never forget was such the look that had glared on my father before the blow she lifted the white arm of which she was proud and threw back her head like the fecial hurling his dart clara vaughan you shall bitterly grieve for this it shall throw you and your mother at the feet of your fathers murderer and you shall crave meat worse than your enemys blood until she had quitted the house i could not sit down but went to my fathers bedroom where i often took refuge when strongly excited and unable to fly to his grave the thoughts and the memories hovering and sighing around that fatal chamber were enough to calm and allay the sensations of trivial wrong but now this was not the case the outrage offered had been not to me but to him who seemed present there the suggestion too of an injury done by my father though scorned at first was working and ruffling within me as children put bearded cornears in anothers sleeve which byandby work their own way to the breast till now i had always believed that some worldly advantage or gain had impelled my foe to the deed which left me an orphan but that womans dark words had started a new train of reasoning whose very first motion was doubt of the man i worshipped among all i had ever met there existed but one opinion as to what he had beena true gentleman who had injured not one of gods creatures whose life had been guided mainly by the wishes and welfare of others moreover i had my own clear recollectionshis voice his eyes and his smile his manner and whole expression these it is true were but outward things yet a childs intuition is strong and hard to refute again during my remembrance he had never been absent from us except for a day or two now and then among his county neighbours and any ill will which he might have incurred from them must from his position have become notorious and yet in the teeth of this reasoning and in spite of my own warm feeling that horrible suspicion clave to my heart and chilled it like the black spot of mildew and what if the charge were true in that case how was i better than he who had always been to my mind a fiend in special commission his was vengeance and mine revenge he had suffered perhaps a wanton wrong as deep to his honour as mine to my love while i was brooding thus miserably my eyes fell upon the bed there were the red streaks grained and fibred like the crosscut of a fernstalk framed and looking down on me the sampler of my life drawing near i trembled with an unknown awe to find myself in that lonely presence not indeed thinking but inkling such things of my father my own darling father whose blood was looking at me in a storm of selfloathing and sorrow i knelt there and sobbed my atonement but never thenceforth could i wholly bar out the idea foul ideas when once admitted will ever return on their track as the cholera walks in the trail of its former pall but instead of abating my dogged pursuit i now had a new incentiveto dispel the aspersions cast on my fathers shadow chapter ix at this particular time of my life many things began to puzzle me but nothing was a greater puzzle than the character of my guardian morose or moody he was not though a stranger might have thought him so nor could i end with the conviction that his heart was cold it rather seemed to me as if he felt that it ought to be so and tried his best to settle down as the inmate of an icehouse but any casual flush of love any glow of native warmth from the hearts around him and taken by surprise he wavered for one traitor moment and in his eyes gleamed some remembrance like firelight upon frozen windows but let any one attempt to approach him then with softness to stir kind interest and feeling into benevolent expression and mr vaughan would promptly shut himself in again with a bar of irony or a bolt of sarcasm only to my mother was his behaviour different towards her his manner was so gentle and his tone so kind that but for my conviction that remorse lay under it i must have come to like him true they did not often meet for dear mother confined herself in spite of mrs daldy more and more closely to her own part of the house and rarely had the spirits now to share in the meals of the family therefore i began at once to take her place and would not listen to mrs daldys kind offer to relieve me this had led quite recently to a little outbreak one day i had been rather late for dinner and entering the room with a proud apology found to my amazement mrs daldy at the head of the table for me a seat was placed as for a good little girl by the side of master clement at first i had not the presence of mind to speak but stood by my rivals chair waiting for her to rise she affected not to understand me and began with her hand on the ladle and looking me full in the face i fear darling clara the soup is cold but your uncle can give you a very nice slice of salmon have you offered thanks for these mercies thank you i will take soup allow me to help myself i am sorry to have troubled you and i placed my hand on the back of her chair presuming that she would get up but she never stirred one inch and actually called for a plate to help me my guardian was looking at both of us with a dry smile of amusement and clement began to simper and play with his forknow for it or never thought i mrs daldy you quite mistake me or pretend to do so have the goodness to quit my chair she had presumed on my dread of an altercation before the servants but only thomas henwood happened to be in the room had there been a dozen present i would still have asserted my right at last she rose in her stateliest manner but with an awkward smile and a still more awkward sneer your use my poor child of the possessive pronoun is far more emphatic than your good breeding is who cares for your opinion not a hospitable inquiry but then she was not my visitor in grand style she marched to the door but soon thought better of it and came to her proper place with the sigh of a contrite spirit poor creature it is a rebuke to me for my want of true faith in the efficacy of prayer and after all this she made a most excellent dinner about that woman there was something of a slimy pride no more like to upright prickly selfrespect than macerated birdlime is to the stiff bright holly yet no one i ever knew possessed such wiry powers of irritation whenever my mother and my guardian met she took care to be in the way and watched them both and appealed to me with all her odious pantomime of sorrow sympathy wonder loving superiority and spiritual yearnings and all the time her noisome smile like the smell of a snake came over us she knew and rejoiced in the knowledge how hard set i was to endure it and every quick flash of my eyes only lit up her unctuous glory for all i know it was natural that my antipathy to that woman should by reaction thaw sometimes my coldness towards my uncle though selfrespect had at length compelled him to abandon his overtures to my friendship now and then i detected him looking at me with a pitying regard in selfdefence i began to pity him and ceased to make faces or sneer when the maidsthose romantic beingsdeclared that he must have been crossed in love at this conclusion long ago all the servants hall had arrived and even little tilly jenkins not admitted as yet to that high conclave remarkable only for living in dustbins and too dirty to cause uneasiness to the undershoeboys mothereven that tilly i say ran up to me one morning when i went to see my dear pony and beat out her dust and then whispered oh please miss clara to give my very best wishes to master what a terrible blight to the heart be unrequited love and tilly sighed a great cloud of brickdust terrible tilly i hope you have not fallen in love with the weeding boya smart young lad ten stairs at least above her me miss do you think i would so demean myself and tilly caught up her dustpan arrogantly this little anecdote proves a fact which i never could explain viz that none of the servants were ever afraid of me to return to the straight line of history my guardian came home rather late that evening and some hours after the hasty exit of mrs and master daldy while i was waiting in some uneasiness it struck me that he had kept out of the way on purpose lest he should seem too anxious about the plot mrs daldy as i found afterwards had written to him from the inn describing my frenzied violence and foaming satanic furyperhaps i turned pale no moreand announcing her intention to remain at malvern until she should be apprised whether uncle or niece were the master in the latter case she demandednot that she cared for mammon but as a humble means for the advancement of the kingdomthe sum of l that being the lowest salary conscience allowed her to specify for treading the furnace of affliction to save the lost sheep of the house of israel i forgot to say that before she left the house she had tried to obtain an interview with my mother hoping no doubt to leave her in the cataleptic state but this had been sternly prevented by thomas kenwood who performed quite a labour of love in ministering the expulsion all the servants hated her as a canting sneak and a spy that night when i received mr edgar vaughans short missiveclara i wish to see you immediately in my study my heart began to flutter provokingly and the long speech i had prepared flew away in shreds of rhetoric not that i meant for an instant to bate one tittle of what i had done and would do but i had never asserted my rights as yet in direct opposition to him nor taken upon my own shoulders the guardianship of myself but the dreary years of dark preparation and silent welding of character had braced a sensitive nervous nature with some little selfreliance with all the indifference i could muster i entered the gloomy room and found him leaning upon the high desk where he kept the accounts of his stewardship the position was chosen well it served at once to remind me of his official relation and to appeal to the feelings as betokening an onerous wardship of late his health had been failing him and after every long absence from home he returned more jaded and melancholy now a few silver hairsno more than a wife would have quickly pulled outwere glistening among his black locks but though he was weary and lonesome he seemed to want none to love him and his face wore the wonted sarcastic and travelled look as our glances met we both saw that the issue was joined which should settle for life the mastery he began in a light and jocund manner as if i were quite a small thing well done miss clara you are asserting yourself why you have dismissed our visitors with very scant ceremony to be sure i have and will again if they dare to come back and dont you think that you might have consulted your mother or me most likely i should have done so in an ordinary case then your guardian was meant for small matters but what was the wonder today no wonder at all mrs daldy insulted my father and i sent her out of his house what made her insult my brother my refusal to marry her puppet and puppy clement daldy did she propose such a thing she must think very highly of you then i think very lowly and you declined did you clara no i refused very good no one shall force you there is plenty of time to consider the subject one moment is too much clara i have long noticed in you a rude disrespectful and i will say in spite of your birth a low and vulgar manner towards me your uncle and guardian once for all i will not permit it child child you call me do you me who am just seventeen and have lived seven such years as i have and no one else he answered quite calmly and looking coldly at me i never argue with women much less with girls mrs daldy comes back tomorrow you will beg her pardon as becomes a young lady who has forgotten herself the other question may wait i thought sir that you had travelled far and in many countries the abrupt inquiry startled him and his thoughts seemed to follow the memory what if i have he asked at length and with a painful effort have you always found women do just what you chose he seemed not to listen to me as if he were out of hearing then laughed because i was looking at him clara he said you are an odd girl and a vaughan all over i would rather be your friend than your enemy if you cannot like me at least forget your dislike of me and remember that i am your uncle and have tried to make you love me and what if i do not then i must keep you awhile from the management of this property my dear brother would have wished it until you recover your senses and not an acre of it is legally yours this he said so slowly and distinctly and entirely without menace that knowing his manner i saw it was the truth at least in his opinion strange as it may seem i began at once to revolve not the results of dispossession and poverty on myself or even on my mother but the influence which the knowledge of this new fact must have on my old suspicions surmises and belief will the property pass to you i asked yes if i choose or at any rate the bulk of it what part will be yours do you mean to say the house never mind now i would rather leave things as they are if you will only be more sensible i will not disguise my opinions for a hundred vaughan parks or a thousand vaughan palaces no nor even to be near my fathers bones very well he said just as you like but for your mothers sake i give you till christmas to consider if you bring back mrs daldy i shall leave the door as she enters it i have no wish to hurry you he replied and therefore she shall not return at present now take these papers with you you may lay them before any lawyer you please they are only copies but may be compared with the originals which i have they will quickly prove how totally you are at my discretion the money and the land may be so but not i before i go answer me one question did you know of these things whatever they may be before my fathers death he looked at me clearly and calmly with no withdrawal or conscious depth in his eyes and answered no as a gentleman i did not i felt myself more at a loss than ever and for the moment could not think chapter x thus was i and what mattered much more my mother reduced quite suddenly from a position of rank and luxury and a prospective income of l ayear so much had the land increased in value to a revenue of nothing and no home even to me it was a heavy blow but what could my poor mother do we were assured by counsel that a legal struggle could end in expense alone and advised by the family lawyers to throw ourselves on the good feeling and appeal to the honour of mr edgar vaughan mr vaughan he must henceforth be called i cannot well understand still less can i explain small and threadbare technicalities motes which too often are the beam of justice but the circumstances which robbed me of my fathers home were somewhat as follows by the will of my fathers grandfather hubert vaughan who died in the year the whole of the family property was devised to his son vaughan powis vaughan for life and after his decease to his sons successively in tail male failing these to his right heirs in general this will was said to have been prepared in haste it was in fact drawn by a country attorney when the testator was rapidly sinking it was very brief and by no means accurately worded neither did it contain those powers to meet family exigencies which i am told a proper practitioner would have inserted there was no reason to suppose that the testator had contemplated anything more than a strict settlement of the usual kind ie a common estate entail expectant upon a lifeinterest and under which i should have succeeded my father as his heiress in the ordinary course but it is the chief fault of smatterers in the law and country attorneys at that time were no better that they will attempt to be too definite the country lawyer in this case grossly ignorant of his profession and caught by the jangle of the words tail male had inserted them at hazard possibly not without some idea that they would insure a stricter succession than a common entail would do when my father became of age measures were taken for barring the entail created by the will of hubert vaughan and at the time it was believed that these were quite effectual and therefore that my father was now entitled in feesimple and could dispose of the property upon his marriage with my mother she with worthy pride refused most firmly to accept a jointure charged on his estates alleging that as she brought no fortune into the family she would not incumber the family property which had but recently been relieved of incumbrances more than thisshe had even insisted upon expressly abandoning by her marriage settlement all claim to dower this unusual course she had adopted because of some discontent expressed by relatives of my father at his marriage with a portionless bride whereby her selfrespect had been deeply wounded so nothing was settled upon her except her own little estate in devonshire which was secured to her separate use my father had never permitted this excess of generosity on her part but that he was by nature careless upon such subjects and hoped to provide amply for her interests by his will moreover he was hot to remove all obstacles to their marriage but it was now discovered that he had no power to charge the real estate for her benefit in the manner his will imported that he had never been more than a tenant in tail and that entail such that i could not inherit neither of course could i take under his will as he possessed no power of disposition one quarter of all that has been written upon the subject i never could understand and even as to the simplest points sometimes i seem to apprehend them clearly and then i feel that i do not my account of the matter is compressed from what i remember of the legal opinions the leading fact at any rate and the key to all the mischief was that the entail had never been barred at all the legal process called a recovery which was to have had that effect being null and void through some absurd informality they told me something about a tenant to a precipice but they must have made a mistake for there was no precipice on the estate unless some cliffs near the church could be called so and they were never let be that as it may my fathers will was declared to be waste paper except as regarded what they called the personalty or in good english the money he had to bequeath and of this there was very little for shortly before his death he had spent large sums in drainage farmbuildings and other improvements furthermore he had always maintained a profuse hospitality and his charity was most lavish the lawyers told us that under the circumstances a favourite expression of theirs when they mean some big robbery a court of equity would perhaps consider our application to be recupped as they called it out of the estate for the money laid out in improvements under a false impression but we had been cupped enough already grossly plundered by legal jargon robbed by statute and scourged by scriveners traditions we flung away in disgust the lint the bandits offered and left them all estate right title interest and claim whether at law or in equity in to or out of the licking of our blood but now my long suspicions and neverdiscarded conviction of my guardians guilt were by summary process not only revived but redoubled this arose partly from the discovery of the stake he had on my fathers life and partly perhaps from a feeling of hatred towards our supplanter that he knew not till now the flaw in our title and his own superior claim was more than i could believe i felt sure that he had gained this knowledge while in needy circumstances and sharp legal practice brought as he then most probably was into frequent contact with the london agents who had the custody of the documents to be in the same room with him was now more than i could bear and it became impossible that we should live any longer in the same house he indeed wished or feigned to wish that we should remain there and even showed some reluctance to urge his unrighteous rights but neither my mother who bore the shock with strange resignation nor myself would hear of any compromise or take a farthing at his hands and he was too proud and stern to press upon us his compunctions statements of our case had been prepared and submitted to three most eminent conveyancers and the three opinions had been found to agree except upon some trivial points more than two months had been thus consumed and it was now once more the anniversary of my fathers death i had spent the time in narrowly watching my exguardians conduct though keeping aloof as much as possible from any intercourse with him one night i stole into the room which he called his study and where with a childs simplicity i believed him to keep his private documents through thomas kenwood to whom i now confided almost everything and whose suspicions were even stronger than mine i obtained clandestine possession of the keys of the large bureau as i stood before that massive repository in the dead of night the struggle within me was intense and long what letters what journals documents or momentous relics of a thousand kinds might be lurking here waiting only for a daughters hand to turn the lock and cast the light she bore on the deathwarrant of her father how easy then to snatch away the proof clutching it though it should burn the hand or bosom to wave it with a triumph wilfully prolonged before the eyes of justices dullvisioned ministers and then to see without a shudder or a thrill of joy but with the whole soul gazing the slow struggling ghastly expiation as this thought came crawling through my heart lighting up its depth as would a snake of fire the buhl before me grew streaks of blood and the heavy crossbars a gallows i lifted my hand to open the outer lock already the old cruciform key was trembling in the silver scutcheon i raised the lamp in my left hand to show the lunette guard which curved above the hole when a heavy mass all cold and dark fell across my eyes i started and thought for the moment in my strong excitement that it was my fathers hand one instant more and through the trembling of my senses i saw that it was only a thick fold of my long black hair shaken down on the face by my bending and quivering posture but the check was enough a vaughan and that the last one of so proud and frank a race to be prowling meanly with a stolen tool to violate confidence and pry through letters no suspicion however strong nothing short of certainty if even that could warrant it driven away by shame combined with superstition i glided from the cold silent room and restored the keys to my faithful friend whom i had left in the passage ordering him at once to replace them and never touch them again well miss he whispered with a smile i knew you couldnt do it because i seemed somehow it wasnt like a vaughan we were already preparing to quit the house no longer ours when our dismissal became abrupt through another act of mine what drove me to such a wild deed i can scarcely tell shame perhaps for the furtive nature of my last attempt hurried me into the other extreme and now i was so shaken by conflicting impulse that nothing was too mad for me on the seventh anniversary of my fathers death and the last which i was likely ever to spend beneath that roof i passed the whole day in alternate sadness and passion in the bedroom where he died all the relics i possessed both of his love and of his death i brought thither and spread them out and wept upon the one and prayed upon the other i also brought my choicest histories of murder and revenge and pored over them by the waning daylight and the dull lamp and so on through the night until my mind became the souls jetsam then i procured four very large wax candles and lit them at the head of the bed two on each side and spread a long white cloth between as if my father were lying in state and hung a row of shorter lights above to illuminate the letters of blood then i took a small alarum clock given me by dear father that i might rise for early walks with him and set it upon a chest by the door and fixed it so as to ring five minutes before the hour at which the murder befell a cold presentiment crawled through me that at the fatal time i should see the assassin after all these arrangements i took my volume again and sat in the shade of the curtain with a strong light on the page i was deep in some horrible record and creeping with terror and hope when the clear bell rang a long and startling peal i leaped up like one shot through the heart and what i did was without design or purpose my glance fell on the dagger i caught it up and snatched the lamp and hurried down corridor and staircase straight to my guardians private room he was sitting at the table for he never passed that night in bed at the sound of the lock he leaped up and pointed a pistol then hid it straight up to him i went as swiftly and quietly as a spirit and spoke seven years ago at this very moment my father was killed do you know this dagger he started back as if i had stabbed him with it then covered his eyes with both hands you know it then i said with a triumph chill all over me it was your hand that used it another moment and i should have struck him with it i lifted it in my frenzy when he looked at me by some wonderful effort calmly steadily even coldly yes he said i have seen that weapon before alas my poor dear brother whether it was true feeling that made his voice so low and deep or only fierce selfcontrol i knew not then nor tried to think you know who owned it i asked with my life upon his answer yes i know who owned it once but many years ago and i know not in the least what is become of him now the baffled fury and prostrate hopefor at the moment i fully believed himwere too much for my reeling brain and fasting body for one minutes command of my faculties i would have sold them for ever but i felt them ebbing from me as the life does from a wound the hemispheres of my brain were parting one from the other and a grey void spreading between them i tried to think but could not i strove to say anything but failed fainter and fainter grew the room the lamp the ceiling the face at which i tried to look things went to and fro with a quicker quiver like flame in the wind then round and round like whirling water my mouth grew stiff and the tongue between my teeth felt like a glove and with a rush of sound in my brain and throat and a scream pent up yet bursting i fell as i thought through the earth i was only on the floor in a fit when i came to myself i was in my own bed and my own dear mother bending over me pale and haggard and full of tears the broad daylight was around us and the faint sunshine on her face she had been with me ever since in my weakness i looked up at her with a pang of selfreproach to think how little i had valued her love and i vowed to myself to make up for it by future care and devotion that violent convulsion and the illness after it changed me not a little both in mind and body chapter xi it was indeed high time for me to cherish my mother her pain at leaving the place where she had known her little all of happinessfor her childhood had been overcast with troubleher pain was so acute and overpowering that all my deep impassioned feelings sunk reproved before it my guardian now seemed much embittered against me and anxious for our departure he came once or twice in my illness to ask for and to see me and he brought back unperceived by any one the weapon for which i raved but ere i was quite recovered he wrote requesting to see me on business in his study i could not speak yet without pain having bitten my tongue severely your mother shall have a home here he said as long as ever she wants one but as for you malignant or mad i will try no more to soften you when first i saw you in your early childhood you flew at me as a murderer soon after you ransacked my cupboards and stole my boots to compare them with some impressions or casts you kept yes you look astonished i never told you of it but i knew it for all that of those absurdities i thought little for i regarded them as the follies of a mad child and i pitied you deeply and even liked you for your filial devotion but now i find that you have grown up in the same belief and you dare even now to avow it you know that i have no fear of you then why had you got that pistol i saw that he was vexed and surprised at my having perceived it in a house like this where such deeds have been done i think it right to be armed do you think if i had feared you or your evidence i would have restored that dagger whose was it i told you the other night that i once saw a weapon like it for which at first i mistook it but closer examination convinced me of the difference how does it differ in this there was no snake on the handle of the other though there was the cross on the blade and where did you see the other some day i will tell you it is not right to do so now not convenient to you i suppose you mean i have also shown you that the lock of hair found in your poor mothers hand is much finer and more silky than mine and you know that i cannot draw on my foot a boot so small as the one whose impression you have but i am ashamed of myself for having stooped to such proofs as these dare you to look at me and suppose that i with my own hand could have stabbed my brother a brother so kind and good to me and for whose sake alone i have borne so long with you he tried to look me down i have met but one whose gaze could master mine and he was not that one so you doubt me still are your things packed yes and my mothers then if your mother is well enough and will not let you leave her you had better go next week no i replied we will go tomorrow wilful to the last so be it take this you cannot refuse it in duty to your mother he put in my hand an order for a large sum of money i threw it into the fire there have been criminals i exclaimed who have suffered from a lifelong fear lest the widow and orphans starved through their crime should compass their dying bed though we starve in a garret we touch no bread of yours bravo miss melodrame you need never starve in the present state of the stage that i dont understand but this i do it is perhaps the last time i shall ever see you living whether you did that deed or not is known to god and you and possibly one other but whether you did it or not i know it is on your soul your days are wretched your nights are troubled you shall die as your brother died but not so prepared for death good bye clara my lunch is coming up god has much to forgive me but nothing worse than the dark thought of that speech in my fury at weakness in such a cause i had dared sometimes to imagine that my mother knew him to be the murderer but concealed it for the sake of the family honour chapter xii no need to recount my bitter farewell to all the scenes and objects i had loved so long to all which possessed a dark yet tender interest and most of all to my fathers grave that some attention might still be paid to this i entrusted it to the care of an old housekeeper of ours who was living in the village my last visit was in the moonlight and dear mother was there i carried rather than led her away slight as my knowledge has been of lightsome and happy love i am sure that a sombre affection is far the stronger and sweeter as we began our journey a crowd of the villagers met us beyond the lodge and lined the gloucester road as far as the old oaktree while our hired conveyance passed between them the men stood mute with their hats in their hands the women sobbed and curtseyed and blessed us and held up their children to look at us our refuge was the small estate or farm in devonshire which i have mentioned as my mothers property this which produced l ayear was all that now remained to us except a sum of l left to me by a godfather and of which i could not touch the principal the residue of the personalty and the balance at the bankers we had refused to take being assured that legally we were responsible to mr vaughan even for the back rents of the gloucestershire estate of course we had plenty of jewellery some of it rather valuable but the part most precious was heirloom and that we had left behind most of our own had been my fathers gift and therefore we could not bear to sell it as regarded myself this comparative poverty was not of very great moment except as impairing my means of search but for my mothers sake i was cut to the heart and lost in perplexity she had so long been accustomed to much attention and many luxuries which her weak health had made indispensable to her thomas henwood and poor ann maples insisted on following our fortunes at one third of their previous wages my mother thought it beyond our means to keep them even so but for her sake i resolved to try i need not say that i carried all my relics difficult as it was to hide them from my mother when we reached our new home late in the evening of the second day a full sense of our privation for the first time broke upon us it was midwinter and in the gloom of a foggy night and after the weariness of a long journey our impressions were truly dismal jolted endlessly up and down by ruts a foot deep and slaty stones the size of coalscuttles entombed alive betwixt grisly hedges which met above us like the wings of night then obliged to walk up treadmill hills while the rickety fly crawled up behind then again plunging and lurching down some corkscrew steep to the perpetual wood and rushing stream at the bottom at length and at last along a lane so narrow that it scraped us on both sides as we passed a lane which zigzagged every thirty yards with a treebole jutting at every corner at length and at last we came to the farmyard gate it was not far from the lonely village of trentisoe which lies some six miles to the west of lynmouth this part is little known to london tourists though it possesses scenery of a rarer kind than lynmouth itself can show passing through an outer court with a sawpit on one side and what they call a linhay on the other and where a slop of straw and muck quelched under the wheels we came next to the farmyard proper and so as the flyman expressed it home to ouze the ouze was a low straggling cottage jagthatched and heavyeaved and reminded me strongly of ragged wet horsecloths on a rack the farmer was not come home from ilfracombe market but his wife mrs honor huxtable soon appeared in the porch with a bucket in one hand and a candle stuck in a turnip in the other in the crosslights we saw a stout short woman brisk and comely with an amazing cap and cheeks like the apples which they call in devonshire hoary mornings a massy on us zuke she called into the house if here baint the genelvolks coom and us be arl of a muck hum cheel hum for thee laife to the calves ouze and toorn out both the pegs and take the pick to the strah and gie un a veed o wets having thus provided for our horse she advanced to us so ye be coom at last i be crule glad to zee e zure enough baint e starved amost an unkid place it be for the laikes of you so saying she hurried us into the house and set us before a woodfire all glowing upon the ground beneath an enormous chimney podded with great pots and crocks hung on things like saws these pots like devonshire hospitality were always boiling and chirping the kitchen was low and floored with lime and sand which was worn into pits such as boys use for marbles but the great feature was the ceiling this was divided by deep rafters into four compartments lengthwise across some of these battens of wood were nailed forming a series of racks wherein reposed at least a styeful of bacon herbs and stores of many kinds and ropes of onions dangled between mrs huxtable went to the dresser and got a large dish and then turned round to have a good look at us poor leddy she said gently i sim hers turble weist and low but look e zee there be a plenty of bakken yanner and usll cut a pegs drort tomorrow and varmer badcock ll zend we a ship by rason ourn be all alambing then she turned to me whai miss you looks crule unkid tu do e love zider no mrs huxtable not very much i would rather have water oh drat that wash e shant have none of thiccy us has got a brown gearge of beer and more nor a dizzen pans of mulk and crame her chattering warmth soon put us at our ease and as soon as the parlour fire burnt up she showed us with many apologies and hopping no offence the room which was thenceforth to be ours after tea i put my dear mother to bed as soon as possible and sat by the dying fire to muse upon our prospects not the strangeness of the place the new ideas around me not even my weariness after railroad coach and chaise could keep my mind from its one subject in fact its colour had now become its form to others indeed all hope of ever detecting and bringing to justice the man for whose death i lived might seem to grow fainter and fainter expelled from that place and banished from those recollections where and by which alone i could well expect ever to wind up my clue robbed of all means of moving indifferent persons and retaining strong ones and more than this engrossed as i must henceforth be in keeping debt at bay and shielding my mother from carewhat prospect was there nay what possibility that i a weak unaided girl led only by set will and fatalism should ever overtake and grasp a man of craft and power and desperation it mattered not let other things be doubtful unlikely or impossible let the hands of men be clenched against me and the ears of heaven be stopped let the earth be spread with thick darkness as the waters are spread with earth and the murderer set sahara between us or turn hermit on the andes happen what would so god were still above us and the world beneath our feeti was as sure that i should send that man from the one to the throne of the other as he was sure to be dragged away thence to fire and chains and gnashing of teeth chapter xiii so impulsive kindhearted and honest was mrs huxtable that we could always tell what was the next thing she was going to say or do even at her meals she contrived to be in a bustle except on sundays but she got through a great deal of work on sundays she put on with her best gown an air of calm dignity which made her unhappy until it was off which it was directly after the evening service she seemed a very sensible woman and whatever the merits of the case she sided always with the weakest the next morning we asked how it was she appeared not to expect us as i had written and posted the letter myself on the previous saturday for sure now she replied and the papper scrawl coomd on monday but us baint girt scholards and varmer said most like twas the queens taxes for there was her head upon it so us put un in the big mortar till beany dawe should come over or us should go to church next zunday and passon would discoorse it for us butand off she ranbut her belongs to you now miss clerer seeing as how youve coom after un so they had only a general idea that we were coming and knew not when it would be the following day thomas henwood arrived bringing our boxes in a vehicle called a butt which is a short and rudely made cart used chiefly for carrying lime after unpacking our few embellishments we set up a clumsy but comfortable sofa for my mother and tried to divert her sadness a little by many a shift and device to garnish our narrow realm we removed the horrible print of death and the lady which was hung above the chimneypiece and sundry daubs of our lord and the apostles and a woman of samaria with a french parasol and eli falling from a turnpike gate over the great western steamer but these alterations were not made without some wistful glances from poor mrs huxtable at last when i began to nail up a simple sketch of the church at vaughan st mary instead of a noble representation of the prodigal son wearing a white hat with a pipe stuck under the riband and weeping into a handkerchief with some horse upon it the good dame could no longer repress her feelings whai miss clerer miss dear art alaive cheel what be bout thems the smartest picters anywhere this saide of coorn varmer gied a pan of hogs puddens for they and a chainey taypot and a zunday pair of corderahoys why themll shaine with the zun on um laike a vield of poppies and charlock but thic smarl pokey papper of yourn haant no more colour nor the track of a marly scrarly a massy on us if i couldnt walk a better picter than thic with my pattens on in the zider squash to argue with such a connoisseur would have been worse than useless so i pacified her by hanging the rejected gems in her own little summer room by the dairy our parlour began before long to look neat and even comfortable of course the furniture was rough but i care not much for upholstery and am quite rude of french polish my only fear was lest the damp from the limeash floor should strike to my dear mothers feet through the scanty drugget which covered it the fireplace was bright and quaint lined with old dutch tiles and the greywashed walls were less offensive to the eye than would have been a paper chosen by good mrs huxtable the pretty lattice window budding even now with woodbine and impudent to the winds with myrtle would have made amends for the meanest room in england before it lay a simple garden with sparry walks and brightthatched hives and down a dingle rich with trees and a crystal stream it caught a glimpse of the bristol channel chapter xiv when our things were nearly settled and i was sitting by myself with dirty hands and covered with dust there came a little timid tap at the door followed by a shuffling outside as if some one contemplated flight yet feared to fly opening the door i was surprised to find the child whom i expected a massive figure some six feet and a quarter high and i know not how many feet in width but wide enough to fill the entire passage he made a doubtful step in advance till his great openhearted face hung sheepishly above my head have i the pleasure of seeing mr huxtable i asked ees um he stammered blushing like a beetroot leastways miss i ort to zay no plasure um

the room and all his bashfulness lost for the moment in the pride of strength came over him again like an extinguisher although he did not tremblehis nerves were too firm for thathe stood fumbling with his hat and reddening and looking vaguely about at a loss where to put his eyes or anything else my mother quite worn out with her mornings walk surprised at her uncouth visitor and frightened perhaps at his bulk sank on our newfangled sofa in a stupor of weakness then it was strange and fine to see the strong mans sense of her feeble state all his embarrassment vanished at once he saw there was something to do and a look of deep interest quickened his great blue eyes poising his heavy frame with the lightness of a bird he stepped to her side as if the floor had been holy and scarcely touching her contrived to arrange the rude cushions and to lay her delicate head in an easy position as a nurse composes a child all the while his looks and manner expressed so much feeling and gentleness that he must have known what it was to lose a daughter or mother poor dear leddy he whispered to me her be used to zummut more plum nor thiccy i reckon her zimth crule weist and low

comfort he departed after a cheering glance at my mother before i proceed the homeric epithet breakploughharness applied by the poet to mr huxtable needs some explanation it appears that the farmer in some convivial hour for at other times he detested vaunting had laid a wager that he and timothy badcock his farmlabourer would plough half an acre of land wiout no beastessy in the falde now it happened that the parracombe blacksmith had lately been at barnstaple and there had seen a man who had heard of ploughing by steam so when the farmers undertaking got noised abroad and magnified all exmoor assembled to witness the exploit wondering trembling and wrathful benches and tables were set in the higher barton a nice piece of mealy land just at the back of the house while suke and mrs huxtable plied the ciderbarrel for the yeomen of the neighbourhood the farmer himself was not visibleno plough or ploughing tackle of any description appeared and a rumour began to spread that the whole affair was a hoax and the contriver afraid to show himself but as people began to talk of sending for the constable who of course was there all the time and as cartwhips and knobsticks began to vibrate ominously mrs huxtable made a signal to mr dawe who led off the grumbling throng to the further end of the field where an old rickcloth lay along against the hedge while the tilting was moved aside the bold sons of exmoor shrunk back expecting some horrible monster whose smoke was already puffing all they saw was a onehorse plough with the farmer in full harness sitting upon it and smoking his pipe and timothy badcock patiently standing at the ploughtail amid a loud hurrah from his friends mr huxtable leaped to the fore and cast his pipe over the hedge then settled the breastband across the wrestlingpads on his chest and drew tight both the chaintraces gee wugg now if e wull cried stout tim badcock cheerily and off sailed the good ship of husbandly cleaving a deep bright furrow but when they reached the corner the farmer turned too sharply and snapped the offside trace that accident impressed the multitude with a deeper sense of his prowess than even the striking success which attended his primitive method of speeding the plough to return to my mother as spring came on and the beautiful country around us freshened and took green life from the balmy air i even ventured to hope that the good yeomans words would be true he had become by this time a great friend of ours doing his utmost that we might not feel the loss of our faithful thomas henwood poor thomas had been very loth to depart but i found as we got settled that my mother ceased to want him and it would have been wrong as well as foolish to keep him any longer he invested his savings in a publichouse at gloucester which he called the vaughan arms and soon afterwards married jane hiatt a daughter of our head gamekeeper or i ought to say mr vaughans ann maples remained with us still we lived as may be supposed in the most retired manner my time was chiefly occupied in attendance upon dear mother and in attempts to create for her some of those countless comforts whose value we know not until they are lost after breakfast my mother would read for an hour her favourite parts of scripture and vainly endeavour to lead me into the paths of peace her soul discarded more and more the travel garb and wayfaring troubles of this lower existence as day by day it won a nearer view of the golden gate and the glories beyond with which i have seen her eyes suffused like the lucid heaven with sunrise it has been said and i believe that there is nothing in all our material world so lovely as a fair woman looking on high for the angels she knows to be waiting for her even i though looking in an opposite direction and for an opposite being could not but admire that gentle meekness whose absence formed the main fault of my character not that i was hardhearted or cross unless selflove deceives me but restless yearning and hatred were ever at work within me and these repel things of a milder nature as a bullet cries tush to the zephyr chapter xv one cold day in march when winter had come to say goodbye with a roar after wheeling the sofa with my mother upon it towards the parlour fire i went out to refresh my spirit in the kitchen with mrs huxtable and to yat myself for the sofa took all the parlour fire by the fragrant hearth of wood and furze the farmers wife was larning me some strange words of her native dialect which i was now desirous to discoorse and which she declared to be the only vitty talk arl the lave of thiccy stoof zame as the carnishers and the zummersets and the lunnoners tulls up arl thiccys no more nor a passel of gibbersh miss clerer and not vitty atarl noo nor english nother instead of zaying ai laike a kirsten zome on em zays oi and zome on em i in the middle of her lecture and just as i had learned that to quilty is the proper english for to swallow and that the passage down which we quilty is correctly speaking not the throat but the ezelpipe a strangelooking individual darkened the draxtool corruptly called the threshold and crossed the planch or floor to the fireplace where we sat turning round i beheld a man about fifty years old of moderate stature gauntly bodied and loosely built and utterly reckless of his attire his face was long and thin the profile keenly aquiline and the angles made yet sharper by a continual twitching and tension of the muscles the skin of his cheeks was drawn from his solemn brows to his lipless and downcurved mouth tight and hollow like the bladder on a jampot his eyes of a very pale blue seemed always to stand on tiptoe and never to know what he was going to say a long straight melancholy chin grisly with patches of hair was meant by nature to keep his mouth shut and came back sullenly when it failed over his shoulders was flung a patched potatosack fastened in front with a wooden skewer and his nether clothes were as ragged as poetry in his air and manner selfsatisfaction strove hard with solemn reserve upon the whole he reminded me of an owl who has lost his heart to a bantam hen i cannot express him justly but those who have seen may recognise beany dawe the sawyer acknowledged the bard of the north of devon mr ebenezer dawe without any hesitation or salute took a threelegged stool and set it between our chairs then looked from mrs huxtable to me and introduced himself wull here be us three and i hopps us shall agree agray indeed cried mrs huxtable doon e zee the quarlity

after so long a drouth coomd down my drort like the quane and princess royal the very saam as a drap of oial the very saam the very saam he repeated with an extrametrical smack of his lips which he wiped with the back of his hand and cast a meaning glance towards the cellar the farmer rose and took from the dresser a heavy quart cup made of pewter with this he went to the cellar whence issued presently a trickling and frothing sound which thrilled to the sensitive heart of mr dawe the tankard of ale with a crown of white foam was presented to the thirsty bard by his host who did not however relinquish his grasp upon the vessel but imposed like pluto to orpheus a stern condition now beany dawe thee shant have none unless thee can zay zummut without no poetry in it at this barbarous restriction poor ebenezer rolled his eyes in a most tragic manner he thrust his tongue into his cheek and swung himself not to and fro as usual but sideways and clutched one hand on the tatters of his sack while he clung with the other to the handle of the cup then with a great effort and very slowly he spoke if my poor vasses only maks you frown ill try ees fai i wull to keep em a rhyme came over him the twitching of his face showed the violence of the struggle he attempted to say in but nature triumphed and he uttered the fatal down in a moment the farmer compressed his mighty fingers and crushed the thick metal like silver paper the forfeit liquor flew over the poets knees and hissed at his feet in the ashes foreseeing a storm of verse from him and of prose from mrs huxtable at the fate of the pride of her dresser i made a hasty retreat thenceforth i took a kind interest in our conceited but harmless bard his neighbours seemed not to know how long it was since he had first yielded to his unfortunate ailment which probably owed its birth to the sound of the saw during our first interview his rhythm and rhyme had been unusually fluent and finished from pride perhaps at having found a new audience or from some casual inspiration candour compels me to admit that his subsequent works were little if at all better than those of his more famous contemporaries and i am not so proud as he expects me to be of his connexion with my sad history chapter xvi about half a mile from tossils barton the farmhouse where we lived there is a valley or rather a vast ravine of a very uncommon formation a narrow winding rocky combe where slabs and tors and boulder stones seem pasturing on the velvet grass or looking into the bright troutstream which leaps down a flight of steps without a tree to shade its flash and foam this narrow but glad dingle as it nears the sea bursts suddenly back into a desert gorge cleaving the heights that front the bristol channel the mountain sides from right and left straight as if struck by rule steeply converge like a highpitched roof turned upside down so steep indeed that none can climb them along the deep bottom gleams a silver chord where the cramped stream chafes its way bedded and banked in stone without a blade of green from top to bottom of this huge ravine there is no growth no rocks no cliffs no place to stay the foot but all a barren hard grey stretch of shingle slates and gliddery stones as if the ballast of ten million fleets had been shot in two enormous piles and were always on the slip looking at it we forget that there is such a thing as life the desolation is not painful because it is so grand the brief noon glare of the sun on these titanic dry walls where even a lichen dies the gaunt desert shade stealing back to its lair in the early afternoon the solemn step of evening stooping to her cloak belowi know not which of these is the most impressive and mournful no stir of any sort no voice of man or beast no flow of tide ever comes to visit here the little river after a course of battles wins no peaceful union with the sea but ponds against a shingle bar and gurgles away in slow whirlpools only a fitful moaning wind draws up and down the melancholy chasm the famous valley of rocks some four miles to the east seems to me commonplace and tame compared to this grand defile yet how many men i know who would smoke their pipes throughout it thinking so much of this place i long wished my mother to see it and finding her rather stronger one lovely april morning i persuaded her forth embarked on mrs huxtables donkey we went down a small tributary glen towards the head of the great defile the little glen was bright and green and laughing into bud and bantering a swift brook which could hardly stop to answer but left the ousels as it passed to talk at leisure about their nests and the trout to make those musical leaps that sound so crisp through the alders another stream meets it among the bushes below and now they are entitled to the dignity of a bridge whereon grows the maidenhair fern and which with its rude and pointed arch looks like an old packsaddle upon the stream from this point we followed a lane leading obliquely up the ascent before the impassable steep begins having tethered our quiet donkey to a broken gate i took my mother along a narrow path through the thicket to the view of the great ravine standing at the end of this path she was astonished at the scene before her we had gained a height of about two hundred feet the hilltop stretched a thousand feet above us we stood on the very limit of vegetation a straight line passing clown the hill where the quarrylike steep begins my dear mother was tired and i had called her to come home lest the view should make her giddy when suddenly she stepped forward to gather a harebell straggling among the stones the shingle beneath her foot gave way then below her and around and above her head began in a great mass to glide buried to the knees and falling sideways she was sinking slowly at first then quickly and quicker yet with a hoarse roar of moving tons of stone gathering and whelming upon her down the rugged abyss screaming i leaped into the avalanche after her never thinking that i could only do harm stronger and swifter and louder and surging and berged with shouldering stone the solid cascade rushed on i saw dearest mother below me trying to clasp her hands in prayer and to give me her last word with a desperate effort dragging my shawl from the gulfing crash i threw it towards her but she did not try to grasp it a heavy stone leaped over me and struck her on the head her head dropped back she lay senseless and nearly buried we were dashing more headlong and headlong in the rush of the mountain side to the precipice over the river and my senses had all but failed and revenge was prone before judgment when i heard through the din a shout on the brink of firm ground stood a man and signed me to throw my shawl with all my remaining strength i did so but not as he meant for i cast it entirely to him and pointed to my mother below one instant the avalanche paused he leaped about twenty feet down through the heather and gorse and stayed his descent by clutching a stout ash sapling to this in a moment he fastened my shawl a long and strong plaid and just as my mother was being swept by he plunged with the other end into the shingle tide i saw him leap and struggle towards her and lift her out of the gliding tomb gliding himself the while and sway himself and his burden by means of the shawl not back for that was impossible but obliquely downwards i saw the strong sapling bow to the strain like a fishingrod while hope and terror fought hard within me i saw him by a desperate effort which bent the ashtree to the ground leap from the whirling havoc and lay my mother on the dead fern and heath of the rest i know nothing having become quite unconscious before he saved me in the same manner we must have been taken home in farmer huxtables butt for i remember well that amidst the stir and fright of our return and while my mother was still insensible mrs huxtable fell savagely upon poor suke for having despatched that elegant vehicle without cleaning it from the lime dust whereby as she declared our dresses so rent and tattered by the jagged stones were muxed up to shords poor suke would have been likely to fare much worse if at such a time she had stopped to dust the cart when the farmer came home his countenance rich in capacity for expressing astonishment far outdid his words wull wull for sure wuther ye did or no was all the vent he could find for his ideas during the rest of the day though it was plain to all who knew him that he was thinking profoundly upon the subject and wholly occupied with it in the course of the following week he advised me very impressively never to do it again and nothing could ever persuade him but that i jumped in and my mother came to rescue me but his wife very soon had all her wits about her she sent to coom for the doctor i begged that it might not be mr dawes physician she put dear mother to bed and dressed her wounds with simples worth ten druggists shops and bathed her temples with rosemary and ran down the glen for fathery ham valerian which she declared would kill nine sorts of infermation then she hushed the entire household permitting no tongue to move except her own and beat her eldest boy a fine young huxtable for crying whereupon he roared she even conquered her strong desire to know much more than all could tell and showed my mother such true kindness and pity that i loved her for it at once and ever since breathing slowly and heavily my poor mother lay in the bed which had long been the pride of tossils barton the bedstead was made of carved oak as many of them are in north devon and would have been handsome and striking if some ancestral huxtable had not adorned it with whitewash but the quilt was what they were proud of it was formed of patches of diamond shape and most incongruous colours with a deaths head in the centre and crossbones underneath when first i beheld it i tossed it down the stairs but my mother would have it brought back and used because she knew how the family gloried in it and she could not bear to hurt their feelings one taper white hand lay on it now with the tender skin bruised and discoloured by blows she had closed the finger which bore her wedding ring and it still remained curved and rigid in an agony of tears i knelt by the side of the bed watching her placid and deathlike face till then i had never known how strongly and deeply i loved her i firmly believe that she was revived in some degree by the glare of the patched quilt upon her eyes the antagonism of nature was roused and brought home her wandering powers feebly glancing away she came suddenly to herself and exclaimed is she safe is she safe yes mother here i am with my own dear mother she opened her arms and held me in a nervous cold embrace and thanked god and wept chapter xvii when the surgeon came he pronounced that none of her limbs were broken but that the shock to the brain and the whole system had been so severe that the only chance of recovery consisted in perfect quiet she herself said that the question was whether providence wanted her still to watch over her child after some days she came down stairs not without my support and was propped once more upon her poor sofa calm she appeared and contented and happy in such sort as of old but whenever she turned her glance from me she observed with starting eyes every little thing that moved especially she would lie and gaze through the open window at a certain large spider who worked very hard among the woodbine blossoms one day in making too bold a cast he fell some chord of remembrance was touched and she swooned away on the couch in spite of these symptoms i fondly hoped that she was recovering strength she even walked out with me twice in the sunny afternoon but this only lasted a very short time it soon became manifest even to me that ere long she would be with my father unable to fight any more with this dark perception i embraced it with a sort of savage despair an utter sinking of the heart which defied god as it sank this she soon discovered and i fear that it saddened her end she was much disappointed too that we could not find or thank him who had perilled his life for us none could tell who he was or what had become of him though the farmer at our entreaty searched all the villages round we were told indeed by the landlady of the reddeer inn a lonely publichouse near the scene of the accident that a stranger had come to her in very great haste and having learned who we were for she had seen us pass half an hour before had sent her boy to the farm for some kind of conveyance while he returned at full speed to attend those whom he had rescued it further appeared that this stranger had helped to place us in the cart and showed the kindest anxiety to lessen the roughness of its motion himself even leading old smiler to thwart his propensity to the deepest and hardest ruts by the time our slow vehicle reached the farm mrs huxtable was returned from the lower cleve orchard where she had been smoking the fernwebs in ignorance of our mishap and our conductor seeing us safe in her hands departed without a word while she was too flurried and frightened to take much notice of him neither could the woman of the inn describe him she was so mazed when she heard of the vail arl down the girt goyal as she called our slide of about fifty feet and for this she quoted the stranger as her authority thems the very words as he used though just before this she had stated that he was a foreigner and could not speak english knowing that in devonshire any stranger is called a foreigner and english means the brogue of the countryside i did not attach much weight to this declaration the only remaining witness the lad who had come with the butt was too stupid to describe anything except three round os with his mouth and eyes but it mattered little about description i had seen that stranger under such circumstances that i could not fail to know him again on the morrow and once in the following week some kind inquiries were made as to our condition by means of slips of paper conveyed by country lads no name was attached to these and no information given about the inquirer the bearer of the first missive came from lynmouth and of the second from ilfracombe neither lad knew anything though submitted by mrs huxtable to keen crossexamination except that he was paid for his errand but would like some cider and that the answer was to be written upon the paper he brought whether any motive for concealment existed beside an excess of delicacy or whether there even was any intentional secresy or merely indifference to our gratitude was more than we could pretend to say i am not at all inquisitivenot more so i mean than other womenbut i need not confess that my curiosity to say nothing of better feelings was piqued a little by this uncommon reserve so now beside the engrossing search for my deadly enemy i had to seek out another my brave and noble friend chapter xviii but for the present curiosity gratitude hate all feelings indeed and passions except from the bled vein of love and the heartrooted fibres of sorrow were to be crushed within me evening after evening my dear mothers presence seemed more and more dreamy and shadowy and night after night she went feebler and feebler to bed in the morning indeed she had gathered some fragile strength such strength as so wasted a form could exert and the breeze and the fresh may sun made believe of health on her cheeks but no more was i tempted to lay my arm round her waist and rally her on its delicate girlish span nor could i now look gaily into her eyes and tell her how much she excelled her child those little liberties which with less than a matrons dignity and more than a mothers fondness she had so long allowed me became as she still expected and i could not bear to take them so many great distresses even at night when i twined in its simple mode her soft brown hair as i thought how few the times my old task would be needed again it cost me many a shift to prevent her descrying my tears in the glass or suspecting them in my voice for herself she knew well what was coming she had learned how soon she must be my sweet angel instead of my mother and her last trouble was that she could not bring me to think the difference small so calmly she spoke of her end not looking at me the while for fear we both should weep so gently and sweetly she talked of the time when i should hearken no more as if she were going to visit a garden and hand me the flowers outside then if i broke forth in an anguish of sobs she would beg my forgiveness as if she could have done wrong and mourn for my loneliness after her as though she could help forsaking me looking back even now on that time how i condemn and yet pardon myself reflecting how little i tried to dissemble my childlike woe when all things rejoiced in their young summer strength and scarcely the breeze turned the leaves for the songs of the birds and the pure white hawthorn was calm as the death of the good and the soul of gladness was sad we talked for the last time together mother and child looking forth on the farewell of sunset the room under the thatch smelled musty in summer and i had made up a bed on the sofa downstairs the wasting low fever was past and the wearisome cough exhausted and the flush had ebbed from her cheeks as the world from her heart and of all human passions and wishes and cares not one left a trace in her bosom except a mothers love this and only this retarded her flight to heaven as the sight of his nest delays the rising of the lark my child she began and her voice was low but very distinct my only and darling child who has minded me so long and laid her youth and beauty and high courageous spirit at the feet of her weak mother my child who fostered in wealth and love will be tomorrow an orphan cast upon the wide worldhere she fairly broke down in spite of religion and heaven and turned her head to the pillow a true daughter and mother of earth i would fain have given that fortune whose loss to me she lamented for leave to cry freely with her without adding to her distress in a minute or two she was able to proceed with her thin hand she parted the hair shaken purposely over my eyes i am sure that my pet will listen with kindness and patience while i try to say what has lain so long at my heart you know how painfully i have always been moved by any allusion to the death of your dear father it has been a weakness no doubt on my part but one which i vainly strove against and for which i trust to be pardoned where all is pardon and peace her voice began to tremble and her eyes became fixed and i feared a return of the old disorder but she shook it off and spoke again distinctly though with great labour this is a bitter subject and i never could bring myself to it till now when it seems too late but my poor love i am so anxious about it for the restthat providence which has never forsaken us repine as i would i can trust that providence still to protect my darling child there is one thing and only one by promising which you will make my departure quite happy then i shall go to rejoin your father and carry such tidings of you as will enable us both to wait in the fulness of time your coming oh that the fulness of time were come i cried in my selfish loneliness for me it is empty enough my precious my own darling clara you sob so you make me most wretched mother i will not cry any more neither did i while she could see me i need not tell you she said what is that promise which i crave for your own dear sake no maam i replied i know quite well what it is i saw that i had grieved her how could i call her then anything else than mother my mother dear you wish me to promise thisthat i will forego my revenge upon him who slew my father she bowed her head with a look i cannot describe in the harsh way i had put it it seemed as if she were injuring both my father and me had you asked me anything else although it were sin against god and man if you could ask such a thingi would have pledged myself to it as gladly as i would diedie at least if my task were done but this this one thing onlyto abandon what i live for what i was born to do to be a traitor to my own father and youi implore you mother by him whose glory is on you now do not ask me this her face in its sadness and purity made me bury my eyes and forget things then i must die and leave my only child possessed with a murderers spirit the depth of her last agony and which i believed would cling to her even in heaven was more than i could bear i knelt on the floor and put my hand to her side her worn out heart was throbbing again with the pang of her disappointment mother i cried i will promise you this when i have discovered as i must do that man who has made you a widow and me an orphan if i find any plea whatever to lessen his crime or penitence to atone for it as i hope to see my father and mother in heaven i will try to spare and forgive him can you wish me to rest in ignorance and forget that deed clara she answered weakly and she spoke more slowly and feebly every time you have promised me all i can hope for how you loved your father me too you have loved i cannot say how much for my sake you have borne poverty trouble and illness without a complaining word by day and by night through my countless wants and long fretfulness i put my finger upon her pale lips how could she tell such a story then her tears came now and then and would not be stopped as she laid her weak hand on my head may the god of the fatherless and the poor who knows and comforts the widows grief the god who is taking me now to his bosom bless with all blessings of earth and heaven and restore to me this my child a sudden happiness fell upon her as if she had seen her prayers acceptance she let her arms fall round me and laid my cheek by the side of her bright flowing smile it was the last conscious stir of the mind all the rest seemed the flush of the soul in the window the nightscented heath was blooming outside it the jessamine crossed in a milky way of white stars and the lush honeysuckle had flung down her lap in clusters the fragrance of flowers lay heavy upon us and we were sore weary with the burden of sorrow and joy so tranquil and kind was the face of death that sleep his halfbrother still held his hand the voice of the thrush from the corner laurel broke the holy stillness like dreams of home that break our slumbers his melody was its own excuse my mother awoke and said faintly with no gleam in her eyes raise me upon the pillow my love that i may hear him once more he sings like one your father and i used to listen to every evening in the days when we watched your cradle i lifted her gently the voice of nature made way for her passing spirit now kiss me my child once more my own loved child my heart is with you for ever light of my eyes you are growing dim she clasped her hands in prayer with one of mine between them my other was round her neck then she spoke slowly and with a waning voice but firmly as if it had been her marriageresponse thou art my guide and my staff i have no fear neither shadow of trembling make no long tarrying oh my god the bird went home to his nest and she to that refuge where all is home though the hands that held mine grew cold as ice and her lips replied to no kiss and the smile on her face slept off into stillness and a grey shade crept on her featuresi could not believe that all this was death clara vaughan book ii chapter i longshadowed death some poet says how well i know and feel it the gloom before him deepening as he comes and the world of darkness stretching many years behind i once dared to believe that no earthly blow could ever subdue or even bend my resolute will i now found my mistake and cared not even to think about it on the morning after my mothers death i wandered about and could not tell where to go the passionate clinging which would not allow me during that blank and sleepless night to quit what remained of her presence and the jealous despair which felt it a wrong that any one else should approach had now settled down to a languid heaviness and all that i cared for was to be let alone all the places where we had been together i visited now without knowing why perhaps it was to see if she were there then vaguely disappointed i thought there must be some mistake and wearily went the dreary round again i cannot clearly call to mind but think it must have been that day when i was in the corner of the room looking at the place whence they had taken dear mother ann maples and mrs huxtable came in followed by the farmer who had left his shoes at the door they did not see me so i suppose it must have been in the evening they were come to remove the sofa i have not the heart to follow their brogue yes to be sure said mrs huxtable looking at it with a short sigh it was odd that it should strike me then but all she did was short get it out of her sight poor dear said ann maples to see her sit and look at it exclaimed the farmers wife with her eyes so dry and stupid like returned the other poor child she must have cried herself out i have known her sit by the hour and stare at the bed where her father was killed but it was a different sort of look to this ah well she has lost a good mother said dame huxtable god grant my poor little chicks may never be left like her whats your children to talk of along with miss clara asked my nurse mrs huxtable was about to answer sharply but checked herself and only said all children is much of a muchness to their mothers dont tell me cried ann maples who had never had any the farmer came between them walking on tiptoe for good now dont ye fall out at such a time as this here whats our affairs to speak of now whats any folks asked mrs huxtable that has the breath of life and goes forth in the morning and is cast into the oven maam continued her antagonist ah bless thee yes the farmer replied ill take my gospel oath of it its not much good i am at parsoning and maybe i likes a drop of drink when the weather is fitty but that young chestnut filly thats just come home from breaking id sell her to a gipsey and trust him for the money if so be twould make the young lady turn her face to the lord cant ye speak to her now about it either of you women dooe now dooe how could i possible his wife exclaimed why farmer you must be mazed a high young lady like that and the tears still hot in her eyes the very reason wife the very time and reason but likely mrs maples would be the proper person thank you sir my nurse replied mrs maples knows good manners a little thank you sir mrs maples wasnt born in devonshire i ask your pardon maam said the farmer much abashed i humbly ask your pardon i wasnt taught no better i can only go by what i have seen and what seems to come inside of me and i know in our way of business when a calf is weaned from the mother the poor beastess hath a call for some one else to feed it maybe its no harm to let her have the refusal therewith he opened my mothers bible and placed it reverently on the windowseat waife doe mind the time as poor aunt betsy died over there to rowley mires for sure i do but what have her got to do with it us mustnt talk of her i reckon any more than of the chillers though us be so unlucky as to be born in devonshire fie fie thee ought to know better than to talk of poor aunt betsy along of a lady and before our betters here she curtsied to ann maples with a flash of light in her eyes and rubbing them hard with her apron well well replied the farmer sadly mayhap so i did and who be i to gainsay mayhap so i did he dropped his voice but added after some reflection it be hard to tell the rights of it but sure her were a woman who said her were a man thee zany mrs huxtable was disappointed that the case would not be argued the farmer discreetly changed the subject now if it was me he continued i wouldnt think of taking this here settlebed away from the poor thing why not farmer asked mrs huxtable sharply give me a reason for leaving it and ill give you ten for taking it i cant give no reasons but maybe it comforts her a little comfort indeed said his wife breaks her heart with crying more likely come lend a hand old heavystrap what can a great dromedary like thee know about young wenches at any rate he knew more than she did the moment they touched it i burst forth from my corner and flung myself upon it rolling as if i would bury myself in the ecstasy of anguish what they did i cannot tell they might say what they liked i had not cried till then the next day i was sitting stupified and heavy trying once more to meet the necessity of thinking about my mothers funeral but again and again the weakness of sorrow fell away from the subject the people of the house kept from me mrs huxtable had done her best but they knew i would rather be alone the door was opened quietly and some one entered in a stealthy manner regarding it as an intrusion i would not look that way miss clara dear began the farmer standing behind me and whispering i humbly ask your pardon miss for calling you that same but we have had a wonderful fine season sure enough i made him no answer being angry at his illtimed commonplace if you please miss such a many lambs was never known afore and turnips fine last winter and corn and hay and every kind of stock a fetching of such prices the farmers about here has made their fortune mainly i am glad to hear that you are so prosperous mr huxtable i answered very coldly yes fie good times miss wonderful good times we dont know what to do with our money arnost buy education and good taste i said instead of thrusting your happiness upon such as i how little i knew him shall i ever forgive myself that speech ah i wish i could he answered sadly i wish with all my heart i could but we must be born to the like of that i am afeared miss vaughan poor fellow he knew nothing of irony as we do who are born to good taste otherwise i might have suspected him of it then he suddenly wished me good evening although it was middleday and then he made off for the door but came back again with a desperate resolve and spoke for him very quickly looking all the time at his feet there i cant make head or tail of it miss clara but wife said i was to do it so take the danged money thats a dear and for good now dont be offended for i casn help it he opened his great hand which was actually shaking and hurriedly placed on the sofa a small packet tied in the leaf of a copy book then suddenly put in mind of something he made a dive and snatching it up flung it upon a windsor chair it fell with a chink the string slipped off and out rolled at least forty sovereigns and guineas and a number of crownpieces peremptorily i called him back for he was running out of the door mr huxtable what is the meaning of this meaning miss lord bless you miss clara there baint no meaning of it only it corned into my head last night as i was laying awake humbly asking your pardon miss for that same that if so be you should desire that the dear good lady herself might like if i may make so bold meaning that it isnt fitly like that she should lay nowhere else but alongside of her own husband till death do them part mr henry valentine vaughan esquire vaughan park in the county of gloucestershire there i be as bad as beany dawe he repeated his rhyme with some relief hoping to change the subject i caught him by both hands and burst into tears dont ye now he said with a thickness in his voice dont ye now my dearie leastways unless it does you good it does me good indeed i sobbed to find still in the world so kind a heart as yours though i longed to look him in the face i knew that i must not do so oh why are men so ashamed of manly tears perceiving that i could not speak he began to talk for both of us making a hundred blundering apologies trying to hide his knowledge of my poverty and to prove that he was only paying a debt which extended over many years of tenancy he was not at all an imaginative man but delicacy supplied him with invention so deep a sense pervades all classes in this english country that want of money is an indictment which none but the culprit may sign poor or rich i should not be worth despising if i had shown the paltry pride of declining such a loan the tears came anew to my eyes when i found that what had been brought so freely was the savings of years of honest toil a truth which the owners had tried to conceal by polishing the old coin but not being skilled dear souls in platecleaning they had left some rottenstone adhering to the george and dragons chapter ii although i find a sad pleasure in lingering over these times with such a history still impending i cannot afford the indulgence dear mothers simple funeral took me once more to my native place even without mr huxtables generous and noble assistance i should have laid her to rest by the side of the husband she loved so well but difficulties sore to encounter at such a time would have met me on every side moreover the kind act cheered and led me through despondency like the hand and face of god caring little what people might say or think i could not stay at a distance nature told me that it was my duty to go and duty or not i could not stay away and now for the last time i look on the face and form of my mother that which i have played and talked and laughed with though lately not much of laughter that which has fed and cared for me till it needed my care in turn that which i have toddled beside or proudly run in front of whose arms have been round me whenever i wept and whose bosom the haven of childhoods storms first to greet me with smiles in the morning and last to bless me with tears at night ever loving and never complainingin one word for a thousand my mother so far away now so hopelessly far away there it lies indeed i can touch it kiss it and embrace it but oh how small a part of mother and even that part is not mine so holy and calm it lies such loving kindness still upon its features so near me but in mystery so hopelessly far away i can see it but it never will know me again i may die beside it and it cannot weep the last last look of all on earththey must have carried me away i remember tottering down the hill supported by a stalwart arm the approach to the house preventedor something two children ran before me stopping now and then to wonder and straggling to pick hedgeflowers one of them brought me a bunch then stared and was afraid to offer them nancy ill be the death of thee whispered a womans voice the little girl shrunk to me for shelter with timid tears in her great blue eyes so i took her hand and led her on and somehow it did me good at intervals the funeral hymn which they sing on the road to the grave fell solemnly on our ears some one from time to time gave out the words of a verse and then it was sung to a simple impressive tune that ancient hymn which has drowned so many sobs i did not hear but felt it we arrived at vaughan st mary late in the afternoon of the second day the whole of the journey was to me a long and tearful dream mr huxtable came with us he had never before been further from home than exeter and his single visit to that city had formed the landmark of his life he never tried to comfort me as the others did the ignorant man knew better alone i sat by my fathers grave with my mothers ready before my feet they had cast the mould on the other side so as not to move my fathers coverlet the poor old pensioner had been true to her promise and mans last garden was blooming like his first flowerbed my mind if any i had seemed to have undergone some change defiance and pride and savage delight in misery were entirely gone and depression had taken the place of dejection death now seemed to me the usual and proper condition of things and i felt it an impertinence that i should still be alive so i waited with heavy composure till she should be brought who so often had walked there with me at length she was coming for good and all and a space was left for me but i must not repose there yet i had still my task before me the bell was tolling faster and the shadows growing longer and the children who had been playing at hideandseek where soon themselves shall be sought in vain had flitted away from sight perhaps scared at my presence perhaps gone home to tea to enjoy the funeral afterwards the evening wind had ceased from troubling the yews and the shortlived songs of the birds were done the place was as sad as i could wish the smell of new earth inspired as it always does some unsearchable everlasting sympathy between the material and the creature the sun was setting behind me suddenly a shadow eclipsed my own upon the red loam across the open grave without a start and dreamily as i did all things now i turned to see whence it came within a yard of me stood mr edgar vaughan in a moment the old feeling was at my heart and my wits were all awake i observed that he was paler than when i had seen him last and the rigid look was wavering on his face like steel reflected by water he lifted his hat to me i neither rose nor spoke but turned and watched him clara he said in a low earnest voice i see you are still the same will no depth of grief no length of time no visitation from him who is over us all ever bend your adamant and implacable will i heard with some surprise his allusion to the great being whom he was not wont to recognise but i made him no reply very well he resumed with the ancient chill hardening over his features so then let it be i am not come to offer you condolence which you would despise nor do i mean to be present when you would account the sight of me an insult and yet i loved your mother clara i loved her very truly this he said with such emotion that a new thought broke upon me quick as the thought he asked would you know who killed your father and my mother too i answered whose coffin i see coming the funeral turned the corner of the lane and the dust rose from the bearers feet he took his hat off and the perspiration stood upon his forehead betwixt suspense and terror and the wildness of grief i was obliged to lean on the headstone for support and a giddiness came over me when i raised my eyes again there was no one near me in vain i wiped them hurriedly and looked again mr vaughan was gone but on the grass at my feet lay a folded letter i seized it quickly and broke the seal that moment a white figure appeared between the yewtrees by the porch it was the aged minister leading my mother the last path of all the book was in his hand and his form was tall and stately and his step so slow that the white hair fell unruffled while the grand words on his lips called majesty into his gaze thrusting aside the letter i followed into the church and stood behind the old font where i had been baptized a dark and gloomy nook fit for such an entrance she who had carried me there was carried past it now and the pall waved in the damp cold air and all the world seemed stone and mould but afterwards on the fair hillside while the faint moon gathered power from the deepening sky and glancing on that hoary brow sealed the immortal promises and smoothed the edges of the grave around which bent the uncovered heads of many who had mourned before and after a few bounds of mirth should bend again in mourning until in earths fair turn and turn others should bend and they lie downbeholding this and feeling something higher than dust to dust i grew content to bide my time with the other children of men and remembered that no wave can break until it reach the shore chapter iii when a long and heavy sleep my first sleep since dear mothers death had brought me down to the dull plain of life i read for the first time the letter so strangely delivered even then it seemed unkind to my mother that i should think about it mr vaughan had placed it in a new envelope which he had sealed with his own ring the original cover if any there were having been removed the few words of which it consisted were written in a clear round hand upon a sheet of thin tough paper such as we use for foreign postage and folded in a peculiar manner there was nothing remarkable in the writing except this that the words as well as the letters were joined it was as follows the one who slain your brother is at grove street london you will come in danger of it why you know no date no signature no stops except as shown above in short it was so dark and vague that i returned to devonshire with a resolution to disregard it wholly when we reached the foot of the hill at the corner of the narrow lane which leads to tossils barton and where the white gate stands of which the neighbourhood is so proud a sudden scream was heard and a rush made upon us from behind the furzebush the farmer received the full brunt of a most vigorous onset and the number and courage of the enemy making up for their want of size his strong bastions were almost carried by storm to the cry of daddy daddys come home half a dozen urchins and more without distinction of sex jumped and tugged and flung and clung around him with no respect whatever for his sunday coat or brassbuttoned gaiters taking advantage of his laughing they pulled his legs this way and that as if he were skating for the first time and little sally his favourite swarming up made a base footrope of the great ancestral silver watchchain whose mysterious awe sometimes sufficed to keep her eyes half open in church betwixt delight and shame the poor father was so dreadfully taken aback that he could not tell what to do till fatherly love suggested the only escape he lifted them one by one to his lips and after some hearty smacks sent all except the baby sliding down his back while all this was going forward the good dame with a clean apron on kept herself in the background curtseying and trying to look sad at me but too much carried away to succeed her plump cheeks left but little room for tears yet i thought one tried to find a road from either eye when the burst was nearly done she felt like a true woman for me so lonely in all this love though i could not help enjoying it and so she tried to laugh at it for a long time after this the farmer was admired and consulted by all the neighbouring parishes as a man who had seen the world his labourers also one man and a boy for a fortnight called him sir a great discomfort to him more than this some letters were brought for him to interpret and beany dawe became unduly jealous but in this as in most other matters things came to their level and when it was slowly discovered that the farmer was just the same his neighbours showed much disappointment and even some contempt it was not long before the thought of that letter which had been laid by so scornfully began to work within me again and again as time wore on and the deep barb of sorrow darkly rusted away it came home to me as a sin that i was neglecting a special guidance moreover my reason for staying in devonshire was gone and as my spirit recovered its tone it could not put up with inaction three months after our return one breezy afternoon in august when the heath had long succeeded the gorse and broom upon the cleve and the children were searching for wuts and halfkerneled nuts i sat on a fallen tree where a break in the copse made a frame for one of our favourite views of late i had been trying to take some sketches in watercolours of what my mother and i had so often admired together and this had been kept for the last wild as the scheme may appear to all who know the world and its high contempt for womans skill i had some hope of earning money in london by the pencil and was doing my utmost to advance in art also i wished to take away with me some memorials of a time comparatively happy little sally huxtable a dear little child now my chief companion had strayed into the wood to string more strawberry beads on her spike of grass for the wood strawberries here last almost to the equinox and i had just roughed in my outline and was correcting the bold strokes by natures soft gradations when suddenly through a cobnut bush and down the steep bank at my side came in a sliding canter a magnificent red deer he passed so close before me with antlers like a varnished crabstick russet in the sun that i could have touched his brown flank with my pencil being in no hurry or fright whatever he regarded me from his large deep eyes with a look of courteous interest a dignified curiosity too well bred for words and then as if with an evening of pleasant business before him trotted away through the podded wild broom on the left before i had time to call him back which with a childish impulse i was about to do the nutbush where he had entered moved again and laughing at his own predicament on the steep descent a young man leaped and landed in the bramble at my feet before me stood the one whom we had so often longed to thank but at sight of me his countenance changed entirely the face so playful just before suddenly grew dark and sad and with a distant salutation he was hurrying away when i sprang forward and caught him by the hand every nerve in my body thrilled as i felt the grasp that had saved my mother and me excuse me he said coldly i will lose my prey but i would not let him go so curtly what i said i cannot tell only that it was very foolish and clumsy and cold by the side of what i felt whom but god and him had i to thank for my mothers peaceful end and all her treasured words each worth a dozen lives of mine he answered not at all nor looked at me but listened with a cold constraint and as i thought contemptuous pity at which my pride began to take alarm sir i exclaimed when still he answered not sir i will detain you no longer from murdering that poor stag he answered very haughtily i am not of the devonshire hunters who toil to exterminate this noble race as he spoke he pointed down the valley where the red deer my late friend was crossing for his evening browse to a gnoll of juicy grass then why was he pursuing him and why did he call him his prey the latter probably a pretext to escape me but the former question i could not answer and did not choose to ask he went his way and i felt discharged of half my obligation chapter iv the farmer his wife and little sally were now all i had to love poor ann maples though thoroughly honest and faithful was of a nature so dry and precise that i respected rather than loved her i am born to love and hate with all my heart and soul although a certain pride prevents me from exhibiting the better passion except when strongly moved that other feeling sown by satan he never allows me to disguise to leave the only three i loved was a bitter grief to tell them of my intention a sore puzzle but after searching long for a good way to manage it the only way i found was to tell them bluntly and not to cry if it could be helped so when mrs huxtable came in full glory to try upon me a pair of stockings of the brightest blue ever seen which she had long been knitting on the sly for winter wear i thanked her warmly and said dear me mrs huxtable how they will admire these in london in lonnon cheel she always called me her child since i had lost my mothertheyll never see the likes of they in lonnon without they gits one of them there long glaskies same as preventive chaps has and then i reckon therell be hexymoor between and dartmoor too for out i know and ever so many churchtowers and milestones oh yes they will i shall be there in a week in lonnon in a wake dear heart alaive cheel donte tell on so she thought my wits were wandering as she had often fancied of late and set off for the larder which was the usual course of her prescriptions but i stopped her so calmly that she could not doubt my sanity yes dear mrs huxtable i must leave my quiet home where all of you have been so good and kind to me and i have already written to take lodgings in london oh miss clerer dear i cant belave it nohow come and discoorse with farmer about it he knows a power more than i do though i says it as shouldnt but if so be he hearkens to the like of that ill comb him with the toasting iron giving me no time to answer she led me to the kitchen the farmer who had finished his mornings work was stamping about outside the threshold wiping his boots most carefully with a pitchfork and a rope of twisted straw this process to his great discomfort mrs huxtable had at length enforced by many scoldings but now she snatched the pitchfork from him and sent it flying into the court wunt thee never larn thee girt drummedary not to ston there an hour mucking arl the place wull wull said the farmer looking at the pitchfork first and then at me reckon the old mares dead at last casn thee drame of nothing but bosses and asses thee girt mule heres miss clerer as was like a cheel of my own and now shem gooin awai and usll niver zee her no more what dost thee mane ooman asked the farmer sternly hast thee darrd to goo a jahing of her zame as thee did zuke oh no farmer i answered quickly mrs huxtable never gave me an unkind word in her life but i must leave you all and go to live in london the farmer looked as if he had lost something and began feeling for it in all his pockets then without a word he went to the fire and unhung the crock which was boiling for the family dinner this done he raked out the embers on the hearthstone and sat down heavily on the settle with his back towards us presently we heard him say to himself if any cheel of mine ates ever a bit of bakkon today ill bile him in that there pot and to zee the copy our sally wrote this very morning wonnerful wonnerful cried mrs huxtable and now herll not know a p from a pothook and little jack can spell zider zame as em does in lonnon town dang lonnon town said the farmer savagely and arl as lives there lave out the duke of wellington its where the devil lives and em catches his braath in lanterns my faather tould me that and her niver spak a loi but it haint for the larning i be vexed to lose my dearie that last word he dwelt upon so tenderly and sadly that i could stop no longer but ran up to him bravely with the tears upon my face as i sat low before him on little sallys stool he laid his great hand on my head with his face turned toward the settle and asked if i had any one to see me righted in the world but him i told him none whatever and the answer seemed at once to please and frighten him then dont e be agooin my dear heart dont e think no more of gooin if it be for the bit and drap thee ates and drinks doesnt thee know by this time our own flash and blood baint no more welcome to it and us has a plenty here and more nor a plenty and if us hadnt jan huxtable hisself and honor huxtable his waife wud live on pegmale better nor they desarves and gie it arl

at this moment when i could say nothing being thoroughly convicted of ingratitude and ashamed before natures far better than my own dear little sally who had been rolling on the dairy floor recovered from the burst of childish grief enough to ask whether it had any cause up to me she ran with great pearl tears on the veining of her cheeks and peeping through the lashes of her violetblue eyes she gave me one long reproachful look as if she began to understand the world and to find it disappointment then she buried her flaxen head in the homespun apron i had lately taken to wear and sobbed as if she had spoiled a dozen copies what happened afterwards i cannot tell crying i hate but there are times when nothing else is any good i only know that as the farmer left the house to get as he said a little braze these ominous words came back from the court twud be a bad job for tom grundy if her coomd acrass me now chapter v that same evening as i was sitting in my lonely room yet not quite alonefor little sally who always did as i bade her was scratching and blotting her best copybook under my auspicesin burst mrs huxtable without stopping to knock as usual oh miss clerer what have e been and doed varmers in crule trouble usll arl have to goo to gaol tomorrow chillers and arl she was greatly flurried and out of breath and yet seemed proud of what she had to tell she did not require much asking nor beat about the bush as many women do but told me the story shortly and then asked me to come and hear all particulars from tim badcock the farmlabourer who had seen the whole tim sat by the kitchen fire with a pint of cider by him on the little round table strong evidence that his tidings after all were not so very unwelcome wull you zee miss said tim after getting up and

taime wiout no saign postesses every word of tims story is true except as regards the names chapter vi two or three days after this i was keeping school in the dairy the parlour being too small for that purpose and the kitchen and washup as they called the backkitchen too open to inroads from suke and tim my class consisted of ten or rather was eight strong the two weames big baby and little baby only attending for the sake of example and because they would have roared if parted from the other children so those two were allowed to spraddle on the floor where sometimes they made little rollers of themselves with much indecorum and between whiles sat gravely sucking their fat red fingers and then pointed them in a glistening state at me or my audience and giggled with a large contempt the eight who made believe to learn something were the six elder huxtables and two of tim badcocks young uns i marshalled them four on each side against the low limewhitened walls which bore the pans of cream and milk little sally my head scholar was very proud of measuring her height by the horizontal line on the milkpan where the glazing ended which tabitha badcock even on tiptoe could not reach they were all well claned and had white pinnies on and their ruddy cheeks rubbed up to the highest possible polish with yellow soap and the jacktowel behind the washup door hence i never could relieve them from the idea that sunday now came every day in the week i maintained strict discipline and allowed no nonsense but two sad drawbacks constantly perplexed me in the first place their ways were so ridiculous and they laboured so much harder to make me laugh than they did to learn that i could not always keep my countenance and when the spellingbook went up before my face they knew as well as possible what was going on behind it and peeped round or below and burst out all together the second drawback was that mrs huxtable in spite of all my protests would be always rushing in upon errands purely fictitious and the farmer himself always found some special business in the yard close to the wired and unglazed window whence every now and then his loud hawhaws and too audible soliloquies dang me wull done zally that wor a good un zay un again cheel zay un again wull e utterly overthrew my most solemn institutions coom now smarl chillersi addressed them in my unclassical devonshire dialect for it kept their attention alive to criticise me when i spak unvittycoom now eve a been spulling lang enough ston round me now and tull me what i axes you already i had made one great mistake by saying round instead of raound and billy the genius of the family was upon the giggle now thun wutt be a quadripade ai knoo says sally with her hand held out zo do ai says

cries bill suddenly clearing up her be wutt moother zits on vor to mulk the coos baint her now thee beest ony wan leg out bill now tabby badcock while tabby is splashing in her memory for i told them all last week the farmer much excited and having no idea what the answer should be but hoping that one of his own children may discover it first boldly shows his face at the wired window but is quite resolved to allow fair play not so mrs huxtable who in full possession of the case suddenly appears behind me and shakes her fist at poor puzzled tabby theedst best pretend to know more than thy betters she tries to make tabby hear without my catching her words but the farmer hotly shouts lat un aloun waife tak thee hon from thee mouth i tull e spak up now little wanch thus encouraged tabby makes reply looking crosswise at mrs huxtable plase miss it be a beastie wi vour taials raight cries the farmer with admiration conquering his disappointment raight this taime aill tak my oath on it i zeed wan to barnstaple vair last year and her wor karled phanominy quadripade her kirsten name and her zurname now ai coom to racollack tabby looks elated and mrs huxtable chagrined before i can redress the situation a sound of heavy blows delivered on some leathery substance causes a new stir all recognise the arrival of her majestys mail a boy from martinhoe who comes upon a donkey twice a week if there happen to be any letters for the village below out rush mrs huxtable and suke who once received an epistle and the children long to go but know better the boy however has only a letter for me which is from mrs shelfer a cousin of ann maples to whom i wrote a few days since asking whether she had any rooms to let mrs shelfer replies that she has apartments and they are splendid and the rent quite trifling so the mail is bribed with a pint of cider while i write to secure a new home my departure being now fixed and inevitable the women naturally began to remonstrate more than over it had been settled that ann maples should go with me not to continue as my servant but to find a place for herself in london my few arrangements which cost me far more pain than trouble were not long in making and after saying goodbye to all the dear little children and weanies and kissing their pretty faces in their little beds amid an agony of tears from sally i was surprised on entering the kitchen to find there mr beany dawe there was little time for talking and much less for poetry we were to start at three in the morning the farmer having promised to drive us to meet the coach in barnstaple whence there would be more than thirty miles of hilly road to tiverton the nearest railway station the journey to london could thus be made in a day though no one in the parish could be brought to believe it the poet had been suborned no doubt by mrs huxtable and now detained me to listen to an elegy upon the metropolis of england i cannot stop to repeat it neither does it deserve the trouble but it began thus fayther was wance to lonnon town and a zed zed he whan a coom down dont e niver goo there ebenezer my son for they mulks a coo when her aint gat none they kapes up sich a hollerin naight and day and a devonsheer man dunno the impudence they zay their heads and their hats wags regular like the scratchers of a harrow and they biles their taties peeled and ates them in a barrow they raides on a waggon top with their wives squazed up inside her and they drinks black dose and yesty pops in the place of wholesome zider they want take back anything theyve zelled and the beds can bite and the cats can speak and a welldressd man be a most compelled to channge his shirt in the middle of the week lor cried mrs huxtable however could they do their washing thee vayther must a been as big a liar as thee beany them gifts always runs in the family when with remarkable patience i had heard out his elegant effusion the author who had conceived much good will towards me because i listened to his lays and called him mr dawe the author dived with a deepdrawn sigh into a hole in his sack and produced in a mysterious manner something wrapped in greasy silver paper and well tied up he begged me to accept and carry it about me most carefully and secretly as long as i should live to no other person in the world would he have given this but i had earned it as a true lover of poetry and required it as a castaway among the perils of london in vain i declined the present refusal only confirmed his resolution as the matter was of so little importance i soon yielded upon condition that i should first examine the gift he gave me leave with much reluctance and i was surprised at the beauty and novelty of the thing it was about the size of a geneva watch but rather thicker jet black and shining and of the exact shape of a human heart around the edge ran a moulding line or cord of brilliant red of the same material as the rest in the centre was a white spot like a siphuncle what it was i could not guess but it looked like some mineral substance where the two lobes met a small hole had been drilled to receive a narrow riband after putting me through many guesses mr dawe informed me that it was a pixies heart a charm of unequalled power against witchcraft and assassination and to enthral the affection of a loved one he only smiled and rubbed his nose on hearing that i should never want it in the last capacity being greatly pleased with it i asked him many questions which he was very loth to answer nevertheless i extorted from him nearly all he knew as he was sawing into boards a very large oaktree something fell from the very heart of it almost into his mouth for poor ebenezer was only an undersawyer as he could not stop the saw without his partners concurrence and did not wish to share his prize he kicked some sawdust over it until he could stoop to pick it up unobserved in all his long experience of the woods he had seen but two of these rare and beautiful things and now assured me that any sawyer was considered lucky who found only one in the course of his career the legend on the subject was rather quaint and graceful and deserves a better garb than he or i can furnish all in the olden time there lived a little pixie king so lovely and so light of foot that when he danced the ring the moonlight always shifted to gaze upon his face and the cowslipbells uplifted rang time with every pace there came a dozen maidens almost as tall as bluebells the cowslips hushed their cadence and bowed before the true belles the maidens shyly glancing betwixt the cummer darts espied the monarch dancing and lost a dozen hearts he was fitted up so neatly with dewdrops for his crown and he footed it so featly he never shook them down the maids began advancing along a lily stem not to stop the monarchs dancing but to make him look at them the king could not afford them the proper time to gaze but sweetly bowed toward them at the turn of every maze till full of pretty faces and his sandals getting worn he was puzzled in his paces and fell upon a thorn the maidens broke the magic ring and leaped the cummer dart alas our little pixie king the thorn is in his heart they laid him in a molehill and piteously they cried yet this was not the whole ill for all the maidens died each took a spindled acorn found below a squirrels nest and set the butt against the ground the barb beneath her breast so truly she addressed the stroke unto her loving part that when the acorn grew an oak it held her little heart by no means a little heart it seemed to me for a fairy to have owned but as large as it was loving i assured mr dawe that he was quite untaught in fairy lore or he never would have confounded fairies with pixies a different class of society but he treated my learning with utter contempt and reasonably enough declared that he who spent all his time in the woods must know more than any books could tell he also informed me that the proper name for the lignified fairy heart was a gordit but he did not choose to tell me what had become of the other which was not so large or handsome as this yet it had saved him a months sawing and earned him a rare time which meant i fear that the proceeds had been spent in a very long cruise after refusing all compensation mr dawe made his farewell in several couplets of uncouth but hearty blessing begging me only to shake hands with him once and venturing as a poet to prophesy that we should meet again the gordit was probably nothing more than a rare accretion or ganglion in the centre of an aged oak however it was very pretty and of course i observed the condition upon which i had received it valuing it moreover as a token of true friends but how can i think of such trifles while sitting for the last time in the room where my mother died tomorrow all the form and colour of my life shall change even now i feel once more my step on the dark track of justice which is to me revenge how long have i been sauntering on the dreary moor of listlessness and hollow weariness which spreads for so many dead leagues below the precipice of grief how long have i been sauntering not caring to ask where and conscious of existence only through the nerves and fibres of the memory the things i have been doing the duties i have discharged the vague unlinked ideas startling me by their buffoonery to griefmight not these have all passed through me every whit as well if i had been set against a wall and wound up for three months and fitted with the mind expressed in the chuckle of a clock nay worse than allhave i not allowed soft thoughts to steal throughout my heart the love of children the warmth of kindness the pleasure of doing good in however small a way much more of this and i shall learn forgiveness of my wrong but now i see a clearer road before me returning health renews my gall death recedes and lifts his train from the swords that fell before him once more my pulse beats high with hatred with scorn of meanness treachery and lies with admiration of truth and manhood not after the fashion of fools but dare i mount the judges throne shall the stir of one frail heart however fresh from its makers hand be taken for his voice pronouncing right and wrong these thoughts give me pause and i dwell again with my mother but in all the strength of youth and stern will i tread them down and am once more that clara vaughan whose life shall right her fathers death chapter vii at last we got through our parting with the best of people far worthier than myself to interest any reader and after it the dark ride over the moors and the farmers vain attempt at talking to relieve both himself and us the honest eyes were bright with tears tears of pity for my weakness which now he scarcely cared to hide but would not show by wiping away and how many times he begged for frequent tidings of us which sally could now interpret if written in large round hand how many times he consulted commanded and threatened the coachman and promised him a goose at michaelmas if he took good care of us and our luggage these great kindnesses and all the trifling cares which strew the gap of long farewells were more to think of than to tell but i ought to mention that much against the farmers will i insisted on paying him half the sum which he had lent me in a manner never to be forgotten moreover with the same presentiment which he had always felt he made me promise once more to send for him if i fell into any dreadful strait it was late at night when our cabman the most polite and if his word may be trusted the most honourable of mankind rang the bell of mrs shelfers house the house was in a bystreet near a large unfinished square in the northern part of london mrs shelfer came out at once sharp and quick and short and wonderfully queer at first she took no notice at all of either of as but began pulling with all her strength at the straps of the heaviest boxes which by means known to herself alone she contrived to drag through the narrow passage and down three low steps into the little kitchen then she hurried back talking all the time to herself reopened the door of the fly jumped in and felt under both the seats and round the lining finding nothing there she climbed upon the drivers box and thoroughly examined both that and the roof being satisfied now that none of our chattels were left in the vehicle she shook her little fist at two or three boys who stood at the corner near the mews and setting both hands to the farmers great hamper or maun as he called it she dragged it inside the front door and turned point blanc upon me pray my good friend how many is there im sure i dont know mrs shelfer your cousin knows best ah theyre terrible fellows them cabbies terrible the cabman stood by all the time beating his hands together twas only last time i went to barbican one of em come up to me mrs shelfer says he mrs shelfer says i pray my good friend how do you know my name ho i knows charley well enough says he and there aint a better fellow living a deal too good for you says i and now pray whats your business with me why old lady he says as impudent as the man with the wooden leg youve been and left your second best umbrella under the seat of the botany bay bus catch me says i its bible truth says he and my old womans got it now if you never get drunk says i till that umbrella runs in your shoes your old woman neednt steal her lights and with that i ran between the legs of a sheep hanging up with my tuscan bonnet on trimmed with whitenothing like it my good friend the same as ive had these two and twenty years what for mrs shelfer i asked in great surprise why for the butcher to see me to be sure miss you see he wanted to get me down the mews and murder me with my little washleather bag as i was going to pay the interest on shelfers doublebarrel gun ah yes with a short sigh and therell be four and ninepence again next tuesday talking at this rate and stopping for no reply she led us into her kitchen saying that she would not light a fire upstairs it was so bootiful the trimmings of the grate because she wasnt certain that we would come but she had got supper for us excuse me my good friend in her own snug little room and bootiful they was sure enough the wind last week had made them so fat she pointed in triumph to a large dish on the table piled up with blue shells why mrs shelfer they are muscles i exclaimed with some disgust ah i see you knows em that they are miss and as bootiful as ever you ate charley and me sits down to a peck of them but the man as comes round with the catsmeats brother the man with the truck and his eyes crossed he told me there was such a demand for them in grosvenor square and they was so cunning this weather when they gets fat he hadnt more than half a peck left but they was the best of the lot now ill have them all bootiful hot bootiful boiling my good friend if youll just run upstairs and a teaspoon and a half of salt and cousin ann knows the way and the apartments is splendid splendid miss vaughan she drew herself up at the end of the sentence with an air of the greatest dignity then suddenly dropped it again and began bustling in and out now for the first time i had leisure to examine her for while she spoke the short jumps of her ideas unsettled my observation she was a little body rather thin with a face not strongly peculiar but odd enough to second the oddities of her mind no doubt she had once been pretty and her expression was pleasant now especially when a glimpse was afforded of her quick grey eyes which generally avoided the gaze and dropped beneath a fringe of closeset lashes but the loss of the front teeth and the sharpening and wrinkling of the face with the straggling neglect of the thick black hair fraying out from the black cap and the habit she had of shutting her mouth with a snap all these interfered with her credit for pristine good looks like mrs huxtable she was generally in a bustle but a bustle of words more often than of deeds she had no deception about her yet she never knew the difference between the truth and a lie and could not understand that any one else should do so therefore she suspected everything and everybody till one of her veins of opinion was touched and then she would swallow anything tired out with the long days travel the dazing of railway speed and the many scenes and faces which had flashed across me i could not appreciate the beauty of mrs shelfers furniture but leaving ann maples to eat the muscles if she could and to gossip with her cousin i was not slow to revisit the old farmhouse and even the home of my childhood in the winged cradle of sleep chapter viii ann maples had done her best to persuade me to call on my godmother lady cranberry but i was quite resolved to do nothing of the sort in the first place lady cranberry was a person of great wealth living in a very large house and keeping up such state as gay widows love who have forgotten old affections and are looking out for new in me therefore to whose fixed estimate fidelity seemed the very pith of honour there could be no love towards such a changeling and even if i had liked her my circumstances would not admit of our visiting upon equal terms and it was not likely that i would endure to be patronized by any one in the second place the same most amiable lady had written letters of beautiful condolence and taken a tender interest in our change of fortune so long as there was any novelty in it but soon flagged off and had not even replied to my announcement of dearest mothers death finally i hated her without any compromise from what i had seen of her and what she had done to me at vaughan park so my good ann set off all alone for she hoped to obtain some recommendation there and i was left to receive mrs shelfers morning visit her queer episodical conversation and strange biographies of every table chair and cushionher sticks as she delighted to call themi shall not try to repeat for my history is not a comic one neither will she appear unless the connexion requires it one vein of sympathy between us was opened at once by her coming into the room with a lame blackbird on her finger and i was quite surprised at the number of her pets as for the splendid apartments they were two little rooms on the first floor adjoining one another and forming together with the landing outside and a coalcloset the entirety of that storey the rooms above were occupied by a young dressmaker mr and mrs shelfer who had no children kept the groundfloor consisting of a parlour and kitchen and the two attics one of which was always full of onions and carrot seed upon the whole though the sticks were very old and not over clean until i scoured them and the drawingroom as my landlady loved to call it was low and small and looked through the rails of a narrow balcony upon a cheesemongers shop across the road instead of a wooded dingle i was very well satisfied with them and above all the rent was within my means in the afternoon when things were growing tidy a carriage drove up rapidly and a violent ringing of the bell ensued it was lady cranberry who under the pretext of bringing ann maples home was come to gratify her own sweet curiosity she ran upstairs in her most charming manner caught me by both hands and would have kissed me desperately if i had shown any tendency that way then she stopped to admire me oh you lovely creature how you are grown to be sure i should never have known you how delicious all this is of course i was pleased with her admiration but only for a moment because i disliked her i am glad you find it delicious i replied quite coldly perhaps i shall byandby what would i give to be entering life under such sweetly romantic circumstances dear me i must introduce you what a sensation you will cause with such a face and figure and such a delightful story we shall all rave about you and how well you are dressed from that outlandish place what a piece of luck its the greatest marvel on earth that you found me in london now excuse me i said i neither found nor meant to find you oh of course you are cross with me i forgot about that but who made your dress in the name of all woodland graces i always make my own dresses then you shall make mine say no more about it you shall live with me and make my dresses by day and by night you shall go with me everywhere and i wont be jealous i will introduce you everywhere this is my ward miss vaughan whose fatherah i see you know that romantic occurrence in gloucestershire do you think it will be a yourand the great exhibition seasonbefore you are mistress of a property ten times the size of vaughan park if you doubt it look in the glass ah me you know nothing of the world i forget i am so warmhearted but you may take my word for it will you cry a bargain she held out her hand as she had seen the fast men do whose society she affected i noticed it not but led her on my fury had long been gathering i almost choked when she spoke in that way of my father utterly as i despised her but i made it a trial of selfcontrol which might be demanded against more worthy objects are you sure that i shall be useful sure that i shall earn my board oh you vaughans are always so conscientious i want an eiderdown petticoat quilted at once for the winter and i dare not trust it to biggs i know she will pucker it so that shall be the first little job for my clara her cup was full she had used dearest mothers fond appellative and as i thought in mockery i did not lower myself by any sarcastic language she would not have understood it i merely opened the door and said calmly to my landlady who was there of course promiscuously mrs shelfer show out the countess of cranberry poor godmother she was so frightened that i was sorry for her they helped her into the carriage and she had just strength to draw down the blinds mrs shelfer had been in raptures at having so grand a vehicle and two great footmen at her door lest the street should lose the effect she had run in and out a dozen times and banged the door and got into talk with the coachman and sent for beer to the inn though she had it in the house she now came again to my door in what she called a terrible quandary i could not attend to her but locked myself in and wrestled with my passionate nature at one time indulging then spurning and freezing it yet i could not master it as i fancied i had done chapter ix soon afterwards ann maples went to the place which she had obtained in lady cranberrys household and i determined to begin my search mrs shelfer do you know london well my landlady was feeding her birds and i had made up for her disappointment about lady cranberry by fitting the lame blackbird with a wooden leg cut from a skewer and tipped with a button it was pretty to see how kindly and cleverly he took to it and how proudly he contemplated it when he thought there was no one watching his mistress now stopped her work and made ready for a long speech with the usual snap of her lips know london miss vaughan i was born in red cross street and ive never been further out of town than chalk farm fair or hampstead waterworks and please god i never will bless me what an awful place the country is awful what with the trees and the ditches and the stingnettles and the black wainscot with skewers on the top too bad of you mrs shelfer to be frightened at palingsand your husband a gardener too but tell me whereabouts is grove street what grove street my good friend grove street london to be sure why dear me miss i thought you knew everything you can doctor jack and the bully and tell me all about sandy the squirrels tail and the hair coming off and when its going to rain dont you know theres a dozen grove streets in london for all i know leastways i knows four and where are those four mrs shelfer now please my good friend give me just a minute to think it is dreadful work to be hurried ever since i fell downstairs when i were six year old let me see now charley knows cant you wait miss till charley comes home and hes coming quite early this evening and two friends of his to supper no mrs shelfer i cannot wait if you cant tell me i must go and get a book oh them books is no good why they aint got charley in and he with the lease one time of the garden in hollyhock square and a dahlia named after him at the royal heretical society and they did say the queen would have handed him the spade she liked his looks so much only his nails wasnt clean very likely you heard missand how he was cheated out of it do you expect me to wait all day no no my good friend to be sure not you never will wait a minute partikler when i spill the coals and when i wants to baste the meat and how can the gravy run and a pinch of salt in the drippingpan yesterday mrs shelfer you basted my pound and a half of mutton with three pounds of coals now dont go off into a treatise answer me where is grove street bless my heart miss vaughan you never gives one a chance and we thought a young lady from the country as had been brought up with tags and lace and bobbin and pigs and hay could be cheated anyhow no i dont mean that i beg your pardon dear patty i often speak very hastily what i mean is that you thought i should know nothing at all and i dont know much but one thing i do know that you would never cheat me much to my surprise she was not at all sensitive on this subject in fact she had dealt with so many lodgers that she expected to be suspected but i believe she never cheated me more than she could help she answered me quite calmly after some meditation to be sure miss to be sure i only does my dooty a little dripping may be or a drop of milk for old tom and a piece of soap you left in the water miss i kept it for charley to shave with now mrs shelfer no more of that come back to grove street surely i have given you time enough now well miss there is one i know close by here you keep down the willa road and by the fishmongers shop and then you turn on the right over against the licensed pursuant to act of george the fourth i knows george the fourth acted badly but i never thought it was that way sam the sweep lives with him and the young man with a hook for his hand that lets out the times for a penny and keeps all his brothers and sisters and where are the other three that you know theres one in hackney and one in bethnal green and theres one in mileend road bless me to be sure ive been there with dear miss minto after a cat she lost a tabby with a silver collar on and a notch in his left ear it would make you cry miss thank you mrs shelfer that will do for the present ill go up to the drawingroom now in a few minutes i went forth with my dark plaid shawl around me which had saved my mothers life and was thenceforth sacred it was the first time i walked all alone in london and though we lived quite in the suburbs it seemed very odd to me for a while i felt rather nervous but no one molested me then or at any other time although i have heard some plain young ladies declare that they could not walk in london without attracting unpleasant attention perhaps because they knew not the way either to walk or to dress without any trouble i found no grove street then rang the bell and looked round me it was a clean unpretentious street not to be known by its architecture from a thousand others in london the bell was answered by a neat little girl and i asked for the master of the house clever tactics truly for commencing a task like mine being told that the master was from home i begged to see the mistress the little maid hesitated awhile with the chain of the door in her hand and then invited me into the parlour a small room but neat and pretty please miss what name shall i say miss vaughan if you please then i said to myself what good am i is this my detective adroitness presently a nice old lady with snowwhite hair came in miss vaughan she asked with a pleasant smile do you wish to see me yes if you please just to ask a few questions as to the inmates of this house despite her kindness and good breeding the lady stared a little may i inquire your motives do you know me at all i have not the pleasure of knowing you my motives i must not tell you but as a lady i assure you that curiosity is not one neither are they improper she looked at me in great surprise examined me closely and then replied young lady i believe what you say it is impossible not to do so but my answering you must depend on the nature of your inquiries you have done excuse my saying it you have done a very odd thing i will not ask many questions how many people live here i will answer you curtly as you ask unless you ask what i do not choose to answer four people live here namely my husband myself our only daughterbut for whom i might have been ruder to youand the child who let you in also a woman comes every day to work are there no more forgive my impertinence no strangers to the family no lodgers whatever my son is employed in the city and sleeps there my only daughter is in very weak health and though we do not want all the house we are not obliged to take lodgers a thing i never would do because they always expect to be cheated and is your husband an englishman yes and an english writer not altogether unknown she mentioned a name of good repute in the world of letters as even i was aware you have quite satisfied me i thank you most heartily very few would have been so polite and kind i fear you must think me a very singular being but i have powerful motive and am quite a stranger in london my dear i knew that at once no londoner would have learned from me the family history i have told you i should have shown them out at the very first question thank you oh thank you my child but i am sure you have hurt yourself oh the shell has run into your forehead as she looked so intently at me on her way to the door of the room her foot had been caught by the claw of the whatnot and i barely saved her from falling no mrs elton i am not hurt at all how stupid of me to be sure and all my fault that you fell i hope the shell is not broken ah i bring very bad luck to all who treat me kindly the shell is not worth sixpence the fault was all my own if you had not been wonderfully quick i must have fallen heavily pray sit down and recover yourself miss vaughan look you have dropped a letter dear me i know that writing excuse me it is i that am now impertinent if you know that writing pray tell me how and where the letter she had seen was the anonymous one which brought me from devonshire to london i had put it into my pocket thinking that it might be wanted it fell out as i leaped forward and it lay on the floor wide open may i look at the writing more closely perhaps i am deceived for a while i hesitated but it seemed so great a point to know who the writer was that i hushed my hesitation however i showed the letter so that she could not gather its import yes said mrs elton i am quite certain now that is the writing of a polish lady whom at one time i knew well my husband has written a work upon poland which brought him into contact with some of the refugees among them was a gentleman of some scientific attainments who had a pretty lively warmhearted wife very fond of dancing and very fond of dogs she and i have had many a laugh at one another and ourselves for though my hair is grey i am fond of lively people and where is that lady now my child i cannot tell you her name i will tell you if you like when i have consulted my husband but it will help you very little towards finding her for they change their names almost every time they move even in london they forget that they are not heard every time they sneeze the furtive habits born of oppression cling about them still and where did they live at the time you knew them wrung by suspense and anxiety i had forgotten good manners but mrs elton had good feeling which knows when to dispense with them nevertheless i blushed with shame at my own effrontery not very far from here in a part that is called agar town but they have now left london and england too i believe i must tell you no more because they had reasons for wishing to be unknown only tell me one thing were they cruel or violent people the very opposite most humane and warmhearted they would injure no one and hated all kinds of cruelty how pale you are my child you must have a glass of wine it is useless to say no as this clue which seemed so promising led to nothing at all i may as well wind it up at once and not tangle my story with it mr elton permitted his wife to tell me all she knew about the polish exiles for they were gone to america and nothing done here could harm them but at the same time he made me promise not to mention to the police if my case should ever come before them the particulars which he gave me and i am sure he would not wish me to make free with the gentlemans name a gentleman he was as both my kind friends assured me and not likely to conceal any atrocious secret unless he had learned it in a way which laid it upon his honour mr elton had never been intimate with him and knew not who his friends were but mrs elton had liked the lady who was very kind and passionate also she was very apt to make mistakes in english names and to become confused at moments of excitement therefore mrs elton thought that she had confounded the eltons address with that of some other person for it seemed a most unlikely thing that she should know the residents at two nos grove street however so it provedbut of that in its place it was now six months since they had quitted london perhaps on account of the climate for the gentleman had been ill some time and quite confined to the house it would be altogether vain to think of tracing them in america while living in london they owned a most magnificent dog a truly noble fellow but afflicted with a tumour this dog suddenly disappeared and they would not tell what had become of him but the lady cried most violently one day when he was spoken of directly after this they left the country with a very brief farewell all this i learned from mr and mrs elton during my second visit for mrs elton was too good a wife to dispense with her husbands judgment also i saw their daughter a pleasing delicate girl they learned of course some parts of my story and were most kind and affectionate to me and i am proud to have preserved their friendship to the present time but as they take no prominent share in the drama of my life henceforth they will not be presented upon its stage as i returned up the villa road thinking of all i had heard and feeling down at heart something cold was gently placed in my ungloved hand turning in surprise and fright i saw an enormous dog wagging his tail and looking at me with magnificent brown eyes those great brown eyes were begging clearly for the honour of my acquaintance and that huge muzzle was deposited as a gage of love as i stooped to ascertain his sentiments he gravely raised one mighty paw and offered it to me delicately with a little sigh of selfapproval upon my accepting it frankly and begging to congratulate him upon his noble appearance and evident moral excellence he put out his tongue a brilliant red one and gave me a serious kiss then he shrugged his shoulders and looked with patient contempt at a nicelydressed young lady who was exerting her lungs at a silver whistle some fifty yards down the road go good dog i said with a smile run thats a good dog your mistress wants you immediately let her wait he said with his eyes i am not in a hurry this morning and she doesnt know what to do with her time however if you think it would be rude of me and with that he resumed a long bone laid aside while he chatted to me tucked it lengthwise in his mouth like a tobaccopipe and after shaking hands again and saying now dont forget me the great dog trotted away sedately flourishing his tail on high like a plume of pampas grass at the corner of the railings he overtook his young mistress whose features i could not descry though from her air and walk i knew that she must be a pretty girl a goodtempered one too she seemed to be for she only shook her little whip lightly at the dog who made an excursion across the road and sniffed at a heap of dust chapter x although ann maples was not so very talkative it would be romantic to suppose that mrs shelfer had failed to learn my entire history so far at least as her cousin knew it having now disposed of one grove street i was about to try the same rude tactics with another viz that in hackney when my landlady gave a little nervous knock and hurried into the room oh miss vaughan is it about them willains you are wandering about and taking on so and frightening all of us nearly to death mrs shelfer i shall feel obliged by your leaving me to manage my own affairs bless you miss so i will i wouldnt have them on my mind for the bank of england and guildhall paved with lombard street and so i told charley last night right my good friend quite right you may depend upon it here she tapped her forehead and looked mysterious that being so mrs shelfer i need say nothing more and with that i was going away no no to be sure not only listen to me miss one minute and i knows more about willains a deal more than you do of course miss why ever since that rogue who come to miss mintos with brandyballs and rabbitskins on a stick once more mrs shelfer i have no time to spare for gossip gossip no no miss vaughan if you ever heard any one say patty shelfer was a gossip ill thank you for their name gossip a mercy on me with all i has to do and the days drawing in so and how they does charge for the gas and the directors holds a meeting first tuesday in every month and fills up the pipes with spittle thats the reason it sputters so charley told me good bye mrs shelfer no no one minute miss vaughan you are always in such a hurry what charley and me was talking about last night was this my uncle john a very high class man firstrate firstrate miss vaughan has been for ever so long in the detective police theres nothing he dont know of what goes on in london from the rats as comes up the drain pipes to the queen getting up on her throne a wonderful man he is i said tother day is he like you mrs shelfer like me my good friend no no and i wouldnt be like him for something with all them state secrets upon him why he darent sneeze out of his hat but if youll only put off going again till tomorrow hell be here this very night about the plate they stole in the square and im sure you cant do better than hear what he thinks about you hell be sure to know all that was done at the time bless you he has got to make all the returns what that is i dont know its a kind of tobacco charley says that they smokes in the queens pipe but i think its the convicts as returns from botany bay well mrs shelfer ill think of what you say and i am much obliged to you for the suggestion but i cant bear the idea of coming before the police again with a matter in which they failed so signally but you know my good friend it need not be put on the books at all hell tell us what he thinks of it private like and for the love of the thing if i see him at all i must beg to see him alone to be sure my good friend quite right miss vaughan quite right im sure i would rather have the plumbers ladle put to my ear than one of them horrible secrets mrs shelfer have i told you any now remember if you ever again allude to this subject before me i leave your house that day you ought to know better mrs shelfer you are quite right miss vaughan i ask your pardon you are quite right the very words as charley said to me the other night you ought to have knowed better patty that you did away she went smoothing her apron patting the fray of her hairfor she never wore sidecombsand mumbling down the stairs quite right my good friend quite right i ought to have knowed better poor thing she brought up my dinner and tea without a single word but with many sly glances at me from her quick grey eyes once or twice she was at the point of speaking and the dry smile she always spoke with fluttered upon her face but she closed her lips firmly and even bit them to keep herself in i could scarcely help laughing for i liked the odd little thing but she was so free with her tongue that the lesson was sadly wanted late in the evening she came to say that inspector cutting was there and would come up if i wished it upon my request he came and one look was enough to show that his niece had not misdescribed him an elderly man but active looking and wiry with nothing remarkable in his features except the clear cast of his forehead and the firm set of his mouth but the quick intelligence that shot from his eyes made it seem waste of time to finish telling him anything for this reason polite though he was it became unpleasant to talk to him it was something like shooting at diversas my father used to describe itfor whom the flash of the gun is enough yet he never once stopped or hurried me until my tale was done and all my thoughts laid bare then he asked to see all my relics and vestiges of the deed even my gordit did not escape him ldo he said shortly do you speak italian i can read it but not speak it is it commoner for italian surnames to begin with an o or with a c there are plenty beginning with both but more i should think with a c when all my particulars had been told and all my evidence shown i asked with breathless interestfor my confidence in him grew fastwhat his opinion was allow me young lady to put a few questions to you on matters you have not mentioned forgive me if they pain you i believe you feel that they will not be impertinent i promised to answer without reserve what was your mothers personal appearance most winning and delicate how old was she at the time of her marriage twentyone i believe how old was your father then twentyfive how many years were they married sixteen exactly when did your guardian first leave england in the course of a year or two after the marriage had there been any misunderstanding between him and your father none that i ever heard of did your father at any time travel on the continent only in switzerland and part of italy during his wedding tour your guardian returned i believe at intervals to england i had never told him this yes at least i suppose so or he would not have been in london did he visit then at vaughan park not once within my memory thank you i will ask no more it is a strange story but i have known several much more strange of one thing be assured i shall catch the criminal i need not tell you that i heard much of this case at the time were you sent down to gloucestershire no if i had beenwell i will not say but i was not then in my present position had i been so it would have become my special department pray keep me no more in suspense tell me what you think that i must not do or you should know it at once for my opinion is formed it would be a breach of duty for me to tell you now oh i cried in my disappointment i wish i had never seen you young lady you have done your duty in placing the matter before me and some day you will rejoice that you did so one piece of advice i will give you change your name immediately before even the tradesmen about here know it change my name inspector cutting do you think i am ashamed of my name certainly not you have shown great intelligence when a mere child exert but a little now and you will see the good sense or rather the necessity of my recommendation when you have gained your object you may resume your name with pride you have given your information miss vaughan as clearly as ever i knew a female give it if i detest anything in the way of small things it is to be called a female so i said coldly inspector cutting i thank you for the compliment it would be strange indeed if i could not tell with precision what i have thought of all my life excuse me miss it would not be strange at all in a female and now i will wish you good night you shall hear from me when needful meanwhile i will take charge of these articles he began in the coolest manner to pack up my sacred relics dagger casts and all indeed you wont i cried you shall not have one of them what are you thinking of he went on with his packing i saw he was resolute so was i i sprang to the door locked it and put the key in my pocket he said nothing but smiled now i exclaimed in triumph you cannot take those away unless you dare to outrage a young lady i was wholly mistaken he passed by without touching me drew some instrument from his waistcoat pocket and the door stood open before him all my treasures were in his left hand i flew at and snatched them and then let go with a scream a gush of blood poured from my hand he had taken the dagger folded in paper only and i was cut to the bone i sank on a chair and fainted when i came to myself mrs shelfer was kneeling before me with her feet in a basin of water while two other basins and numberless towels were round mrs shelfer was rubbing my other hand and crying and talking desperately about her bad luck that day and a man with eyes crossed whom she had met in the morning in the background stood mr shelfer himself whom i had hitherto failed to see though i believe he had seen me often he had a pipe in his mouth about a yard long and seemed wholly undisturbed all right old ooman he said deliberately through his nose as he saw that i perceived him shell do now if you dont make too much rumpus and with that he disappeared and i had time to pity myself the hand the poor farmer used so to admire and which i was proud of no doubt in my way lay in a dishcloth covered and oozing with blood but my relics were on the table all safe a quick step was heard on the stairs and inspector cutting came in carrying a small phial out of the way patty he cried you are doing more harm than good he took up a basin of cold water and poured half the contents of the little phial into it now hold her arm up patty as high as you can i never knew arnica fail my hand was put into the water and the bleeding was stanched in a minute or two however he kept it there for a quarter of an hour till it was quite benumbed now you may look at your hand miss vaughan it will not be disfigured at all there will be no inflammation patty fetch me some cambric and the best lard put the young lady to bed at once and prop her arm up a little i looked at my hand and found three parallel gashes across it for every edge of the weapon was keen but only one wound was deep viz that across the palm which was very deep under the thumb i have the mark of it still all the wounds were edged with a narrow yellow line inspector cutting i cried no power will move me from here until you promise not to steal my property stealing it is and nothing else you have no warrant and my information to you was wholly unofficial the last word seemed to move him they all like big words however clearheaded they are miss vaughan under these special circumstances i will promise what you require upon condition that you give me accurate drawings for i see that you can make them certainly when my hand is well enough believe me i am deeply concerned at what has occurred but the fault was all your own how dare you obstruct the police but i wish some of my fellows had only half your spirit a little more experience and nothing will escape you come miss vaughan though you are a lady or rather because you are one give me your left hand in token that you forgive me i did so with all my heart i liked him much better since i had defeated him and i saw that it was well worth the pain for he would do his utmost to make amends he wished me good night with a most respectful bow i will come and inquire how you are tomorrow miss vaughan patty quiet and coolness and change the lard frequently no doctor if you please and above all hold your queer little tongue never fear me uncle john you are right my good friend it is a little tongue but no queerer than my neighbours inspector cutting would have formed a far lower opinion of my spirit if he had seen how i cried that night not from the pain of the wounds i am sure but to think of the fuss dear mother would have made about them chapter xi in spite of the arnica my cuts were not healed for a month not enough i mean for me to handle a pencil mr cutting when he came according to promise told me something to quiet me because i was so feverish whether he believed it or only acted medically was more than i could decide the opinion he gave me or the substance of it was this that the deed was done not for money or worldly advantage in any way but for revenge here i thought of mrs daldy what wrong the revenge was wreaked for he could not even guess or at any rate would not hint to me that the straightest clue to the mystery was to be sought in italy where my guardians track should be followed carefully the idea of forcing or worming the truth from him was rejected at once through my description of his character although the inspector quite agreed with me that even if guiltless of the crime mr edgar vaughan knew all about it now that no importance should be attached to the anonymous letter from london in accordance with my promise to mrs elton i did not mention the polish ladys name and mr cutting did not press me to do so for he firmly believed from what i said that she had made a mistake in the address she gave and would not help us now even if we could find her that nevertheless a strict watch should be kept in london whither flock ninetenths of the foreigners who ever set foot in this country london moreover was likely ere long to draw nearly all the migratory strangers to the business or pleasure of next years great exhibition provided only that it should prove successful as the inspector thought it would as for my enemy being attracted by works of industry it seemed to me quite against nature that a base assassin should care for art or science or any national progress but the remembrance of several cases among the dark annals i used to delight in soon proved to me my error while the long experience of a man versed from his youth in criminal ways convicted me of presumption to put myself more on a level with fraud and stealth and mystery i did a thing for which i felt guilty to myself and my mother i changed my name but in spite of inspector cutting i did not travel out of the family my fathers second name was valentine taken from his mother this name i assumed in a shorter form becoming clara valence it saved change of initials and a world of trouble and i felt warmer in it because it seemed to have been my fathers in the neighbourhood i knew no one except mrs elton to whom as i grew intimate with her i partly explained my reasons as for mrs shelfer she was delighted at the change she said that her uncle john had christened me that it sounded much prettier and would always remind her of valentines nevertheless i longed for the day when i might call myself clara vaughan once more by the time i was able to go about freely again and use my hand as of old it was the middle of november the first use i made of my pencil was to copy most carefully all that inspector cutting required he promised to keep these drawings and indeed the whole matter most jealously to himself by which term he meant as i afterwards found inspector cutting and those to whom he was bound to report what i now wanted was money to send an adroit inquirer throughout the north of italy and other parts where my guardians shifting abode had been i knew that he dwelt awhile at pisa genoa and milan also at an obscure little village named calva which i could not find in the maps all i had learned of his rovings was from the lessons my father would give me sometimes when he used to say now tooty put your finger on uncle edgar to every one but myself it seemed a strange thing that after so many wanderings mr edgar vaughan had brought no valet major domo or courier no dependant or retainer of any kind and not even a foreign friend to england or at any rate to vaughan park but now for the needful resourcesthe only chance of procuring them lay in my young and partly selftutored art i braced myself with the remembrance that while none of my family ever laid claim to genius the limners faculty had never been wanting among them inferior gifts are often as heirlooms in the blood though high original power follows no vein except its own the latter none of us ever possessed but taste and the knack of adaptation had seldom been alienated observation too in a small way and the love of nature seemed inborn in us all my fathers drawings were perfect but for the one thing wanted and in sketches from outdoor nature that want was less perceived my grandfather had been known among the few amateurs of the day as a skilful colourist as to habits of observation a little tale handed down in our family will show that they had existed in one of its members seven generations ago in the autumn of when king charles was stealing along from colonel wyndhams house to the coast of hampshire and sussex the little band was overtaken by nightfall somewhere near the new forest it was shortly after the narrow escape of the king from that observant blacksmith who saw that his horse was shod with northcountry iron though he was taking it easily his three trusty friends knew well that a roundhead squadron was near and that his last chance depended on speed and night travel what could they do now in the tempestuous darkness they were in a tract thinly inhabited half woodland half heather and the road was hopelessly lost no rain fell as yet it was true and the wind was waiting for rain but the lightning came fitfully from the horizon all round the king alone was on horseback his three companions afoot they stood still in doubt and terror for they could not tell north from south suddenly major cecil vaughan espied a faint gleam familiar to him of old in the waste land round vaughan park to an accurate eye there could be little doubt as to the source of the lambent lightflame it could not be called it played in a pale yet constant stream on a certain kind of moss known to botanists not to me for the waste lands have been reclaimed this light is to be seen at no time except when the air is surcharged with electricity follow me all i know the way cried major vaughan right cheerily and if you do man said the king your eyes are made of dashers what this meant i used as a child to wonder but now i know for six dark miles the major led them without default until they came to a lonely heathmans house where they slept in safety he never told them how he did it being apt i suppose as men of the second order are to hug superior knowledge but it was a most simple thing that strangely sensitive moss follows the course of the sun and therefore the lambent light can only be seen from the west so all the time he could see itthe others never saw it at allhe knew that they were wending from west to east which was their proper course to return to myself i put the finishing touch to a view of rock and woodland scenery northwest of tossils barton and set off to try my fortune with it some young ladies born to my position would have thought this errand one of much degradation but it did not appear so to me so i walked brisklyfor i hate an omnibus and could ill afford a cabto the shop of a wellknown dealer in pictures not far from the haymarket it was my first venture into the heart of london but i found the way very easily having jotted it down from a map the day was dark and drizzly the pavement grimy and slimy and hillocked with mud at the joints of the flags it was like walking on a peeled kneadingtrough with dollops of paste left in it along the far reach of the streets and the gardens in the squares wisps of fog were crawling and almost every one was coughing the dealer received me politely too politely in fact for it seemed to savour of kindness which i did not want from him what i wanted was business and nothing else he took my poor drawing done only in watercolours and set it up in a square place made perhaps for the purpose where the brown flaw fell upon it from a skylight formed like a devonshire chimney then he drew back and clasped his hands then shaded his eyes with them as if the light were too strong whereas the whole place was like a well turned upside down he seemed uneasy because i did not care to follow him throughout all this little performance and now i said for my foolish pride was up and i spoke as i would have done to the porter at our lodge not with the least contempti was never so low as thatbut with a long perspective now mr oxgall it will soon be dark what will you give me for it allow me miss allow me one moment the light is a leetle too strong ah the mark of the brush comes out strong touch but indiscreet a year of study required shade too broad and massive a want of tone in the background great feeling of nature but inexperienced rendering more mellowness desiderated full however of promise all the faults on the right side most energetic handling no weak stippling here but watercolours are down just now a deal depends on the weather and time of year how so mr oxgall hot sun and off they go fog and murk and frost and the cry is all for oil excuse me missa thousand pardons your name escaped me you did not pronounce it strongly miss valence i said with an emphasis that startled him out of his mincing miss valence you think me very long all young ladies do but my object is to do them justice and if they show any power to encourage them thank you i want no encouragement i know i can draw a little and there it is the fog is thickening i have far to go your price if you please i went up many steps in his opinion by reason of my curtness and independence miss valence i will give you three guineas although no doubt i shall be a loser then dont give it said i in pure simplicity i went up several steps more how utterly men of the world are puzzled by plain truth miss valence if you will forgive the observation i would beg to remark that your conversation as well as your painting is crisp i will take this little piece at all hazards because it is full of character will you forgive me for one word of advice there is nothing to forgive i shall thank you heartily for it it is simply thisthe worst part of your work is the perspective and figuredrawing will be of service to you study at a school of design if you have one near you and be not above drawing stiff and unsightly objects houses are the true guides to perspective i cannot paint or even draw but i am so much with great artists that i know well how to advise thank you can you kindly suggest anything more yes your touch is here and there too harsh keep your hand light though bold and your brush just a leetle wetter but you have the grand things quite unattainable when not in the grain i mean of course freedom of handling and an artists eye do you think i could do any good in oils i have no doubt you could but not for a long time if fame is your object take to oils if speedy returns stick to watercolours leave me your address if you have no objection and bring me your next work if i do well with this i will try to give you more he took from a desk three new sovereigns and three new shillings wrapped them neatly in silver paper and handed them to me i never imagined i could be so proud of money light of heart i left the shop not that i had made my fortune yet but what was greater happiness i thought myself likely to make it soon i perceived with some alarm how thick and murky the air had grown the fog was stooping heavily down and was now become like a wash of gamboge and lampblack all the streetlamps were lit though they could not see one another and every shopkeeper had his little jet the pavement was no longer slippery but sticky and dry and a cold that pierced to the bones was stealing along already it had begun to freeze and i so familiar both with white and black frost observed with no small interest the grey or fogfrost which was new to me how different from the pure whiteness when the stars are sparkling and the earth is gleaming and the spirit of man so buoyant this grey fogfrost is rather depressing to most natures and a chilly damp creeps to the core of all things thick encrusting rime comes with it and sometimes a freezing rain before i reached the new road the fog had grown so dense and dark that i was much inclined to take a cab for fear of losing my way but i could not see one and finding myself at last in a main thoroughfare called the hampstead road i walked on briskly and bravely till i reached camden town when i knew what course to pursue slowly wending up college street for i was getting tired and the fog thicker than ever indeed every step seemed a thrust into an ochred wall i heard a plaintive and rather musical voice chanting much as follows christian friends and sisters in the lord all who own a heart that feels for undeserved distress aid i implore you a bereaved wife and mother who has this very moment seven small lovely children starving in a garret three of them upon a bed of sickness and the inhuman landlord for the sake of a few shillings about to turn them this bitter night into the flinty streets christian friends may you never know what it is to be famished as i and my seven darlings are this very night in the midst of plenty from plymouth in devonshire i walked two hundred and fifty miles afoot all the way to join my beloved husband in london when i came to this christian citygeorgiana pick up that halfpennyhe had been ordered off in the transport ship hippopotamus to shed his blood for his queen and country and i who have known the smiles of plenty in my happy rustic home i am compelled for the sake of my children to the degradation of publicly soliciting alms the smallest trifle even an old pair of shoes or a left off garment will be received with the heartfelt gratitude of the widow and orphan my eldest child maam the oldest of seven bad in the whooping cough georgiana curtsey to the pretty lady and show her your broken chilblains no thank you i said i could just see her through the fog she looked like one who had seen better days and the thought of my own vicissitudes opened my heart towards her how could i show my gratitude better for the money i had just earned than by bestowing a share in charity upon worthy objects so i took out my purse an elegant little french one given me by dear mother and placed my three new shillings in the poor creatures hand as she stood in the gutter she was overpowered with gratitude and could not speak for a moment then she came nearer to bless me sweet lady in the name of seven famishing innocents whom you have saved from death this night may he who guards the fatherless and the widow from his mercyseat above may he shower his richest blessings snapshe had got my purse and was out of sight in the fog georgianas red heels were the last thing i saw for an instant i could not believe it but thought that the fog had affected my sight then i darted across the road almost under the feet of a horse and down a place called pratt street it was hopeless utterly hopeless and not only my three pounds were gone but half besides of all i had in the world i had taken that money with me because i meant if fortunate with my landscape to buy a large box of colours in rathboneplace but the fog had deterred me she had snatched my purse while i tried to clasp it for my glove had first got in the way all was gone dear mothers gift my first earnings and all more than all i felt sore at heart from the baseness of the robbery nothing is so bitterly grievous to youth as a blow to faith in ones species i am not ashamed to confess that feeling all alone in the fog i leaned against some iron railings and cried away like a child child i was still at heart despite all my trials and spirit and more so perhaps than girls who have played out their childhood in the full flow of my passion for i was actually sobbing aloud ashamed of myself all the while i felt an arm steal round my waist and starting in fear of another thief confronted the loveliest face that human eyes ever looked on with soft caresses and sweetest smiles it drew close to my own stormy and bitter countenance are you better now dear oh dont cry so youll break your poor little heart do tell me what it is thats a dear ill do anything to help you you cant help me i exclaimed through my sobs nobody can help me i was born to ill luck and shall have nothing else till i die dont say so dear you mustnt think of it my father who never is wrong says theres no such thing as luck i know that well enough people always say that who have it on their side ah i never thought of that but i hope you are wrong but tell me dear what is the matter with you im sure you have done no harm and dear papa says no one can be unhappy who has not injured any one cant they though your papa is a moralist now ill just tell you facts and to prove my point i told her of this new trouble hinted at previous ones and my many great losses of which money was the least even without the controversial spirit i must have told her all there was no denying anything to such a winning loving face dear me she cried very thoughtfully with her mites of hands out of her muffshe had the prettiest set of fur i ever beheld and how it became herdear me she couldnt have meant it i feel quite sure she couldnt youll come to my opinion when you have time to consider dearthis was said so sagely that i could have kissed her all over like a duck of a baby to steal from you who had just given her more than you could afford now come with me dear you shall have all the money i have got though i dont think its anything like the nine pounds you have lost and im sure it is not new money only i havent got it with me i never carry money do you know why dear no how should i well i dont mind telling you because then i cant spend it or give it away i dont care a bit about money what good is it to me why i can never keep it somehow or other but papa says if i can show five pounds on christmasday he will put five more on the top of it and then do you know what ill do ill give away five and spend the rest for pappy and conrad and the lively little thing clapped her hands at the prospect quite forgetting that she had just offered me all her store presently this occurred to her no now i come to think of it i wont have the five pounds on christmasday as the girls at the college say ill just sell the old pappy that will be better fun still he will find a good reason for it he always does for everything you shall have every bit of it come home with me now thats a dear you are better now you know come thats a love i am sure i shall love you with all my heart and you are so terribly unlucky i yielded at once she was so loving and natural i could not resist her she broke upon me like soft sunshine through the fog laughing smiling dancing her face all light and warmth yet not a shallow light but one that played up from the fount of tears her deep rich violet eyes seldom used their dark lashes except when she was asleep she was life itself quick playful loving life feeling for and with all life around pitying trusting admiring all things yet true as the hearth to household ties i never found another such nature it was the perfection of maiden womanhood even in its unreason and therefore nobody could resist her with me of ten times her strength of will and power of mindsmall though it beshe could do in a moment exactly as she liked i mean of course in trivial matters it was impossible to be offended with her when she had led me a few steps towards her homefor i went with her not of course to take her money but to see her safe she turned round suddenly oh i forgot dear i must not take you to our house we have had new orders but where do you live i will bring you my little bag tomorrow they wont let me out again tonight now i know you will oblige me i am so sorry that i mustnt see you safe home dear this she said with the finest air of protection imaginable i gave her my name and address and asked for hers my name is isola ross i am seventeen and a half and my papa is professor at the college i ran away from old cora it seemed such fun to be all alone in the fog what trouble i shall get into but they cant be angry with me long kiss me darling mind tomorrow off she danced through the fog and i went sadly home yet thinking more of her than of my serious and vexatious loss chapter xii inspector cutting upon the first tidings of the robbery came at once and assured me that he knew the party well and wanted her for several other plants and crafty as she was leary was the elegant word he used he was sure to be down upon her in the course of a very short time isola ross to my great surprise did not come the next day nor even the day after so i set out to look for her at the same time wondering at myself for doing so knowing that college street must take its name from some academic building in or near it i concluded of course that there i should find professor ross and my lovely new friend so without consulting mrs shelfer who would have chattered for an hour away i went one tine frosty morning to ask about the college i found that a low unsightly building which i had often passed near the bottom of the street was the only college there so i entered a small quadrangle to make further inquiries the first person i saw was a young man dressed like one of my fathers grooms and cracking a long whip and whistling he had a brilliant scarlet neckcloth green sporting coat and black boots up to his knees i studied him for a moment because it struck me that he would look well in a foreground when toned down a little as water colours would render him he appreciated my attention and seemed proud of it now polly what can i do for you dear he must have been three parts drunk or he would never have dared to address me so of course i made no answer but walked on he cracked his whip like a pistol to startle me splendid filly i heard him mutter but cussed high action what he meant i do not know or care the next i met was a fussy little man dressed all in brown who smelt of musty hay will you kindly tell me i asked where to find professor ross ross ross dont know the name no ross about here whats he professor of that i was not told but it is something the young ladies study no young ladies about here but i see you have brought your dear mammas lapdog take it out of the bag let me look at it is not this the college yes to be sure the best college in london quick let me see the dog i have no dog sir i have made some mistake then you have got a pony pet overfed shetland breed no indeed nothing except myself and i am looking for miss ross young lady you have made a very great mistake you have kept me five minutes from a lecture on the navicular disease and my practice is controverted by an upstart youth from the country i am in search of authorities and off he darted i suppose to the library it was clear that i had made some mistake so i found my way back to the street and asked in the nearest shop what building it was that i had just left oh thems the weterans said the woman and a precious set they be why they did not look like soldiers no no miss weterans where they takes in all the sick horses and dogs and very clever they are i have heard say and where is the college where the young ladies are i dont know of no other college nearer than high street where the boys wear flat caps but theres a girls school down the road i dont want a school i want a college where young ladies go then i cant help you miss and back i went to consult mrs shelfer bless my soul miss valence cried the little woman out of breath with amazement have you been among them niggers its a mercy they didnt skin and stuff you what do you think now they did to my old tom how can i guess mrs shelfer no no to be sure not i forgot my good friend why they knowed him well it seems because he had been there in dear miss mintos time for a salmon bone that had got crossways in his oesop so they said at least but they are the biggest liarsso only a year ago come next boxingday here comes to the door half a dozen of them buscad and coachman all in one all looking as grave as judges when i went to the door they all pulled their hats off as if i had been the queen at the very least what can i do for you my good friends says i for shelfer was out of the way and catch me letting them in for all their politeness no no thank you mrs shelfer says the biggest of them a lanternjawed young fellow with covers over his pockets mrs shelfer you are possessed of a most remarkable cat an animal maam of unparalleled cemetery and organic dewelopment our professor maam is delivering a course of lectures on the canonical heapatightness of the hirumbillycuss well done mrs shelfer what a memory you must have pretty well miss pretty well particular for long words when i likes the sound of them well sir i says feeling rather taken aback thank god i havent got it no maam says he your blooming countenance entirely negatives any such dyingnoses but the professor in passing the other morning observed some symptoms of it in your magnificent cat for whom he entertains the most sincere attachment and whom he will cure for our advancement and edification upon the lecture table and now maam professor sallenders desires his most respectful compliments and will you allow us to take that dear good cat to be cured the professor was instrumental once in preserving his honoured existence therefore he feels assured that you will not now refuse him well you see miss i didnt half like to let him go but i was afraid to offend the professor because of all my animals for i knew that he could put a blight upon them birds and all if he chose old tom was lying roasting his back again the fender the same as you see him now poor soul so i catched him up and put him in a double covered basket with a bit of flannel over him because the weather was cold and he was so clever would you believe it he put up his old paws to fight me he knew he was going to mischief and that turned me rather now will you promise to bring him back safe i says maam says the lanternjawed young man bowing over his heart and as serious as a pulpit maam in less than an hour rely upon the honour of weteran arian gent well mrs shelfer i am astonished even i should never have been so silly poor old tom among the philistines well miss i began to feel very uneasy directly they was gone i thought they looked back so queerly and old tom was mewing so dreadful in the basket presently i began to hear a mewing out of the cupboard and a mewing out of the clock and even out of the drippingpan so i put on my bonnet as quick as i could and ran right away to the college and somehow or other by the time i got there i was in a fright all over as good luck would have it the man was at the gate a nice respectable married man and a friend of charleys curbs i says where is professor sallenders down in the country says he since last friday he never stops here at christmas mrs shelfer hes a deal too knowing for that my heart went pop miss like an oyster shell in the fire i held on by the door and i thought it was all up with me dont take on so missus says curbs if any of your museum is ill theres half a dozen clever young coves in the operating room over there only theyre busy just now cutting up a big black cat my eyes how he did squeal i screamed out and rancurbs thought i was mad and he was not far outbang went the door before me and there on the table with the lanternjawed young man flourishing a big knife over him there lay my precious old tom strapped down on his back with his mouth tied up in white tape and leather gloves over his feet and sticks trussed across him the same as a roasting rabbit and a streak of white all along his blessed stomachyou know miss he hadnt got one white hair by rightswhere the niggers had shaved and floured him to see what they were about he turned up his dear old eyes when he saw me it would have made you cry and he tried to speak oh you precious old soul didnt i scatter them right and left i scratched that lanternjawed hypocrites face till i gave him the hirumbillycuss and hirumtommycuss too i expect i called a policeman in and there wasnt one of them finished his christmas in london but the poor old soul has never been the same cat since the anxiety he was in turned his hair white on both sides of his heart and all round the backs of his ears he wouldnt come to the door he shook so at the call of the catsmeat man for better than a month and he wont look at it now while theres a skewer in it the poor little woman was crying with pity and rage old tom looked up all the time as if he knew all she said and then jumped on her lap and showed his paws and purred meanwhile a change had come over my intentions perhaps all the rudeness i had met with that day had called my pride into arms at any rate much as i liked pretty isola and much as i longed for her fresh warm kindness i now resolved to wait until she should choose to seek me so i did not even ask mrs shelfer whether she knew the college where the professor lectured what were love and warm young hearts to me i deserved such a rebuff for swerving so from my duty now i would give all my thoughts to the art whence only could spring any hope of attaining my end and the very next day i would follow the picturedealers advice chapter xiii there was a school of design not very far from my lodgings and thither i went the next morning my landlady offered to come with me and see me safe in the room and of course her charley who seemed to know everybody knew some one even there to whom she kindly promised to recommend me so i gladly accepted her offer in some respects mr shelfer was more remarkable than even his wife he was so shy that on the rare occasions when we met i never could get him to look at me except once when he was drunk yet by some mysterious process he seemed to know everything about methe colour of my eyes the arrangement of my hair the dresses i put on the spirits i was ina great deal more in fact than i ever cared to know so that sometimes my selfknowledge was largely increased through his observations repeated by his wife but i was not allowed to flatter myself that this resulted from any especial interest for he seemed to possess an equal acquaintance with the affairs of all his neighbours mention any one anywhere around and he without seeming to mean it would describe him or her unmistakably in half a dozen words he never praised or blamed he simply identified he must have seen more with a blink of his eye than most people see in five minutes of gazing he seldom brought any one home with him though he often promised to do so he never seemed to indulge in gossip at any rate not with his wife cut it short old ooman was all the encouragement he ever gave her in that way when he was at homea thing of rare occurrencehe sat with his head down and a long pipe in his mouth he walked in the street with his head down and never accosted any one where did he get all his knowledge i doubt if there were a publichouse in london but what shelfer knew at the furthest a cousin of the landlord and a brother of one of the potboys charley shelfer everybody called him and everybody spoke of him not with distinguished respect but with a kindly feeling his luck was proverbial he had a room full of things which he had won at raffles and he was in constant requisition to throw for less fortunate people as for his occupationhe called himself a nurseryman but he had no nursery that i could discover he received a pound a week for looking after the garden in the great square but when any one came for him he was never to be found there i think he spent most of his time in jobbing about and swopping as mrs shelfer called it among his brother gardeners sometimes he brought home beautiful plants perfectly lovely flowers unknown to me even by name and many of these he presented to me by mrs shelfers hands every sunday morning he was up before the daylight and away for an excursion or rather an incursion through the hampstead highgate and holloway district from these raids he used to return as i came home from the morning service by the way if i had wanted to puzzle him and find a blank in his universal acquaintance the best chance would have been to ask him about the clergyman he never gave the pewopeners any trouble neither indeed did mrs shelfer who called herself a catholic but the lively little womans chiefest terror was death and a parson to her was always an undertaker if mr shelfer had not spent the sunday morning quite so well as i had at any rate he had not wasted his time i think he must have robbed henroosts and allotment grounds and yet he was too respectable for that but whence and how could he ever have come by the gipsey collection he always produced from his hat from his countless pockets from his red cotton handkerchief every sunday at pm eggs chickens mushrooms sticks of horseradish and celery misletoethrushes cucumbers cabbages red and white rabbits watercress aylesbury ducksi cannot remember one quarter of his manifold forage all i can say is that if these things are to be found by the side of the road near london middlesex is a far better field for the student of natural history than gloucestershire or even beloved devon mrs shelfer said it was all his luck but i hardly think it could have rained aylesbury ducks even for mr shelfer all the time he was extracting from his recesses this multifarious store he never once smiled or showed any symptoms of triumph but gravely went through the whole as if a simple duty how was it such a man had not made his fortune because he had an incurable habit of backing bills for any one who asked him and hence he was always in trouble mrs shelfer and i were admitted readily into the school of design it was a long low room very badly lighted and fitted up for the time until a better could be provided it looked very cold and comfortless forms instead of chairs and desks like a parish school the whitewashed walls were hung with diagrams sections tracings reductions most of them stiff and ugly but no doubt instructive at one end was a raised platform reserved for lecturers and the higher powers shelves round the wall were filled with casts and models and books of instruction were to be had out of cupboards of course we were expected to bring our own materials and a code of rules was exhibited the more advanced students were permitted to tender any work of their own which might be of service to the neophytes from no one there did i ever receive any insolence at first the young artists used to look at me rather hard but my reserved and distant air was quite enough to discourage them after the introduction which mrs shelfer accomplished in very great style i dismissed her and set to in earnest to pore once more over the rudiments of perspective one simple truth as to the vanishing point struck me at once i was amazed that i had never perceived it before it was not set forth in the book i was studying but it was the sole key to all my errors of distance at once i closed the book upon that one subject i wanted no more instruction i had caught the focus of truth books like bad glass would only refract my perception all i wanted now was practice and adaptation of the eye strange as it seemed to me then i could draw no more that day i was so overcome at first sight by the simple beauty of truth mathematical yet poetical truth that error and obscurity for there is a balance in all things had their revenge for a while on my brain but the truth once seen could never be lost again thenceforth there were few higher penances for me in a small way than to look at one of my early drawings when my brain was clear i returned to do a real days work for the cups and vases and plates and things of aesthetic art as they chose to call it i did not care at all but the copies and models and figures were most useful to me unless i am much mistaken i made more advance in a fortnight there than i had in any year of my life before with my usual perseveranceif i have no other virtue i have thati worked away to correct my many shortcomings not even indulging much as i wanted the money in any attempts at a finished drawing until i felt sure that all my foundations were thoroughly laid and set and now i cried towards christmas now for mr oxgall if i dont astonish him this time my name is not clara vaughan it did me good when i was alone to call myself by my own name and my right to be my fathers daughter chapter xiv meanwhile old christmas was come and all i was worth in the world was change for half a sovereign true my lodgings were paid for a fortnight in advance because good mrs shelfer wanted to treat all her pets to a christmas dinner but as for my own christmas dinnerthough i cant say i cared much for itif i got one at all it must be upon credit since my drawing would not be finished for another week credit of course i would not think of any day in the week or year i would rather starve than owe money however i was not going to cry about plumpudding though once or twice it made me hungry to think of the dinner in the great hall at vaughan park on the christmas eve a much more elaborate matter in the old time than the meal served in the diningroom next day now i sat in my little room this dreary christmas eve and do what i would i could not help thinking a little it was a gusty evening cold and damp with scuds of sleet and snow as yet it had not made up its mind whether to freeze or thaw nevertheless the streets were full of merry laughing parties proud of their bargains for the christmas cheer and as they went by the misletoe and the holly glistened in the flickering gaslight for old recollections sake i had made believe to dress my little room with some few sprigs of laurel and unberried holly the sceptre branch all cobbed with coral beads was too expensive for me misletoe i wanted not who was there now to kiss me from the sheer craving of human nature for a word of kindness i had called that afternoon upon mrs elton but good as she was and sweet to me she had near relatives coming and i saw or fancied that i should be in the way yet i thought that her mother heart yearned toward me as she said good bye and showed me out by the christmas tree all trembling to be lighted now i sat alone and lonely by the flickering of three pennyworth of wood which i had bought recklessly for the sake of the big ashtree that used to glow with the lichen peeling round it on the old christmas hearth where i was believed the heiress the little spark and sputter of my sallow billet chopped by the poor old people at st pancras workhouse led me back through eight sad years to the last merry time when my father was keeping his latest christmas and i his pride and hope was prouder than all at being just ten years old how he carved and ladled the gravy how he flourished his knife and fork with a joke all hot for every one how he smiled when the thricehelped farmers sent for another slice and laughed when the crowboy was nearly choked with plumpudding how he patted me on the head and caught me for a kiss when i dressed up as headwaitress with my long hair all tied back pulled his right arm and pointed to widow hiatts platethe speech he made after dinner when i was amazed at his eloquence and clapped my little hands and the way he made me stand up on a chair and drink the queens health firstthen the hurrahs of the tenants and servants and how they kissed me outsideall this goes through my memory as the smoke of the billet goes up the chimney and the tears steal under my eyelids then i see the long hall afterwards with the tables cleared away and the lights hung round the tapestry and the yule log roaring afresh my father a type of the true english gentleman not of the past but the present century holding the hand of his wife a lady of no condescending airs but true womanly warmth and loveboth dressed for the tenants ball as if for the lordlieutenants both eager to lead off the country dance and beating their feet to the music next them a laughing child in a little white frock and pink slip scarce to be known for myself handinhand with my brave chevalier master roderick blount accounted by cooky and both ladysmaids and most of all by himself my duly affianced lord then the housekeeper starched beyond measure yet not too stiff to smile and open for the nonce even to jokes about courtship yielding her gracious hand for the dance to the senior tenant a man with great calves red face and snowwhite hair after them come hark a loud knock and a ring it is just in time before i begin the palinode who can want me tonight i want no one but those i cannot have whom the fire has now restored me though the earth has hidden them mrs shelfer is hard at work in the kitchen preparing a wonderful supper for charley who has promised to come home she has canvassed the chance of his keeping this promise fifty times in the day hope cries yes experience whispers no at any rate the knock is not his for he always carries a latchkey she calls up the stairs miss valence before she goes to the door for who knows but she might be murdered in the midst of her christmas pudding i come out to prove my existence and stand in the dark on the landing she draws back the bolt i hear a gruff voice as if it came through a hat young ooman by the name of clara waun live here yes to be sure miss valence you mean my good friend the name on this here ticket aint walence but waun all right my good friend all right its just the same hor i dont know that though jim the name of the party here aint waun after all it be walence and three blessed days us has been all over london jim from the top of the van suggests that after all walence and waun be much of a muchness for his part hell be blessed if hell go any further with it let him and ben look at the young lady and see if she be like the card meanwhile of course i come forward and claim the parcel whatever it is mrs shelfer redoubles her assurances and calls the man a great oaf which has more effect than anything why jim this must be charleys missus charley shelfers missus him as beat you so at skittles last week you know ah he did so and id like to back him again you ben for a quart all round this fact is decisive who can doubt any more but for all that the book must be signed in the name of waun with which of course i comply when the two strong men have with much difficulty of which they made much more lowered the enormous package from the van ben stands wiping his forehead lor how hot it be tonight to be sure and the job us has had with this big lump surely both the handles come off long ago i wish my missus had got a featherbed half the weight of that fiveandtwenty year ive been along of this company man and boy but i never see such a direction as that there in all my born days did ever you jim well replies jim ive seed a many queer ones but none as could come up to that and whod a thought after all their troublefor im blessed if they wrote that there under a weekwhod a thought theyd a put waun on it when they meant walence but the young lady is awaiting for us to drink her health ben and a

eightpence im blessed if they havent airned it now thank you miss and werry handsome on you and us hopes the contents will prove to your liking miss and make you a merry christmas away they go with the smoking horses after carrying into the little kitchen the mighty maun which mrs shelfer with my assistance could not stir bless me miss valence what a direction cries mrs shelfer when the full light falls upon it the direction was written in round hand upon a strip of parchment about four inches wide and at least eight feet in length it came from the bottom all up over the cover and down upon the other side so that no one could open the basket without breaking it asunder it was as follows miss clara vaughan lodges at number seven in prince albert street in london town near windsor castle in gloucestershire the daughter of mr henry valentine vaughan esquire a nice tall young lady her always wears black things and walks very peart pale with a little red on her cheeks when they lets her alone cant be no mistake without it be done a purpose if so be this here little maun haint brought to her safe and sweet and wholesome will be prosecuted with the utmost rigour of the law signed john huxtable his mark x witness timothy badcock hisn x i wondered much whether mr beany dawe had been called in to achieve this masterpiece of manuscript which was all in large round hand but without any stops it seemed beyond poor sallys art yet were some loops and downstrokes that must be dear little sallys i took it off with much troublethe parchment was joined in four placesand i have it now meanwhile mrs shelfer was dancing around it neglecting her supper in the wonder of this gigantic hamper let me get a chopper miss youll never get it open why its sewed as tight as an oyster however i did get it open at last and never shall i forget the contents there was a months food for a family of twelve first came hay such as i never smelt out of devonshire then eighteen rolls of butter each with a snowy cloth around it the butter so golden even at that time of year that mrs shelfer compared it to the yolk of an egg looking out of the white then a storey of clotted cream and beautiful lard and laver which they knew i loved then a floor of hay below it a pair of guinea fowls two large turkeys and most carefully wrapped from the rest a fine hare filled with dried sweet herbs below these a flitch of bacon two woodsmoked hams a pair of tongues a leg of exmoor mutton and three bottles of best elder wine then a brown paper parcel containing sallys last copybook i had set her copies for half a year to come and a long letter the first i had ever received from tossils barton when all was out at last after the greatest delight and laughter as each thing appeared i fell back in utter dismay at the spectacle before me mrs shelfer sat on the floor unable to find her way out she was so flounced and tippeted with good things when i came to her relief she did nothing but go round and round what was left of the little room humming a catholic hymn and pressing both hands to her side but something must be done at once waste is wickedness how could we stave it off everything would depend upon the weather at present all was beautifully fresh thanks to the skilful packing and the frost albeit the mighty package had made the round of all the albert streets in london mrs shelfer would have looked at it for a month and at intervals exclaimed bless me my good friend that beats charleys pockets how they must eat in devonshire come mrs shelfer what good are you at housekeeping you dont help me at all let us put most of it out of doors at once you have no cellar and i suppose they have none in london at least we can give it the chance of the open air and it is not snowing now oh but the cats miss well i must find some plan for them before we go to bed now come and help thats a good little creature and ill give you some elder wine when we have done so we got all that was taintable into the little yard while tom who never stole except when quite sure of impunity looked on very sagely there we fixed it all up to the wall secure except from cats of whom a roving band serenaded me every night i presented mrs shelfer at once with a turkeya specimen of natural history not found by the roadside even on mr shelfers sabbath journeyalso a ham and three rolls of butter as to the rest i would think what to do with it afterwards mrs shelfer kept off the cats until midnight after which i held them at bay by the following means with one of my mineral paints mingled with some phosphorus i drew upon a black board a ferocious terrier the size of life with fangs unsheathed bristles erect and eyes starting out of his head we tried the effect in the dark on poor tom who arched his back and sputtered with the strongest execration then turned and fled ignobly amid roars of laughter from mr shelfer who by this time was come home this oneheaded cerberus being hung so as to oscillate in the wind right across the catleap i felt quite safe so long as my chemical mixture should continue luminous chapter xv dear little sallys letter gave me the greatest delight it was all in round hand and had taken at least a week to write and she must have washed her hands almost every time there were no stops in it but i have put some the spelling was wonderfully good for her but here and there i have shaped it to the present fashion please miss clara dear father and mother and i begs their most respectable duty and love and they hopes no offence

settle by the fire john huxtable his mark x honor huxtable hern x chapter xvi i was much grieved at the loss of my last letter to tossils barton because it contained my little christmas presents for all the family it was registered for security but i suppose they took no count of that where the delivery of letters depended so much upon luck of their christmas present to me i resolved to give the surplus to those who would be the better for it and not according to the usual law of such things to those who did not want it and would make return with interest so on the christmas morning mrs shelfer and myself each carrying a large basket went to the mews round the corner and distributed among the poor lodgers there more christmas dinners than had ever entered those doors before and how grateful the poor things were only they all wanted the best now the school of design was closed for a while and i worked hard for several days at the landscape for mr oxgall though the store of provisions sent me and the rent enclosed in the turkey had saved me from present necessity on the day of all days in the year the saddest and darkest to me i could not keep to my task but went for a change of thoughts to the school now open again it was the th of december and though i crouch not to the mumming of prigs scolloped out at the throat who block out with a patchwork screen the simple hearth of religion and kneel at an ashbin to warm themselves though i dont care a herring for small anniversaries dotted all over the calendar and made by some murphy of old yet i reverence deeply the true feasts of church and chapel the refreshings of faith and charity whereupon we forgive and are sorry for those who work hard to mar them neither does it seem to meso far as my timid and wavering judgment extendsto be superstition or vanity if we dare to set mark by those dates in our own little span which god has scarred on our memory in the long dark room so bare and comfortless and today so lonely and cold i got my usual books and studies and tried all in vain to fix my attention on them finding the effort so fruitless i packed up my things in the little black bag and rose to depart turning round i saw on the table where students works were exhibited a small object newly placed there it was a statuette in white marble of a magnificent red deer such as i had seen once or twice in the north of devon the listening attitude the turn of the neck the light poise of the massive head even the mild yet spirited eye and the quivering sensitive lip i could answer for them all they were done to the very life truth power and elegance triumphed in every vein of it for a minute i stood overcome with wonder if this were the work of a youthful sculptor england might hope at last for something beyond the grotesque before me rose at once all the woodland scenery the hillside garbed with every shade of green the brambled quarry standing forth the trees the winding vales embosoming the light the haze that hovers above the watersmeet bold crests of amaranth heath behind and far away the russet wold of exmoor the stag in the foreground of my landscape i feel so grateful to him for this expanse of vision that i stoop down and kiss him while no one can see me as i bend the gordit drops from its warm home in my breast by some impulse undefined i lift the ribbon from my neck and hang the little fairys heart on the antlers of the devonshire deer out springs from behind a chest full of casts and modelswhat model can compare with herthe loveliest of all lovely beings my little isola ross i hide the tears in my eyes and try to look cold and reserved what use is it one smile of hers would have disarmed belial it isnt my fault dear it isnt indeed oh please give me that cordetto no dont that is why i loved you so at first sight and here is all my money dear i have carried it about ever since though i sewed up the purse not to spend it and only once cut it open they made me promise and i would not eat for three days and i tried to be sulky with pappy because he did not care they made me promise with all my honour not to go and see you and cora came about with me so that i had no chance of breaking it and i would not tell them where you lived dear but i led old cora a dance through your street on the side you live till she began to suspect but i could never see you though i looked in at all the windows till i was quite ashamed and the people kissed their hands to me poor little dear i lived upstairs and could not have seen her without standing out on the balcony which was about the size of a chessboard if she had not been so simple as to walk on my side of the street she must have seen me ere long for i sat all day near the window to draw when i was not away at my school i forgave her most graciously for having done me no wrong and kissed her with all my heart her breath was as sweet as violets in spring clover and her lips warm and soft as a wrens nest on receiving my forgiveness away she went dancing down the long room with her cloak thrown off and her hair tossing all out of braid and her exquisite buoyant figure floating as if on a cloud of course there was no one there or even impulsive isola would hardly have taken her frolic and yet i am not sure she never thought harm of any one and never imagined that any one could think harm of her after a dozen flits of some rapid elegant dance quite unknown to me who have never had much of dancing but which i supposed to be scotch back she came out of breath and kissed me ever so many times and kissed my gordit too and told me never to part with it one thing she was sure of that her papa could not resist me now and when he was told of it i should come to their house the next day and she knew i was dreadfully proud but would i for her sake forgive her pappy of course he knew nothing about me and she had never told him my name though she could not help telling my story at least all she knew of it but he was so dreadfully jealous of her he did not want any one to have a touch of her glove but himself looking at her pure sweet face i could well believe it but how could he bear to see that dear little thing go three days without food most likely she had exaggerated although she was truthful as light sometimes her quick fancy and warmth like the sunshine itself would bring out some points too strongly however i was prepared without that to dislike the professor for as a general rule i dont like men who moralise at least if their philosophy is frigid nevertheless i promised very readily to forgive her papa for i did so love that isola her nature was so different to mine so light and airy elastic and soft in short if i must forsake my language the complement of my own we chatted or rather she did for at least half an hour and then she told me old cora was coming to fetch her at three oclock once more i rose to depart for i feared she might get into trouble if the old nurse should find her so intimate with a stranger but isola told me that she did not care for her a bit and she had quite set her heart on my meeting her brother conrad the sculptor of that magnificent stag perhaps he would come with cora but he was so altered now she could never tell what he would do since the time she first saw me conrad had come of age and she could not guess what it was all about but there had been a dreadful disturbance between him and his father and he had actually gone to live away from the family she thought it must be about money or some such nasty thing but even cora did not know or if she did the old thing would not tell it had made poor isola cry till her eyes were sore but now she supposed she must make up her mind to it all but she would tell the truth she did hate being treated like a baby when she was a fullgrown woman how much taller did they expect her to be and what was much worse she did want so to comfort them both and how could she do it without knowing what was the matter it was too bad and she wished she was a boy with all her heart she did she went on talking like this till her gentle breast fluttered and her coral lips quivered and the tears stole down her long lashes and she crept to me closer for comfort i was clasping her round little waist and kissing the bright drops away when in burst a dark scraggy woman who must of course be old cora she tore the poor child from my arms and scowled at me fiercely enough to frighten a girl unacquainted with real terrors i met her dark gaze with a calm contempt beneath which it quailed and fell she mumbled some words in a language or patois which i supposed to be gaelic and led off her charge towards the door she had mistaken her adversary was i to be pushed aside like a gingerbread woman tempting a weakstomached child i passed them then turned and confronted the hag have the goodness old woman to walk behind this young lady and me when we want your society we will ask for it isola ross come with me unless you prefer a rude menials tyranny to a ladys affection isola was too frightened to speak i know not what would have been the result if the old hag who was glaring about rather taken aback but still clutching that delicate arm had not suddenly spied my fairys heart as yet unrestored to its sanctuary she stared for a moment in wide amazement then her whole demeanour was altered she cringed and fawned and curtseyed as if i had worn a tiara she dropped my dear isolas arm and fell behind like a negress my poor little pet was trembling and cold with fright for as she told me afterwards she had never seen old cora in such a passion before and the superstitious darling dreaded the evil eye as we went towards isolas home i could not help thinking how fine the interview would be between mrs shelfer and cora if i only chose to carry that vanquished beldame thither but sage discretion was i not now eighteen and the thought of that solemn day prevented me so i took them straight home leading isola while she guided me and turning sometimes with complacency to encourage old cora behind us the house they lived in was a high but narrow one dulllooking and dark with area rails in front some little maiden came to the door and i took my leave on the steps dear isola now in high spirits again kissed me like a peach quite warm in the sun and promised to come the next day about which there could now be no difficulty old cora bent low as she wished me good evening and begged leave to kiss my cordetto this i granted but took good care not to let it pass out of my hands she admired it so much especially when allowed to examine it and there was such a greedy light in her eyes that i was quite sure she would steal it upon the first chance and therefore i went straightway and bought a guard of thick silk cord as a substitute for the black riband which was getting worn and so i came home before dark full of wonder but feeling rather triumphant and greatly delighted at having recovered dear isola end of vol i london r clay son and taylor printers bread street hill

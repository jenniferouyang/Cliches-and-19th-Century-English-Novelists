the meeting xlvi the discovery xlvii the final proof xlviii the last introduction the top heavy four horsed yellow old coach from vicenza which arrived at padua every night of the year brought with it in particular on the night of october a tall personable young man an englishman in a dark blue cloak who swang briskly down from the coupe and asked in stilted italian for la sapienza del signer dottor' lanfranchi from out of a cloud of steam for the weather was wet and the speaker violently hot a husky voice replied eccomi eccomi a servirla the young man took off his hat and bowed have i the honour to salute so much learning he asked courteously let me present myself to my preceptor as mr francis strelley of upcote his servant said the voice from the cloud and servant of his illustrious father don francis be accommodated let your mind be at ease your baggage these fellows are here for it your valise i carry it your hand i take it follow me these words were accompanied by action of the most swift and singular kind mr strelley saw two porters scramble after his portmanteaux had his valise reft from his hand and that hand firmly grasped before he could frame his reply the vehemence of this large perspiring sage caused the struggle between pride and civility to be short such faint protests as he had at command passed unheeded in the bustle and could not be seen in the dark vehement indeed in all that he did was dr porfirio lanfranchi professor of civil law it was astonishing that a bulk so large and loosely packed could be propelled by the human will at so headlong a speed yet spurred by that impetus alone he pounded and splashed through the puddled half lit street of padua at such a rate that mr strelley though longer in the leg fully of his height and one quarter his weight found himself trotting beside his conductor like any schoolboy the position was humiliating but it did not seem possible to escape it the doctor took everything for granted and besides he so groaned and grunted at his labours his goaded flesh protested so loudly the pitfalls were so many and the pace so severe that nothing in the world seemed of moment beyond preserving foothold along the winding way between the half discerned arcades palace gateways black entries church portals down the very middle of the street flew master and pupil without word spoken they reached the pra skirted its right hand boundary for some hundreds of yards and came to the door of a tall narrow white house upon this door the doctor kicked furiously until it was opened then with a malediction upon the oaf who snored behind it up he blundered three stairs at a time strelley after him whether or no and stayed not in his rush towards the stars until he had reached the fourth floor landing where again he kicked at a door and then releasing his victim's hand took off hat and wig together and mopped his dripping pate as he murmured chaste madonna what a ramble what a stroll for the evening powerful mother of us all such a stroll had never yet been taken by mr francis strelley of upcote in his one and twenty years' experience of legs nor did he ever forget this manner of being haled into italy nor lose his feeling of extremely helpless youth in the presence of the doctor his tutor and guardian but to suppose the business done by calculation of that remarkable man is to misapprehend him altogether dr lanfranchi's head worked as his body did by flashes he calculated nothing but hit at everything hit or miss it might be but let's to it and have done was his battle cry the lamp over the door of his apartment revealed him for the disorderly genius he was a huge blotch faced tumble bellied man bullet headed bull necked and with flashing eyes inordinate alike in appetite mind and action he was always suffering for his furies and always making a fine recovery just now he was at the last gasp for a breath or so you would have said to look at him but not so his exertions were really his stimulant presently he would eat and drink consumedly drench himself with snuff and then spend half the night with his books preparing for to morrow's lecture of this sort was dr porfirio lanfranchi who had more authority over the wild students of padua than the chancellor vice chancellor and senate put together the same lamp played upon the comely and ingenuous face upon the striking presence of mr strelley and showed him a good looking good tempered sanguine young man of an appearance something less than his age he was tall and supple wore his own fair hair tied with a ribbon was blue eyed and bright lipped and had a notable chin firm square at the jaw and coming sharply to a point he looked you straight in the face such was his habit but by no means arrogantly or with defiance seriously rather gravely and courteously as if to ask do i take your precise meaning to be such a look was too earnest for mere good manners he was serious there was no laughter in him though he was not of a melancholy sort he pondered the world and its vagaries and examined them as they presented themselves in each case upon the merits this which was i think his strongest characteristic should show that he lacked the humorous sense and he did he had no time to laugh wondering engaged him the life of the world on its round showed him miracles daily he looked for them very often but more frequently they thrust themselves upon him sunrise now what an extraordinary thing he never ceased to be amazed at that the economy of the moon too so exquisitely adapted to the needs of mankind nations tongues hardly to be explained by the sublime folly of a babel the reverence paid to elders to women the sense of law and justice in our kind in the leafy shades of upcote in oxfordshire he had pondered these things during his lonely years of youth and adolescence had pondered and in some cases already decided them upon the merits this was remarkably so in the matter of betty coy as he will tell you for himself before long meantime lest i keep dr lanfranchi too long upon the threshold of his own house all i shall add to my picture of his pupil now is that he was the eldest son and third child of squire antony strelley of upcote a catholic non juring recusant stout old gentleman of oxfordshire and of dame mary born arundell his wife and that he was come to study the moral and civil law at this famous university of padua like many an englishman of his condition before him he was twenty one years of age had as much money as was good for him and much more poetry than enough in his valise to say nothing of the germ of those notes from which he afterwards long afterwards compiled the ensuing memoirs dr lanfranchi had not said accidente more than twice nor kicked his door more than half a dozen times before it was opened by a young and pretty lady who held a lamp above her head she was apparently a very young and very pretty rather little lady and was dressed with some care but not more than her person deserved in black and white her dark hair which was high upon her head was crowned with a large tortoiseshell comb she held the lamp as i say above her as she curtseyed smiling in the way be very welcome sir she said and be pleased to enter our house it was charming to see how deftly she dipped without spilling the lamp oil charming to see her little white teeth as she smiled her lustrous eyes shining in the light like large stars it was charming to see her there at all for she was charming altogether in figure in face and poise in expression which was that of a graceful child playing housewife lastly in the benevolence curiosity and discretion which sat enthroned upon her smooth brow like a bench of lords justices or of bishops if you prefer it this was none other than dr porfirio's wife as he then and there declared by grunts mia moglie a servirla he was understood to say and pushed his way into his house without ceremony while mr strelley with much kissed the hand of his hostess the salute received with composure was rendered with a blush for this to be truthful was the very first hand ever saluted by the young gentleman the fact says much for his inexperience and right instinct at once quite at her ease as if she were the mistress of a well kissed hand was signora aurelia lanfranchi for that was her name and had been so for rather more than two years quite at her ease and most anxious to put strelley there relieving him of his cloak and hat of his sword pistols and other travelling gear in spite of all protestations on his part she talked freely and on end about anything and nothing in a soft voice which rose and died down like a summer wind and betrayed in its muffled tones as if it came to him through silk that she was not of the north but of some mellower more sun ripened land she was in fact of siena a gualandi by birth and extremely proud of it strelley was so informed before he had been four and twenty hours in her company but now having spoiled him of his defences she invited him into the salone wooed him thither indeed with that sidelong head and sort of sleek smile with which you coax a cat to come to your knee mr francis would have followed her singing to the bonfire on such terms at the table which was liberal was the learned doctor seated already napkin to chin mr strelley was shown his place and expected to take it while the fair housewife waited upon the two and when he seemed timid she raised a wail of pretty protest and dragged him by the arm towards the chair it was absurd it was preposterous he was robbing her of her pride she had eaten long ago besides it was the woman's place and nonna was in the kitchen ashamed to appear in the state she was in signor francesco must please her in this she would be vexed and surely he would not vex his hostess to this wilful chant the doctor contributed his burden of che che s'accommodi and rapped with his knife handle upon the table old nonna toothless bearded and scared popped her head beyond the kitchen door to be short insistence went to a point where good manners could not follow mr francis sat himself down and donna aurelia clapping her little hands cried aloud that victory was hers quick quick nonna these signori are at table she stormed into the kitchen and speedily returned with a steaming and savoury dish she dispensed the messes she poured the wine she hovered here and there salt pepper cheese yet a little bread madonna purissima she had forgotten the mustard no it was here it was here there must have been more rejoicings over the recovery of the mustard than were made for the victory of lepanto betweenwhiles she talked gaily or pathetically or intimately of things of which the guest had known nothing but immediately felt that he now knew all the moral lapses of this professor or that the unparalleled slight offered to signora pappagallo by donna susanna tron the storm of rain and thunder on tuesday week no it must have been monday week a scandal in the senate a duel in the pra how the avvocato minghini was picked up dead in pedrocchi's a meat fly in his chocolate sparkling eyes a delicate flush quick breath a shape at once pliant and audacious flashing hands with which half her spells were woven all these and that wailing dragging comico tragic voice that fatal appeal of the child trained by the wisdom of the wife completed the rout of our youth before supper was over he was her loyal slave she insisted upon showing him his quarters they were not it seemed upon this floor nor the next below no but on the next below that signor francesco must follow her as lamp in hand she went downstairs her high heels clattering like spanish castanets she opened his door with a key which she then handed over to him she showed him his bedroom his saloon your citadel don francis she said your refuge from my heedless tongue your chocolate shall be brought to you here but we hope you will give yourself the trouble to dine with us generally my husband sups too late for your convenience he is always at the cafe till nine o'clock he sits there with his friends and hears the news which he knows beforehand as well as they do and when they have done he tells it all over again to them this is the way with men and i sit at home and make my clothes this also is the way with women it seems there is no other she stayed a few more minutes chattering laughing and blushing then with a sudden access of shyness wished him felicissima notte and held him out her hand mr francis stooped over it and saluted it once more with profound respect he was long in going to bed he wrote furiously in his diary after a space of restless contemplation when he roamed across and across the room but now i must leave his raptures and himself to his own pen having got him inmate of a household where by ordinary he might have lived a blameless three years if however he had done that i don't suppose the singular memoirs which follow would ever have been written chapter i my exordium a justificatory piece if we soberly reflect upon the part which the trappings and mantlings of men have played in their affairs we shall not hesitate i believe to put into that category many things which have hitherto been considered far less occasional what is honour but a garment what money but a walking stick what are fine manners but a wig if i professed instead of abhorring the cynic school of philosophy i might go on to ask what were love but an ointment or religion but a tinted glass i can thank my redeemer as i sit here in my green haven with the stormy sea of my troubles afar off beating in vain against the walls of contentment that through all my vicissitudes i was never tempted to stray into such blasphemous imaginations fool as i have been and fool as i have declared myself upon the forefront of this very book i have never said in my heart there is no god but much and loudly have maintained the affirmative and although i have been sadly wickedly detestably errant from his way there is one divine precept which i have never failed to keep and that is love one another all other affections additions accidents accessories of men however from the lowest which is money to the highest which is polite education i have been able to discard without concern or loss of self respect this fact alone should furnish good reason for my memoirs and commend them to the philosopher the poet the divine and the man of feeling for true it is that i have been bare to the shirt and yet proved my manhood beaten like a thief and yet maintained myself honest scorned by men and women and yet been ready to serve my fellows held atheist by the godly and yet clung to my saviour's cross in situations calculated to excite the contemptuous ridicule of the meanest upon earth i have been satisfied that i was neither contemptible nor reasonably ridiculous and that while i might herd with ruffians and find in their society my most comfortable conversation i was the richer partly for that i had lost in choosing to consort with them and partly for what i had gained as having nothing yet possessing all things as poor yet making many rich the boast of st paul the hope of st francis of assisi in those pithy antitheses is the summa of my experience eldest son but third child of my parents i was born upon the th of october in the year and for that reason and another to which i shall shortly allude was named francis after the great champion of our faith commemorated upon my birthday the other reason was that oddly enough my mother before my birth had dreamed of him so persistently and with particulars so unvaried that she gave my father no option but to change the settled habits of our family and bestow upon me the name which he despised of a patriarch whom he underrated her dream repeated she told me with exact fidelity and at regularly recurring periods was that she could see st francis standing on a wide sea shore between sand dunes and the flood of waters standing alone there with an apple in his hand which he held lightly as if weighing it by and by said my mother she saw three women come slowly over the sandhills from different points one from the south one from the north and one from the west but they converged as they drew near to st francis joined hands and came directly to him the midmost of the three was like a young queen she on the side nearest the sea was bold and meagre the third was lovely but disfigured by a scar when they were come before st francis after reverences they knelt down on his right hand and his left and the queenly woman in front of him to her courteously he first offered the apple but she laughingly refused it she of the scar when it was held before her covered her face with her hands and shrank away but the hardy woman craned her head forward and bit into the apple while it was yet in the saint's hand then the young queen would have had it if she might but was prevented by the biter and the two clamoured for it silently by gestures of the hands and eyes but with haste and passion at this point said my mother her dream always ended and she never knew who had the apple she fretted greatly because of it and was hardly recovered after i was born my father who disliked all women except my mother and catholic as he was had scant respect for the mendicant orders hated this dream hated to be reminded of it hated the name which he had been persuaded into giving me and as a consequence i believe never loved me for unnumbered generations of our family we had been antonys gerards ralphs martins the name of francis was unknown to the tree he never ceased to inveigh against it and foretold the time when it would stand out like a parasite upon its topmost shoot your italian ecstatic he told my mother began life by running away from his father and only came back for the purpose of robbing him he taught more people to live by singing hymns than ever were taught before and preached the virtues of poverty by which he intended the comfort it was for the blessed poor to be kept snugly idle by the accursed rich it never occurred to him to reflect that if everybody had been of his opinion everybody would have starved the world would have stood still and neither st ferdinand of spain nor st edward the confessor nor don john of austria could have become famous as for your women and apples the conjunction is detestable cain was the result of one woman's desire for an apple and the siege of troy that of another's i don't wish this boy to grow up either murderer or pretty paris the like of this speech often repeated indeed never omitted when so i happened to fall into some childish disgrace may be imagined it made an outcast of me an exile from my nursery days i grew up lonely sullen moody i could not meet my father with any comfort to either of us and though i loved my mother and she me that cold shadow of his prejudice seemed to be over my intercourse with her to chill and check those emotions which should glow naturally when a son stands in the presence of his mother to be brief i was an unhappy solitary lad with sisters much older and brothers much younger than himself cut off too by reason of religion from the society of neighbours from school and college such companions as i could have were far below me in station and either so servile as to foster pride or so insolent as to inflame it there was father danvers it's true that excellent jesuit and our chaplain and there were books i was by nature a strong healthy active boy but was driven by sheer solitariness to be studious if it had not turned out so i know not what might have become of me at what untimely age i might have been driven to violence crime god knows what that there was danger of some such disaster father danvers was well aware my faults as he did not fail to remind me week by week were obstinacy and pride of intellect my weaknesses lack of proportion and what he was pleased to call perversity by which i suppose he meant a disposition to accept the consequences of my own acts i freely admit a personal trait which will be obvious as i proceed trivial as it may seem and does at this time of writing i must record an instance of it the last i was to exhibit in england never vicious i may sincerely say convinced rather that women are as far above our spiritual as they are fatally within our material reach it was by my conduct to a woman that i fell into a way of life which nobody could have anticipated in my twentieth year in a moment of youthful ardour i kissed betty coy our dairymaid over the cheese press and was as immediately and as utterly confounded as she was i remember the moment i remember her a buxom fresh coloured young woman rosy red her sleeves above her elbows her la mr francis what next i remember all even to my want of breath suddenly cooled passion perplexity and flight it is a moot point whether that last was the act of a coward but i can never allow it to be said that in what followed i showed a want of courage i devoted a day and night to solitary meditation no knight errant of old watching his arms under the moon prayed more earnestly than i and when i had fully made up my mind to embrace what honour demanded of me i sought out the girl who was again in the dairy and in solemn form upon my knees offered her my hand father danvers walking the terrace was an accidental witness of my declaration and very properly told my father betty coy unfortunate girl was dismissed that evening next day my father sent for me footnote i need only say further of betty that she shortly afterwards married james bunce our second coachman at upcote and bore him a numerous progeny of whose progress and settlement in the world i was able to assure the worthy parents it would be idle to rehearse the interview between an angry father and an obdurate son the more i said the angrier he got the discrepancy between us made a reasonable conclusion hopeless from the first when he cried did i mean to disgrace my name and i replied no but on the contrary i had been wishful to redeem it how you fool said he by marrying a dairymaid sir i answered by showing to the world that when a gentleman salutes a virtuous female it is not his intention to insult her i was too old for the rod or i should have had it as it was i received all the disgrace he could put me to dismissed from his presence confined to my room forbidden any society but that of father danvers and my own thoughts my infatuation however persisted and threatened to take the dangerous form of fraud i could not for the life of me see what else i could do to recover the girl's fair fame hopelessly compromised by me than exhibit to the world at large the only conceivable motive of my salute i knew immediately i had done it that i could not love betty coy but i believed that i could prove the tender husband correspondence to this effect all on my side with her parents decided mine to hasten my removal abroad it had always been intended that i should study in padua rather than in paris or salamanca if for no better reason than that that had been father danvers' university and that he knew many of the professors there among others dr porfirio lanfranchi who became my host and guardian and had been class mate and room mate of our chaplain's these things matter very little i was not consulted in them and had no objections as i had no inclinations for any particular residence in the world before my twenty first birthday i forget the exact date the hour arrived when i received on my knees my mother's tearful blessing embraced my brothers and sisters kissed my father's hand and departed for oxford where i caught the london mail and after a short sojourn in the capital left england for ever i conceive that few further prolegomena are necessary to the understanding of the pages which follow before i touched the italian soil i was in the eyes of our law a grown man sufficiently robust and moderately well read i was able to converse adequately in french tolerably in italian had a fair acquaintance with the literatures of those countries some latin a poor stock of greek i believe that i looked younger than my age stronger than my forces better than my virtues warranted women have praised me for good looks which never did me any good that i know of i may say without vanity that i had the carriage and person of a gentleman i was then as i have ever been truly religious though i have sometimes found myself at variance with the professional exponents of it in later years i became i believe something of a mystic apt to find the face of god under veils whose quality did not always commend itself to persons of less curious research on the other hand i do not pretend to have kept the decalogue of moses in its integrity but admit that i have varied it as my occasions seemed to demand i have slain my fellow man more than once but never without deliberate intention so to do if i have trespassed with king david of israel i feel sure that the circumstances of my particular offence are not discreditable to me and it is possible that he had the same conviction for the rest i have purposely discarded many things which the world is agreed to think highly necessary to a gentleman but which i have proved to be of no value at all i will only add this one observation more for my unparalleled misfortunes in every kind of character and dangerous circumstance i am willing to admit that i have nobody to thank but myself and yet but the reader must be judge i do not see how in any single case i could have acted otherwise than as i did what then we carry our fates with us from the cradle to the grave even as the spinning women themselves wind that which was appointed them to wind and ply the shears and make fruitless their toil when they must and all that we acquire upon our journey does but make that burden more certainly ours what was i but a predestined wanderer and fool if you will burdened with my inheritance of honourable blood of religion of candour and of unprejudiced enquiry how under the sun could i but let the reader be judge i left england early in september made a good passage to genoa and from thence proceeded by easy stages to padua arriving there by the coach on the night of october i was met by my host and tutor dr porfirio lanfranchi and by him taken to his lodgings on the pra della valle and introduced to the charitable ministrations of his young and beautiful wife the fair the too fair donna aurelia with whom i shall not disguise from the reader i fell romantically and ardently in love chapter ii aurelia and the doctor it was i know very well the aim and desire of this beautiful lady to approve herself mother to the exile thus cast upon her hands and it was so as much by reason of her innate charity as of her pride in her husband's credit to blame an ambition so laudable would be impossible nor is blame intended to lie in recording the fact that she was a year my junior though two years a wife such was the case however and it did not fit her for the position she wished to occupy nor indeed did her beauties of person and mind unless a childish air and sprightly manner cloudy dark hair a lovely mouth and bosom of snow a caressing voice and candour most surprising because most innocent can be said to adapt a young lady to be mother to a young man be these things as they may inflaming arrows full of danger shafts of charity pious artillery as you will they were turned full play upon me from the first moment of my seeing her she set herself to put me at ease to make me an intimate of her house to make herself i may say in no wrong sense an inmate of my heart and god knoweth god knoweth how she succeeded aurelia impossibly fair inexpressibly tender and wise with that untaught wisdom of the child daughter of pure religion as i saw thee at first and can see thee still can that my first vision of thee ever be effaced nay but it is scored too deeply in my heart is too surely my glory and my shame still i can see that sweet stoop of thy humility still thy hands crossed upon thy lovely bosom still fall under the spell of thy shyly welcoming eyes and be refreshed while i am stung by the gracious greeting of thy lips sia il ben venuto signer francesco saidst thou alas what did i prove to thee unhappy one but il mal venuto the herald of an evil hour what did i offer thee in exchange for thy bounty but shame and salt tears what could be my portion but fruitless reproach and footsore pilgrimage from woe to woe but i forget myself i am not yet to disinter these unhappy days it is not to be supposed from this apostrophe that when i fell at once to love my master's wife i saw in her more than my lamp and my saint the gracious presence which should imparadise in dante's phrase my mind i was an honest lad very serious and very simple perhaps i was a fool but i was a pure fool and he had been a very monster of depravity who could have cast unwholesome regard upon a welcome so generous and modest as hers i declare that she was never anything to me but a holy emanation not to be approached but on the knees not to be looked upon but through a veil so from this page until near the end of my long history she will appear to the reader i never had an unworthy thought of her never an unworthy desire i never credited her with more than charity towards myself and if i gloried in the fact that i was privileged to love so wondrous a being the thought humiliated me at the same time i was conscious of my nothingness before her worthiness and desperate to fit myself for her high society a noble rage for excellence possessed me like any champion or knight of old i strove to approve my manhood only that i might lay the spoils of it at her sacred feet by origin aurelia was a sienese the daughter of the ancient noble but reduced family of gualandi and had without knowing it caught the fancy of dr lanfranchi when he was in her native city upon some political question or another at the age of eighteen she had been made the subject of a marriage treaty between her mother and this learned man of fifty a treaty conducted by correspondence and without any by or with your leave of hers it may be doubted whether she had done much more than see and quiz her husband until she was brought to his house to be mistress of that and slave of its master doing violence to the imaginations of a lover i can look back upon her now with calmness and yet see no flaw upon her extraordinary perfections i can still see her lovely in every part a bright glancing various creature equally compounded of simplicity and common sense her greatest charm was precisely what we call charm a sweetly willing pliant disposition an air of gay seriousness such as a child has and a mood which could run swiftly at the touch on some secret spring from the ripple of laughter to the urgency of tears she was very devout but not at all in our way who must set our god very far off if we are to consider his awful nature she carried her gaiety with her into church and would laugh in the face of the blessed virgin or our saviour just as freely as in that of the greatest sinner of us all her carriage and conversation with heaven were indeed exactly those which she held towards the world and were such that it was impossible not to love her and yet for an honest man who desired to remain one equally impossible to do it for although she was made in shape line and feature to be a man's torment and delight she carried her beauties so easily valued them so staidly and considered them so unaffectedly her husband's property that he would have been a highway thief who had dared anything against her here indeed was to be reckoned with that quality of strong common sense without which she had been no tuscan girl she had it in a remarkable degree as you may judge when i say that it reconciled her to her position of wife to a vast disorderly tyrannical man nearly old enough to be her grandfather it enabled her to weigh the dignity ease and comfort of the casa lanfranchi against any romantic picture which a more youthful lover could paint before her eyes i am convinced the conviction was it will be seen forced upon me that not only was she a loyal obedient and cheerful but also a loving wife to this huge and blusterous person of whom nevertheless she was a good deal afraid for if he fondled her more than was becoming he stormed at her also in a way not tolerable when dr lanfranchi met me on my arrival i remember that he took my hand in his own and never let go of it until he had me in his house this made me feel like a schoolboy and i never lost the feeling of extreme youth in his eyes i believe now that his terrific silence his explosive rages mock ceremoniousness and startling alternations were all parts of his method towards his pupils for my experiences of them were not peculiar i have seen him cow a whole class by a lift of his great square head and most certainly whatever scandalous acts may have disgraced the university in my time they never occurred where dr lanfranchi was engaged burly bulky blotched as he was dirty in his person and in his dress careless to the point of scandal he had the respect of every student of the bo he was prodigiously learned and a great eater the amount of liquid he could absorb would pass belief it used to be said among us that he drank most comfortably like a horse out of a bucket his lectures were extraordinary crammed with erudition which proceeded from him by gasps jerks and throttled cries for mercy on his failing breath and illustrated by personalities of the most shocking description he spared no deformity or defect of any one of us if it happened to engage his eye sometimes a whole hour's lecture would be consumed in a scandalous tale of rome or naples sometimes indeed it would be a reminiscence of his own youthful days which policy if not propriety should have counselled him to omit yet as i say he never lost the respect of the class but was feared served and punctually obeyed it was much the same at home that is his methods and their efficacy were the same in private life he was an easy rough facetious companion excessively free in his talk excessively candid in the expression of his desires and with a reserve of stinging repartee which must have been more blessed to give than to receive terrible storms of rage possessed him at times under which the house seemed to rock and roll which sent his sweet wife cowering into a corner but though she feared him she respected and loved the man and i was to find that out to my cost before my first year was out meantime that year of new experience uplifting love and growth by inches must ever remain wonderful to me with aurelia's music in my ears and love's wild music in my heart happy happy days of my youth dichosa edad y siglos dichosos aquellos a quien los antiguos pusieron nombre de dorados cried the knight of la mancha and i may call that paduan year my age of song it ran its course to the sound of flutes harps and all sweet music i never knew until i knew aurelia that such exulting tides of melody could pour from human throat when aurelia rose in the morning and threw open her green shutters if the sunlight was broad upon the pra flecked upon the trees striking the domes and pinnacles of the santo with fire she sang full diapason with that careless fling of the voice that happy rapture that bravura which makes the listener's heart go near to burst with her joy if rain made the leaves to droop or scudded in sheets along the causeways she sang plaintively the wounded aggrieved hurt notes of the nightingale her song then would be some old remembered sorrow of her land of ginevra degli almieri the wandering wife of the donna lombarda who poisoned her lover or of the countess costanza's violated vow so she shared confidences with the weather and so unbosomed herself to nature and to god meantime she was as busy as a nesting bird she made her doctor's chocolate and took it in to him with the gazette or the news sheet she would darn a hole in my stocking on my leg without pricking me at all look me over brush me re tie my hair pat me into order with a critical eye and send me off to my classes or study with a sage counsel to mind my books and a friendly nod over her shoulder as we each went our ways she would go to mass at the santo to market in the piazza she would cheapen a dress length chat with a priest admonish old nonna the woman of the house all before seven o'clock in the morning and not before then would she so much as sip a glass of coffee or nibble a crust of bread on sundays and festas she took her husband's arm and went to church as befitted wearing her glazed gown of silver grey her black lace zendado she took a fan as well as a service book and happy was i to carry them for her she had lace mittens on her hands and a fine three cornered hat on her head she looked then what she truly was the thrifty young housewife who if she was as lovely as the summer's dawn was so only by the way and thrifty she proved herself for when she had kneeled and crossed herself twice towards the altar she pulled up the shining silk gown all about her middle and sat down upon her petticoat exquisite fragrant piteous aurelia is it wonderful that i loved her and who was i o heaven what sort of lover was i to disturb her sweetly ordered life to that i must next address myself cost me what it may chapter iii my dangerous progress i was fairly diligent during my year of study at padua fairly punctual in attendance at my classes and lectures fairly regular in my letter writing home i acquired no vices though there were plenty to be got was not a wine bibber a spendthrift nor a rake i was too snug in the casa lanfranchi to be tempted astray and any truantry of mine from the round of my tasks led me back to aurelia and love to beat up the low quarters of the town to ruffle in the taverns and chocolate houses with sham gentlemen half frocked abbes and rips to brawl and haggle with vile persons and their bullies set cocks a fighting or rattle the dice box in the small hours what were these pleasures to me who had aurelia to be with from the first she had taken her duties to heart to mother me to keep me out of harm's way to maintain her husband's credit by making sure of mine these things she set herself to do with a generous zest which proved her undoing slowly and from the purest of motives her influence upon me her intercourse with me grew and spread slowly the hours i spent with her extended unperceived by her exquisitely perceived by me until at the date to which i am now come near a year after my entering the university i may say there was not a spare moment of the day from my rising to my going to bed which was not passed with aurelia to make the full import of this plain to the reader i must particularise to some extent my own rooms i have explained were in the same house two storeys below the lanfranchi apartment in them i was served with my chocolate by old nonna the servant and was understood to leave them at seven o'clock in the morning and not to return until midday when i dined with my hosts the afternoons were my own i was at liberty to take horse exercise and i kept two saddle horses for the purpose or to make parties of pleasure with such of my fellow students as were agreeable to me at six i supped with aurelia alone and at seven i was supposed to retire either to my own room for study and bed or into the town upon my private pleasures these i say were the rules laid down by aurelia and her husband at the beginning of my residence in padua by almost imperceptible degrees they were relaxed by other degrees equally hard to measure they were almost wholly altered the first to go was the practice of taking my chocolate abed one morning nonna was late and i rose without it the same thing happened more than twice so then i went upstairs to find out what had hindered her there i found my aurelia fresh from mass and market drinking her morning coffee explanations apologies what not ensued she invited me to share her repast from that time onwards i never broke my fast otherwise than with her so was it with other rules of intercourse the doctor was a machine in the ordering of his life his chocolate at six his clothes at eight he left the house at nine and returned at noon he left it again at two in the afternoon and returned at nine in the evening he supped he went to bed on the stroke of ten except on sundays high festivals the first the middle and the last day of carnival through all the time of my acquaintance with him i never knew him break these habits but once and that was when his mother died at mestre and he had to attend the funeral on that occasion he must rise at six and miss his dinner at noon he was furious i never saw a man so angry i cannot tell how or when it was that i first spent the whole of my afternoons in aurelia's society nor how or when it was that instead of leaving her house at seven in the evening i stayed on with her till the stroke of nine within a few minutes of the doctor's homecoming it is a thing as remarkable as true that nothing is easier to form than a habit and nothing more difficult to break formed and unbroken these habits were unheeded by ourselves but not altogether unperceived there was one member of the household who perceived them and never approved i remember that old nonna used to shake her finger at us as we sat reading and how she used to call out the progress of the quarters from the kitchen where she was busy with her master's supper but my beloved mistress could not and i would not take any warning it became a sort of joke between aurelia and me to see whether nonna would miss one of the quarters she never did and as often as not when nine struck and i not gone she would bundle me out of doors by the shoulders and scold her young mistress in shrill venetian loud enough for me to hear at my own chamber door aurelia used to tell me all she had said next morning she had an excellent gift of mimicry could do nonna and i grieve to say the doctor to the life the end of this may be guessed privilege after privilege was carelessly accorded by aurelia and greedily possessed by me at the end of six months' residence those three still evening hours existed not for the blessedness of such intercourse alone but to be crowned by the salutation of an adorable hand and when i retired at last it was not to my bed but to my window to the velvet spaces of the night to the rustling trees the eloquent congress of the stars to sigh my secret abroad to those sympathetic witnesses to whisper her name to link it with my own to tell in a word to the deep bosomed dark all the daring fancies of a young man intoxicated with first love and from privilege to privilege i strode a fine conqueror a very few months more and not only was i for ever with aurelia but there was no doubt nor affectation of concealment on my part of how i stood or wished to stand before her i postulated myself in fine as her servant in amours cavalier i will not say for that has an odious meaning in italy than which to describe my position nothing could be wider of the truth i did but ask liberty to adore sought nothing further and got nothing else this upon my honour was ever the sum of my offence up to my last day of bliss you would have supposed that she could hardly have misunderstood the state of my affairs had i said or done nothing so quick witted was she it is inconceivable but as time went on and success with it i quite got out of the way of concealment and spoke of myself openly as her slave she used to laugh at me pretend to think me an absurd boy and now and then threatened and that half in jest to tell her husband i know very well that she never did the padron we used to call him to each other having taken the name from old nonna it was one of our little foolish jokes to pretend the house an inn he the landlord and ourselves travellers met there by hazard we had a many familiar private sayings and nicknames of the sort secret cues to look across the table when he was there and smile at each other as when he railed as he was fond of doing at tuscan ways and speech at the usage of siena her own country or when after his meal he made a noise sucking his teeth sweetly pleasant dangerous days were they as lovely to her as to me how can i tell there was no doubt but she knew me thoroughly the little pleasant encroachments of mine stolen upon her unawares were now never checked i am speaking of the end of my first year when i could hold her hand unreproved and kiss it as often as i pleased i took and kept and exhibited to her without embarrassment little trifles of hers a hair ribbon a garter a little trodden venice slipper if she asked for them back it only provoked me to keep them closer to my heart she saw no harm in these foolish sweet things she felt herself to be my senior by comparison with her position mine was that of a child to the very end she maintained the fiction that she was my foster mother responsible to my parents for my advancement in education and morals assuredly she taught me her tongue and kept me out of gross iniquity but equally certain is it that i learned more than italian i learned however to be very fluent in that for inspired by love of aurelia i attacked it with extraordinary passion all italy and above all tuscany took sacred air from her there grew to be an aureole about everything which owned kinship with her i was a severe ritualist as every lover is it became a blasphemy in me to think of aurelia in any form of words but those of her own honey tongue and that was of the purest in the land she had very little venetian at any time and kept what she had for her husband and household management to me she employed her native speech not the harsh staccato of florence a stringent compound of the throat and the teeth but the silken caressing liquids of siena the speech of women to their lovers of st catherine to her spouse so i became expert in tuscan and after the same fashion in tuscany also she was deeply and burningly proud of that land of art and letters she knew something of its history something if not much of its monuments such as it was it sufficed me inspired by her i began the study of literature and if at first i read disingenuously i went on to read with profit the vita nova of dante enabled me perhaps to touch upon topics with her which i could not have dared to do without its moving text but it won me to the heart of the great poet i walked the dire circles of hell i scaled the mount of purgatory i flew from ring to ring of the heaven of pure light aurelia was my beatrice but the great florentine and his lady were necessarily of the party and then i began as men will to take the lead aurelia had exhausted her little store when she had named giotto and dante i took her further afield we read the commentaries of villani malavolti's history of siena the triumphs of petrarch his sonnets fatal pap for young lovers the prince of machiavelli the epics of pulci and bojardo and ariosto's dangerously honeyed pages here aurelia was content to follow me and i found teaching her to be as sweet in the mouth as learning of her had been i took enormous pains and consumed half the night in preparation for the morrow's work i abridged guicciardini's intolerable history i hacked sense out of michael angelo's granite verses weeded lorenzo of disgustfulness politian of pedantry the last thing we read together was the aminta of tasso the last thing i had of her was the little flowers of st francis a favourite book of her devotion my saint she called st francis of assisi as in one sense no doubt he was but aurelia i had replied kissing both her hands you know very well who is my saint i should have been named aurelius she had said it is a good name aurelio there are many who have it in my country you shall call me nothing else said i then but she shook her head and hung it down as she whispered softly i like best francesco and then so low as to be hardly audible checho the sienese diminutive for my name of francis old nonna came in to hound me from the room that night it was my last but one aurelia came to the door with me and let me kiss her two hands again i have come to the hour of my destruction the th of june the smouldering fires which had laboured in my breast for nine months burst into a flame which overwhelmed both aurelia and me i committed an unpardonable sin i endeavoured to repair it with an act of well nigh incredible temerity what occurred on that night is in fact the origin of these memoirs and their sole justification the dawn of that momentous day found her a loving and honoured wife and its close left her innocent as she was under the worst suspicion which can fall upon a good woman it found me a hopeful gentleman of means and prospects and i went out of it into the dark a houseless wanderer to consort with profligates thieves and murderers chapter iv fatal avowal i shall not deny that the overnight's tenderness may have wrought in me the dangerous ecstasy which was to prove so cruel a requital of it for it is of the nature of love to be inflamed by the least hint of a neighbouring answering fire i believe that i could have been for ever aurelia's mute adoring unasking slave but for the fact that she had sighed and whispered me checho and twice suffered me to kiss her hands fatal benevolence that lifted suddenly the meek fatal wealth bestowed that made the pauper purse proud i had passed the night in a transport of triumphant joy throughout the day succeeding it i felt my wings nunc i could exclaim with propertius nunc mihi summa licet sidera contingere plantis and that exalted strain which was my perdition alas was hers also that which followed was a very hot still night with thunder in the euganean hills and aurelia may have been lax or languid or in my miserable person some of the summer's fire may have throbbed it was late near nine o'clock already old nonna had given three warnings of the hour and was only delaying the last while she stirred the ingredients of the doctor's minestrone over the fire the knowledge that she must come in and i go out shortly at any moment fretted my quick senses to fever i looked for ever at aurelia with a wildly beating heart she on her side was aware of my agitation and breathed the shorter for the knowledge she sat by the open window mending a pair of stays at her side was her work table upon that her three wicked lamp i leaned over a chair exactly in front of her watching every slight tremor or movement just as a dog watches a morsel which he longs for but is forbidden to touch thrice a dog that i was i felt like a dog that night we had read little and spoken less the airless night forbade it for the last half hour no words had passed between us but a faint ah go now go now checho from her and from me my prayer of not yet not yet let me stay with you aurelia was tired and now and again put down her work with a sigh to gaze out of the window into the soft deeps of the night gemmed as it was with fireflies and wavering moths how prone is youth to fatuous conceits i imagined that she suffered with me i identified her pains with mine i thought that she loved me and had not the heart to bid me begone that new wicked feeling of triumph that new exultation in manly strength that delirium that poisonous frenzy came flooding over me some gesture of hers more than commonly eloquent may have set me on fire i may have seen her tremble i may have guessed a tear more insensate folly than mine can be lent by youth on less security than this for there sat i quivering with love and there before me unlaced in loose attire in all the luxury of lassitude breathed and sighed the loveliest of women i cannot explain what i dare not extenuate dowering her with my own madness i forgot her honour my own the world and god i leaned forward towards her took her languid hand and holding it in my own said quietly very quietly i love you you are my soul she laughed gently then sighed you must not say so to me even if it is true she said i repeated the words i love you you are my soul and she was silent i said after a pause during which i could hear the furious beating of my heart i am at my prayers in my church before my altar your eyes are the candles your heart is the altar stone i kneel and i did kneel then she grew alarmed and was for stopping me checho she said this is foolish and i must not listen i beg you to get up i know it is late please to ask nonna what's o'clock i am serious and i i said am serious the time is full the time is now oh aurelia i said urgently my saint and my lamp hush hush she said and tried to regain her hand no but you must be quiet listen but i could not now be stopped oh i cried out i have been silent too long and now i must speak for six months i have been silent but now there is death in silence i shall die of love and it will be you that will have killed me i knelt again and again said i love you oh no no she said but her protest was fainter i repeated it and now she made no protest god help me i thought her won i flung myself violently near and in my agitation knocked over my chair as that fell backwards so fell i forwards to her knees i clasped them closely studded kisses on her hands i raised my face to hers and saw her the lovelier for her pale terror she was speechless listen to me aurelia youngest of the angels i began and just then old nonna burst in upon me crying ruin i sprang to my feet and aurelia away her work table went down the lamp with it we were all three in darkness ruin said nonna i tell you ruin that wretched boy the padron is on the stair aurelia shrieked that she was undone nonna who had flown back into the kitchen returned with a lamp i saw my beautiful mistress distraught and ran forward to comfort her she shrank from me with horror as well she might farewell lady i said i will go to meet what i deserve i took my cloak hat and sword and went to the door but nonna caught me by the skirt and is he mad then she cried and what are you about don francis will you meet the padron on the stair and let him up to see this wreckage madonna purissima what is one to do with a boy of this sort let me go said i to my proper fate i know very well what i have done it may be that i did and i hope that i did but very certainly i did not know what to do next nor did aurelia sobbing and trembling she lay upon nonna's breast imploring her to save us both i heard the professor clear his throat upon the floor below and knew that i was too late nonna took the command she flung open the door of the clothes press and in with you says she to me little fool a pretty state of things she turned to her mistress mistress go you down and meet him keep him at the door hold him in talk hug kiss throttle what you will or what you can while i set this to rights aurelia drying her eyes flew to the door and nonna then taking me by the shoulders fairly stuffed me into the clothes press among aurelia's gowns which hung there demurely in bags keep you quiet in there foolish wicked young man said she and when they've gone to bed maybe i'll let you out if i do let me tell you it will be because you have done so much folly and wickedness as no one in his senses could have dared that shows me that you are mad and one must pity not blame the afflicted all this time she was working like a woolcarder at the disordered room but could not refrain her tongue from caustic comments upon my behaviour wicked wicked don francis nay complete and perfect fool rather who because a lady is kind to you believes her to be dying for your love your love indeed what is your precious love worth beside the doctor's have you a position the greatest in the university have you years gravity authority money in the funds why are you breeched yet have you tired of sugar sticks what next so she went on grumbling and scolding until the doctor came grunting to the open door with aurelia upon his arm he was as usual out of breath and angry he was also i judged embarrassed and fretted by the ministrations of aurelia my curse i heard him say my undying curse upon the man who built this house twice a day am i to scale a mountain wife wife you strangle me oh dear friend oh dear friend 'twas the voice of aurelia are you come back to your poor girl hey cried he testily do i seem to be absent i wish you would talk sense these infernal stairs rob us all of our wits it seems i am very foolish said aurelia and i heard her trouble in her tones i have been waiting so long so very long there my child there said he and kissed her now be pleased to let me into my house with a sigh which i heard she released him and he came stamping into the room i trembled in my shameful retreat the reflections of a young man of sensibility ear witness against his will of the chaste and sanctioned familiarities of a man and wife must always be mingled of sweet and bitter but when to the natural force of these is added horror of a crime and the shame arising from discovery of utter delusion the reader may imagine the stormy sea of torment in which i laboured in a word i was to discover a new aurelia aurelia the affectionate wife the careful minister not the adored mistress of a feverish boy the heroine of a vita nuova the beatrice of a i fear me profane comedy the beloved of aminta and the pastor fido i own that i was dismayed wounded in my tenderest part at the discovery aurelia had suddenly become a stranger to my heart i was nothing less than nothing to her now that she was alone with her husband beside the care of his appetite for food my labours upon guicciardini the toil of a month of nights was as the work of an ant in the dust beside her interest in his gossip of the schools the coffee house the street corner my exposition of the sonnets of petrarca was as the babble of school children at play in the pra beside her attentions to his clumsy caresses her tenderness to me hour after hour was but the benevolence of a kindly woman to a lad left on her hands oh bitter tonic discovery how bitter it was i leave my reader to determine i do not feel equal to the task of relating all that i overheard if i could have stopped my ears i would have done it she tempted him beguiled him to eat to praise her to be at ease to love her with that liquid tongue of hers which would have melted a flinty core she talked of his and her affairs she was interested in his commentary upon the pandects she was indignant at the jealousy of dr this she made light of the malice of professor that with flying feet from table to kitchen and back with dexterous hands at bottle platter or napkin she ministered to his slightest whims she refused to allow nonna to wait upon him she must do everything for him for this once and when amid his flung ejaculations and bolted mouthfuls between his non c'e male his buono buono his ancora un po' or dammi da here he could find time to ask her what this new alacrity of hers meant on such a hot night of summer with a touching falter of the voice i heard her reply it is because it is because i have not always been good to you porfirio it is because of late this evening i have much wished for you to be here it is because cospetto i heard the doctor cry what is the meaning of this come here my dear and then when she went to him and sat upon his knee i heard him murmur his endearments ah and i heard her soft and broken replies and i knew very well that in her heart she was reproaching herself for what i alone had done and by her humble appeal for kindness was craving his forgiveness for offences for which i could never hope to be forgiven these terrible discoveries far from making me cease to love aurelia increased incalculably while they changed and purged my love pity and terror says aristotle in his poetics are the soul's cathartics both of these i felt and emerged the cleaner by the tune aurelia had coaxed her husband to come to bed and had gone thither with a kiss herself i was half way to a great resolve which though it resulted in untold misery of body was actually as i verily believe the means of my soul's salvation without ceasing for a moment to love aurelia i now loved her honestly again i could see her a wife i could know her a loving wife without one unworthy thought i could gain glory from what was her glory i could be enthusiastic upon those virtues in her which to a selfish lover would have been the destruction of his hopes in a word i loved her now because she loved another there is nothing remarkable in my possession of feelings which no honourable man should be without nor can i see that what i was moved to do in consequence of having those feelings was any way out of the common if the sweet subservience and careful ministry of aurelia had moved her husband's admiration how much the more must they have moved mine and what is more natural to the ardent explorer than to announce his discoveries i had learned that i had loved an angelic being what wonder that i desired to inform the one person in the world who had a right to know it that such was my extreme privilege of this i am content reader to be judged by thee if my enthusiasm was extravagant surely it was pardonable judge me then as thou wilt and as thou canst for the end of this chapter of my history is cardinal but there were these moving considerations also if aurelia had tacitly reproached herself to her husband with what were my crimes and only mine was it not my bounden duty to save her before it were too late must i not avow what as it seemed she was on the point of avowing if she pure innocent believed herself guilty and needing forgiveness whereas i and i only was that monster in a few moments' time when she should be with her husband in the innermost shrine of the temple of hymen i might be sure she would take upon herself the guilt and alone receive my punishment could i endure the thought of this miserable that i was could i suffer such a sacrifice and wear the livery of man i knew that i could not out therefore of thy hiding place sinner i bade myself and get the vice scourged out of thee these were a part of my reflections this was my plain resolution generous honourable they seemed to me then honourable alike to aurelia and to her husband the doctor had replenished his glass and was leaning back in his chair he had released some of the buttons of his vest and they had flown to their repose he was looking down at the table where he twisted the glass about he was thinking of his wife of her sweet humour innocence and purity of everything which i so adored and had dared to tarnish he was frowning and smiling at once at his thoughts i heard him say to himself that's a good girl that's a good girl of mine when i walked out of the cupboard and stood pale but composed before him at the opposite side of the table even then so absorbed he was in his mellow humours he did not hear me eh la madonna he mused as good as gold he stretched his legs out to the full and glanced with lazy luxury round about his room then he saw me chapter v disaster light of light he said in a horrible whisper and again very god doctor lanfranchi said i seriously for my passion lifted me up doctor lanfranchi she is better than refined gold he did what i suppose he had not done for many years he crossed himself over the face bless my soul he said sir sir i admonished him you little know of what excellent substance that saint is compact sir i might have continued i know not how long upon a theme so noble but for his astonishment which though it kept him stupid must have a vent who the devil stammers he what the devil it amazed me and vexed me greatly that i could not make him understand whom i praised i went close to him i touched him on the shoulder hearken to me doctor said i donna aurelia your lady is as it were an angel of heaven and i i said it with sorrowful grimness and i have better reason to know it than you he felt my touch and recoiled from it he looked at me half askance from under knitted brows and between blinking lids as if he thought me a spirit paradise of god says he then who is this his glance lighted upon the cupboard doors set open he frowned and said with difference and who are you that speak of angels sir i replied and my convictions were never more firmly in my words my name is wretch and i am unworthy to live i am that vile thing once called francis strelley now brought to confusion and conscious of his horrible offence sir sir i said wildly donna aurelia is the handmaid of high heaven while i while i o god emotion poured its hot flood over me i fell to my knees in the painful silence which ensued and no doubt seemed longer than it actually was i suppose that he collected some half of the truth and in the manner of him who sees but half distorted it to be greater than the whole his manner towards me altered very materially he resumed his authority get up he said croaking like a raven and at first i thought that i dared not and immediately after knew that i dared i sprang to my feet and faced him livid as he was doctor lanfranchi said i i have overheard you by accident as you praised her i have heard you call her good ah and in agreeing with you i can testify that you spoke more truth than you dreamed of no saint in heaven is so good as she but it has been required of me that i should grope in hell before i could see heaven in her soul he held himself from me by doing violence to his own person caught at his cravat and gripped it with both hands what are you saying say that again of what do you accuse yourself of sin i said he looked at the cupboard then with chilly rage at me what were you doing in there he asked and that was a terrible question since there i never ought to have been i asked him would he hear me he nodded his head and sat grimly down by the table at which of late he had so happily reclined he covered his mouth and nose with his hand but kept his piercing eyes upon me disconcerting but even so had he listened in silence i might have made him see the truth sir i began it is true that i love and have always loved your wife and it is true that i have been wicked enough to declare my passion but it is also true that by her and by her alone i have been convinced of my presumption here he held up his hand stop there you say you have been convinced how were you convinced where were you convinced let me understand you was it in there he jerked his hand towards the fatal cupboard yes i replied it was in there i was forced to overhear your conversation with donna aurelia which proved to me that i am less than nothing to her and that you are all the world he snorted scoffing at the thought we shall see soon enough he said bitterly who and what i am i continued if you think that i have injured you i say nothing of my lady or of myself you are horribly deceived on the contrary i have done you a service you have the proof to your hand that you are the husband of a pattern among ladies here once more he looked at the cupboard and ma he said and shrugged after this so long as i could speak to him he tapped his foot punish me i advised him use me as you will kill me i shall not defend myself i have never yet refused to take the consequences of my acts but over my dead body if you are a true man you will give thanks to god for the gift of such a wife as you have i was indignant honestly and as i think rightly so but again he misunderstood me he got up and threatened me with his great forefinger enough of your sermons sir he said have i lived and taught sucklings all these years to be told my duty to god almighty will you teach me forsooth for what i am to give thanks and whom i am to correct or chastise wait you there young gentleman wait you there until i know more about you and my pattern lady he turned his back upon me and wrenching open the chamber door called harshly upon aurelia immediately and no doubt she had been quaking for the summons my adored mistress came trembling out her hair tumbled about her shoulders her hands at her neck her feet were bare upon the flags her great and mournful eyes loomed hollow in her face they were my instant reproof for now and now to the full i saw a fatal consequence of my enthusiastic action unhappy francis what hadst thou done thou hadst intended to abase thyself in her service and betrayed her thou hadst intended to honour and condemned her to dishonour alas thou hadst gone near to ruining the purest and loveliest of women by revealing those very things which proved her so the doctor at his pitch of most savage and relentless calm pointed to me and the cupboard to the criminal and his lurking den together look at those woman he said ominously deliberately but she could not or would not and before she could collect her wits what must need old nonna do but make bad worse and running thrust herself in between and wag her hand under the doctor's nose eh eh eh what a bother about nothing says this amiable old fool let us pray all together to the madonna that you be not sorry for this she has done nothing padron nothing at all he alone is wicked by diana the mighty i swear it and it was i who put him in the cupboard and therefore know what i am saying she a lamb of our saviour's flock madness are you jealous of a boy without a beard do you conceive that your lady could listen to a voice that sang among milk teeth ah do you listen rather padron to me and the truth for we are at one together the truth and i she stayed for breath hag said the doctor you are lying this fine young man has confessed to me the agreeable truth madam he turned to donna aurelia here is a confessed lover of yours pray have you anything to say he is very foolish he is very wicked i have often told him so often and often says aurelia twisting her hands about to night he has said what he should not and i believe he knows that very well i had intended to tell you if you had come sooner as i wished ah and as i asked you porfirio you would have heard it all from me that is all i was frightened nonna popped him in the cupboard how he got out how you found him there i know not but he has done me no harm nor you neither porfirio that i swear before the saints in heaven the doctor glared at her then took her by the wrist lies lies woman he said furiously he convicts you himself he came out of the cupboard of his own act she stared in amazement and forgot the pain he was giving her he came out but is he mad no madam said i and no by heaven cried the doctor for i have no doubt at all but that he intended to provoke me to anger and then to run me through the body with that sword of his i threw up my arms at such a monstrous suspicion aurelia who had been gazing at me as if she feared for my reason now looked down please to let go of my wrist she said you are hurting me porfirio i know no more than you do why he came out of the cupboard but of course you do him a wrong he did not mean anything of the sort he is of a good heart incapable of murder and now please porfirio let go of my wrist but he did not his rage gathering in volume bade fair to convulse him i intend to have the truth from one of the three of you before i let you go said he from you i require to know why you put him into the cupboard it was very silly said aurelia since he had done no harm nonna why did you put him into the cupboard diana cried the old woman where else was i to put the boy the doctor's laughter was terrible to me i took a step forward i will tell you sir the reason of both your puzzlements i said i was put into the cupboard because donna aurelia was rightly ashamed of me and i came out because i was honestly ashamed of myself ha said he so now we have it you shall have it now i replied i was honestly ashamed of myself and honestly glorious that i had been rebuked by so noble a lady sir it is true that i love this lady aurelia gave a shocked little cry but i went on it is true that i kiss her feet sir i worship the ground she presses with them it is holy ground he scoffed at me i said my feelings overcame me i sinned i am utterly unworthy punish me for my sin as you will i shall not defend myself but do not and do not you madam i entreat punish me for the one thing i have done this night of which i may be rightly proud bah said he you are a fool i see and now madam yes porfirio said she poor soul you and that she wolf over there what have you to say i say said nonna that the young gentleman is out of his wits aurelia said i am wretched he was very foolish you have deceived me he thundered at her made a fool of me at your ease you spoke your wheedling words and he was in there to listen and to laugh by my soul you coaxed you stroked you sidled you whispered and he was in there laughing laughing laughing oh madam you talk of his young foolishness but you make your profit of my old foolishness it is false said aurelia i never did it by my soul says he i'll not be contradicted i say that you do o heaven is this your duty your gratitude your thanks due to me why why why what did i take you from what did i make of you your wretched mother she looked up with flashing eyes there was danger to be seen on its way she is not wretched then she should be madam he said she is parent of a wicked false aurelia crying shook to get free no no be silent you shall not say such things she stamped her foot it is absurd i won't have it she said he gave a strangling cry of rage and despair released her and rushed towards the cupboard dramatically he flung his arms towards it as if he would shake off his two hands and leave them there explain that woman he screamed explain it if you dare she was now equally angry with patches of fire in her cheeks i shall explain nothing more you will not believe me when i do my mother will understand me then she shall if she can says the doctor and as soon as you please aurelia peered at him what do you mean sir why madam that you shall go where you are best understood what she cried you mean you cannot mean oh preposterous the doctor was looking at the cupboard ay and it is preposterous and i do mean it she stared at him for a moment perplexed then flew into a towering and ungovernable rage ah she cried and she shook in every member ah now you may mean what you please for i have done do you dare to suspect me do you dare to treat me as an infamous woman oh oh do you dare you shall have no need to repeat it i will go to my mother's house i will go now now now nonna my cloak and shoes at once i have been good i have always tried to be good and do you faithful duty i have known what i ought to do i have been proud to be dr lanfranchi's wife i thought i would show to my people that a girl of siena could be proud even of a venetian pig if he were her husband ah but no more no more no i will work elsewhere for better wages you have seen the last of aurelia she was superbly beautiful as she turned pointing to me this youth this mad incomprehensible youth what harm has he done you compared to what he has now done to me he loves me he says i don't understand his love but why should he not am i to fall in love with everybody who says that do you think you are the only one and and why you have never said that you loved me no you have not you just took to me and made me work your servant or your doll your plaything when you were done with the cafe me a gualandi of siena and you a pig of padua good heaven for what do you take me sir did you find me in the street is my family one of wretches oh what a man you are ungrateful cruel hard as the grave yes yes nonna fold me close in my cloak it will keep me from such cold as this she stood cloaked and ready we all stood the doctor like a rock i like a man dead at his prayers she looked from one of us to the other to me second you told me that you loved me don francis she said i am going to my mother will you take me i never loved her so well as at this moment when i said madam i dare not do it she blushed i know she was mute with astonishment i thought old nonna would have torn my eyes out dog she called me son of a dog i dare not go with you madam i repeated i love you too well i have done you so much wrong meaning to do right that i dare not now risk an act which i know to be wrong oh i cried as my distress grew oh unsay those words aurelia you could not mean them they were not yours she tossed her head and shrugged i will be careful not to say them again at least she said they evidently distressed you come nonna we will leave these gentlemen the doctor never moved i followed her with my eyes one more look from hers would have drawn us both to our destruction i thank god at this hour that she never showed it me she went out and shut the door behind her neither of us moved until we heard the street door bang we had been waiting for that now dr lanfranchi said i with a glance at my sword i am ready for you how and when you please with a howl like that of a miserable maniac he leapt upon me tripped and threw me flat upon the flags i remember the stunning shock of my fall but remember no more i learned afterwards that he had pitched me out on to the stairs and that i fell far chapter vi i commence pilgrim i arose from bed some two or three days after the terrible occurrence related and how i had got into it except for the charity of the doorkeeper there's no telling i arose i say to a new heaven and a new earth a heaven impossibly remote an earth of sickly horror an earth of serpents and worms upon which i crawled and groped the loathliest of their spawn i surveyed myself in the glass faced myself as i was i the wrecker of homes the betrayer of ladies love's atheist pale hollow cheeked with eyes distraught there was good ground for believing that when dr lanfranchi threw me upon my worthless skull he had jogged out my wits the facts were otherwise however resolution came back upon the crest as it were of the wave that brought me full knowledge the more disastrously showed the ruin i had made the more stoutly i determined to repair it the surgeon who attended me was perfectly discreet and told me nothing more than that professor lanfranchi had left padua and was gone to venice not so the custode of the house it was from him i had the rest dr lanfranchi had taken his keys with him and had left no directions donna aurelia had been twice to the house since her first departure from it and had been unable to get access the second time of failing said the custode she had lashed into the street like a serpent from a cage and nobody he added nobody in this town and nobody under heaven's great eye can say where she has gone perhaps she is dead sir but i believe that she is not pretty and snug lady that she was it's my belief she will fret after her comforts and that if she get them not from one she will have them from another old nonna had also disappeared he said which was better than things might have been but the strongest ray of comfort shed upon me from this worthy fellow's store was this that donna aurelia had returned to her house plainly if she had been thither twice she could be induced thither a third time it must then be my business to induce her and to see to it if possible that she was properly received upon that occasion here was a duty plainly set before me my first and greatest reparation which no other tie must hinder to accomplish which i must shrink from no hardship however severe no humiliation however bitter another lay closer to my heart i'll allow the words of pardon which i hoped to sue forth from the dearest lips in all the world for i could never hope to be happy until the being whom most loving i had most offended could consent to assure me of my peace this however i resolutely put by as a selfish pleasure which i must not expect to enjoy until i had earned it however natural might be the impulse which urged me to find aurelia fall at her feet anoint them with my tears i must withstand it until i could be sure of her honour saved now was that surety to be gained first from her or first from her wrathful husband i turned to the custode who stood smiling and rubbing his chin in my doorway i said beppo i am in great perplexity it is idle to deny that i am the immediate cause of all this misery for you know it as well as i do he said that he had guessed something of what i was so good as to tell him there was as i understand a little misadventure with a cupboard door he said but who can contend with fate it has been my fate i said to bring ruin upon the lady whom i adore my sin is worse than that of hophni and phineas and i would that the requital might be as theirs was save that i can make it more bitter yet why says he what was done to those gentlemen i told him that they were slain with the sword to which he replied that so far as he had ever heard the doctor was nothing of a swordsman and that he knew i had some proficiency in fence i hope then he added that your honour will succeed where those other gentlemen failed but if you ask my advice i say leave the doctor alone and comfort the little lady his gross misapprehension of every merit of the case nettled me i saw it was useless to talk with a person of his condition and that instant action was my only safety i must go on my knees if must be to the feet of donna aurelia i must put myself entirely at her service should that lie in spurning me with her heel i must endure it should she bid me go and receive public chastisement from her dangerous husband i would assuredly go tears stripes hunger thirst cold heat loneliness nakedness unjust accusation ridicule malicious persecution all these i would cheerfully undergo and if one or any of them could repair her misfortunes then they would be repaired the custode said that he believed they could not but i bade him be silent and begone wretched venetian i cried at him thou art incapable of comprehending anything but victuals if i tell thee that i have lacerated an angel and deserve the sword thou speakest of my skill in fence i waste my breath upon thee comfort the lady dost thou dare to say what comfort can she have but in my repentance what have i to offer but devotion it is just that which i advise your honour he began but i was now embarked upon the waters of adventure cheered with the prospect of action impatient to begin my voyage astonishment cropped his period midway he gaped as he saw what i did i threw upon the floor my sword and finely laced coat i threw my vest ruffles cravat watch rings after them i kicked into a corner with my foot my buckled shoes my silk stockings my fine gilt garters upon the top of the heap i cast my paris hat my gloves and brooch there lies i said the sinful husk of francis strelley let the swine nozzle and rout in it for what they can find to their liking and here i cried standing before him in shirt and breeches barefooted bareheaded without a coat to my back here good man stands the naked soul of that same francis which shall go shivering forth to declare his shame to meet his penance to stand begging at the door of the holy place for the mercy which he has shown himself unworthy of about my disordered hair i tied aurelia's ribbon round my upper arm i placed her garter to my neck upon a silken cord i hung her venice slipper in the bosom of my shirt i placed the little book of devotion which she had given me and the aminta of tasso in which we had last read together farewell beppo said i you may not see francis again where are you going sir he asked me wondering to siena to aurelia to heaven and he held up his hands you are never going to siena as you are he cried and i asked him how else he would have me go your honour will take cold in the chest says he that's very plain but long before that can declare itself your honour will be lodged in the madhouse and what is madam aurelia to say by your leave to an undressed young gentleman which she declined to say to a dressed one let me tell you young sir he added with a sneer siena's not the only city in italy where there are madmen man i said what is it to me do you suppose whether i am in a madhouse or a prison this night i intend for siena and shall certainly get there in good time now i will ask you to leave me tis your honour is for leaving not i said he and though i shall be taking a liberty it's in a case of bad is the best i do believe he took off his jacket and put it on the bed what are you proposing beppo said i a strait waistcoat said he and came at me with determination i was his master in a very few minutes for i was much stronger than he reckoned for when i had him at my discretion i let him get up and thus addressed him i have every reason to be extremely offended with you i said but i believe that you have acted honestly let me however recommend you not to interfere in the private and personal affairs of gentlemen until you have fitted yourself to understand them i am going upon a journey in a manner which appears becoming to one who is responsible for these lamentable troubles i shall leave my property here in your charge but will ask you to accept such of those articles as are on the floor as may be of use to you when you see me again it will be as your indulgent master but he who now bids you farewell is unworthy to shake your hand he nevertheless took my hand and kissed it devotedly immediately afterwards he had fallen upon my discarded trifles excellency excellency he cried gasping what bounty what splendour of soul he fingered my watch listened to it it goes yet it is a famous watch he babbled like a happy child mechlin stuff every thread of it he smoothed out the lace ends of my cravat so he ran through the silly things one after another shoes which he could not wear a sword which he could not use a coat which must exhibit him a monkey he grovelled before me and would have kissed my foot but that i shrank from him in disgust horrible venal venetian i said thou hast shown me one more degraded than i he was out of sight with his bundle of treasures before i could finish my reproof and i busied myself with my last preparations i wrote two letters the first was to dr lanfranchi the second to my father to the doctor i said what was i think becoming namely that his wife was as spotless as the snow and that the very blackness of my guilt did but show her whiteness more dazzling i added an expression of my undying sorrow for having brought misfortune upon her whom i must always love and him whom i had once respected and assured him that i did not intend to rest until i had repaired it this i addressed to the university i explained briefly to my father the reason of my temporary absence from padua and upon reconsideration of my plans desiring to avoid any affectation of extravagance added a cloak a small bundle of clean linen a staff and a few gold pieces to my thin equipment at four o'clock in the afternoon i went out into the street and directed my steps towards the gate of san zuan leaving padua i turned and looked for the last time upon her domes and towers farewell once proud city now brought low by my deed i said keep if thou must the accursed memory and name of francis antony strelley gentleman poisoner of homes stabber in secret traitor in love i leave him behind me for the worst thou canst do he that quits thee now is another than he francesco ignoto pilgrim in need of grace then i addressed myself stoutly to the hills and it is a circumstance worthy of remark that the further i pushed the more certainly i recovered my spirits i suppose there never was yet in this world a young man to whom the future did not appeal more urgently than the present or who would not rather undertake an adventure without a shilling to his name than in his post chaise and four it is i take it of the essence of romance that the lady's castle prison of enchantment lies beyond the forest across the hills or over sea and most assuredly that damsel who is to be won by means of a courier leading a spare horse is as little worth your pains as she whose price is half a guinea i in that commencement of my pilgrimage then was happy because i was doing something and hopeful because i could not see my way chapter vii i am misconceived at the hospital i am conscious that the reader may find much to condemn in my last chapter he may think my schemes chimerical my methods undisciplined he may say that i am perverse i shall only urge in defence of what i did that i deeply loved and had deeply injured the lovely aurelia she had departed from me in misunderstanding and anger she did not believe in my devotion she could not understand my behaviour was it surprising then if i felt that i must find her at all costs was it wonderful that i wished her to know of my repentance or that i wished to repair my wrong doings for eight months i had enjoyed daily and hourly communion with her and i don't pretend to say that the horrible loss of that had a good deal to do with my precipitate departure any more than that the hope of finding her was what gave the spring to my feet and brought back the young blood to my heart no pilgrim to loretto or compostella more longingly set his eyes to where he believed his hopes to lie than did i watch for the first sign of the apennines which barred my way to siena having thus briefly defended myself against misconception i shall say no more on that head after my first night under the stars wondrous night of wakefulness and hopeful music throughout which i lay entranced at the foot of a wooded hill and was never for a moment uncompanioned by nightingale cicala and firefly i began to suffer from footsoreness a bodily affliction against which romance that certain salve for the maladies of the soul is no remedy or very little crossing the hills over burning roads through thorny brakes or by slopes of harsh grass my heels and the balls of my toes became alarmingly inflamed and an acacia spine lodging in the sole of one foot made matters no better that second day of mine i could barely hobble twelve miles and nothing but resolution could do that much for me the night came and found me ill i slept not though i had provided myself with food i could not touch it luckily i was discovered by some shepherd boys early in the morning and directed to the town of rovigo at some half a league's distance where they said there was a hospital seeing that my foot was now so bad that the touch of a hand upon it was torment i think it had gone hard with me if rovigo had stood another half league away i shall not readily forget the noble charity of one of those boys who seeing the inflammation set up by the thorn in my foot ripped off the sleeve of his shirt and bound it round the instep my first experience of the magnanimity of the poor but by no means my last i limped into rovigo and learned the direction of the hospital at whose gate i was kept with a sorry crew of wretches for a mortal hour while the brother in charge finished his siesta two friars a soldier disguised in drink a young jew and myself completed the company which was allowed to make itself free of a flagged and whitewashed hall absolutely devoid of furniture and smelling at once sour and stale i am sorry and ashamed to remember that the jew was the only person of my four fellows in misfortune who kept up any semblance of manners or proper reserve he differed indeed markedly from the others not only in his behaviour which was at least conformable but in his appearance of alacrity and cheerful health seeing that i suffered as much from the ribaldry of my fellow guests as from my bodily pains he came and sat by my side and encouraged me with the assurance that it was far better to wait for the brother in charge to awake in the course of nature than to disturb him out of his sleep mighty little chance for me for example he said if brother hyacinth don't have his nap to the full he'll be as savage as a starved wolf understand and will send a man to hell sooner than to admit him if he have a good foot left to take him there why then said i he will never send me for sure for i have no feet be not so sure dear sir returned the jew you don't know brother hyacinth as well as i do there was a fellow came here on a day all spent and bleeding he had lost a toe under a coach wheel if you will believe it this dear host of ours bade him go walk on his hands and offered him the cloister to get perfect in now with me i know it will go hard unless those fools cease their din the two friars had been dicing with the soldier and had won his boots each had taken one from him and were now wrangling who should have both i was struck by the sinister expression of one of them a capuchin of great strength with a long white beard more than enough of him in due course i told the jew that my case was so bad i cared not greatly whether i was received or no a man i said could die anywhere why yes he said so he can and live anywhere also one is as easy as the other if you but give your mind to it but one thing i will tell you he added it is not so easy as you might think to live cheaply when you have the means of living dear i shall be lucky if i spend this night as i desire but you will see hush here is our man i had been about to ask him what was his malady for he appeared to me the picture of health and shining with it but just then a square headed religious with small angry eyes and prominent bones came into the hall attended by a clerk a sleek young fellow who called out silence and was instantly obeyed the two friars were on their knees in a trice and chattering their hail marys the soldier after some efforts to rise had managed to lift himself by the wall and being propped up against it was saluting all and sundry with great impartiality the jew only was good enough to help me with the support of his arm his was the first case your name said brother hyacinth and was answered giovanni battista maria bentivoglio write said brother hyacinth to his clerk jew name unknown active liar this done he continued his questions your means alas none replied the jew search him said brother hyacinth the clerk thereupon turned out his pockets which were empty of everything but holes not content with that however he felt all over his body and when he had as i may say drawn all the coverts blank knelt down and pulled off the man's shoes the jew was unable to repress an exclamation which i naturally set down to his disgust at the indignity but i found that this was not so the clerk very neatly picked out a small key from between his toes and held it up to his master i thought as much said brother hyacinth go the young jew sighed shrugged and stood back without a word and while i was considering what his imposture could have been it was my turn brother hyacinth examined me with keen displeasure who are you he asked me i told him francesco antonio strelli and he bade the clerk write these names down nationality he asked next i told him inglese one of the friars that evil bearded fellow i noticed had drawn near and was listening with all his might now it was to be noticed of him that he breathed very short and fast and that his breath struck like fire upon my skin the interrogatory was renewed your place of immediate origin i was asked i said padua your present occupation repentance i said and spoke the truth your means of support grace said i and he stamped on the ground you are trifling with me i advise you to take care answer me truthfully of what you repent this angered me i told him shortly that like everybody else in the world of my way of thinking i repented of sin he turned to his amanuensis write down that the young man refuses to give an account of himself he said harshly and then asked me what i wanted of the hospital i said with heat my brother i had required of it what i now see i am not to expect charity namely both of judgment and act i am afflicted as you ought to have seen at once i need your wisdom but need most your sympathy to my amazement he cut me short as he had done with the jew by the brief command search him i recoiled as well as i could in my fainting and helpless condition do you dare insult a sick man i cried and to the clerk who was about to put me to this indignity i said touch me at your peril sir for though i die for it you will pay for your temerity the jew who had been looking on at my examination quite unabashed at the mortification of his own here interposed by telling me that the thing was a common form and must be gone through with i was about to shake him off for his impertinence when a chance phrase of his free lodging enlightened me this then was not what i understood by a hospital using the applied sense of the word but one of those original institutions so called which were of course guest houses for the poor the moment i understood that i saw that i and brother hyacinth had been at cross purposes i pulled out my handful of money and spilled some pieces upon the floor instantly the great friar behind me clapped his foot upon them the jew hunted down the rest brother hyacinth now recoiled what does this mean he asked are you a fool or a thief or an impudent rascal you are mistaken i replied i am none but it is clear that i have deceived you had i understood the real objects of your hospital which i am compelled to add you have most successfully concealed i should not have been before you i am ill and in great pain i supposed that you could give me assistance and even now should that be possible i would accept it and pay for it brother hyacinth with keen displeasure said that mine was a case for the police and that while he should decline my money he was minded to detain my person for their consideration but the jew thereupon broke in with more assurance than i should have thought him capable of your pardon very reverend he said but this is a case for the best physician in rovigo and the best bed in the best inn this gentleman as i knew very well from the first is acting for a wager only your astuteness has prevented him from winning it he has failed but not by much it is an honourable defeat he very willingly bestows upon you two ducats for the beneficent purposes of the hospital those very two in fact which the reverend frate behind him has covered with his foot with the others he will return to his noble parents being furnished with a certificate from your reverence to the effect that he has failed in his endeavour the clerk who had by this time extracted the two pieces from beneath the foot of the capuchin who loudly denied that they were there was now whispering with brother hyacinth after a short time he drew me apart and told me that but for him i should certainly be sent to prison the brother in charge he said believed me to be a highway thief or professed that he did against all reason for said the clerk as i told his reverence if your honour had been a thief it is very unlikely that we should have had the pleasure of your company at the hospital his reverence has made difficulties it has been hard to convince him though your honour's generosity to the hospital has not been without effect i flatter myself that my arguments have been useful any further service i can do your honour i shall very thankfully undertake i expressed myself obliged to him and added that though it might be very true that i deserved prison i had other acts of penitence in view which could only be properly performed in tuscany i said you would be justified if you knew the whole of my history in declining what i nevertheless urge upon your benevolence this crown piece namely he assured me that no crime of mine however unnatural could cause him a momentary scruple took the coin spat upon it pocketed it and said that he was my servant and orator to the end of time at this moment the great capuchin he of the covering foot took me by the arm and begged the favour of a word in my ear he was a hideous villain broad shouldered scarred hugely bearded and had a prominent tooth in his lower jaw rather loose which stuck out like a tusk i have spoken of his breath which was as the blast of a furnace i see he said with an odious leer that you are a game cock i knew you by your ruffle it was gallantly tried and nearly successful i like your spirit much come with me and you shall not fail again you and i will take the road together live at our ease and live for nothing and brave it with the best notwithstanding what do you say shall we shake hands upon it monster that he was as he hovered over me there grinning moving his tooth he inspired me with loathing i felt the blood tingle in my cheek better a jew than a thieving renegade says i that is my answer to you go in peace he said as you will and turned to his affairs i left the hospital with the benevolent jew whose name was issachar chapter viii the pedlar of crucifixes issacher as well as being a cheerful loquacious fellow and of ready wits was so exceedingly kind as to support my weight upon his sparer frame my arm was heavy i am sure upon his neck as his was certainly tight about my middle but he uttered no complaints indeed there was no room for them in the voluble series of his comments confessions promises and inquiries he said as we made our painful way down the single street of rovigo my dear friend you and i have both failed in our enterprise and for much the same reason but really you must be a novice at the trade if you expect to get a free lodging with a pocketful of gold about you confess that my invention of your wager was as happy as it was apt done in a flash on the wings of the moment as they spread for a flight but that is my way i am like that the lodging of my key however was a folly of a sort i am never likely to commit again another time i will swallow it it was indolence on my part my besetting weakness a child of a whim having bestowed my goods what but that hindered me from likewise bestowing the key i am vexed with myself but i expected more company who was to know there would be time for so much examination but now sir let me see how i can serve you an inn a meal a decent bed medicaments all these you can have for a turn of your pretty golden key i thanked him for his services but he would not hear a word of them helping me through the town he took me to a small inn outside the gate saw me put to bed brought me a good broth some wine and bread and left me to my meditations while he went for a doctor the thorn was extracted poultices applied i was given a soothing medicine fell asleep and slept heavily in the morning i found him by my side after asking how i did and satisfying himself by examination that my feet were recovering he said that he wished to serve me without being indiscreet what your private purposes may be he said i neither know nor seek to inquire it is plain that you are a gentleman of some simplicity or of a subtlety far too fine for my eyes of every day whichever you may be i admire if you are candid in calling yourself a pilgrim i appreciate your candour if you are not i appreciate even more your discretion but you will still let me observe that for a young gentleman of personal attractions to walk half naked through an inquisitive nation and to give oracular replies to questions put him by officials to say the least of it is to excite remark i have some recommendations to make which i hope you'll pardon as first stockings second a pair of stout walking shoes third a hat fourthly some apparent calling beside that of penitent penitence is a trade open to many objections but for those i am sure i should have tried it myself of what for instance do you repent is it murder is it coin clipping is it but i spare your blushes besides it can always be objected that as there is nothing to hinder your penitent fishmonger from trading in fish and being truly contrite at the same time so also your honour has the same privilege before you to be short i recommend you to choose some calling more plainly commercial i replied that he was very right and that i would gladly embrace any calling which would not hinder my design to this he answered that i had not done him the honour of explaining my design but that he conceived it to be that of walking about the country with as much discomfort as possible to this superficial judgment i very naturally demurred you are dry my dear sir i said nor do i wonder allow me to tell you my story and i shall make you sweat with indignation omitting names of persons and places i thereupon detailed the whole of my case and concluded thus solemnly i hope that you now understand how i am placed i am a gentleman who has behaved himself like a ruffian a christian who has stultified his religion i love a certain lady and have insulted her i was placed in a sacred relationship and betrayed it still a lover still a postulant for service i have three objects in life a to bite and burn the vice out of myself b to find my mistress c to make her amends whatever occupation you propose for my consideration must subserve these three great ends issachar listened with attention and remained for some time after i had finished speaking lost in thought then he said i see that yours is no common case honour religion and love make a strong partnership and hard taskmasters to a young journeyman perhaps i am too little of a casuist to maintain that the lady will not be gratified by your efforts to gain her esteem my experiences have been few and i am no lady's man but i own i should have thought that she would have preferred a more dashing return to her feet something on horseback say with a hand on your thigh and a kiss of the finger tips ha you might say ha fair enchantress do we meet again a nonchalant mien i believe few ladies can resist it but it is not for me to say i am however convinced of one thing which is that if you stray about the country at random proclaiming in a resolute voice that you are a criminal in a very short time you will be taken at your word and clapped into gaol there or in a madhouse either will be uncomfortable but in neither will you meet your lady of that i am positive he grew warm he grew declamatory why this is extraordinary he cried why sir how will you get out of this state and into another without a passport how will you live when you have spent your money how can you approach your lady or anybody's lady without a coat on your back or a quattrino in your pocket i am ashamed to put you questions so elementary but if you can answer one of them i shall have done with them as i had no answer ready issachar proceeded briskly confidentially and with alacrity it is indeed lucky for you he said that you have fallen into my hands fra palamone that old tusker with the useful foot would have flayed you alive and sold the skin now i have everything here that a man of honour can want a neat jacket he produced it shoes stockings garters he put them on the bed a hat he held up a broad brimmed felt with a draggled feather which conferred no benefit upon it and now he continued for your trade short of chivalry which involves horse exercise and is to be condemned on the score of expense peddling is the very thing for you i understand your requirements perfectly put shortly they are a piety b travel c gallantry beyond those you need health reasonable protection from law or lawlessness honest profit well take peddling it is safe it is easy you have company you may make money you see all the sights and hear all the news and you may repent as diligently as you please through all but my assistance will be better than you can dream of i am myself a pedlar with a small stock left which as i am going home to venice i shall make over to you at cost price in addition to that i will hand my passport over to you just as i have given you my coat and hat read it and you will see how exactly your wheels fall into my ruts he produced his passport and put it in my hands i found myself about to be described as issacaro ebreo vendor of pious objects licensed by the sacred college and vouched for by the grand inquisitor my features were said to be fleshy my nose pendulous my hair black and curly my shoulders narrow my manner assured i objected that the description would never pass me over the frontier but issachar replied have no concern on that score observe my shoulders they are as level as your own can it be said of my manner that it fails of delicacy that passport was no more mine than it is now the fact is that a passport is needed to distinguish one man from another and if the traveller have no particular features these must be found for him these crucifixes will save you that i said as a christian i am not allowed to deny i have a round score of them left says he let us figure up the whole the passport i could not let go for less than two ducats upon my soul and honour it cost me near three the hat the coat shoes and stockings well can we say less than a ducat and a half surely not the workmanship alone is worth the money for the crucifixes which are very fine and in the rococo manner now so much esteemed i cannot say a quattrino less than four ducats nor can a christian i suppose set any bounds to the value he places upon that symbol my price therefore is nominal an act of charity on my part which my sympathy with your sad story moves me to do i believe you had in your breeches pocket some ten ducats and a few broad pieces supposing i take seven ducats and conclude the bargain what do you say will you shake hands upon it he looked pleasantly at me holding out his hand the crucifixes were large the image of plaster the cross of white wood the price was exorbitant but i felt the force of his argument that no christian could set bounds to the value of such a symbol moreover the trade attracted me to walk the world as a pedlar of crucifixes could one conceive a nobler employment i at least could not the merchandise so noble that it could not be degraded by the merchant the merchant so ignoble that he must needs be dignified by the merchandise the cross emblem of sacrifice emblem of divine compassion divine providence and humility i must be excused if i saw here something more than happy coincidence if i fell into a mood of dangerous exaltation i embraced my new career with fervour i embraced my stock in trade oh thou unique and venerable wood i cried often as thou hast been carried into men's affairs in the forefront of red battle to preside over the consecrations of pontiffs and emperors to abase kings to lend criminals a final hope never yet hast thou submitted thyself to a sinner in sorer need but never also found sincerer champion than francis strelley under this sign did constantius caesar subdue chosroes under it shall riotous francis tread down himself i bade issachar take his purchase money i thanked him warmly for his friendly thoughts of me and having put on the coat hat and other garments he had sold me set out once more after a day's and night's repose which were complete enough to make further inactivity impossible i found my passport an easy key into the states of the church which all that rich alluvial country of ferrara had now become i sold no crucifixes but meditated profoundly upon them as i penetrated further into the great lombard plain and drew nearer to the cloudy mountains which seemed to me the guardians of my land of promise i hung one of them round my neck by a cord and got much comfort and spiritual assistance from it my faith grew livelier as my needs increased the sacred figure received my confidences and seemed to impart ghostly counsels i had a superstitious care to keep it always towards tuscany twisting the cord round so that the cross was on my back whenever i had occasion to face north instead of south before going to sleep i was careful to stand it up so that the image pointed its bowed head in the right direction i felt sure that all would go well with me whilst i bore upon me this infallible mark of honest profession i was like dante it seemed to me approaching the mount of purgation for which in my own case i put the apennines like dante it was necessary that all my stains should be done off and that i should be marked by the guardian of the gate well here i bore my sign the only sign tolerable for a christian and before i had reached the last ridge of the mountains before i could hope to look up to the shining eyes of my beatrice my brands of sin must one by one be wiped out ah that was very true and was proved to be so before i had done my journeyings but i knew not then in what manner a misfortune for me was that playing a character i could not refuse to sell my wares at malalbergo a small town between ferrara and bologna i came into a region where famine and pestilence between them had been rife stalking dreadful reapers side by side mowing as they went the people stormed the churches and hung with wild cries for mercy about the shrines on the wayside they fell ravenously upon me and as i could not set a price upon my crucifixes and it was soon known that i had them to give away it follows that within half an hour after entering malalbergo i was able to leave it with nothing to show for my declared profession but the cross about my neck so fearful was i of losing that one i concealed my passport and travelled henceforward under my own name and profession i had very little money left some three or four ducats i think i determined to be careful of these and to endeavour after some employment in bologna at once congenial and lucrative which should not however deflect my designs from the speedy accomplishment of my pilgrimage chapter ix i am humiliated lifted up and left curious it had been my hope to be able to buy exercising great economy a new store of crucifixes in bologna and to find a country beyond it where i might without scruple sell them for the means of bare subsistence for i asked no more than that but even that much was not to be the city of st dominick's last rest would not allow long resting place to me i was delighted with the first view of it as following the brown street of entry it revealed itself to me its towers and arcades squares and fountains and spacious churches made a strong impression upon my excited senses having found a modest lodging i wandered from shrine to shrine enraptured and believing myself fondly in a city of believers as ardent as myself i took no trouble either to conceal my crucifix a most conspicuous ornament i must allow or my sentiments of hopeful devotion i suppose that by degrees i excited remark i was a stranger in a thinly populated very idle curious city i think that i meditated aloud i may certainly have done so since i had no desire to conceal my ambitions if i struck my breast the action was sincere becoming to a contrite sinner if i was inspired and i was i believe that i was about to prove a cause of inspiration in others it is indubitable that i spoke to the crowd which gathered about me and followed me from church to church and that under the stimulus of their plaudits i was moved to what may be called eloquence i spoke of charity i remember upon the steps of san petronio charity of interpretation in matters of faith and morals and private conscience and i ended by declaring what was perfectly true that christian as i was a jew had put me in my present way of salvation at this singularly inopportune moment i was rudely interrupted the crowd parted and fell this way and that without my perception and a hand clapped upon my shoulder brought me to earth from those middle regions of the aether where i had seemed to be afloat it was as if looking up at the stars i had stumbled on a knotty root an officer of the inquisition stood beside me a tall keen eyed man cloaked in black i have been watching you young man for two hours he said you perform your devotions somewhat publicly and seem to have a great deal to say about your spiritual state the church has appointed ways and means for the consolation of the faithful some of which are no doubt open to you only scandal can ensue these kind of practices i was highly indignant as who would not have been upon my word sir i exclaimed if a sinner may not proclaim his repentance so near the throne of pardon nor a faithful believer record his sincerity within this shadow of the truth such excesses as you use he stopped me savour of private conscience following its own bent the church is distrustful of such excursions that crucifix which you carry for instance i clasped it with fervour ah it is my passport sovereigns and rulers of states said the officer will require more particulars and so for that matter will the police of bologna this is useless for any such purpose and your pretence only adds urgency to my desire of you i don't wish to be severe with you i ask you in a friendly and reasonable way to give me the crucifix never said i without it i am lost to tuscany with it replied the officer you are lost to the world for some time this indecent profession of opinion what a wooden cross as big as a dagger give it to me at once and follow me to the tribunal of the police i confess that i grew cold before such irrational tyranny you are going the way to work sir i said to make me an atheist i shall yield only to force vain protest have it as you will said the officer and signed to the sbirri who came forward at once cleaving the crowd with their drawn swords this young man is illuminated said the officer take him to the tribunal and look into his papers i saw that submission was my only course and took it the police led me away a much more severe scrutiny of my miserable passport than had taken place at ferrara followed upon this nothing but the assured manner of issachar was allowed to stand up for me my nose was fatally straight my hair fatally out of curl i was asked was i a jew and had i dared to pretend it i know not to what extremes they might not have proceeded but i had never learned to lie i admitted at once that i had bought the passport instant action was taken upon this my crucifix was burnt the passport confiscated i was given six hours in which to leave bologna and did not take three i departed in a towering rage which perhaps did me good and devoured the leagues between the city and the mountains at a pace which i am sure did me credit the lengthening shadows of these engulfed and sobered me late at night i reached a village at the foot of the mountains whose name i don't know and sought out the only inn the place boasted if any place could have been assured enough to boast of so miserable a shelter by this time i had walked off my fury and a great part of my piety i shall only add of bologna which i have never revisited that if it is the duty of a city of the church to freeze the faith out of the heart of a son of the church then that haughty seat may boast of having fulfilled it my inn was full of french and savoyard soldiers recruiting it was evident for their cause or their pockets war was said to be threatening between the holy see and the grand duchy these were the pope's allies roaring drinking carding wenching and impressing all travellers who could not pay their way out saturnian revels the landlord was playing bacchus much against his will the landlady and a tattered maid were venus and hebe by turns for my own part shunning to be ganymede i slunk into an outhouse and shared its privacy with some scared fowls and a drover of the garfagnana who taking me at first for a crimp ran at me gibbering with a knife i pacified him luckily before it was too late and crouched with him until daylight expecting discovery at every outcry not until then did the house seem asleep but about cockcrow there was a silence as of the dead and that time was judged favourable by my companion in hiding to get clear away knife in mouth he crept out of cover and went tiptoe by the house the poor fellow was crimped at the corner by some wakeful sentry and tied up to fight the grand duke so i stayed with the fowls until the maid came in for a victim which was to supply the lieutenant's breakfast here was my chance madam says i and the girl gave a little shriek being desperate i put an arm round her waist and covered her mouth with my hand madam i said courteously i deplore the necessity of laying violence upon you but pray you to believe if you can in my sincere respect for you i am travelling to florence but alone help me to avoid these guests of yours and i shall be eternally grateful when i was sure that she had understood me i released her she sighed forgive me sir she said but i thought you were going to make love to me god forbid it said i perhaps a little too devoutly for she seemed to be piqued she said it's as you please sir of course he never forbids what you gentlemen have a mind to you are wrong my dear i replied he does forbid it but we don't know it until too late sir said she it's not too late yet it was now for me to sigh if you knew or could read one page of my story i told her you would understand how late i am and how pressed for time will you not help me i am in your hands she looked kindly stay here sir said she i'll do my best for you what means she took cannot be told but after a short absence she returned with bread and a jug of wine under her apron and beckoning me to follow her took me by a back way behind the houses up a stair cut into the rock and so to the upper street of the little town towering above me then i saw the broad green side of the mountain whose summit was wreathed in white mist you are free to go now sir said she there lies your honour's way i thanked her warmly offering her my hand but she put hers behind her is that all you are going to give me she asked me and made me blush for my poverty i would give you something very handsome if i had it i said for you have done me a real service it would have been impossible for me to fight the grand duke feeling as i do towards one of his subjects you have saved me from a painful dilemma and deserve more than i can offer you such as they were however i held out to her in one hand my last gold ducat in the other my aminta the maid looked all about her shaking her head at the choice nobody was near the narrow street was asleep i would much rather take a kiss from your honour said she no girl likes to be disappointed and you have a smooth chin i could not but tell her that in accepting a salute of the kind she little knew what risk she was running to which she at once replied that a girl in her situation with a houseful of french soldiers was indifferent to common dangers i told her i was sorry to hear it and felt obliged to add that i was peculiarly accursed why says she mighty curious whatever have you done a pretty gentleman like you my dear said i i have injured a spotless lady her reply was to throw her arms about my neck and give me some three or four resounding kisses bless your innocence she cried warmly i wish i had been your lady injuries indeed i was moved you are a kind and charitable soul i said and put the religious of bologna to shame except from you and a venetian jew i promise you that i have met with no humanity upon my travels at this moment she heard herself called from below and bade me kindly adieu i suppose you are after your lady she asked as she turned to leave me yes says i that is my pilgrimage to make her amends well says the maid be bolder with her than you were with me or you'll never do it adieu sir i saw her no more i felt myself touched in a lively part so quickly is our nature responsive to kindness the embrace of that warm hearted girl i thought as i went on my way has put heart into me a generous forgiving soul and by a figure she may stand for that compassionate aurelia for whom i shall seek until i fall is there no offence which women will not forgive yes there is one the great offence of all pride ah beppo beppo i cried my venal paduan i was happily inspired when i left thee my purple and linen i laughed aloud and footed the long hill bravely it may seem trifling to establish one's uplifting by the kiss of a poor wench but who can explain the ways of the soul the wind bloweth where it listeth and if that of hers were the kiss of peace at any rate it was kindly meant and so i kindly received it unknown lowly benefactress i salute thee again from afar after many years breasting the last green steep of the hill picking my way amid black rocks and dripping fern i soon came upon the high road whose entry had been barred to me by the soldiers i ate my bread finished my jug of wine and pushed on so vigorously that by noon i was in the heart of the mountains to cut the narrative short after one cold night in the open and one more day's march having surmounted the watershed of lombardy and tuscany i found myself within view of the frontier saw the guard house with the red and white posts of the grand duchy and two sentries with muskets walking up and down a sharp reminder of difficulties ahead beyond the frontier the road curved about a great bluff of rock and skirted the edge of an abyss i could see dimly a far stretching blue plain with rivers and white villages showing faintly upon it my heart leaped at the thought that there below me within a day's travel was the land that held aurelia and redemption but even in that same moment there surged up that bitter something which chilled the generous feelings and staled the fluttering hopes cruel and vexatious thought there was not a rill of water on these mossy stones which did not race unimpeded or if impeded gathering force and direction from the very obstacle towards aurelia yet here was i sentient adoring longing who had travelled so far and endured so much unable to move one step beyond a painted post such thoughts make rebels of us is man then the slave of all creation is his the one existence framed by the almighty that cannot follow his nature better then to be a beast of chase darting mouse or blundering mole than a man if the more erect posture is to be the badge of a greater degradation if the sole merit of two legs be that they take less hobbling better far to go upon four needless to say that these were the mutinous reflections of the young francis who suffered not of him who now writes them down who pays taxes wears a good coat and bows to the police with the best citizens in the country but that francis of nascent rebellion miserably irresolute truly indignant not daring to go forward not able to retire asked himself such burning questions in vain as he paced the brown length of a beechen glade within sight but out of hope of his promise i must have wandered further than i reckoned for so it was that i presently became aware of a companion in my solitudes this was a capuchin of great girth and capacity who sat under a chestnut tree secluded from observation and was at that time engaged in dyeing his beard chapter x i fall in again with fra palamone the capuchin's employment was precisely what i have stated though all probability is against it i was curious enough to watch him and could make no mistake he had a copious beard descending to his stomach the half snowy white the half a lustrous black upon a depending twig he had fixed a tin edged mirror in his hand was a small tooth comb with this he raked his beard over and over again occasionally dipping it in a tin cup at his side he looked in the glass picked up a strand of beard examined it minutely underneath dipped his comb and raked dipped and raked again my gradual advance due as i have said to curiosity not presumption did not disconcert him at all he began to speak without so much as looking at me whereby i was able to hope that i was not recognised on my side it had not taken long to ascertain that i knew the capuchin very well if not by his white half beard then by that jutting tusk of his at once so loose and so menacing it was that very same who at the hospital of rovigo had looked at me so hard had burnt my cheek with his hot breath and urged the value of his friendship so clamantly against that of the jew's fra palamone as i remembered his name nor could i forget why i had decided against him nor in what terms it had been because when i had brought my handful of money flooding out of my pocket two ducats had been covered by this man's foot and had been buried deep in his toes buon di said he in cheerful tuscan speech are you come upon a like errand of accommodation by chance you are welcome to a corner of my dressing room we'll strike a bargain if you dip my beard i'll dip yours i said that would be bad commerce on my part since i had no beard you sir i added have a remarkable one which i confess i regret to see coloured a fig for your regrets little man said the other politics is the cry if your passport described you as a middling sized man with a black beard and a running at the nose you'd be doing as i am but you'll never have such a passport as that my passport i told him is destroyed it described me as a young jew with an assured manner and a pendulous nose this caused the capuchin to look upon his visitor whether he knew me or not then or before he made no sign there's no flattery in that he said but you could have done it a manner's a manner and there's an end but i could swell any man's nose for him and say thank you and what does your present passport bear i said i have none the holy office having confiscated it ejected me from bologna because i wore a crucifix and prayed to the madonna ah says he i've known a man hanged in that city for less but what you say convinces me of one thing you will be all the better for company how so said i why says the capuchin you tell me you were talking to the madonna it is true that i was addressing her in her image very well that's a proof positive to me that you had nobody else to address a most unwholesome state of affairs how does my beard strike you black as blackness i fancy he was right i assured him that it was now as black as erebus and pleased him extremely i told him however that i thought he would have more difficulty with the rest of his description which gave him a middle size and a cold in the head he was in person gigantic and in health appeared to be as sound as a bell i shall get through said the friar on my beard and where that goes i can follow as easily as a tomcat his head but i have a trick of bending the knees which will serve me for some hundreds of yards and if you suppose that i can't snivel you are very much mistaken listen to this he hung his head looked earnestly at the ground then he sniffed sniffed do i say it was as if all the secret rills of the broad earth had been summoned from their founts no noise more miserably watery could have proceeded from a nose he beamed upon me am i a wet blanket he cried now friend shall we go he had packed up his tools in his begging bag and stood ready to depart i reminded him that i had no papers that need not disturb you at all he said you pass in as my convert all you have to do is to do nothing and keep your mouth shut if you cannot speak you cannot answer that is good logic i hope we will discuss our several affairs presently in the reasonable air of tuscany i stifle in the pope's dominions you might say that there was not room enough for two such men he blew out his shining cheeks till his eyes disappeared he looked like a swollen tree bole with a mossy growth dependent then he deflated them with a bang and shouted with laughter a single expression of delight sharply reverberant and suddenly stopped poh what a rattle you'll think me he said come and remember that you are a deaf mute to get a thing granted it is no bad way to take it for granted this is what the capuchin did i was young and he was old i undecided and he perfectly clear in his intention there was little more even to my too charitable eyes in his favour certainly not his looks he was a huge straddling positive kind of a fellow with an air of specious bluff benevolence about him which gave way to examination he had a very ugly mouth under his beard cut up sideways by the pressure of his long tooth to emerge his eyes were small greedy and near together they looked different ways his nose was huge and glowing broad rooted as a tree and pitted with the smallpox on his left brow he had a savage scar his strength and determination were very extraordinary i was to learn within a few weeks how strong he was how ferocious and dangerous his age might be guessed at near sixty for all his vivacity for at close quarters i could see unmistakably the senile arc in either eye and as the reader knows his hair and beard were very white debauchery may have left these marks upon him but had not worn out his force that at any rate was still enough to resolve the irresolute francis an incurable believer in the native goodness of mankind to obey him in this instance i am by nature pliant and easily led and i have never been one for half measures therefore i received upon my staff the capuchin's bundle in addition to my own and followed my leader towards the guard house within sight of which crooking his knees together under his frock drawing in his shoulders poking his head the sturdy rogue reduced his apparent size and expression more materially than could be believed his calculating eyes grew weak and watery he snivelled at the nose drew his breath sharply as if it hurt him almost visibly shrank into himself i looked at him with amazement but the officers seemed to know him very well ho fra clemente says one on the round again it appears the capuchin quavered his admission his hand shook as he proffered his passport yes yes poor brother clement must live find consolation if he could a festival at prato called him a great affair but he was getting very sadly as his friends might see could not keep the road much longer the customs officers gave him back his papers with scarcely a glance to spare for them and had no ears for his maundering so occupied were they with me his companion whom have we here fra clemente said one presently and sent my heart into my throat but the capuchin sniggered and touched his nose with his finger there was an air of low cunning about him very unpleasant to observe this sor giacomo says he with a cackle is a little surprise for the grand duke a specimen a rarity a pretty thing this is a scythian youth deaf and dumb from his birth but very taking as you can see 'tis the best thing i've picked up on my travels for many a year and a fortune to me why if i can present this handsome lad to his highness you may have me back upon you in my bishop's coach and six and there will still be men of my religion who will have got more for doing less let me tell you you're never going to spoil an old friend's industry for the sake of a dumb heathen heathen cries the fellow is he a heathen do you suppose you may offer the grand duke a heathen you'll have the inquisition upon you my man for certain sure and the cardinal archbishop for once on their side into the water with him before you touch florence or out with your knife make a christian or a jew of him ay says his colleague handling me as if i had been an odalisque ay and the prince between you and me is near his time his menagerie may go to the dogs for all he cares jews and infidels blacks and whites and all he sees little but the doctors and the priests in these days what has it come to that says the capuchin peering through what seemed to be rheumy eyes if it have indeed then may heaven be his friend for he'll need one tut so i've spent my ducats for nothing it seems he shook his pretended convoy roughly by the shoulder accursed scythian that ever i set eyes upon thee forty ducats signori of hard money to a venice ship's chandler who had him i know from a tripoli merchant for half the sum and a hardy healthy tall propagating rogue he is by the looks of him well well you may keep him for me i am just a broken old man he spat upon the ground and appeared to ruminate upon his hard fortune i was greatly disgusted by now at the false position in which i had been put and should assuredly have found my tongue had i not perceived that the trick was succeeding one of the officers said that he would go to perdition rather than have a mute heathen on his hands the other encouraged the capuchin to hope for the best the grand duke might rally he had the strength of a cow and the obstinacy of an old woman in fact i was pushed over the frontier after my supposed owner without further ceremony and soon joined him the old scoundrel moved painfully off dragging one leg after the other but no sooner had the winding of the road concealed him than erect and replete once more he clapped me heartily on the back and began to crow and caper his delight in the mountain airs i watched him with mingled feelings half gratitude half disgust chapter xi i exercise common sense imagination and charity was not that fine comedy in an old grey bearded capuchin dog cried the frate leaping about and cracking his fingers could you have bettered it could any man living have bettered it confess me an old rogue in grain or i break every bone in your body it is not for me to confess you one thing or another fra clemente to call you so i replied except that you have made me party to some abominable falsehoods however i have benefited by them and am willing to believe that you acted for the best which is more than i can say for your endeavours upon our last meeting at rovigo may i remind you of that if i had hoped to startle him i was very much mistaken the capuchin at once sobered down and became confidential and affectionate he put his arm round my neck and spoke with feeling you have as good a memory as i have i see he said laughing pleasantly i had not intended to recall to your mind a time when i confess to having been the victim of prejudice and without going so far as to say that i followed you solely to remove your suspicions that would not be the truth i shall own that i had you much in my thoughts and hoped more than once that we might cross paths my prayer is answered i shall set to work to convince you of my good intentions towards you perfect confidence of man to man shall it not be so if i cannot help you it will be surprising you have seen how i can help myself i did not again remind him that i had seen that very clearly when at rovigo his foot had been clapped upon my coins but fra clemente if that were his name saw that it was remembered your money let me say would have been safer with me than with that oily thief issachar he said calmly but let that pass you saw fit to trust him and now you can judge how far i am to be trusted i have nothing to complain of and nothing to hide i hope you can say the same i was silent let me tell you he went on that my name in religion is palamone fra palamone here his tones became lighter as he soared from the injured benefactor's into a jauntier suit yes i am that fra palamone known all over tuscany for the most wheedling good natured cunning light fingered and light hearted old devil of a capuchin that ever hid in st francis' wound hey but i'm snug in my snuff coloured suit my poor old father god have him after all his pains put me there to lie quiet and nurse my talent and so i do when times are hard but the waxing moon sees me skipping and you will no more keep me long off the road than your cur upon it i must be out and about in the kitchen to tease the wenches into the taverns for my jug of wine off to the fairs where the ducats blow like thistle down under the gallows to see my friends dance at the gaol doors against delivery the round of the pillories a glance at the galleys with a nose for every naughty savour and an ear for every salted tale i have prospered i was made to prosper this good belly of mine this broad easy gullet these hands this portly beard which may now get as white as it can since i have done with gossip fra clemente a wrist of steel fingers as hard as whipcord and legs like anchor cables all these were fostered and made able by brown st francis' merry sons fra palamone dear unknown fra palamone ever your servant and now here with another revolting change he turned his lips back to show his tooth and now said he you fish eyed jelly gutted staring misbegotten bottle of bile who in the deuce's name lent you the impudence to listen to my confidential histories without so much as letting me know your fool's name hey the ferocious invective of this peroration accorded so ill with his prattling exordium that i was left with nothing but a gaze this i gave him liberally but he went on lashing himself into fury to use every vernacular oath he could lay tongue to he swore in venetian in piedmontese in tuscan he swore corsican ligurian calabrian spanish hebrew arabian and portuguese he shook his fists in my face dangerously near my astonished eyes he leaped at me gnashing his teeth like a fiend he bellowed injuries shocking allegations impossible to be proved horrible guesses at my ancestry he barked like a dog bayed at me on all fours finally whirling his staff over his head he rushed at me as if to dash my brains out then cooling as suddenly as he had boiled over stopped short looked quizzically at me blew out his cheeks and let his breath escape in a volley poh says he poh what an old palamone we have here threw down his staff and came towards me all smiles his arms extended admirable youth he cried heartily give me your hands i love you dearly we shall be fast friends i can see kiss me boy kiss me i should have resented this comedy of thunderstorms more hotly than i did if i had not believed the friar to be mad but i was very much offended by the titles of dishonour most improperly bestowed upon me and was determined to have done with their inventor sir i said you have done me a service i allow and i am much obliged to you but i am constrained to point out that i have carried your baggage on my shoulder for some five or six miles you gave me your confidences unasked and undesired it matters no thing to me whether your name be palamone or graffiacane nor how far you choose to disgrace your habit or molest the charitable now you have acted like a maniac and if i did my duty i should give proper information in the proper quarter instead of that i restore you your bundle and wish you a good evening fra palamone had been watching me studying my face intently as i spoke his arms folded over his labouring chest he had before the close of a dignified if somewhat sententious address recovered his breath and completely his gravity my dear young gentleman he said i admire your spirit as much as your person and manner all three puzzle me i must say so young and so rhetorical so simple and so polished an egg an egg are you english dutch irish what the devil are you you won't tell me and i don't know but with all you say of my whirligig self i entirely and heartily agree that at least is to the good i propose that we sit down here and now and discuss your affairs for what better can we do a grassy bank the scent of leaves a fading sun the solemn evening air nature invites come what do you say we will eat and drink of the best for i and my sack are no mean caterers we'll make all snug for the night and rise up betimes better friends than ever for our late little difference of opinion nothing could have been less to my taste the man inspired me with extreme disgust fra palamone i said firmly our ways separate here i go to pistoja you where you please or do you go to pistoja i shall take the other road i commend you to god i salute you i thank you and hope i shall never see you again english cried fra palamone slapping his forehead now i know with whom i am dealing who else commends his enemy to god and hopes that the devil will step in he looked me up and down triumphantly grating his upper lip with that fierce tusk of his if i were in the humour boy he said which you may thank madonna i am not i could have you on your back in two ticks and your hands tied behind you i could take every paul off you ah and every stitch down to your shirt but no you are a gentleman i prefer to take your hand being confident that we shall meet again in a few days' time from now hold your way to pistoja since so you will have it i am never deceived in my man i know you and all your concerns as well as if you were my own son and better a deal you have your troubles before you brought upon you by your own headiness your own insufferable piety and crass conceit and i young sir and i am one of them that you will find out i bid you farewell sir says i very stiff but i say to our next meeting he cried and plunged down the hillside i heard him for a long time shouting songs at the top of his voice resting no more on the road i pressed my way southward descending through chestnut woods to the olives the garlanded vines the wonderful husbandry of a generous land amazed and enchanted by the profusion i beheld the earth seemed to well forth rich blood at the mere tread of a foot boys and girls young men and women half naked but glowing with beauty and vigour watched their beasts on the woody slopes or drove the plough through the deep soil following after great oxen singing as they toiled the ground sent up heat intoxicating to the blood of a northern wanderer it was the land of promise indeed flowing with milk and honey a pastoral land of easy love and laughter where man clove to woman and she yielded to him at the flutter of desire yet all was sanctioned by the providence which fashioned the elements and taught the very ivy how to cling was there not deep seated truth methought in those old fables which told of the loves of the nymphs the loves of the fauns was there not some vital well spring within our natures some conduit of the heart which throbbed yet at the call of such instincts i was more sure of it than i had ever been before the loves of the nymphs the clinging ivy the yielding reed the loves of the fauns buffeting wind and kissing rain these shy brown girls who peered at me from between the trees these musing shepherd lads calling them upon oaten pipes panaque silvanumque senem nymphasque sorores i saw them i saw them i walked fast my feet raced with my thoughts my heart was beating my blood was hot my inclinations were pastoral but enthusiastic i was disposed to admire and prepared to prove that i admired i could have embraced a sapling and swooned as i called upon dryas or syrinx then by and by in the fulness of the time i saw a slim solitary girl ahead of me in a glade walking bolt upright with a huge faggot of sticks upon her head it was growing dusk i could see little of her save that she was tall and walked superbly well from the hips that her skirts were thin and close about her person that she was alone young and over burdened i quickened my steps she stopped she turned to face me i saw her black hair close curtaining her whiteness i saw her steady eyes under dark and level brows i saw she was very thin and as wild as a hawk i was foolishly agitated she not at all buona sera said she she stood easily upright her burden on her head her hands were on her hips she was perfectly simple as simple as a nymph and as handsome in her proud calm savage way i returned her greeting and more for the sake of getting countenance than for the answer asked her to direct me to some lodging not too far off she took some time in replying but her eyes never left mine she gave me a steady scrutiny in which were neither vulgar curiosity nor equally vulgar stupidity to be discerned it seemed that she was busy with her thoughts how she was to answer me for when she had looked her full she shrugged and turned her head stiffly saying there is none for your excellency god knows said i how excellent i am and that where there is lodging for the meanest upon earth there is lodging for me what god knows she said he mostly keeps to himself i speak of what i see your excellency is on a frolic my excellency died three weeks ago i told her oblige me by not referring to it again and if you will not give me direction let me carry your faggot for you why how will that help your excellency says she by satisfying you that i have some title left to the name i replied believe me i need the good opinion of my fellow creatures will you not humour me i cannot sir she said i can cease to carry my faggot but that won't help you very much i insisted i don't know why she stared at me with raised brows then jerked the faggot to the ground try she said and folded her arms across her chest waiting it is a fact that i tussled laboured and wrought at the accursed thing an ineffectual hercules its weight was really enormous how her slim neck could have borne it without cracking puzzles me still though i know how like a caryatid she was formed she did not laugh at me or smile she merely watched me and so goaded me to put out all my strength which was considerable knack of course was a wanting i got it upon end put my head against it lifted it and it fell behind my back twice i did this and grew dank with humiliation then i rushed at it lifted it bodily on high and crammed it down on my head clumsy malapert that i was it slipped to my shoulder thence upon the girl's bare foot hey she cried sharply now i hope you are satisfied i saw that her cheek was bleeding as well as her foot i would have struck off my fumbling hands at the wrists for this vexatious affair forgive me i said forgive me pray and went to her i implored her pity execrated my clumsiness i was born i said to be fatal to ladies hereupon she looked at me with some interest you she said i bore the brunt of her extraordinarily intent eyes with great modesty yes she continued that may be true for i see that you are a signore it is the prerogative of signori to ruin ladies i was stabbed more deeply than she knew and said at once it is true that i was born a gentleman it is true that i have ruined a lady but i repudiate your conclusion with horror i beg of you to allow me to stanch your wound she smiled perhaps it may not need it perhaps i may not desire it but try try she offered me her cheek down which a thin stream of blood had wandered as it would a ridiculous difficulty presented itself i hovered undecided suck the wound suck the wound said the girl we shall not poison each other i obeyed the flow of blood ceased i knelt down and treated her foot in the same simple fashion when i stood up again she thanked me with what seemed shining eyes and emotion in the voice i don't know what sort of ladies you have ruined said she but you have a pleasant manner of reparation the scratch on my cheek smarts but not unduly my foot is as sound as ever it was she helped me perch the faggot on my head and we walked on together this last generosity had touched me her name she told me was virginia strozzi and her people were very poor folk of condoglia condoglia was a village on a spur of the mountains the property with the bodies and souls of its inhabitants of a great lord a marchese she was sixteen years old and had never tasted meat condoglia was but a mile away it was getting dark would i spend the night there your honour must not look for decency she said with a sad patience which was very touching to me you can judge of what you will find by what you see of me rags cover my leanness and wattles cover my rags as i am so are my father and mother sisters and brothers and so i suspect were theirs you will sleep on litter you will eat black bread and drink foul water it is what we do year in and year out except that sometimes we go without the bread what do you say i say i replied that i am thankful for your kindness to one who has used you ill my maladroitness was horrible your amendment was however handsomely done she said and added fiercely let me tell you that nobody has ever touched my foot with his lips before i owe you for that you are generous indeed virginia i said i shall be proud to be in your debt for a lodging we were not long in reaching condoglia which so far as i could see was no more than a row of hovels on the summit of a crag and then we entered the meanest dwelling i have ever seen it was like a gipsy's tent made of mud thatched with furze and consisted of a single room on whose floor of beaten dung huddled a family of starving wretches hollow eyed pale gaunt and almost naked a round dozen of them there were a man bright and peaked with hunger a poor drudge of a woman worn to a rag before her time with a dying child upon her empty breast a grown son and seven children all crouched there close together like pigs in a yard to keep life in their bodies i saw no signs of food and i reflected that outside this misery and want the rich tuscan earth was a steam with fecund heat and bore a thousandfold for every germinating seed to them faint and desperate as they were the entrance of virginia herself as thin as a rod and of myself a stranger caused no surprise they looked to the door as we came in but neither stirred nor spoke indeed it was virginia who did what was necessary she brought from her bosom a loaf of rye bread she fetched a flask of oil she broke up the one and soaked it in the other and distributed the victual first to the guest then to the children and her parents last to herself the bread was musty the oil rank but the children tore at it as if they had been young wolves all but one who was too weak to hold its own and might have died that night had i not taken it upon my knee and put some food between its grey lips no one spoke it grew dark there was no candle or other light i sat awhile in the absolute silence then fell fast asleep with the child on my knees wrapped in my cloak in the morning when i awoke virginia was gone deeply touched by what i had seen and still more by the desperate patience with which afflictions so bitter were borne before i went away i gave the husbandman all the silver money i had left some few liras and reserved for my future needs one single ducat the last gold piece i had the man thanked me exorbitantly in a voice broken with gratitude yet almost in the same breath admitted the insufficiency of the gift we shall send virginia into pistoja to morrow he said it has come to this that her brothers and sisters are dying and she must do what she can i asked will you send her to beg the question was evaded she'll do well enough when she's been fed and cleaned for she's a well made handsome girl there is a great man there we shall keep the wolf from the door by what she sends us and maybe have something over misery teaches all trades to a man you see i trembled and turned pale i entreat you i said to do no such dreadful thing i have serious reasons for asking very serious there is one thing which we cannot afford to lose even if we lose life itself in keeping it and it is a thing for which we pay so dear now and again that we cannot value it too highly i mean our self respect the peasant looked round upon his hovel and sleeping brood with those famine bright eyes of his must i keep my self respect sooner than some of them must i not throw one to the wolves sooner than a half dozen he gave over his unhappy survey with a shrug it seems i have nothing to get rid of here he said quietly except that valuable thing i pulled out my gold piece will that keep it safe for you i asked the gleam of the man's eyes upon it was terrible to see will you engage the word of a man that in exchange for this you will never do what you have proposed st mary help me i will sir he said the coin changed hands where is virginia i asked him and he told me that she and gino her brother had been up before the light and were spreading dung now said i it is proper that i should tell you that i am without a farthing in the world i say that not because i grudge you the money but that you may see how entirely i trust you you may trust me indeed sir said virginia's father with tears and i took my departure the peasant escorted me some half mile of the road to pistoja he explained that condoglia and all the country for ten miles square about it belonged to the marchese semifonte who had a palace in pistoja another in florence several villas upon the neighbouring heights and a fine eye for a handsome girl it would have been at his door first of all as to the proper and appointed connoisseur that the young virginia would have knocked with her sixteen years for sale for in every sense of the word said her father she was his property a chattel of his i thanked god heartily that i had found a use for my gold piece and a salve for his conscience into the bargain i felt and told myself more than once that any tragic fortune to that nymph of the wild wood not averted by me would bring the guilt of it to my door i may as well confess too that her haggard beautiful face and thinly gowned shape were seldom out of my thoughts upon my two days' further journeying to pistoja on the other hand with curious levity of fancy i was convinced that before i had been many hours in that my first tuscan city i should be bedewing the feet of aurelia with my tears and so the sweet rainbow vision of my adored mistress also danced before my eyes as i fared and disputed with that queen of rustic misery for the mastery of me chapter xii i seek and find the hopes of a young man upon his travels may be lighter than feathers whirled about by the wind but they soar as high and are as little to be reasoned with going to pistoja that fine summer's morning my convictions of triumph were sealed to me and why indeed because i had confronted and discomfited my redoubtable adversary of the mountain and rescued a poor family from hateful sacrifice i was forsooth to find aurelia in pistoja to fall with tears at her feet to be pardoned and absolved to rise to the life of honour and respect once more she was to rejoin her husband i my classes and all my former bliss all was to be as it had been most unreasonable hope yet i declare that these were my convictions upon approaching pistoja and that far from diminishing as i drew nearer and nearer to the city so did they increase and take root in my mind it was therefore as a man prepared and dedicated that i entered the gates as a man under orders that i took my way through the crowded street as a man guided by an inner light requiring not the functions of his senses that i paced steadfastly forward neither asking the way nor looking about for it and only paused when i was before the worn portal of a great red brick church whose facade never finished presented to the world the ragged ends of bricks and mortar here i say i paused but not for uncertainty's sake rather that i might take full breath for my high adventure as a man may hold his energies curbed on the entry into battle or with his hand at the chamber door upon his marriage night or even at his last hour when the sands are nearly run and the priest has done his best and before him lies all that dark unexplored plain he must travel alone i breathed no articulated prayer all my being prayed every pulse and current in my body every urgency of my soul tended upwards to my advocate and guardian in heaven i bowed my head i made the sign of the cross i pushed the curtains and went in before me stretched a vast and empty church desolate exceedingly at the far end of which in the gloomy fog before a lamp lit altar i saw a woman kneeling stiffly with uplifted head as if she watched not prayed watched there and waited knowing full well the hour was come and the man her head was hooded in a dark handkerchief i could see her thin hands clasped together on the altar rail even as i realised these things about her which besides her rigid unprayerful pose were all there were to see i must admit to myself that she bore no resemblance to my lady that one matter of devotion and the devotional attitude were enough to condemn her for aurelia was no bargainer in church but lent herself unreservedly to the holy commerce her generous body her ardent soul and asked no interest for the usufruct have i not seen her rain kisses upon the tomb of st antony more passionately than i could have dared upon her hand had she ever risen from the outpouring of prayer without the dew of happy tears to bear witness in her eyes to her riven heart her piety was indeed her great indulgence so eager so luxurious pursued with such appetite as i have never seen in england or france nor assuredly in padua where there is no zest but much decorum in the practice of religion to see her in church was as it were to see a child in her mother's lap able to laugh to play to sulk and pout ah and to tell a fib being so sure of forgiveness no secret too childish to be kept back no trouble too light the mustiness of the season's oil the shocking price of potherbs the delinquency of the milliner's apprentice who had spoiled a breadth of silk she could grumble at her husband or impart and expect heaven to share her delight at some little kindness he had done her since i have heard her speak calmly to the madonna about some young gentleman who had followed her three days running to mass i am very sure that she and our lady were in full agreement on my account thus it was that she who had been early parted from her earthly parents nestled into the arms of her heavenly parents upon what warm waves of feeling would aurelia float into the bosom of the mother of sorrows with what endearments use her with what long kisses coax her for little mercies with what fine confidence promise her little rewards and to compare this passionate flooding of heart and mind of corporeal and spiritual faculty with any incense which that rigid watcher of mysteries had to offer up were an absurdity and a profanation impossible even to my deluded vision while i watched and compared however i did not turn away i cannot understand my interest or curiosity which were very real i knew that aurelia was not in this church but for all that i stood rooted by a pillar at the door and kept my gaze fixed upon the woman in the distant chapel she may have continued kneeling there motionless for some quarter hour more in itself the act of suspense is an absorbing one so much was i possessed by it that i forgot all beside it that i was a lover not of this shrouded unknown that i was penniless and outcast that i was hungry ignorant uncertain unforgiven i think that in some indefinable way the spirit of aurelia may have been about me pervading this cold church linking me and that other i think that aurelia's soul may have whispered to mine behold thy duty there i cannot tell but this i may say with truth that when the thin hands at the rail unclasped and one made the cross over the form that knelt so lonely there when the woman lifted her head and slowly rising turned and came up the church when our looks met and i found my eyes searching the grave face and sombre eyes of virginia that unhappy child for whom i had spent my last gold piece i was neither startled nor disappointed but felt rather that i had known all along that it was she i assume that i was in that exalted frame of mind which i have endeavoured to describe this young girl's eyes fixed upon me appeared like beacons in that dark place sullen fires lit at night to warn me that i was still upon sentry duty about her person money can a soul be saved by money the enemy is hungry about the wall said the eyes of virginia be steadfast on the watch neither of us gave recognition of the other neither of us spoke but when she was level with me i turned and walked by her side to the door i held the curtain back for her to pass out she bowed her head and accepted the service as seriously as a princess together we went down the steps side by side we crossed the piazza took the main street turned to the right under an archway and went down a steep and narrow lane all this in perfect silence we reached a little piazza a bay in the lane raised upon a parapet from the road level here breaking our long and nervous abstinence virginia stopped saying i am tired let us sit down chapter xiii having emptied my pocket i offer my hand but reserve my heart we sat down upon the steps of a church san pietro was its name a very old church for a while we were silent virginia it was to be seen was now timid timid to the verge of defiance i was curious and curiously excited mastering myself i asked her in as redoubtable a voice as i could summon what she did here in pistoja she then looked at me with her tragic eyes grey eyes they were tinged with black and looking steadily always without a trace of fear she answered you know very well why i am here indeed i exclaimed i know nothing of the sort i don't in the least understand you her calmness her unflinching regard were dreadful to me do you mean me to suppose that your father i could not finish with the horrid thought she saved me that pain my father has your money said she and would have kept me at home if he could but there he reckoned without his daughter i left home some three hours after you and got here before you as you see i could not be indignant with her there was that underlying her hardy speech which forbade precipitate judgment my child i said what do you mean to do she shrugged her thin shoulders it is misery at home here in pistoja there is not apparent misery nor need there be any signer francesco she said look at me i am sixteen years old a marriageable girl not ill looking not ill made starving without a lover or the portion to buy one what is to be done with me what is to be the end of me it seems that the world has to answer me that question am i to stop at condoglia and gnaw my knuckles and work to the bone for another's benefit and kennel with dogs and chicken why my going will benefit them the chicken will have more to eat or say that i do stop there what then having nothing needing much i marry a man of my own nation who has even less than nothing and needs more than i do in fact he needs me only that i may fend for him and then and then don francesco more knuckles to be gnawed more starving mouths to gnaw them more dogs more chicken to jostle for the pease straw which i and my man and the children we choose to beget shall huddle on life in condoglia ah thank you for nothing don francesco if this is what you have bought for me with your fine gold piece i was dismayed i was dumb at such a callous summing up of my honest action all i could stammer out was some feeble trite protest against a disordered life which sounded insincere but certainly was not that when i urged her in the name of religion to go home she opened her eyes with an expression of scornful incredulity she was fully six years younger than me and yet strangely my senior without being told so i had the intuition that to appeal to her on the part of religion was to invite failure do you ask me to agree with you she said slowly when i know what i know and you so evidently know nothing who pray are you to judge whether it be unwholesome to the soul for the body to sleep in a good bed you who have rarely had a bad one and can you tell me that it is a sin to wash the body and feed and clothe it delicately when all your life long you have had ministers to yours as of right what do you know of the inconvenience of the course i meditate when you have nothing with which to compare it you to whom hunger and nakedness are an adventure yes an adventure undertaken for a whim or a frolic i know not which for fifteen days of your life you have gone fasting unwashen to bed but i for fifteen years of mine consider me that sir your experiences again may be ended whensoever you choose you have but to write a letter i suppose but for me she touched herself on the breast they have no end at all save one and i have never learned to write my good don francesco said she lightly you don't know what you are talking about this gave me the courage if not the opportunity to assure her that i did i entreated reproached exhorted her to no purpose driven to it at last i alluded again to my unlucky expenditure when she drew herself up fiercely and striking at me venomously had me at her discretion i am perhaps in your debt for that magnificent outlay of yours don francesco she said i am willing to admit it if only to spare you the trouble of reminding me of it any more and if you ask me to liquidate it i cannot refuse you i am at your disposition as soon as you please and in any manner that you think proper but if you think i am to be bought of my father and put in a cupboard like so much cheese and locked up with a golden key kept in some man's pocket you are very much mistaken here the reader may think it would have been proper for me to have told her that she was a worthless girl who might go to the deuce for all i cared but if such is his opinion it is not and was not mine i shall not set down all the talk between us it was beating the air on my side and a steady trampling of solid earth on hers my final argument and that only produced a certain effect upon this remarkably clear headed girl i told her that part of my story which dealt with aurelia's perfections and my own disastrous imperfections i made her understand that i was not the inexperienced man she had thought me rather i was one with two examples ever before him one shining with the pure effulgence of heaven the other harsh staring horrible like some baleful fire at sea ah virginia i concluded you must not misjudge me it is a sinner who speaks to you not a saint removed too far to help you a sinner indeed am i yet not utterly lost i have a guide a hope a haven i have a light whereby i may steer my poor barque aurelia lanfranchi no let me call her by her own name aurelia gualandi will save my soul alive oh let her example be yours and her excellence your means of excellence virginia i say was struck by these moving words of mine she hung her head and seemed sunk in thought i know nothing of this lady nor of her nation she said more gently than before but what you say of her pleases me very much evidently you love her and she you but you must allow me to tell you now what i was timid to say before that she showed much good sense in putting you in the cupboard and you remarkably little in jumping out of it half an hour more cupboard and your learned doctor had been asleep next day you could have made your plans with your lady she would have rewarded you but so she would if when she invited you to accompany her you had offered her your arm and put on your hat what possessed you then what inscrutable reasons had you but there would be no end to my questions and no satisfaction in your replies why heaven the world was before you two you had happiness adventure all the rest of it and if you must needs wander this world need i assure you that two are better company than one fra palamone i remembered had been of that opinion too as it is she continued you may be years before you find aurelia and you must be prepared for any step she may have been driven to take in her extremity i don't wish to wound you but there can hardly be any doubt about her plans she rose to her feet and looked kindly at me saying i thank you for telling me your story if i understand it i think you are rather mad if i don't then i must be but i admire you i think i love you i foretell happiness for you in times to come but not of the sort you seem to hope for at present she held out her hand to me adieu don francesco she said we will part here do you go to find aurelia gualandi i to search for a lover like you deeply touched by this gentle conclusion of our argument i held her hand and made her sit down again she resisted faintly not seriously i then told her that i did not intend her to leave me in this manner or in any manner which did not assure me of her honourable wellbeing and now it was she who pleaded feebly now it was i who was convinced fiery unanswerable i said that i was resolved to protect her honour to work for her to establish her firmly and comfortably in the world which had used her so ill i told her that being devoted entirely to the love of aurelia my company could do her no harm that on the contrary the world putting the worst construction upon our alliance would actually respect her more and do her less injury than if she went into it alone i charge myself with your future virginia i said as if you were my sister i am young and able i shall provide for you never fear until you are honourably and happily married and you shall accept this service from me the only one i can do you upon my own terms and respect the bargain that you make with me more than you have your father's she would not look at me and said nothing but she gave me both her hands and bending her head until she reached them kissed mine fervently and with humble gratitude thus began the most extraordinary partnership between a young man and woman which the world can ever have known for the plighting of it virginia took all the order and direction i remember that she left me for a short time sitting there on the church steps and returned with bread and salt got i know not how or whence she broke the bread sprinkled it with the salt and initiated me into a mystical meal of her own devising this old church under which we partake our sacrament she told me is called san pietro's it is here that in times gone by the bishop of pistoja went through the ceremony of a mystical marriage with the abbess of the benedictines which has now been stopped by the jesuits because more than once it was not so mystical a business as it might have been but i think the place very suitable for what you and i have to do with certain rites then of her own contriving certain sprinklings of salt in a ring upon the ground about us upon our heads and knees with certain balancing of flakes of bread and many signs of the cross virginia and i celebrated a union which i say with my hand on my heart was intended by both of us to be as mystical as possible and was so until long afterwards it was deliberately ended at the end of her observances she took my hands in each of hers crosswise and looking earnestly at me said we are now indissolubly bound together by the communion of bread and salt my pure intention to your pure desire together we will live until we find aurelia you as master i as servant you vowed to preserve my soul i to succour your body let nothing henceforward separate us but one thing amen to that virginia i said and that one thing shall be a prosperous marriage for you so the bargain was struck and now again i looked at the girl the hard and bitter fires had burned themselves out of her eyes nothing remained there but a clear radiancy she was like a new creature earnest frosty cold like a spirit set free i have said she was handsome in a thin fine way she was very pale black browed with firm pure lips a sharp chin grey judging eyes she was lithe and spare like a boy and very strong her hair which was abundant and loosely coiled upon the nape of her neck was nearly black not of that soft cloudy dark which made aurelia's so glorious but as if burnt with a hot rusty tinge here and there about it though not now in the rags in which i saw her first she was still poorly dressed in the habit of the peasantry of that country in a green petticoat and red bodice which like that of all unmarried girls here was cut to display the bosom her feet were bare and her arms also to the arm pits such was virginia strozzi for whom i had not then any symptom of what the world calls love i do not deny that she interested me extremely and was of great comfort and assistance nor that as the reader will soon see i gave her and with good reason respect gratitude a strong affection as much of these as a man can give to any woman born of her feelings towards me at this time i shall not attempt any relation she herself had said that she loved me whether she meant by that more than a sympathetic affection a common cause an adventure shared a comradeship i know not or at least i did not know then all i have to add is that she never betrayed it chapter xiv my happy days their unhappy end i lived in pistoja for a month or more very happily without money in my pocket or a house to my name to the benefit of my health and spirits and with no injury to my heart's treasure i mean by that expression that i by no means in the interests of my new surroundings forgot donna aurelia on the contrary i assured virginia every day that expiation was extremely necessary for me and aurelia's restoration to her husband a vital part of it virginia without professing to understand me fell in with my convictions but she replied to them that my aurelia must either have gone to siena or be about to go if the latter we should be in the way to meet her by staying in pistoja if she was already at home with her mother the more time we left for the soreness to subside the better it would be for all of us i fell in with this line of argument which seemed to me unanswerable because i was not then aware that the shorter way to siena from padua was by arezzo i was now to learn that it was very possible in a country where all classes save one were poor to do away with the standard which obtains all over the civilised world and to measure men not by what they have but by what they are for a man to be without money where others have much is to be without foothold the goal for any fribble's shot of contempt it is as if he stood naked in a well dressed assembly but where all are naked alike no man need to be ashamed and where all pockets are empty it is not singular to be without them your wit becomes your stock in the funds and your right hand your ready money so i say i found it to be but i believe that wit and ready hand were alike virginia's i may have caught at the theory hers was the practice virginia's opinion was that work for hire was either done by habit or on compulsion an ox said she draws the plough because his race have always drawn it a peasant works afield because he is part of the soil's economy he comes from it he manures it tills it feeds off it returns to it again it is his cradle his meat his shroud his grave but in cities the case is altered here man is predatory solitary prowling not gregarious here for a man of wits his fellows are the field which he tills he is the best husbandman who can tickle the soil to his easiest profit who can grow the finest crop at the least pains and get for little what is worth much what she would say do we need which the city will not give us for the reaching out of a hand shelter a hundred houses stand empty week by week take any one of them they are there to be chosen clothing do you know don francesco how small a part of the person the laws of morality compel you to cover there is not a dust box in pistoja but will give you a new suit to that measure every day food have you ever asked yourself she would exclaim how many pounds of bread we throw to the dogs in the week enough to feed fifty packs of hounds drink it streams at every street corner thus she would conclude are our necessities supplied for luxuries we have the sun in sheltered cloisters the rain to cleanse the ways in which we walk the splendours of the church to feast our eyes the chances and changes of the streets and taverns to keep our minds alert no no don francis quoth she let them sweat and grow thin who must we are free i could not admit all the conclusions of this philosophy though i was not concerned to dispute them but virginia's theories of life interested me extremely and her ability to apply them was extraordinary perhaps i was by predestination a vagabond and no doubt she was all i can say is that if i myself became strong and healthy on those terms virginia bloomed like a wild rose and seemed to grow in grace under my eyes she devoted herself to me and kept me in excellent order washed my shirt and stockings at the fountain kept my clothes neatly mended buttons on my vest brushed my cloak clouted my shoes she was not inattentive to her own person either she put her hair up into a coil and pinned it with a silver comb kept herself clean and wore shoes and stockings a pair of stays became her well and a loose white kerchief for her bare neck she showed to be a beautiful girl her eyes lost their sombre regard her colour cleared her cheeks took rounder curves where she got her clothes where the food which made her sleek where the happy light in her eyes were mysteries to me she seldom left me she showed no signs of having been at work so far as i knew she had no friends in pistoja and asked no extraordinary charities i believed that she shared in the distribution of alms at the gates of certain monasteries i fancied once or twice that a look of recognition passed between her and various persons as they met in the streets but as she said nothing to me on the subject i made no inquiries there was no doubt of her devotion to myself she never left me or met me again without kissing my hand she always spoke of me by a title of respect as don francis or your honour or sir and yet was entirely unceremonious in what else she said to me criticised my actions and quarrelled with me hotly upon many subjects she took a plain view of my feelings towards aurelia as the reader will have seen and a very plain view of aurelia's towards me but when she found that to have expressed them would really have hurt me she withheld the expression but did not change her view one thing she never did she betrayed not the slightest symptom of love for me i might have been her sister or she my brother for any false shame she had or for any sign of passion towards me she concealed nothing she spared nothing but she asked nothing that i was not ready to give her and this as i then thought was not because she was determined to fulfil her bargain towards me but because there was nothing more that she wanted she liked me i suppose very much she respected me perhaps she might have been a little afraid of me she knew that i was a signore who could end my absurdities so she freely considered my conduct whenever i chose she thought me a little mad meantime as i was uniformly kind to her she had never been so happy in her life on my part i spent my time in the writing of great quantities of poetry which i read to virginia in the evenings and which she thought very fine and in teaching her to read and write she proved an apt and willing pupil quick to learn and with a retentive memory but she could never spell i think it may be said that on the whole i gave her as much as i got for not only did she become happier and healthier but i was able to soften the harsh angles of her mind to humanise reclaim her from savagery i could not however make her religious after my own fashion she went to mass with me and once when i insisted upon it confessed and took the communion but she hated the priests though she would never tell me the reason and could hardly ever be drawn to confession again after trying various shelters from the weather and being driven from each by unforeseen circumstances a cloister or two a church where the sacristan surprised us asleep one morning and turned us out into the rain an old family sepulchre an empty palace and a baker's oven which had fallen to be let and had been occupied by cockroaches we finally discovered and took possession of a ruined tower near the church of sant' andrea which suited us excellently well it had been the fortress of a great old family in the middle ages that of the vergiolesi from whom sprang the beautiful selvaggia beloved by cino of pistoja the lower floor being choked with rubbish and fallen masonry the only access to our retreat was by a broken beam projecting from the original doorway you jumped for this caught it if you were expert enough and must swing yourself up to straddle it you could then gain the string course of brick which encircled the tower and edging along that reach the lower sill of a window that window was our front door the interior was perfectly dry rainproof and from all quarters but one windproof enchanting occupancy to me fit household for a poet without pence and to virginia who had never known a dry lodging a very palace here by the light of candle ends got for the asking from the churches i made her acquainted with letters i held her fingers at the charcoal until they could move alone i pointed my own along the page until her eye could run true the greater part of the walls of our chamber was covered with her sprawled lettering and for all i know to the contrary may reveal to this day the names of francis strelley of aurelia gualandi and of virginia strozzi it is a fine proof of her loyalty to our bargain that the first name which virginia essayed to write was mine but the second aurelia's she took her own in hand last the verb chosen for these easy essays was as usual amare but its application to the walls was again the pupil's device i allowed her willingly to write don francesco ama donna aurelia but forbade her to reverse the names one day when i was out she put virginia strozzi ama don francesco i did not know it till long afterwards i gave her the rudiments of literature also i grounded her in letters as well as in lettering amongst my few possessions were still my aminta and my fioretti and i knew much of dante's comedy by heart virginia had a retentive memory and great aptitude for learning whenever she did well i called her a good child and she was so dreadfully afraid lest i might withhold the praise that she toiled at her ciphering and pothooks long after i was asleep there is no doubt that this was a happy time for both adventurers full of interest for me and of extreme comfort for the girl whom i was able to befriend it is not to be pretended that we kept good company we were outcasts and were thrown of necessity amongst those who had been cast out but the standards of life vary with those who live and i never could see that a man was less of a thief because he thieved from a throne or less a profligate because he debauched a princess i was no doubt in advance of my time these are the ideas of monsieur voltaire i believe that i saw a great deal of iniquity for the taverns and gaming dens to which i sometimes resorted for shelter or entertainment were filled with desperadoes of all sorts deserters from the army thieves coin clippers in hiding assassins elect women of the town and even worse but while i expect my reader to believe that i never sinned with them i shall find him harder to convince that i was never invited to sin such however is the fact and of course it is open to the retort that you do not invite a drunkard to be drunk be that as it may i met these unfortunates upon the common ground of civility conversed with them as equals and was not only respected by them for what i was but came myself to respect them in spite of what they were virginia taught me much here with her it never was such and such is a woman of infamous life but rather such and such has a fine ear for music or can make a complicated risotto i learned with astonishment that with the most deplorable degradation of life there could consist an ability to share the interests of the most refined persons these associates of ours made no secret of their avocations except to the police nor were they abashed or confounded if i happened to meet them in the exercise of them but business done they were to be treated like mr councillor or my lady nor was this an arbitrary exaction or a curious foppery on their part not at all but as they expected to be taken so they behaved themselves there was not i am bound to say one of those women who did not hear mass three times a week recite the daily rosary confess herself take the sacrament nor do i remember a single man of those whom i met in various houses of call or thieves kitchens in the town who was without his mental activity of some honest kind who had not a shrewd interest in politics a passion for this or that science as botany mineralogy or optics or an appreciation keenly critical of the fine arts philosophers too some of them were acute reasoners sophists casuists we had no doubts fears or suspicions of them and they thought no evil of us some of them we invited to a reading in our tower and once we enacted the aminta with great applause beltramo a very engaging boy afterwards hanged for highway robbery and prison breaking violante an unfrocked priest called il corvo virginia and i took parts beltramo i never saw again but once and that against my will i saw him hanged at genoa in a curious life indeed which to one so addicted to research into the ways of men as i always was would have needed violence for its termination violence indeed did end it and with humiliating detail one day i sold my cloak to buy a book that was a vellum bound copy of the sonnets of cino of pistoja which with my autograph fr strelleius pistoriae iv kal aug mdccxxii i still possess in my present retreat at lucca cino had been a famous poet in his day the lover of the beautifully named selvaggia vergiolesi who had in fact lived in our romantic tower i thought that the opportunity of becoming acquainted on the very spot with the mind of a man who must so often have sighed and sung upon it was well worth an unnecessary garment the volume mine and a few pence besides i purchased bread wine and sausage and made virginia a feast we banqueted first on sausage next on poetry and revelled so late in the latter that we exhausted our stock of candle and had none left for the exigencies or possibilities of the night tired out and in the dark we sought our proper ends of the long room i who lay below the window immediately fell into a deep sleep i was awakened by a dream of suffocation imprisonment and loss to find that of such pains i was literally a sufferer a thick woollen was over my mouth and nose the knees of some monstrous heavy man were on my chest cords were being circled and knotted about my hands and arms my feet were already bound so fast that the slightest movement of them was an agony dumb blind bound what could i do but lie where i was the work was done swiftly in the pitchy dark and in silence so profound that i could hear virginia's even breathing separated as she was from me by the length of a long floor there was but one effort i could make with my tied ankles and that was to raise both legs together and bring the heels down with a thud upon the boards the cords cut me to the bone the effect upon virginia was precisely nothing when i was reduced to a mere chrysalis having cords wound all over my body which glued my arms to my flanks i was lifted like a bundle and lowered by a rope through the window to the ground the descent for i spun round and round with horrible velocity made me extremely giddy probably i lost my senses for a time my next discovery was of being carried swiftly over the ground by one who ran rather than walked of my captor mounting what i supposed to be the city wall with me on his back dropping lightly on the other side and running again on and on the river was crossed for i heard the pounding and splashing the bank was mounted i was now crossing furrowed ground heaven knew whither i was a long time the thief climbed a hill i heard him labouring his breath and felt the heat come up from his body like the sun in the dog days from a paved courtyard i was too uncomfortable too perturbed too much enraged over the fact to spend much thought on what the fact might mean was i taken for a soldier then why such a mystery about it i had seen men crimped in the open piazza out of wine shops from the steps of churches what then was my fate i was soon to learn after what i think to have been an hour and a half's journey my captor puffing for breath stopped and put me down on grass porca madonna cried a strident voice i'm not so young as i was or you have grown fat in pistoja the fatter the better for me then i knew that i had been kidnapped by fra palamone chapter xv i am in bondage the woolly gag removed i said in the dark fra palamone so sure as god lives and reigns you shall pay me for this he replied my dear lad i am paid already and twice paid it is the certain conviction that i am hereafter to be much blessed in your society that has forced me to take this liberty may i now have the pleasure of setting you free it wounds me in my tenderest part to know how these cords must bruise you your aching wounds my aching heart come a fair exchange be free and set me free a great shadow of him settled down over my eyes the impending bulk of his huge body heat and garlic came in waves about me his furnace breath not yet fra palamone i said firmly you will do well to leave me as i am until i know more of your intentions you used the word 'freedom' just now how am i to understand it i warn you that so far as i know the first use i shall make of my freedom will be to kill you i meant it at the time for i was beside myself with rage he began to swear gently to himself walking to and fro before my feet coupling as his manner was the names of his maker redeemer and divine advocate with those of dishonourable animals having thus eased himself as a pump gets rid of foul water in the pipes before its uses can begin he began to answer my objections if to have the play of young limbs the prerogative of two footed creation be not liberty said he then there is no liberty in the world and if to be loosed from sin and shame by means however abrupt be not liberty of the most exalted spiritual kind then young man you are a bondslave indeed to your own ignoble desires i said i have told you on what terms i will take my liberty i will die here as i am sooner than make bargains with you i am an old man he replied a weary of my labours i will not wrangle i abhor disputations i am able to offer you don francis a service which is perfect freedom will you take it or leave it i was silent and i believe the old villain went to sleep as certainly i did youth will have its rest whether there be gall in the mouth or a teat when i awoke it was broad day the sun was up and deepening the pale tints of the sky a bird in the oak tree overhead was singing his orison and fra palamone cooking a pork chop upon a little fire of twigs never did i see such delicate art put into such a piece of work he had not boasted when he said that he was a cook not only did he cook it to the exquisite point of perfection but he ate it bone and all combining the zest of a cannibal with the epicure's finer relish and poured near a litre of wine down his tunnel of a throat before he deigned to regard whether i lived or was dead his next act was to recite the rosary aloud on his knees with intense fervour and his next after three prostrations in honour of the trinity to untie the cord about his middle and add a knot or two to the multitude already there with this formidable scourge circling about in his hand he came to where i lay helpless ser francesco he said showing his long tooth and purring his words like a cat i find that bonds imprisonment and hunger have not quickened your resolution i admire you for it but meantime i suffer the rage of the devil i must assuage my pains at all costs and regret that my balm must be your bane but since you elect to be a prisoner it seems reasonable that you should taste prison discipline and i o heaven inflict it i marked his infernal purpose in his eyes no need that he should bare his iron arm and determined to endure even unto death sooner than give way to him he came towards me his arm bare to the shoulder i clenched my teeth shut my eyes and waited not for long the cords writhed about me like snakes of fire biting so deeply that my very heart seemed torn and raw the blood surged into my head beat at my ears and nose and as it seemed gushed out in a flood drowning me in wet heat so presently i lost my senses neither knew nor felt any more blessed art thou death aurelia hath surely sent thee were my last thoughts as i swooned waking once more i was alone lying bound on the edge of a little oak wood before me were brown fields and stretches of flickering heat and far below in the valley i could see pistoja pale red and white in the full sun it was near noon the sun was directly overhead in a cloudless sky and his rays burned me up my head throbbed desperately my body felt one free wound i was sick with hunger clogged with drouth i made sure that i had been left there to die and waited momently for the summoning angel commending my simple soul to the advocacy of the blessed virgin and the merits of my patron st francis of assisi i thought with a pang of my mother who might be praying for me now beside her hallowed image even aurelia's was dim then all visions faded out out of the midst of that glaring sky there beamed as it appeared to me a ray of intense light which grew steadily to an intolerable radiancy i believed it to be the sword of god in st michael archangel's hand held out to give me the accolade and make me cavalier of paradise god and our lady my soul's voice cried an unearthly note of trumpet music responded to my call beginning very far away and swelling in volume of sound until all the air seemed vibrant with it then said my soul in manus tuas domine jesu and i knew nothing more and yet again i awoke in the level light of early evening unspeakably refreshed free from bonds and little more than stiff in the limbs fra palamone was by my side a cup of broth in his hands drink this poor suffering francis he said as gently as a woman henceforth all shall be harmony betwixt me and thee he put the basin to my lips and lifted my head on his knee that i might drink more at ease it was a strong invigorating stuff with a cordial in it i know not of what kind had it been vitriol i had been too weak to refuse it it brought my vigour back in a tide i sat up fra palamone began to talk with more candour and fair reason than his late exploits warranted he said that a great danger greater than my ignorance of this country would allow me to guess had threatened me of late had come to his knowledge in florence and had been forestalled by himself under the merciful guiding of heaven at the last moment the government of tuscany owing to the dotage of the grand duke and the wicked influence of donna violante over her brother in law the grand prince gastone was impotent there was no police but indeed a flagrant anarchy abroad where private malice stalked in the cloak of justice and the passions of evil men had scope for the utmost indulgence great men did as they chose which was to do evil the most unnatural debauchery obtained the grand prince gastone ran spoiling about the country a satyr heading a troop of satyrs no honest person was safe from ruin he told me that i had been remarked in pistoja and my name and origin guessed at they knew me as consorting with profligates and criminals and accused me of having stolen a young girl from the marchese semifonte upon whose estate she had been born and bred it was said that i had brought her to dishonour the laws were to be put in operation against me or what masqueraded as laws worse than death would have been my portion had he not intervened and saved me he had been ill advised perhaps in the manner of doing but i was to reflect was not secrecy essential he owned that my obstinate refusal of his company had angered him stretched as he was by anxiety to the point of laying violent hands upon me with his girdle these cords he said which were meant to remind us of our humility are too convenient ministers of our lust but the remedy for my great offence is easy he again took off the girdle and put it in my hands he took off his habit and knelt before me in a woollen shirt smite don francis said he and fear nothing smite in token of forgiveness as you are generous smite i hope he found me generous enough for i did smite him with all my force whether he felt forgiven or no this did me a power of good i had the satisfaction of cutting his shirt to ribbons and of drawing blood from him a satisfaction which now seems to me wholly unlike my nature and quite unworthy of my position he bore it with exemplary cheerfulness singing sacred songs softly to himself only pausing in these pious exercises to encourage me to hit him harder hey but that was a shrewd one that went home nerve yourself don francis courage and resolve a little lower my son nearer to the buttock there a proud patch there ho ho but you're into it and so on at the end when i sank back exhausted bathed in sweat he sprang towards me put his arms about me and kissed me dear francis beloved friend he said warmly how can old palamone thank you enough for your noble work by devoted service it is yours by more than brotherly love you have it one thing at least is clear we can never be separated after this nothing could be clearer to me than that we must be separated immediately but i did not think it wise to dash his hopes until i found out how far he had lied i wished to learn also what he wanted of my company i told him therefore that supposing his tale about me to be true in general in particular it was most false so far from having injured virginia i said i had saved her from destruction and if the marchese did indeed claim her as his property the very first thing i had to do was to defeat his purpose since that was the root of my partnership with her i explained my position and hers to him as well as i could and condescended for her sake to bargain with the old wretch since you palamone i said desire my company though heaven alone knows why you do desire it i will agree to share my journey with you so far as florence whither i shall go immediately but not on any account without virginia i have charged my conscience with her honour and am inflexible on that point if you won't agree to this you must follow your own devices and may attempt whatever atrocity occurs to you that is my firm decision which no suffering can relax fra palamone all smiles made no difficulties he would fetch virginia that very night and we would set off the next morning for prato where there was a great church ceremony which he must by all means attend then we would go to florence full of friends of his he assured me who would make the weeks fly for my amusement trust me my dear brother he said you will never repent having made the acquaintance of your old palamone i expressed with the utmost plainness my astonishment at the pains he was at to get my society my dear francis he said raising his eyebrows as if in despair of making me understand his whim what greater proofs of my affection can i give you i have flayed your back and allowed you to flay mine i have filled your mouth with wool and carried you like a bale for three leagues in the middle of the night and you ask me why i can only say that i have a liking for you you are spirited pious ingenuous and well read as a man of many trades and accomplishments i shall find you useful in a hundred ways you will understand that before we have been in prato half an hour honestly my friend i have twice tried to serve you in difficulties and each time you have obstinately refused to acknowledge it now for a third time i am going to oblige you consider whether i am altogether undeserving consider it when i am gone for your virginia i had nothing else half so interesting to do i pondered his acts towards me over and over again but could not for the life of me fit them into any reasonable relation to himself that he meant to make profit out of me was certain he lived for profit but how by selling me into slavery had his explanations to the customs house men at the frontier been pure falsehood i knew that the grand duke cosimo was surrounded by miserable young men of all colours tongues and sizes gathered from every quarter of the globe that was a humour of his which all his toadies and sycophants tried to indulge probably his collection lacked an englishman but even as i hotly determined that it should for ever lack one sooner than possess me i remembered that this mad prince lay dying palamone must needs know that and then what sort of a price did he hope for from a man with the death rattle rising in his throat did the heir apparent the grand prince gastone intend to maintain the collection it was possible of some monstrous villainy of the sort i vehemently suspected fra palamone and am the more glad therefore to record that in this particular case i did him a wrong he came back in good time with virginia who her eyes alight sprang towards me and snatched at my hands i let her kiss them and was sincerely glad to see my friend again we devoured each other with questions had she been in danger of the marchese she blushed at the supposition and asked me what i was thinking her had she been alarmed on my account no not at first but later she had been making inquiries had i been uneasy i confessed that i had fra palamone with some magnanimity left us alone for the best part of an hour he sat i remember on the edge of the hill looking towards pistoja reading his breviary well removed from earshot this gave virginia opportunity to exhibit her view of his behaviour we had better travel with him for a while she said he is known all over the country for a desperate rascal but is privy to too many secrets to be apprehended nobody dares lay him by the heels for fear of what he will divulge and the more you thwart him the more risk you run he might easily kill you in a rage he thinks no more of stabbing a man than of skewering a sausage i grant you that your suspicions do him no wrong he would sell you in a moment to any one who would buy you but they are groundless it is quite plain what he wants he sees that you are a foreigner of good birth and position he knows you for a truant on an escapade being certain that there will be hue and cry after you a large reward offered he means to keep you under his eye until the price is high enough to tempt him then he will produce you and get the bounty call him brigand say he holds you to ransom you will be right meantime he will make you useful as you will see when we are in prato me too he will use but not as you might suppose his one passion is money his besetting sins are gluttony and rage he has no other appetites i believe for myself i shall serve him as well as i can and i advise you to do the same ways of escape will occur to us by and by i could see that she was right here was his plan infinitely creditable to him compared to the other i promised virginia that i would humour him for the present and just then the man himself came to us with two chickens some cheese a flat loaf and a bottle of excellent red wine grown as he told me upon the grand duke's podere at poggio a cajano we had a cheerful meal and separated for the night in high good humour chapter xvi virginia and i fall out but are reconciled i confess that i have never been able to feel the force of that argument which says for example that because a man is a sheep stealer he must needs be a bad husband as well might one set out to prove that a parricide must inevitably prove an indifferent cook in the person of fra palamone of whose scoundrelly proclivities i had had more than an inkling already it is undoubtedly true that many agreeable qualities were to be found he was to use my illustration again an admirable cook he was a good talker a companionable man a kindly host having got my measure as it were and won of me by persuasion what he had failed to win by force he was sensible enough to see that if he wished to keep me he must curb his vile passion of rage and so for a while he did trudging our road to prato early in the morning he was very gay virginia stepped along by my side a free moving young creature who never seemed to tire but he struck out in front of us most of the time singing at the top of his voice very discreditable songs or with a joke salutation sarcasm or criticism for everybody we passed on the way wearying of this because as he said it was poor work fencing with bunglers he kept us closer company for the rest of the journey and was most entertaining he talked he joked he told tales he told lies he was shrewd caustic tender witty extravagant uproarious turn and turn about but he never lost sight of his aim probably there never was a man of looser conversation who kept a tighter hold upon the direction of his discourse the end of all his oratory came when he made us his pupils as he called us acquainted with his plans this festa he said whither we go will bring all the world to prato if it have not done so already and as this same world is the orange which i and you my apprentices propose to suck let us lose no time in getting our teeth well into the rind in this way namely there are three days' junketing before us to which we will minister exactly what the revellers need tomorrow when they translate the blessed remains of santa caterina de' ricci we shall sell objects of devotion to the faithful as we were now sitting by the roadside for our midday meal he produced a variety of objects from a bag at his feet observe he continued these images lilies bambini nourishing matrons curly headed deacons these flaming hearts these hearts stuck upon swords a holy traffic indeed here too and he extricated a budget tied in blue tape ribbon are the lives of all the frati worthy of record and of a good few between you and me and this damsel not to be found recorded here in this napkin is everything requisite to make santa caterina de' ricci the happiest of dead ladies as portraits of her mother of her mother's sisters of her father and all his relatives of the young man who drowned himself at pontassieve for her love and of that other young man who on the contrary did not but made himself a priest and became her spiritual director here are the palace in which she was born the escutcheon of the de' ricci which she despised her governess's house the convent where she made her vows and the cell where if she did not die she might very easily have died here you have the great doctors and captains of the dominican order here is albert the great here seraphic thomas here murdered peter here catherine here rose admirable engravings as you see mostly after the admired john here then is our day's work cut out for us a happy toil on the next having done our humble service to the souls of all these persons we must be careful not to forget their bodily needs i shall exercise my skill in dentistry for trifling rewards and you my young aesculapius will prove to others as you have already proved to me that the strong wrist and willing arm are not lacking among your personal endowments i am persuaded that these duties will occupy the whole of the second day for prato will be full to suffocation by that time and there will hardly be a head whose recesses we may not have to explore by these means having secured as i hope the public confidence the time will be ripe for my great design after worship relaxation the release from pain after pain pleasure comes on that third day my children we will set up a faro bank the profits of which if skill be employed will more than counterbalance what we have cheerfully lost in our efforts to do good the reward i say is certain and who shall call it undeserved not i for one now children to the road once more happy fortunes attend us pray for old palamone who loves you dearly and thinks about you night and day he got up as he was finishing this speech of his and took to the road before i could object as i did object to some of his propositions but i told virginia that i intended to leave him at prato and push on to florence as i had no intention of helping him cheat his neighbours what i cried a strelley of upcote a gentleman and an old catholic to clown it in a fair never in the world virginia walking staidly beside me considered this outburst in silence before she delivered herself 'you speak she then said as i would have you speak but not at all as you have decided to speak you cannot at one and the same moment be francesco of upcote and francesco ignoto you cannot exalt yourself and degrade yourself if you choose to be a gentleman why did you discard your coat i laughed at her my child said i on your showing a man cannot be a gentleman in his bed or in his bath but she held to her opinion i think you understand me very well you choose to go a pilgrimage to encounter dangers and humiliations and yet the moment a fine one is proposed to you you jump back after your gentleman's estate you tell me that you have peddled crucifixes what more does palamone expect of you be what you choose don francis kiss me or kiss your aurelia go afoot or in a coach beg or give sink or swim you have two hands you will say it is true but you have only one person if with a fistful of gold in your right hand you go about begging with your left you will be contemptible as well as ridiculous i agree with that i said but here again said she breaking in upon me you have a choice and it is obvious i am not able to speak for donna aurelia or so you will tell me but i will give a great golden heart to the girdle of prato that while she may love a ridiculous don francis she will turn her back on the other love i said echoing her love my good girl of what are you speaking donna aurelia love me you must be mad it is certain that i must be she replied unless it is your honour who is mad pray let me understand what it is that you want of the lady when you find her her pardon i said and made her furious she glared bit her lip stamped with arms tight folded to restrain her heaving chest she stopped short and nodded her words into me one by one as if she were directing artillery at a siege well very well don francis she said then i tell you plainly that you will find misery and her together if you propose to pray at her feet instead of taking her in your arms she of siena she of siena my word you will be miserable and make her miserable i told her to be quiet but she would not she grew wild staring about and straining out her arms i will be no party to this folly i will not i will not she said half to herself but palamone was listening with a comical wry face rubbing his beard she took no notice i know better than you what a girl needs and what her rights are one woman to humour your whims is enough i should hope look at me look at me don francis i had never seen her in this state before a beautiful starving creature like some wild thing baulked of her desire her eyes were gaunt she held out her hands to me i was much concerned it was really palamone who got her to be quiet he came and touched her on the shoulder have patience my daughter he said and added some quick words under his breath whose sense was lost to me meantime a little company of passers by had collected about us and watched for the event we will not discuss our affairs before these citizens said the frate more especially as the lady whose name you toss to and fro is not here to applaud or condemn no doubt but you will find her in prato if as you say she is of the sienese nation why to the translation of the blessed remains are to come donna violante wife of the grand prince and donna camilla pallavicini his mistress next to a saint a grand duke's mistress would draw every woman in siena and we are to have both the thing is not worth discussion she will be there hey then children avanti we went on without any more words virginia all her spirit gone out of her presented the most woebegone appearance it would have been evident to me that she was deeply ashamed of herself had i not been too incensed to think anything about her we entered the town of prato about five o'clock in the evening and found it crammed to the walls with sightseers and those who expected to offer them sights the piazza was like the camp about a fair the inns were like anthills the very churches were full on the morrow was to be the great procession of religious to enact the translation of the remains no lodgings were to be had better than a stall in the stable of the sparrow hawk there it was that we established our camp and that done i left my companions and wandered alone about the town hardly hoping and not able to find my beloved remote and much injured aurelia late at night i returned and threw myself upon the straw which was to be my bed i was tired and fell asleep at once but not comfortably restlessness possessed me i turned and tossed about was distressed by dreams of incredible and fruitless labours and of mental anguish whose cause i could not define presently after i was awakened by a sense of something touching my feet and lay for a time awake wondering what it might be some person or another was touching me there softly very softly and in kindness i heard gentle whispering i felt the touch as of velvet on my feet and then a drop fell warm and wet i said who are you who kiss my feet and was answered it is i virginia my lord what do you there virginia i asked her what do you need of me your pardon she said and i heard her crying softly to herself in the dark my child i said and held out my hand to her you know that i am no man to have pardons worth a woman's accepting but i can assure you of aurelia's pity and pardon for what you have said against her draw near and you shall have it from my hands the straw rustled as she crept on hands and knees towards me her face encountered my hands and rested between them it was burning hot and so were her lips which kissed my palms alternately and thirstily as if she were lapping water forgive me my lord forgive me she urged me oh i am dreadfully ashamed forgive me this once i am wretched child i said think no more of it i have no grudge against you all my thoughts are kindly lie down virginia and sleep our friendship is too strong for a tiff to break it she kissed my palms again and again and crept off the straw i heard her shut the door of the stable after her where she passed the night i know not but i remarked that in our subsequent wanderings she never let me know how or where she did sleep she met me next morning her usual cool nonchalant reasonable self chapter xvii ercole at the fair if needs must have it that i was to accommodate crime by falling into it myself it would appear that i was to do it with a certain air when i awoke i found a very decent suit of black prepared for me against the proceedings of the day a ribbon for my hair shoes shoebuckles silk stockings ruffles a neat cravat edged with lace thus attired i was to be fra palamone's secretary and lieutenant to hold his devotional objects pass them about for inspection praise them discreetly and take the money virginia was to play the country girl who by simple ardour and appropriate questioning was to excite general interest and stimulate the sale she too had a new gown and stomacher and looked so well that the frate said it was quite on the cards that half his stock would be bought for her by enamoured contadini and thus brought into circulation over and over again it was noticeable that far less time was spent upon her instructions than upon mine fra palamone was not at all sure how far i should prove amenable crime however by which i mean an unfailing fount of ready lying was a more difficult accomplishment than i had reckoned it i had no notion when i began what hard work it could be it was not for want of an exemplar for although fra palamone sweated as he lied it would be impossible to relate the quantity the quality or quiddity of his lies their variety was indeed admirable but apart from that they shocked me not a little for i could not but see that as ready a way as any of discrediting true religion is to overcredit it and that where people believe in a miracle to give them a glib hundred is to tempt them to infidelity because it might be true as i undoubtedly believe it to be that st francis of assisi floated between pavement and rafters that were no reason for pronouncing that santa caterina de' ricci could stroke the chimney pots or if one thought it possible that st antony of padua preached to the fishes of the sea i contend that one would not be supported but rather discouraged in the opinion by hearing that santa caterina de' ricci argued with eels in the stew pan but the melancholy fact remains to be told that haranguing all day long the wilder grew the anecdotes of palamone the brisker was his trade virginia also i freely own acted her part superbly with a lisp and a trick of sucking her fingers for one batch an o la for another which brought in showers of purchasers she presently took a fit of bargaining by mere caprice i believe in which she was so keen that she beat down fra palamone to half his prices and set an example which made him desperately angry as for me i fell into entire disgrace almost at the outset for when an old countryman asked me whether it was true that roses of sharon were good for the stone unthinkingly i replied that prayer was better cospetto cried my man and cheaper too many thanks to you for an honest young gentleman fra palamone ordered me to resume my old part of deaf mute the procession of the day which of course put an end to all marketing for the time began at half after ten with high mass set for eleven o'clock it was a pompous business the nuns of san vincenzio two and two with lighted tapers their friends of the world ladies in hoops and feathers attendant cavaliers donna violante widow of the grand prince ferdinand deceased a stout black eyed woman of middle age under dressed and over painted she had a court about her of half a dozen gentlemen twice that number of ladies and three black boys to hold her train donna camilla pallavicini may have been there but i did not see her the clergy followed then the bishop with his chaplains train bearer and acolytes torch bearers next and then the casket containing the body of the saint under a heavy crimson canopy friars of st dominic's religion closed a very fine procession having myself a fair musical ear i thought that the nuns sang badly without harmony or spirit they looked about them too with what i considered regretable freedom they talked to their friends one of them had a damerino on either side of her and one also i was constrained to notice looked fixedly in my direction with fine eyes full of knowledge but presently turned her head and passed on there was nothing flagrant nothing to be compared with what was allowed to religious in padua and venice but i was a little discontented at this nun's inspection i had observed that she was handsome and of fine person pale serious and with a high bred air while all these devotees were winding their way round about the piazza virginia and i had been sitting on a patch of grass by the roadway in the company of a country lad who became extremely friendly he was a goatherd from san benedetto in alpi he told us and had played truant for the day walking over the stony hills for some sixteen or twenty miles and intending to return the same road at night his name was ercole and that as i told him was as it should be but i added hercules served eurystheus for twelve years for one clear purpose which was that he might achieve immortality and some of us labour for the same end and others of us for ends which seem to us equally good will you tell me ercole why you have undertaken these prodigious exertions of yours ercole shrugged there is no life upon our mountains he said moreover santa caterina was a great saint as i have heard your master say just now nor can you deny it i said i do not deny it but the saints never fail us wheresoever one may dwell there are they and by the merits of holy baptism and the benefits of the mass we may be in communion with them whether we live on mountain or plain that is true said ercole yet that was a good procession i would not have missed it for two gold florins i expect that in your country you have no finer processions of priests and noble ladies of religion i am myself impassioned for religion i too was my answer but in my poor country the true faith is enmeshed in cold shrouds of unbelief we dare not have processions but cry unto god in secret and no profession is more discredited with us than that of virgin that is a terrible thing you tell me there says he what else is a girl to do if she cannot marry the man of her heart we have our compensations i replied we worship in the dark hoping to be rewarded in the full light of heaven persecution has braced us the church had grown lax with us for instance you would never see religious behave as here they do did you observe that nun that looked me full in the face as the procession went by ercole's eyes flashed but he said nothing i went on that would be impossible in my country i can assure you pardon me says ercole you misunderstood the lady it was not at you that she looked certainly it was not said virginia with decision she looked at me the boy said and i looked at her she knew that i should be here ho said i and virginia said gia ercole then explained that lady is donna domenica degli onesti who was daughter of my master the marchese onesti when i was dog keeper to him at bogazzano she was always there being in delicate health and we loved each other from the first there was no doubt at all about the matter how could there be any doubt said virginia but ercole took no notice of her there was no doubt she jumped whenever i came round the corner and used to stand behind trees watching me also she used to come to see the dogs fed now when i knew beyond all question the state of her feelings i borrowed guido's guitar and struck one chord upon it at night under her window and sang but one word vieni in three minutes she came on to the balcony and we looked at each other there was a moon and we could see quite well we stood looking like that for five minutes without a syllable spoken and then i went away i went away before she did so the thing was clear after that i called my vieni every night and every night she came sir you saw how fine she was with a face of dawn and great eyes and the mournful air of a saint in the sky there never was such a good love as ours in the world since the days of antonio and cleopatra of blessed memory it lasted all one summer but she was turned of sixteen by then and her father the marchese wished her to marry naturally i forbade that you i cried and again virginia nodded and said gia you may say so said ercole what else could i do and naturally also she preferred the convent i bade her farewell in the garden she allowed me then to touch her hand i said 'addio madonna' and she 'addio ercole' and then i left her standing there that was five years ago since then i have seen her once a year this is the fifth time and when will the sixth time be i asked him immediately he said when the procession returns but ercole is this tolerable i objected is it humane to donna domenica virginia turned upon me here to her she cried fiercely to her why what else could she do what else should i should any woman do immediately she had said this i could see that she wished she had not she blushed and hung her head it is not too easy said ercole but it was best under the circumstances imagine her in the arms of a man it is not conceivable on the other hand one is not jealous of the cross and she knows that i should not come to see her if i had not been faithful and you have spoken for what do you take me i have never spoken to her more than once in the garden or at a less distance than ten braccia except when i touched her hand also i used to say vieni and she came but no more but when she was asked in marriage and you forbade it then she told me herself that she supposed i wished her to take the veil and i nodded my head i was forced to admit his strength of purpose you are a great lover i said that is certain i am a lover also but not at all in your way ercole said i have only done what any man would do who loved a lady don francis would never say vieni said virginia with a snap looking up quickly then the lady would never come said ercole i was silent condemning in my heart what my wits could not gainsay ercole saw his donna domenica again she passed with the returning procession and again looked full and mournful knowledge on her lover he neither blushed nor saluted her but met her eyes steadily and did not follow her retreating figure in the hope that she would turn her head nor did she turn it he seemed perfectly cheerful afterwards and disposed to sleep he said that he should take another day in prato so as to get a little fun of the fair they had no fairs at san benedetto in alpi chapter xviii fra palamone breaks the law and i my chain for his second day's campaign when he set up as a dentist in spectacles and a fine black beard fra palamone chose me to be arrayed in a loose punchinello suit of red cotton covered with the signs of the zodiac in tinsel for said he mystery is half our battle won beforehand hermes trismegistus himself had not been the philosopher he was if he had been understood and to this day aristotle is undervalued not for saying what he meant but for saying it all he gave me a peaked felt hat for my head and exhorted me to have no fears tooth drawing he said is as easy as kissing any day reflect francis upon this and let it be your comfort throughout the coming conflict that there is no jaw bone in the head of mortal man so strong as his wrist with your wrist and elbow you can knock a man down but show me the jaw that will do so much i will say nothing of samson who is not in debate moreover his weapon was borrowed and his enemies were god's enemies now here is another fact full of encouragement for you the stronger a man is in the jaw the harder he will pull against your forceps pray what chance has a tooth the most rooted against your pull and the patient's not the faintest out it comes and there is one poor sufferer the less in prato courage then pull and pull again i promised him that i would pull my stoutest but curtly declined his suggestion that i should try my hand upon virginia's mouth although she made no demur sooner should prato swim in blood i said than i lay violent hands upon my friend and in blood swam prato that day and fra palamone bathed in it eloquently he called himself conqueror of pain and piled up his captures like the trophies of a roman triumph i can still hear the soul congealing yell with which he hailed every new token of his prowess and still see the packed piazza surge as it was swept by it like corn in a breeze woe unto you heathen masticator he would cry holding high the forceps and its victim woe unto you when you meet palamone tyrant of pain blessed be the pincers and the fork which have gained the celestial paradise for sant' agnese and the terrestrial for this worthy man i tell you signori he would say looking round upon the gaping company i would rather be in this man's shoes than in the grand duke's or in those of my blood brother in god the patriarch of venice ha he will break up larks' bones this night and where are the sheep's trotters to deny him entry where are the walnuts or the peach stones whose kernels are removed from him ahi signori do you think if signor dives had had so wholesome a mouth he would have left to lazarus the bones not he but the pith of every one of them had gone to make him sleeker avanti signori avanti let the next in torment come up he had abundant custom and seemed never to tire but my turn came at last introduced by a string of panegyric which spoke of me as the nerve acrobat the lodestone of ivory the electrical indian boy at whose touch teeth flew from their sockets and tartar dissolved in smoke pale but with resolution i grasped the weapon which he handed me to my consternation and half undoing i saw in the chair the sinewy form and honest brown face of ercole the heroic lover he saluted me with a smile and wave of the hand he was here to encourage me he said every man must make a beginning and there was nothing like a friendly face very much unnerved i asked him which tooth he proposed to lose whichever you prefer he said i am here ready take this one for instance he tapped a fine grinder in his lower jaw i asked him did it pain him why no he said it doesn't in a manner ache but it will give you some trouble i believe and i'm quite ready to oblige a friend with whom i have shared confidences take your pleasure of my mouth by all means i recommend this one as a twister displaying here two rows of pearls he tapped the biggest of them and awaited my attack i would sooner starve than touch such beauty as this i said please yourself he replied but observe by your refusal i lose three pauls there's a matter of a wager between me and a friend which shall let the most blood moreover my young apprentice said fra palamone with severity you shall understand that breaking your covenant with me involves the breaking of my stick upon your back via says ercole where is your nerve master do you think i haven't time enough at san benedetto to grow a fresh crop a terrible struggle ensued but ercole won his wager with ease public confidence being now thoroughly established in fra palamone's view he opened his faro bank on the last day of the fair with virginia and me for decoys to all appearance a young married couple from the sea board who were to play and win ten florins i was dressed more or less as a gentleman of the provinces and looked i doubt not like a clown in a white flowered silk vest white breeches and stockings and a coat of full green velvet i carried a sword my hair in a bag my hat under my arm virginia on the other hand looked very handsome in her high necked damask dress her hair done upon the top of her head with a little powder and a patch at the corner of her mouth we were given a page in attendance who was the son of an apothecary in the town and made our ten florins with ease that being all the bargain we spent the rest of the day as we chose which was not punting against fra palamone he must have made sixty times that amount towards evening the piazza grew very gay an opera was given at the theatre after which the ladies of the place took the air walking up and down with their gentlemen drolls marionettes quack doctors a strolling company of comedians from venice tumblers and jugglers were holding their performances before great assemblies of the meaner sort but the gentry kept the middle of the square and there too virginia and i in our finery braved it with the best it was remarkable to me to see how easily and simply she carried herself in a dress and a company entirely strange to her she had no mauvaise honte for she made no pretence she was not self conscious for she deceived nobody she did not smirk nor make herself in any way ridiculous she was still herself put in a position where as she had the wit to see staidness was the natural thing therefore staid she was i would have defied any fine gentleman of london to have known her for the little half naked peasant she had been but one day ago of course in prato the truth was to be known at a glance there was nobody there i suppose who could not have picked out her village nor did she attempt to conceal it you dress me like a lady for your purposes she would say you may depend upon me to do my best clear minded brave honest noble hearted virginia how well i remember thee at this hour and have i not cause should i not be grateful am i not ah but god knoweth that i am now as we were promenading in that company i chanced to see fra palamone talking under a lamp to a tall spare gentleman splendidly dressed in tawny velvet and gold lace i observed in particular that he had a long pale harassed face a hooked nose and eyes so light in colour that they seemed almost white his hands were exceedingly restless always fidgeting with something and he himself for ever on the start to go seemed not so much listening to as enduring the tale told him some person of consequence he evidently was for two lacqueys stood near him one holding his cloak another his sword and gloves twice we had passed up and down at no great distance from him before i asked carelessly of virginia who is the frate's noble friend she did not answer me at once but pressed my arm and walked rather faster when we were beyond the company of promenaders she said i have seen those two for a long time and know that gentleman very well it is the marchese semifonte to whom my village and my family and i myself belong body and soul the poor girl was trembling though she spoke steadily enough and looked at me with unfaltering eyes but she was grave and i horrified but what i began what do you mean child the marchese your oh horrible thought is this the blackest treachery fra palamone finds me in his way said virginia and wishes to have you to himself in florence he thinks that i know too much about him and has told the marchese that i am here he wishes to get rid of me by some simple means nor could he have hit upon a better well she said looking gently at me i am in your hands shall i go i hurried her off at once to our inn the sparrow hawk where i was lucky enough to find the padrona monna bianca by name she was a buxom woman of forty summers good tempered an excellent manager of house and husband and not unreasonably proud of her discernment she had found me out she had told me in the twinkling of an eye i was a gentleman either english or irish and as she put it had my leg in the wrong bed supposing my affair to be one very common to her experience she had begun by deploring my weakness for virginia whom she had called robaccia cosa di niente and the like but i had cut her short by telling her the whole of my own story and part of the girl's she had at once admitted her mistake begged my pardon taken a fancy to me and now proved a good friend in this urgent need i told her the shameful turn of affairs and begged her to take care of virginia while i was employed in challenging the marchese to fight and if possible in running him through the body i said that if she had had the eyes to see my masquerade it was not to be supposed that semifonte would misunderstand me but she stopped me at once do no such thing don francis said she you will be attacking the wrong man the marchese is no better than he should be but he is perfectly galant' uomo and would throw no sort of difficulty in your way but you are crediting him with too much zeal he has many irons in the fire as we say and after all miss virginia is not the only wench in the world per bacco said virginia that's true your aim monna bianca continued should be that old sack of iniquity fra palamone the most wily audacious rogue of a friar in all a friar ridden land now i'll help you there i and your virginia together leave us don francis leave us alone for a while take the air avoid the marchese and by the morning you shall hear some news such indeed proved to be the case the grand duke cosimo it seems on the pressure of his friends the jesuits had published an edict which was then in full force that any man entering a house where a marriageable woman might be living could be arrested and imprisoned without trial footnote mr strelley is perfectly right one of the first acts of gian gastone cosimo's successor was to repeal this preposterous decree the first and only good thing that i ever heard of him m h by means of this monna bianca and virginia laid fra palamone by the heels the girl was sent to spend the night with monna bianca's sister in law who lived with her husband a notary public and own sister in the suburbs of prato just outside the porta fiorentina thither fra palamone went in pursuit of his infamous plans and there he was found by the sbirri of the holy office the case was clear enough against him for i need not say that there was no love lost between the frate and the jesuits much as may be urged against that learned body of politicians no one has ever laid a pandering to profligacy or chicane to their account the sister of monna bianca's sister in law was a marriageable woman fra palamone was in the house with her and was there caught by the inquisition and haled off to their house of correction virginia and i set out at liberty to florence decently clad decently shod with the remains of our ten florins in my breeches pocket i remember monna bianca's parting advice very well farewell don francis it was good luck to you and this honest girl pursue your aurelia as ardently as you will you are only doing after your age and degree in the world let me advise you to write to padua for your portmanteau and effects you will love your mistress none the less for a good coat to your back nor she you i promise you besides i believe in a gentleman living as a gentleman marry off your miss virginia who has her wits about her to your valet or to anybody else's valet who will take her your position with regard to her does you infinite credit with me but i cannot answer for madam aurelia or rather i can answer for her that it will do you precisely the reverse and i have a son of my own remember inform your father of your whereabouts in florence to meet again don francis addio that was a reasonable friendly soul but it was not to be supposed that she could understand the reverential attitude of a young man to his mistress chapter xix i am again misconceived the aspect of florence surveyed from the crags of fiesole or from that gentler eyrie of bellosguardo is one of the most enchanting visions open to the eye of man so cunningly have art and nature joined their webbing but that which can be harvested upon the road from prato is not at all extraordinary suburb there succeeds to dirty suburb the roads are quags or deep in dust the company as disagreeable as it is mean approaching the city from that side you neither know that within a short mile of you are the dome of brunelleschi the tower of giotto the david of michael angelo nor do you greatly care at least i did not being sadly out of spirits upon that day of rain steam and weariness when with the young virginia springing by my side i limped within the porta al prato and stood upon the sacred soil of the second athens quick to feel impressions too quick to read in them signs and portents i felt fatality press upon my brows a little way beyond that porta al prato within the walls there was and still is i believe a broad neglected field ragged grass and broken potsherds surrounded on three sides out of four by shabby houses taverns and garden walls it was called the prato and by the shocking discrepancy between its name and appearance added to my dejection for the one recalled and the other mocked memories of that green and sunlit plain in padua that dear pra della valle upon whose grassy dimples looked the house of aurelia and to whose wandering winds i had so often sighed her name here however the marchese corsini had a casino and loggia here stood in rows the country coaches from the north and west awaiting their times of departure here the florentines used to hold their horse races of st john's day and here finally you could be robbed strangled or stabbed any night of the year yet it boasted at least two convents of nuns among its border of untidy buildings and was destined before long to become of supreme interest to myself virginia the shrewd knew that although i did not as we passed for the first time in our lives over the littered disconsolate spot where in the heavy rain a pack of ruffians and drabs were sprawling she took care to point out one of those two convents a plain yellow house closely shuttered and by its side the red roof and rickety cross of the church appurtenant that she said is the convent of ss maria and giuseppe sul prato mark the house you should look there for your donna aurelia my dejection held me fast the rain the heavy air and fog of florence this vile prato and its company of tumbling scuffling wretches loaded me with an apathy impossible to shake off why there i asked her languidly why anywhere within these fatal walls if as you suppose and i do not suppose she has taken shelter in a convent virginia replied it will be in that convent that society is wholly of siena all the sienese arriving in florence and in need of such shelter go thither i am sure there is not a woman behind those walls who cannot tell you what 'l' andare a provenzano' means and most of them by more than hearsay yes yes either she is there or she will be there before long always supposing that she is miserable for my part i have never disguised from your honour my belief that she is not so miserable as you flatter yourself aurelia can have no place here said i heavily this is a fatal place i shall find her in siena and am minded to go there this very day better for me to have done so but florence lies dead in her road virginia persisted and by the time she had reached it she would be very ready for one of the two things florence affords and what are they virginia her oracular moods always interested me consorting so oddly with her youth pleasure or religion said she and would explain herself no further pleasure or religion it would have needed a greater than the pythian priestess to have given me hopes of either in florence and yet as we pursued our way by the borg' ognissanti towards the river i could not but be struck by the subdued aspect of the citizens who far from being the lively impertinents they had been reputed went gravely and silently about their business cloaked in sombre black they did not stand as italians love to do grouped in the piazzas chattering gesticulating and acting as much for their own amusement as for their hearers' nor did they crowd the chocolate houses where as a rule the very flies are buzzing the news it seemed to me that church doors alone stood open there were few ladies abroad and such as we saw were on the steps of the churches going in or coming out and hardly one of them but had a frate sometimes two once four in her company the number of religious was exorbitant and even more remarkable was it to observe the respect in which they were held every woman meeting one dropped him a curtsey every man saluted him my gentleman if you please hardly gave himself the trouble of acknowledging the grace i saw a couple of theatines scolding a poor lady to tears i saw another shake off a fine gentleman who ran after him to kiss his hand i saw beggars cripples sick men in litters hold out their prayers in vain i grew justly indignant florence is the place for fra palamone i said to virginia with bitter foreboding rather than for you and me it is horrible to think of aurelia with her dutiful regard for the saintly calling bending her knees to these arrogant rascals 'bacchetoni e colli torti tutti il diavol se li porti' said virginia with scornful nostrils here you see the end of a nation which shares your pietistical aptitudes you think you have god by the foot when you have the devil by the tail it is true i agreed sighing that the more i seek after god and his fairest creature the more i am encumbered by these distorted botches of his design this town swarms with frati what will you find on a carrion but flies cried she the grand duke is rotting on his bed and these are the vermin about him before long he will be dust and then it will be the turn of don gastone and frati will give place to cicisbei maybe that you won't find them any more to your liking i shall leave florence i told her so soon as i am assured of aurelia's escape from it i heard her sniff of scorn but did not care to reprove her it was not so easy to leave it as to reach it i found out i had not been two hours in my chosen lodging a decent place enough before i had a visit from the holy office the terrified landlord ushered three clerics into my room two of them dominicans with forms as big as flags to be filled up from my papers the reader knows that i had no papers the only passport i had ever had was destroyed i had no calling but that of pilgrim with which as i could not but see virginia's presence consorted oddly and the objects of my pilgrimage as i had learned by painful experience were not such as would commend themselves to the inquisition but while i hesitated virginia jumped headlong into the breach a flush of seraphic mildness suffused her cheeks her eyes sparkled like diamonds upon a madonna's crown she crossed her arms over her bosom and bowed her head most reverend sirs she said you see before you two innocents whose only faults are youth and ardent imagination attracted by the splendour of these shrines pilgrims to the holy places travellers hopeful of heaven's gate the elder of the two dominicans a pock marked long faced bitter man at once said that he saw before him nothing of the kind we see he continued a young man of foreign aspect obviously confused and you my girl who are too glib by half if you can prove your innocence to our satisfaction we shall be agreeably surprised virginia thus rudely checked in what would no doubt have proved a generous career of falsehood shuddered and bit her lip her crossed arms relaxed but her fists clenched themselves she frowned and looked dangerous my temper none of the best i took a step forward and addressed the company sirs i said plainly my passport is lost and as it was a false one it would have availed me nothing i shall tell you the truth that i am by birth an englishman of your own religion and was until lately a student of padua while there i had the fortunate misfortune to be subjugated by the charms of my tutor's lovely wife fortunate in that she raised my soul to the heights horribly unfortunate in that i presumptuous wretch dared to draw her down into peril you may spare your reproaches for i assure you they cannot sharpen mine she suffered undeservedly and i am vowed to her satisfaction i have entered your master's dominions without objection in pursuit of a pious intention that namely of making amends to a virtuous and innocent lady i have brought this young woman with me a tuscan who needs no passport i believe under the influence of another pious intention she has been in danger of ruin and i believe i have saved her from it i do not disguise from you as you see that i have sinned very grievously but i ask you to accept my assurance that i am on the road to repentance if you choose to apply to the accredited minister of my country you will no doubt receive satisfactory evidence of my standing in the world whatsoever i may deserve from her against whom i have trespassed i have done no harm to you or your master i am not accustomed to have my word doubted and shall take no steps at all to support it from outside i wish you very well and beg you to excuse me i am but newly come to florence and confess to fatigue i ended here because i saw that further discussion would be fruitless the officers it is true had listened to me gravely without any kind of expression their eyes had been fixed upon the floor or the wall they might have been statues but at the close of my periods one of them a stout breathless and foolish looking priest asked me as if i had said nothing at all but where are your papers virginia gave a sharp cry and i was certainly taken aback reverend sir i said as calmly as i was able i had hoped to have explained the pock marked dominican took up the tale it is true you have explained but you have not produced your papers explanations apart from papers are of little or no value explanations said i of the absence of papers are surely more valuable than the absence of papers and explanations alike i repeat that my own passport is lost and that my companion needs none i have now listened to your companion and to you replied the dominican the reasons which on your showing have prompted you to visit florence are connected with sin these are not creditable reasons and explain nothing i must again ask you where are your papers virginia exasperated threw up her arms and called on the madonna our papers just heaven how often is he to tell you that he has none this is idle questioning said i i cannot give you more than explanations because i have nothing more you will make me regret even so much complaisance but said the breathless priest with a comical look awry but this is very serious how are we to fill up these forms if we have no papers i cannot help you i said here it was the turn of the third officer and second dominican he was a fat faced man with a perpetual smile you have done very wrongly both of you he said looking as if he loved the thought i said i have admitted it silence said he the holy office cannot excuse a breach of the laws of which it is the guardian i break no laws sir cried i at least none that are under your care silence said the dominican i cannot believe a word that you say speak you young woman and speak the truth of what nation are you virginia looked him squarely in the face i am a subject of the grand duke's father i am of siena she had her reasons for the fib but not knowing what they were at the moment i started violently and the inquisitor turned upon me do you young man wish to make any remark i wish to say i began the dominican turned to his colleagues he denies that she is of siena therefore probably she has spoken the truth we will inscribe her so will you now tell us he asked virginia of what nation is this young man she replied he also has spoken the truth he comes from padua from padua cried the pock marked officer and the breathless priest tossed up his hands echoing a venetian subject you are wrong i said i am an english subject silence said the stern dominican you are now inscribed as a venetian subject a venetian subject from a country of profligacies and indescribable laxity of manners a venetian a comedian i am neither said i but i must observe that it is open to a venetian if such i were in a time of profound peace to enter this state a comedian said the smiling dominican in a whisper i grew red with vexation sir sir i reproved him you are making me a comedian against my will these things however being duly inscribed against me the more severe officer took up his parable the grand duke he said is clement the holy office very patient but there are bounds the laws must in all cases be observed in this case i suspect the worst pray are you two living in sin virginia cried oh father and the fact was immediately inscribed but now i was furious you break all bounds you who talk of bounds you are an abominable man the priest interposed his person and held up his fat hand these prevarications this violence will not help you it is idle to deny the evidence of our eyes ears understanding you a venetian a comedian i assure you that you are in a very serious position the landlord raised his hands and let them down with a clatter against his thighs i was silent virginia alarmed while the officers consulted together in low murmurs and the priest filled up the rest of his forms out of his own head presently the tall dominican addressed us over his spectacles as follows you have shown us no reasons whatsoever for believing a word that you say your denial of the relationship in which you obviously stand to one another is extremely flagrant nothing but your youth and the comparative candour of the female stand as your advocates thanks to them and to them alone we have decided to be more patient with you than your contumacy deserves pending further inquiries which i promise you shall be made in venice you young man will be lodged with the jesuit fathers and you girl who report yourself as of siena will be placed in charge of the nuns of ss maria e giuseppe sul prato until you can be safely returned to your nation that let me tell you will not be until you have shown signs of a less hardened disposition you will accompany us at once the seal of the inquisition shall be placed upon your effects which seem trifling the landlord is warned that he stands in danger of legal process thus were my unhappy prognostications speedily fulfilled i was helpless and knew it for a second time those whose dignified office it was to personify the charity of our redeemer showed themselves the least charitable of mankind i was chewing the sour cud of these reflections when i heard virginia thanking the officers for their paternal resolves in her regard strange girl she thanked heaven on her knees for their pious mission promised them remembrance in her prayers asked to be allowed to kiss their hands this being permitted was performed to my great disgust who saw myself disbelieved because i had spoken the truth and her believed because she had lied but when she was allowed as a grace to bid me goodbye and came to me and put her arms round my neck and kissed my cheeks crying aloud farewell thou dear companion of my shame do well fulfil the pious purposes of these fathers be sure of me sure of thyself and when i was about to reprove her smartly for her hypocrisy she quickly whispered in my ear did you read my falsehood i am to be put where aurelia will surely come courage i will find her trust your virginia and filled me with confusion i pressed her hands the true friend that she was for a moment she clung to me with passion forget me not my lord pray for me let me see you again such were her sobbed and broken prayers cut short by her unjust judges chapter xx surprising change in my fortunes father carnesecchi of the society of jesus who had charge of the penitents in the college of his order and to whom i was formally handed over by my indurate captor was a member of an old family of fiesole long settled in florence a thin threadbare humble old man who kept his eyes fixed to the earth sharply piercing intelligent eyes as they could be and did his best to keep his lips from speaking he had a trick of pinching the lower of them in the hope i suppose that the difficulty of using the upper one alone would hold him silent but it did not he talked to himself continually the habit was inveterate and as he never let go of his lower lip it was very difficult to catch what he said he was a tall man but stooped at the shoulders threw his head forward like a long necked bird and nodded as he walked beside my dominican monolith he looked what he was far from being abject and poor witted i thought that he bent his head as if it weighed down to the earth under the pitiless blows rained upon it by the inquisitor as without gesture or modulation of the voice this monstrous man unwound his tale of my iniquities which he had taken the trouble to spin like a cocoon all about my poor person if he had twisted a halter of it to hang me with i suspect that he had done what he truly desired father carnesecchi listened to it all in the dejected musing pose which i have described words of pity incessantly escaping from his partly imprisoned mouth dio mio dio buono che peccato and the like with fine shades of difference in expression according to the dark the denser dark the lurid flashes of the dominican's chiaroscuro this hireling shepherd piled up a hideous indictment made up as the reader will perceive out of his own wicked imagination i was a runaway from the venetian galleys an actor of execrable life i had seduced a sienese nun in padua and brought her with me into tuscany to sow contempt of the sacraments and rebellion against the reigning house i had openly advocated the worship of priapus had spurned the marriage vow had called one of the reigning house a tyrant and was an apologist of the paterini he concluded by saying that the holy office was deliberating upon my case and that he could not invite the jesuits to hope for my conversion since i openly boasted of being a comedian and of my preference for that deplorable way of life the holy office asked that i might be kept apart from any whom my conversation might contaminate and that my punishment should be exemplary as well as remedial to all of which father carnesecchi replied altto altro caro fratello and got rid of his monitor as soon as he could i was not conscious that he had given me a single glance of the eye did not suppose that he knew or cared whether i stood ashamed sullen indifferent or indignant under my accuser's blows anger possessed me altogether and if i thought of my new gaoler at all it was to suppose him seeing in me a subject common in his experience whose degrading punishment of stocks whip or pillory was to be stuccoed over with a mockery of religion judge therefore of my surprise when having bowed the inquisitor out of the door father carnesecchi returned to the room and putting his hand upon my shoulder said in excellent english and the tone of a loving parent and now my poor boy let me have the truth the unexpected kindness the charity the unexpected beloved speech unnerved me i flushed stammered some foolish protest burst into tears the good jesuit let my emotion have its fling kneeling then at his knees with my hands folded in his i told him the whole of my story hiding nothing at all not even virginia's ruse for obtaining sight and speech with aurelia supposing her to be in the sienese convent having laid bare every recess of my recent life and not spared myself either in the recital i went on to say that whatever might come of it i must never abandon my search for the lovely hapless innocent aurelia for as i assured him in conclusion and undoubtedly believed unless i found aurelia and received her pardon i should die and there was no justice under heaven if a man sincerely repentant were suffered to expire unredeemed my son said father carnesecchi who had nodded his way through an harangue which i had i can assure the reader treated very summarily indeed it was in a good hour that you were led to me for i am in a position to be of service to you i am no stranger to your country nor indeed to your ancient house many times have i said mass in that of your mother's family the noble house of arundell i shall be able therefore to make a good case for you with your resident at this court i can recommend you to a banker i can extenuate so far as truth will allow your follies to your parents and i can give you absolution when you have done a proper penance all these things i will do but on conditions my first is that you write respectfully and penitently to your father my next that you do the same duty to the outraged professor lanfranchi and my third that you leave your donna aurelia to me am i clear father i said you are as clear as the light of heaven i agree to all your conditions but shall beg of you one thing and that is that you do not prevent my seeing her once more i prevent nothing reasonable replied the jesuit but i will ask you this question has it ever occurred to you that as this lady never desired your ill considered advances in the first place so she may prefer to be without a renewal of them it is possible that she is not greatly obliged to you for having turned her away from house and man i was surprised i confess at his lack of discernment i had hoped i said that i had made clear the one thing above all which i ardently desired namely aurelia's reconciliation with the doctor and do you imagine said he that your seeing her will hasten that consummation i said i cannot suppose that it will retard it if a gentleman has offended a lady should he not beg her pardon you are pitching your pipe in a more reasonable key my son said the jesuit i am glad you have left your sophistries for to tell you the truth i have heard them so often that i have ceased to give them all the attention which their utterers expect the less you see of your pretty lady the better in my opinion have you given any consideration to what may be dr lanfranchi's opinions he is likely to have strong ones from what you tell me of him i said that he had been monstrous unjust to doubt aurelia in the face of my action i think your aurelia lost her little head said he but no worse i hope now my child let us have no more talking of inspiration and wings and healing fingers of ladies and anointings the church is chary of deputing these powers which she undoubtedly possesses and few ladies are likely to receive them at any rate we may leave donna aurelia's claims to them to the sacred college and turn to what is our own immediate concern now come to me and make your confiteor as you ought i have always been more quickly moved to good or evil by kindness than by severity for by nature i am diffident to excess father carnesecchi had found out that trait in my character and proved me plastic under his delicate fingers he did not refuse me the sacrament he absolved me and comforted me greatly it did not become me to be obstinate to one who gave me so much he undertook to accord the differences between aurelia and her husband if i on my part would give my word that no act of mine should endanger their future happiness if i would bind myself here he thought there would be no harm in my seeing her but he insisted that this should not be done without his express sanction he said you are one of those young men of your nation one of many i conceive who come into this country with your minds already made up as to what you will see because you are romantic you see us so because you are mystically inclined you believe us to be a race of seers because you are complex natures you complicate ours because our beauty is strange to you you think us strangely beautiful alas my dear young friend you have yet to learn your italians there is no such italy least of all tuscany as you profess to have read of in donna aurelia's simple soul i don't know the young lady but i know her kind she is undoubtedly a good hearted shrewd little housewife careful of her reputation and honestly proud of it she will make i expect a first rate if too fond mother you of course try to make a beatrice of her quite regardless of the possibility that you are not a dante or even a diotima which thank heaven she is not yet not remembering how far you are from being a socrates my dear young man i shall not forbid you her society subject of course to her own and her husband's judgment which i promise you i shall obtain beforehand seek it then by all means but seek it with circumspection remember that she will not thrive upon the fine poetry you will make of her nor will you indeed but that is your own affair seek her therefore with reasonable care for her future in two words write to her husband and for once deprive yourself of your luxurious mysteries and go to work in the light of day as for your virginia you have a fondness for female society i fancy don't trouble your head further with that little parasite his injunctions were obeyed though i could not agree with all his conclusions i wrote respectfully to my father candidly to dr lanfranchi i wrote on my knees to aurelia though as i now know padre carnesecchi put the letter into his pocket expiatory rites of a religious sort wisely recommended and cheerfully performed i omit from this narrative at their end i was set entirely at liberty and there seemed no limit to the benevolence of the society of jesus in my regard money clothes a servant were found for me a lodging in the piazza santa maria introductions into the fashionable world i took my own rank once more i had tutors books leisure the respect of my equals i went to court was made a visiting member of the famous delia cruscan academy i was offered a box at the opera a villa in the hills a mistress i made the acquaintance of count giraldi a gentleman not only in the immediate service of the sovereign but high in the confidence of the heir apparent a man of the world a traveller affable an abundant linguist no mean philosopher possessor of a cabinet of antiquities a fine library a band of musicians second to none in florence if ever a young man was placed square upon his feet again after a damaging fall it was i for this much at least i render a solemn act of remembrance to the society of jesus who must not be held responsible for the series of events which befell me next and by which it came to pass that the cup of my fortunes went again and again to the bitter fountain of shame i passed i suppose some six weeks without news but not without hope of donna aurelia and i am ashamed to add that the pleasures and interests of the world obliterated in me those obligations of gratitude and honour which i owed to the friend of my misfortunes but so i have always found it that the more respect a man has from the world the less he has to give it in return it is as if knowing his own worth too well he was able to put a just estimate upon his tributary i will only say in my defence that i knew virginia to be safe from positive danger chapter xxi my diversions count giraldi my new friend as i must call him since so he professed himself a dozen times a week was count amadeo giraldi one of the three members of the secret cabinet of the grand duke and the most influential and respectable of the three he was a gentleman of some forty years distinguished in presence and address of suave manners and a cynicism past praying for this tainted philosophic habit had permeated him to the soul so that not only was he naturally a sceptic in matters of received opinion but found a perverse relish in his own misfortune until he was become indeed sceptical of scepticism and found himself at times in real danger of proving a sincere christian so strange a result of philosophy reacting upon itself however did not disturb his serenity but on the contrary added to his diversions for he confessed that his highest pleasure in this life was to discover fresh follies of which he could be capable he considered himself as an inexhaustible quarry of humours vanities jealousies whims absurd enthusiasms absurd mortifications he was able as he said to sit at his ease in the side scene and see himself jigging on the stage in motley or the tragic sock see himself as a lover and cry aloud in delight at the mad persistence of the fool he appeared see himself directing the affairs of the nation and be ready to die of laughing at himself for pretending to be serious and at his countrymen for thinking him so he loved art and spent large sums upon his collection yet said he i should grudge the money for other occasions did it not furnish me with the entrancing spectacle of a middle aged statesman panting after masterpieces fingering this or that painted board and staking his position in this world and the next upon the momentous question is this ear in the manner of fra angelico or could mantegna have so foreshortened a leg i tell you don francis there is no more outrageous comedy no more fantastic extravaganza playing in venice at this hour than every moment of my own life can furnish me with what i hold in my hand the destinies of a million of souls and the iron enters into mine not because those others are in danger not because those others are enslaved no but because at donna violante's card table the marchesa serafina disregards my call for trumps i rise up from my escritoire where lie papers of state a threat from the king of spain declaration of war from the emperor a petition of right from some poor devil who has been shamefully used by one of my ministers i rise i say and leave them lying and for what to dangle at some faded opera which i have heard a thousand times behind the chair of some fine lady whose person i could possess if i wanted it for the writing of a billet is it not incredible but there is more to come my future master the grand prince is more of a fool than i am because he doesn't know it yet i read more consequence out of some petulant freak of his than from all the despair of a nation starving to death and i know very well which would disturb my department the more effectually whether it would be a revolution or his being late for mass is not this a humorous state of affairs does not this tickle your sense of the ridiculous i assure you i have never regretted for a moment my having been involved in the business of the state i can laugh at myself day in and day out the whimsicality of this kind of talk robbed it of its sting but what is really curious about the count was that he was perfectly serious he gave the princes both him who reigned and him who hoped to reign very bad characters but said that for purposes of government he preferred a vicious to a bigoted fool the first he said will be ruled by minions who can be paid this makes administration a simple matter of finance the second sort of princes are ruled by the frati who pay themselves the distinction is material the grand duke cosimo he said on another occasion is living of fright do you not mean dying of it i asked him no said he he is living of it the frati have been at him for years and now he is so terrified lest he may make a bad death that he has forgotten to die at all but of course his fears will wear out in time and then he will perish like any ordinary man of sense as for my future master don gastone he will live just so long as his zest for iniquity endures when like some alexander of the stews he has no more vices to conquer he will die of ennui it is surprising how few are the changes you can ring upon the human appetite gluttony drunkenness spare me the catalogue count i begged him i was enumerating for my own convenience he said as i frequently do to see if i cannot discover one new variety don gastone has not yet exhausted acquisition he has become a numismatist and ploughed up a populous village the other day in the search for a penny of charlemagne's supposed to have been dropped there in passing then there is horticulture which is one of my own vices and of course i do not forget piety but things are not so bad as that just yet it is important that he should survive his father because he is the last of the line of medici and i foresee troubles ahead we shall have an austrian prince who will make soldiers of us or a revolution when our throats will be cut an unpleasant alternative to kill or be killed with these and similar reflections he now dazzled and now depressed but always interested me count giraldi had three palaces in or near florence or rather he had four he himself occupied the great house of his race the palazzo giraldi a magnificent pile built by muchelozzo on the lung' arno the villa felice also on the hillside below fiesole was reserved for himself and his friends his wife a frigid devout elderly lady had her own establishment the splendid palazzo manfredi in oltr' arno and received him with great ceremony once a week for an hour in the afternoon never so long as i had any familiarity with the count did she set foot in either of his houses but he always spoke of her with great respect as the only person of his acquaintance who had never provided him with matter for amusement the fourth of which i have spoken was smaller than any but the most elegant of all that too was over arno in a retired street near the porta san giorgio but within a garden of its own which withdrew it yet more from observation or annoyance i call it his since he assured me of it at a later day but at this time i knew it as in the occupation of the contessa giulia galluzzo a charming lady charming hostess centre and inspiration of a charming circle the count took me with him very soon after we had become intimate to wait upon her she received me with all possible favour i never failed of attending her assemblies never found her otherwise than amiable nor her circle than varied and entertaining without suspecting in the least how count giraldi really stood with regard to her i could see that he was free of the house she called him caro amico and paid great deference to his opinions he on his side addressed her as madonna was tender without being impresse alert without seeming to be so and whether he intended to take her advice or not never failed to pay her the compliment of asking it i am thus particular in speaking of these things for reasons which will shortly appear in the villa san giorgio most of all in the society of its graceful chatelaine i had my fill of poetry and the other ornamental arts wit love philosophy literature bric a brac religion each had its petit maitre and each its sparkling muse it was before the day of arcadia and shepherdesses those flowers of our more jaded years women were still called divine but it was very possible or we used to think it so to discuss matters which you did not understand and express sentiments which you did not feel without the prop of a crook or garters of blue ribbon at my impressionable age with my impressionable habit i took kindly to all this i discussed love with donna giulia and puzzled her sadly i expressed my feelings upon religion to the abbe loisic the count's bookbinder and bored him to extinction one day i was presented to a tall cadaverous gentleman with red eyelashes and eyes so pale as to seem almost white i had a suspicion that i had seen him in some former existence and so soon as the name of the marchese semifonte was mentioned remembered prato with horror the marchese may well have thought me reserved for it is true that i could barely be civil to him he argued from that as i learned afterwards from donna giulia that i was of a ducal family and in proportion as i froze so did he thaw as i receded so did he advance he pressed invitations upon me all of which i could not decline it was proper that i should offer him some hospitality in return and i did he supped with me once or twice in my lodgings lost money to me at cards and so had some grounds for believing himself my friend presuming upon this he was not long in discovering himself to me for the monomaniac he was one of those miserable men devoured by a passion which may lift us to the stars or souse us in the deepest slime of the pit he made proposals to me tentatively at first then with increasing fervency at last with importunity which would have wearied me inexpressibly if it had not disgusted me beyond endurance proposals i mean to share his depraved excursions outraged as i was loathing the man as i had good reason from the bottom of my heart i was driven to confide in count giraldi something of my knowledge of him i had the good sense it is true to withhold the fact that virginia his intended victim was in florence but that is the extent of my prudence it might have served me but for the accident which i must relate in the next chapter chapter xxii i work for aurelia and hear of her it was to the sympathetic ears of donna giulia first of all that i imparted the state of my feelings my hopes fears and prayers with regard to aurelia there was that about count giraldi a diamantine brilliancy a something hard and crystalline a positiveness an incisiveness of view and reflection which on first acquaintance decided me not to take him into my confidence when i came to know him better or to think that i did i followed my natural bent and talked to him unreservedly but in the lady from the beginning i found a very interested listener she led me on from stage to stage of my story until she had it all and gave me the sum of her thoughts freely and with candour i agree with you don francis she said that your lady will be in florence before long a wounded bird makes straight for the nest and only puts into a thicket on the way to recover itself for the longer flight you will have to make the most of your time here for i do not believe that even your eloquence and you are most eloquent will hold her from her mother's arms as things are now you will be sure to follow her to siena and can there make your arrangements at ease my arrangements dear madam are very simple said i pardon is all i ask and leave to serve her she may give me these in florence as well as in siena pardon you may be certain of said donna giulia what has she to pardon you but the fact that you admired her and told her so i assure you we don't think that an irremediable sin in italy permission to serve her in other words permission to prove your admiration by deeds not words is another affair she will certainly wish to consult her mother about that her husband too madam said i this is the real difficulty of the case she gave me a queer look it is unusual to consult the husband she said it puts him in a difficult position it is my fault said i ruefully that he has been put there already undoubtedly it is returned donna giulia you should have remained in the cupboard why the fact that she put you there is proof of that she has given you all possible encouragement i said no more on the subject just then but a few days afterwards being out with the count on horseback he himself spoke to me about my business frankly owning that it was none of his donna giulia mentioned it to me in secrecy he said in the charitable hope that i might be of use to you need i say that all my abilities are at your service in an affair of the sort i have had a good deal of experience are you inclined to make use of me let me add that if you are not i am discretion itself i shall understand your reticence and even take it as a compliment for if you think i am not the kind of man whom you would care to interest in your mistress it will be a gratifying proof that i am younger than i venture to think myself my reply to this frankly stated case was to put before him the tale of the fair aurelia the cupboard and the pilgrimage of penitence count giraldi greatly to his credit listened without the alteration of a muscle and expressed at the close of my blushing narrative his convictions that aurelia must be a charming lady and that i should prove an equally charming damerino when i had learned the rules of the game one of which he added with mock severity one of which is that while the husband must know everything he is to be told nothing to break that rule is to outrage society it may be that something of bewilderment and pain upon my face told him that he had overstepped his path he changed the conversation rapidly encouraged me to talk of aurelia's perfections and of my own shortcomings as i would reserving no doubt his private view of each and ended the conversation by promising me to put all his interest at my service i will do what i can and welcome he said i will make friends with the doctor and perhaps find a place for him under this government i will introduce the doctor's wife to donna giulia and listen to your reading of your poetry at least as readily as she will more i will make you acquainted with my personal bookbinder the abbe loisic a truly great virtuoso if donna aurelia won't accept your sonnets in the dress of his providing you may give up the case as hopeless in a word my dear francis he said laughing there shall be only one thing wanting to complete your felicity and even that i may be able to afford you you will have your mistress at hand her husband accommodated and will only need a rival it seems to me to stimulate you to a pleasant exertion of your powers there ought not to be much difficulty in finding one in florence he was silent awhile then said as if musing on the absurdity semifonte for example i begged him not to mention that man the weeks passed thus pleasantly for me and i was wafted from winter into the fragrant chambers of spring before i was aware on the morning of april as i was sitting in my lodging drinking my chocolate i received a letter from father carnesecchi saying that aurelia was in florence and while i was still standing in ferment with his note shaking in my hand virginia burst into my room fell at my feet clasped me by the knees master news news she cried and kissed my hands with passion chapter xxiii aurelia forgives the mingling of emotions like that of two waters may produce a volume whose direction cannot be calculated by any previous knowledge of the separate streams in my case just described the reader has seen that while my heart was still palpitating at the news of the recovery of a mistress it was to be shaken anew by the sight of a dear friend two sorts of joy met and blended their forces within me their issue in one turbulent flood which i should have thought to see heading to aurelia at the convent instead of that poured themselves upon the bosom of virginia i raised her from my knees where upon her own she was clinging and clasped her in my arms i was indeed happy to see her again and so much so that i forgot entirely that i had only myself to blame for our long separation for the first time in our lives our lips met but if i was moved what is to be said of her i can hardly express the painful scene which followed she lost all control of her senses she clung to me as if i had been a spar in some stormy sea wherein she drowned she uttered incoherent cries she gasped sobbed was clean distraught when i held her when i kissed her she struggled like a caught bird fought furiously used her teeth her nails and yet all the time she was caressing me with every diminutive every sweet term of love which the most passionate people in the world can find as expression of their love thoughts she stroked my cheeks hair and shoulders crooned over me like a brooding dove held me so straitly that i was near choking or with tragic mouth and eyes of sombre fire she adjured me to kill her there and then lest any subsequent moment of her life might be less full of bliss than the present i know that my fancy was inflamed and suspect that my senses from whose occasional dominion i was no more free than most men must have sprung into flame from this dangerous contact had it not been that her excessive joy induced an attack of hysterics for a time she was like a madwoman beyond all human power and she ended by fainting in my arms and had to be carried by myself and scipione my servant to a bed there she lay moaning and muttering to herself for an hour or more it may be imagined whether all this tended to calm my own agitation or to turn my thoughts towards that road whereby alone honour and salvation could be reached i could not go out to see aurelia i could hardly even think of aurelia while virginia lay in my house with closed eyes clenched hands and shuddering breath i left scipione in charge of her and returned to my saloon to pace the floor until he brought me word that she could be spoken with this he did not do for some hours he came in at last shaking his head that is a bad case sir porca miseria says he i hoped that she was better she's ashamed of herself sir he said as well she may be what a scandal my word but these baggages have no modesty the term offended me i told him he was talking nonsense she is a true friend i said whose sympathy may be excessive but to take joy in my joy is the act of a friend scipione saluted me sir if her joy is your honour's i have no more to say a gentleman is entitled to his pleasures i hope and she is a handsome girl though she is thin that will do my man said i you say that she is better she is as well sir as she deserves replied this assured fellow but she is mad mad i cried why yes sir says he judge for yourself here is a girl frying in love wanting to tell your honour that another is yours for the asking he angered me by this freedom which i can assure the reader is not uncommon in this country and i dismissed him with a few directions i said that i must go out at once and was uncertain when i should return meantime virginia was to have every care and was to be provided with among other things suitable clothes for one in the position of a house servant those in which she had made her sudden appearance before me were obviously peculiar to the convent in which she worked and to her standing there i left some money with scipione and went out perhaps it had been better to have interrogated virginia before taking the step i now took and so i should have done had i not been rather disturbed in my mind first by my own pleasure at seeing her again which i now considered to have been disloyal to aurelia and next by scipione's account of her state of heart virginia in love with me this was not the first time i had suspected it but reflecting upon our meeting i was not able to deny that she had been very much moved now should it be true i thought to myself what on earth was i to do what indeed were the merits of the case was the fault mine and how could i best repair it these questions were beyond my then powers of resolution while i was uncertain of aurelia's fate and prospects and i deliberately put them aside i turned all my powers of mind and heart to consider her injuries probable sufferings and monstrous humiliations and by the time i was near the convent of ss maria e giuseppe i was trembling in every limb and in the state of apprehension and desire which becomes the devout lover of a lady incredibly lovely and wise i approached the shabby gate and with uncovered head saluted the posts which held it up i rang the bell the portress appeared i asked her for my mistress by name she said that she would take up mine to the lady superior if my lordship would be pleased to wait then she disappeared and my lordship stood fainting there father carnesecchi i perceived was with aurelia for the note brought back by the portress was all in his handwriting but the signature the initials a l were in her own she said or the respectable jesuit said for her that she was highly sensible of my courtesy in waiting upon her and deplored that as she was somewhat fatigued and about to return to padua it was impossible for her to receive me at the moment she hoped on a future occasion to find suitable expression of her feelings and begged in the meantime to assure me of her entire respect at any other time i might have been chilled by the studious repression of this note but at that moment i had but one aim begging the portress to wait i tore a leaf from my pocket book wrote upon it madam forgive the wicked f s and gave it over to the good nun i beg of you my sister to give this note into the hands of donna aurelia i said it touches on a matter of the utmost consequence to me she agreed with an indulgent and somewhat intelligent smile and retired once more in half the time she came back with a little twisted note i hope that i can please you this time sir she said at any rate you may be sure of your correspondent for donna aurelia wrote every word of it there were but three words si si si aurelia i read and turning my face to the heavens thanked god that i was absolved by the dear subject of my crimes transformed indeed i trod upon air between the prato and the palazzo giraldi i was told that his excellency was visiting the contessa galluzzo i sailed i soared i flashed over arno and into the house at the porta san giorgio absolved absolved i cried and kissed donna giulia's hand the count pressed mine very warmly either the church said he has gained in you a remarkable champion or the world lost a promising scoundrel i had not suspected you of such a load of sin i showed my precious paper and commented upon it with rapture count i said in conclusion a truce to your sallies confess my aurelia a pattern among ladies what modesty what clemency what divine compassion it is too much grace it is dangerous it tempts one to sin again at the time of utterance i undoubtedly believed what i said i am of your opinion said the count i fancy that the lady is very ready to forgive you i speak for myself when i say that i shall do everything in my power to assist her speak also for me caro mio said donna giulia i will wait upon donna aurelia as soon as may be she will be better here than in the tiresome convent i shall invite her to pay me a visit which i hope she added with a smile will not deprive us of the society of don francis i warmly thanked my friends and took my leave chapter xxiv virginia vexes on returning to my house i ended a day of agitation by an interview with virginia i found her in an abject way scarcely able to speak and very unwilling to raise her eyes she was dressed and perfectly composed and said what she had to say in a tone deliberately dry i ask your lordship's pardon she began at once for the tempest i raised in your house i ask it on my knees i forgot myself i lost myself i have not seen your lordship for many months i begged her to allude to it no more i myself had been glad to see her i said she looked up quickly only for a moment and showed a hint of her former fire i think that you were i did think so she said then checked herself and was silent there is no doubt about it said i therefore let nothing disturb you take your time and tell me your news you have seen you have heard yes yes she said i have seen your aurelia she came to our convent a week ago in a chaise and pair this startled me a week ago i should have told you before if i could she continued but they keep us close us penitents i have run away i could not bear that you should remain ignorant if they find me they will beat me to death i assured her of my protection and returned to the subject of aurelia how i asked had she come had she been ill in distress not at all said virginia she was elegantly dressed she was protected by an old woman she wore a mask and a travelling hood and went into the nuns' parlour she asked for a cup of chocolate which was brought her i saw her in the chapel at the office how often had i seen her so my saint on her knees she was on her knees yes said virginia but she yawned very much she did not rise till noon on the next morning i clasped my friend's hand oh virginia you have seen her i cried you help me to see her is she not perfection virginia was rather cool who knows she said shrugging she is like all sienese women she is fatter than i am i allow her shape but she is not near so tall she is a little thing she wears her clothes well and she is merry enough when she has her tongue i could afford to smile at this grudging admiration my dear girl i said you little know her but how should you tell me more did you speak to her she nodded her head and told her story i waited my time i was washing the canon's linen in the little cloister that was my job week in and week out she came through she was scolding her old woman i followed her round the cloister and when the coast was clear said 'hist madonna' she turned and looked at me with her eyes wide open they are handsome eyes for a sienese woman that i allow she said 'do you call me' says i 'i do' she says 'well' i reply 'he is well if you are' 'who then' says she i say 'your lover' this makes her jump like a flea on the bed but she brazens it out finely turning to her old crone with a 'what does the girl mean' bless you they knew well enough i folded my arms so i said 'he has walked the stony hills barefoot to find you he will be out of his skin standing on his head to know you are here' she stamped her foot and flew into a passion 'how dare you' she cries out 'tell me of whom you are talking this rubbish' i nodded my head many times so and said 'you are lucky to have him so fast' she went away after that she never passed me without tossing her head and presently i ran away i was greatly perturbed by this tale of hers and not unreasonably angry i said unhappy girl you little know the harm you have done have i instructed you so badly in myself that you can think to serve me by your servant girl mysteries and your nods and winks i enjoin you to leave my affairs absolutely alone you are to tell me no more speak of me no more see donna aurelia no more since you have left the convent and are in danger of punishment you must of course stay here you must be properly clothed and looked after i will see to that now recover yourself and remember what i have said i was almost immediately sorry for my plain speaking she was in extreme misery i could see tears streamed through her fingers her body was convulsed with grief more than once she seemed upon the point of lashing out at me with some furious blast of indignation but she always checked it as it seemed when it was at the edge of her lips unthinking fool that i was i little knew or guessed what she had endured at the convent for my sake how treated as a sinful woman she had been the object of hard judgment and undeserved reproach preached at prayed over lectured scolded made a slave of how she had loved me and believed in me through all and how unable to bear her lot coming to me at last i had proved the most cruel of her oppressors and precisely the most cruel because from me she deserved the least reproach however i must not extenuate myself nor forestall my history i begged her pardon for my severity and obtained her ready forgiveness from that hour forward she kept herself apart from me as my servant having arranged for her share of his duties with scipione and she never by word or look recalled the time when a much closer intimacy had existed between us one disturbing incident in my affairs with her must be mentioned in this place although it did not occur until i had twice waited upon donna aurelia it was indeed upon my return from the second of those visits that scipione came into the room after me with some secret or another which he itched evidently to impart to me after some hesitation he asked leave to exhibit virginia to me dressed said he according to the best of his ability as such a fine girl should be dressed i nodded my head having little attention to give him just then and he presently returned leading virginia by the hand there sir said the jaunty rogue now perhaps your honour will say that she is worth looking at i stared at virginia who coloured finely and hung her head i must say that preoccupied as i was i was astonished at what i saw he had transformed her by some means out of a sulky and dejected penitent into a young woman of noble appearance and refined beauty i had seen that transformation once before at prato but here was a more mature and assured fine lady she wore her hair over a cushion a handsome dress of yellow and white brocade upon a quilted petticoat silk stockings and high heeled shoes not only were the clothes fine of their kind and well fitted to her person but she wore them surprisingly well their colour set off her clear chiselled and dark beauty and that as if stung by the rivalry came fiercely out to meet them the joy and pride of battle tingled in her cheeks and shone in her eyes she was of that aquiline keen type of feature which we are accustomed to call patrician she looked at once superb and secure at once eager to contend and sure of the prize it may have been that as her name of strozzi implied she was a scion of that noble house sunk by no faults of her own in servitude and obscurity suffice it to say that she was strikingly handsome and perfectly aware of it i was too much astonished to be angry with scipione as i might reasonably have been nor could i have had the heart i acknowledge to have dashed her natural pleasure at her success by any abrupt expression of annoyance i said why virginia you are become a fine lady she stepped quickly forward knelt and kissed my hand an act of humility which touched me sir said scipione i told you that she had the makings your honour can do as you please now and nobody have a word to say i can assure you that the count lost his breath and his heart at once when he saw her the count i cried and he told me that count giraldi had called for me that afternoon and had entertained himself greatly with virginia i sent scipione away it was necessary to know more of this the moment he was out of the room i asked her what had brought about this masquerade of hers she said timidly that scipione had a sister who was woman to a great lady this person had several times been in to see her brother and this dress was of her providing she said that they had teased her about her appearance at prato where scipione's sister had seen her it appears and had dared to prove to them that she was indeed that handsome lady with whom i had been observed she hoped i should not take it amiss or be angry with my servant by which she meant herself i assured her that i was not at all angry which was true and then begged her to tell me what the count had wanted she said he had called to leave me a message an invitation to dine i think and that scipione maliciously or ingenuously had shown him into the room where she was queening it in her borrowed finery i guessed there was more what had his excellency to say on your account my child i asked her he thought at first that i was what i seemed and was most gallant she replied to my consternation i told him however that he was very much mistaken that i was a poor girl and your servant playing as i should not this tickled his excellency or so it appeared and he said what virginia i was careful to hide from her my discomfort over this foolish business virginia with what i am sure was perfect innocence of any evil said he was most kind he praised my looks and vowed that you were happily served and so i am i said rather ruefully he was right what next next sir said this strange girl he praised my figure which he thought was mightily becoming this gown well well and he was right i admitted but did he say nothing more virginia would not look at me but i caught the words he said that he envied you the arrangements of your household well i asked her and he said that he was sure i was as good as i was good looking and gave your honour every satisfaction and then he gave me a gold piece and a salutation and was going away when well well let me have the whole story i shall vex you but not more than i was vexed i assure you no harm had been done for you don't suppose that i wanted his money serving your honour but just as he was going out what must that daughter of mischief scipione's sister do but blurt out that she had seen me with your honour not near so well dressed at the fair at prato the count started and looked very much intrigued he asked me a score of questions artfully you may be sure as if to idle away the time but i told him nothing at all and he presently was tired of working a dry pump he took his leave and that sataness went with him god knows what she knows if i come within distance of her i shall drag her tongue out of her throat i promise you i told her not to trouble herself with what could not be helped i did not see how she could be blamed and after all the count was my friend and a man of honour but i relieved my feelings by bestowing upon master scipione one of the handsomest drubbings his oily skin had ever received i little knew then how richly he deserved it but i found out before long and then if i could have killed him i am sure i would have done it chapter xxv i prepare for bliss i must return to the natural order of my history and relate my first interview with aurelia in order that i may prepare the reader for the last it was brought about by father carnesecchi to whom i applied for it after my visit to the convent and reception of the note of forgiveness i had a great respect for the good man and owed him much for his kindness to me in my hour of need but as i never had the knack of concealing my feelings i could not help showing him i suppose that i was aware that my mistress had been a week in florence without my suspecting it if i had thought to confuse him by any such reproach which i had not i should have been quickly undeceived father carnesecchi at once admitted that he had withheld for what seemed very proper reasons the fact of aurelia's arrival the poor little lady he said when she had recovered from fatigues which without being harsh i must say were not brought upon her entirely unassisted developed a very becoming and dutiful state of the soul i have seldom been more hopeful of a case of conscience but it is a sensitive plant the soul of a young and naturally amiable girl rough blasts may bruise it even excessive nurture may cause an exuberance of growth and weaken the roots i do not doubt your real repentance my francis heaven forbid it me but i confess i do gravely doubt the expediency of your assuring donna aurelia of it otherwise than by a letter which i shall willingly convey to her may i ask you now since i stand to you in loco parentis yes yes in loco parentis how it was that you became acquainted with the fact of her having been a week in the sienese convent i told him the truth and if the father was vexed he was not surprised beware he said of that little parasite you have a dangerous liking for female society as i have told you before of your two intimacies i much prefer that of donna aurelia for you there now is a girl naturaliter christiana but that is characteristic of her nation the elect city of mary indeed as the pious gigli has observed in a large volume come he said suddenly come francis i will take you to see donna aurelia this moment there shall be no drawbacks to our mutual affection what do you say i stammered my thanks shed tears and kissed my director's hands the acts of the next half hour were done to a wild and piercing music i could scarcely breathe let alone think or speak i was swept along the streets i achieved the portal i achieved the parlour pictures of saints wholly sienese reeled from the walls a great white crucifix dipped and dazzled father carnesecchi after a time of shrill suspense came in to fetch me took me tottering up the stairs my heart stood still but the door was open i blundered in i saw her again her lovely childish head her innocent smile her melting eyes her colour of pale rose her bounty her fragrance her exquisite mysterious charm blushes made her divine she curtseyed deeply to me i fell upon my knee and count giraldi rose from his seat and performed a graceful salute she told me that she freely forgave me an indiscretion natural to my youth and position whose consequences moreover could not have been foreseen by either of us she said that she was about to return to her husband who would probably come to florence to meet her and she added that she hoped i should resume my studies at the university and in serious preparation for the future obliterate all traces of the past at these words which i am inclined to fancy had been got by rote she sighed and looked down i promised her entire obedience in every particular and growing bolder by her timidity said that with the doctor's permission i should wait upon her at her convenience aurelia pressed me to come and then told me that thanks to the benevolence of donna giulia conveyed to her by the excellency of count giraldi my visit might be made at the villa san giorgio at her ladyship's next reception i believe don francis that you know the way thither she said very much affected i kissed her hand again and father carnesecchi suggesting that she might be fatigued took me away my next visit to her was paid at the villa san giorgio and on that occasion i saw her alone count giraldi was in fact at that very hour engaged with virginia in my lodgings this time i was neither ridiculous nor thought to be so my lady came into the saloon where i was and ran towards me begging me not to kneel to her she resumed for that happy moment at least her old part of guardian angel sat on the couch by my side and looking kindly at me from her beautiful eyes said in the easiest way i see very well that you have not been cared for so well in florence as in padua now you are to be your good and obedient self again and do everything i tell you i murmured my long meditated prayer for forgiveness making a sad botch of its periods she put her hand over my mouth not a word of that hateful affair she said firmly you were absurd of course and i was to blame for allowing it but i could not be angry with such a perfect little poet and that monster should have known with whom he had to deal he knows it now i believe he knows that a gualandi of siena is not at the beck and call of a pig of padua when he comes here he will come in his right senses you will see i begged her to tell me her story but she said there was little to tell she had not left padua as i had supposed but had stayed with friends of hers in the hope that what she called the pazzeria of the doctor would be blown away finding that he was obstinate she had gone to modena where she lived for a while as companion to an ancient lady who became very fond of her it needed indeed a convenient bronchitis to give her her liberty again when this occurred she found herself provided with a pretty legacy enough to make her independent of the doctor but at the same time more necessary to his happiness she had intended she said for siena but the hospitality of donna giulia was pressed upon her and the good services of the count were freely hers there was talk of a judgeship for her husband she would see how events turned about before she made any plans and you francis she continued are not to be ridiculous any more nor wander about without shoes nor consort with rubbish any more you are to go back to your studies and your books and take your degree you are to say good bye to aurelia as soon as you are well enough and forget that you ever knew her if you can if i forget you aurelia i shall forget heaven i said we will talk about heaven another time said aurelia who was that saucy girl i met at the convent who seemed to know all about you i told her virginia's story exactly she said the piece is madly in love with you i assured her that she was mistaken but she shook her head then nodded it many times certainly certainly she is in love with you and after a pause and i don't wonder you have greatly improved francis to this i said that nothing was further from my thoughts than to do virginia any harm i promised to marry her to my man scipione as soon as possible since protection of some sort was necessary to a bondswoman who had run away from the land to which she belonged aurelia heard me thoughtfully tapping her little foot on the floor in that quick impatient way i loved so well in her marry her yes she said that will be only prudent on your part well it is not for me to quarrel with you but she shrugged and went on quickly oh i don't deny that the wench is well enough in her broomstick way she cried out i said no she looked very well when she was dressed this was an unlucky speech so i have understood sir cried aurelia breathing fast i hear that you were seen with her at prato that she was dressed in silk and a hoop and had her hair on a cushion and i dare say a fan of the afternoons and you think her very well so so so my beloved aurelia had tears in her eyes one dropped and lay upon her bosom i fell on my knees before her and would have kissed her foot but she sprang from me and went quickly out of the room i was left alone in the greatest agitation it was the recollection of this scene which troubled me when returning to my lodging i found virginia again in masquerade chapter xxvi i disappoint my friends my forebodings were more than fulfilled the next time which was at a week's interval that i presented myself at the villa san giorgio donna aurelia in full reception turned her back upon me and left the room in company of the marchese semifonte i suffered the indignity as best i might i did not quit the company nobody i flatter myself knew what pangs of mortification i was feeling i saw no more of aurelia that evening and a conversation which i had with donna giulia made matters no better she spoke to me very plainly and with some warmth here you had but a few days ago your mistress in a most promising humour she said detesting her doctor yet resolved to have him back in order to give you a countenance in count giraldi and myself you have i take leave to say two of the most complaisant friends in europe yet what are you doing you maintain for reasons best known to yourself a pretty girl in your lodgings pranked out in silks and furbelows a runaway from a house of discipline and if it is all true that they tell me one who if she belongs to anybody dare not belong certainly to you really don francis you are exorbitant pray do you propose to us to keep aurelia here in order that she may listen to your poetry and then to return from your intellectual feast to the arms of your little peasant and aurelia is to know it and acquiesce good heavens do you know that she is young fresh and charming and of siena i ask your pardon don francis but oh my perverse young friend why on earth don't you take her dearest lady i cried out what under heaven am i to take i adore aurelia i ask nothing better than leave to serve her to kneel at her feet if she is cruel to me that is my pride if she is kind that is my humiliation if she were to kill me that would be my topmost reward very true indeed she said and what if she were to do as i should certainly do ignore you altogether i should not cease to love her i should have nothing to complain of i said she tossed her hands up in despair if this is what conies of reading your dante i advise the 'song of solomon' she said i have never opened the 'divine comedy' still less the 'vita nova' but i consider the author a donkey and am sure that was the opinion of his donna beatrice count giraldi for some reason which i could not then comprehend did not care to talk of my affair he said nothing of aurelia to me and so far as i could see avoided the lady herself as much as the discussion of her position he told me that he had been able to offer a judgeship of the court of cassation to dr lanfranchi and that he was in great hopes that he would take it in that case he would of course reside in florence and the rest said he i shall leave to you i told him that if donna aurelia was reconciled to her husband through his means i should be eternally in his debt and not less so though i should be in padua and with the mountains between us he frowned he was puzzled you leave us he said you abandon donna aurelia i told him that i could never cease to love her but that love for a lady seemed to me an extremely bad reason for bringing about her ruin i had gone so near to that already that nothing in the world would induce me to risk it again he affected to misunderstand me in his scoffing way admirable admirable he cried i see that you have recovered your spirits i hope my spirit has never failed me yet when i have had need of it i said i shall thank god on my knees this night that my lady has been saved alive no lover in the world has ever begged for his mistress's surrender so heartily as i shall pray for the return of mine to her husband's arms he clapped me on the back you are a master of paradox indeed he said i assured him that i was serious then said he i admire while i do not follow you i ask you once more do you wish me to understand that you abandon donna aurelia i have my reasons mind you and have no wish to take you unawares i cannot abandon what i do not pursue i replied i can only repeat that it would be a very curious proof of my love for a lady to urge her to perdition on my account he looked at me oddly fixedly for a long time then he said it is true that you are an englishman i had forgotten it suddenly he threw up his hands what a nation what a lover his hand came down and rested upon my shoulders my friend he said i am not so young as i was but i do believe that i can teach you something with that he left me upon returning to my house sadly out of countenance by the coldness of aurelia i was met by virginia who reminded me that scipione had obtained leave of absence for the night in order to visit his wife she seemed excited and unlike herself very careful to lock and bolt the front door and was continually at the window looking over the piazza occupied as i was with my own troubles i took no notice of her and she with the intelligence peculiar to her saw how the land lay she was not accustomed to pick her words with me no tuscan servants are and after a time of silence on my part and pretended business about the room on hers she asked leave to speak to me and without getting it said excuse me don francis for the liberty i take but i see you very miserable and guess the reason you have had words with your mistress and no wonder let me tell you that you have not the rudiments of love in you enough of that virginia i said but she would not oblige me let me tell your honour said she that your sex has had the monopoly of mine since this world was first put in order if you want your aurelia as i told you before you must take her your proposals towards her are very christian but i have noticed that it is not the christians who have the prettiest women at their disposition but the turks of whom there are more in the world than you think for your doctor for example was a turk of the turks and what did your aurelia do but grovel for his rod until you came along and she said 'hey here is one who is turchissimo the grandest of grand turks with a longer and sharper rod' you had a great chance then don francis what under heaven possessed you to break the rod in her presence or rather to put it into her hands saying 'behold madam the rod it is yours not mine use it i kneel to receive it' why lord of mercies is this madness let me remind you of what i told you at prato not so long ago that to pray at a lady's feet when you ought to have her in your arms is to prepare misery for the pair of you the whole trouble about that precious fault of yours was not that you committed it dio mio but that you did not commit it again there sir that is my opinion make what you will of it i was too profoundly dejected to be angry as i ought to have been i believe i made no reply emboldened or piqued by that she came nearer and spoke with great passion i'll tell you another thing she said i am in your way and am quite aware of it donna aurelia and all your fine friends believe that i am with you as as i am not well now don francis you may be rid of me whenever you please fra palamone is here and the marchese semifonte also i have seen them both in this very piazza this afternoon once they were together and once palamone was here alone that means something now if you choose to hand me over to those two you will do a fine stroke of business your count giraldi has a fancy for donna aurelia i can see that plainly it suits him very well that i should be here get rid of me and where is the count do you not see i turned upon her then and reproved her you hurt yourself more than me virginia i said by talking in this strain your word 'fancy' is a word of the market grooms fancy a horse at the fair housewives fancy a leg of lamb leering ploughboys in a tavern fancy the wench who cleans the pots gentlemen do not so use to beautiful and wise ladies you use horrible words my poor child but non omnia possumus omnes she listened at first with lowering brows and eyes which watched me guardedly but as i went on more scornfully than perhaps i thought a change came over her she let fall her arms she drooped became distressed i saw a tear fall but i believed that i did well to be angry be sure of this i said sharply that i will suffer no word in disparagement of donna aurelia to be said in my presence your word 'fancy' as applied to her is horrible to me you will take care not to repeat it if you choose to whisper to your friends that i have a 'fancy' for you or that the marchese has purchased fra palamone to indulge a similar 'fancy' on his account i have nothing to say no term of the sort is by this time too hard for me to bear and the marchese no doubt can take care of himself but donna aurelia once and for all is to be left out of your dictionary if you can only couple her name with a degrading qualification enough of that i am about to return to padua and shall take you with me as far as condoglia this was indeed my intention for i was hurt more than i cared to own by donna aurelia's reception of me and yet knew all the time that i deserved nothing more virginia listened with head hung down and clenched hands when i had done she would have rushed headlong into speech but she checked herself by biting her lip forcibly she curtseyed to me and went quickly out of the room i spent a great part of the night in the destruction of papers collection of objects which i wished to take with me and in committing to the flame certain others which i now knew i must do without treasured memories of aurelia went with them she was still in my heart and must ever remain there patroness of my honest intention daylight was creeping over the piazza and putting my candles to shame before i discovered how tired i was i blew them out opened windows and shutters and leaned into the sweet air st mary's church stared hard an unearthly black and white the piazza perfectly empty looked of enormous size in it the dawn wind blew up little spirals of dust and it was so quiet that when a scrap of paper was whirled into the air i heard the littering noise it made before it started on its flight the sky was of exquisite purity pale as milk with a very faint flush of rose behind the church in a few minutes the sun would be up from behind vallombrosa and all the glory of the italian day would roll over florence in a flood i felt mortally and suddenly tired too languid to face the richness of life to come poor and famished as i must now be as i was turning from the window i saw the figures of two men come out of the sharp angle of st mary's and walk towards the town both were tall both in cloaks but one wore his hat and the other carried it by this as well as his drooping deferential shoulders i knew this latter to be the servant the former his patron midway towards the via de' benci they stopped while he of the bare head explained at length pointing this way and that with his hat then counting on his fingers i was now expert enough to be able to read an italian conversation more quickly than i could gather it in talk there was no doubt what was meant i shall go to such and such place come back to such and such place the carriage will stay here in eight hours from now your lordship shall be satisfied the man of position nodded his agreement acknowledged with another nod a low bow from his inferior and walked into florence as he entered the via de' benci i saw him plainly it was the marchese semifonte i saw his pale wandering eyes his moth white face so then i knew who was the other standing out in the piazza by himself looking up towards my room chapter xxvii i slay a man a sudden desire whose origin i could not have defined unless it sprang directly from alarm on her account moved me away from the window towards the door of virginia's room i listened at it but could hear nothing so presently fearing some wild intention of sacrifice on her part i lifted the latch and looked in no she was there and asleep i could see the dark masses of her hair hear her quick breathing as impatient as a child's and as innocent poor faithful ignorant passionate creature had i wronged her did not her vehemence spring from loyalty if she was mistaken was it her fault for what could she that unkempt companion of pigs and chicken offspring of parents little higher in degree what could she know of exalted love what indeed i lit a candle and went to look at her i considered her carefully lying there prone her face turned sideways to the pillow one bare arm flung over her eyes she looked beautiful asleep for her mouth had relaxed its look of proud reserve and all her lines were softened she looked very tired very pure very young god of nature thought i assuredly thou didst not shape this fine true creature for some villain's idle appetite assuredly also thou didst put her in my way for her salvation and may be for mine i accept the sign do thou therefore stand my friend i shut the door softly and returned to my parlour very cautiously i drew near the window and peered out it was well that i took care fra palamone was immediately underneath the window grinning up showing his long tooth and picking at his beard i do not think i ever saw such a glut of animal enjoyment in a man's face before there was not the glimmer of a doubt what he intended semifonte had been told of his bondslave and palamone's hour of triumph was at hand he would bring a warrant no doubt he had it by him he waited only for the police i was laid by the heels a gust of anger like a puff of hot wind blew upon me and made my skin prick me all that i had endured at this rascal's hands swelled within and now i remembered also that i a gentleman by birth and training had been the galled slave of a low ruffian who now intended to sell into vice and infamy an honest girl whom i was pledged to protect well being rehabilitation the respect of my own world had done their work he had to do with a man now i told myself not with a boy i went to my bureau took out primed and cocked my pistols returned to the window and showed myself full to the frate i wish you good morning fra palamone i said his grinning face grinned awry i promise you but he recovered himself and made a brave show buon di ser francesco buon di you are betimes i see or is it that you are belated like my injured friend semifonte the smarting of his honour has kept him from his bed let me tell you but he has gone thither now i hope appeased you intend to appease him i believe in eight hours from now said i the commissary will be at his chocolate at eight o'clock at his office by eleven it is now three you are getting proficient in our tongue he said somewhat put out by my exactitude oh i am proficient in more ways than one i told him you taught me at prato how to draw teeth and i showed you in the same town how claws could be cut what did you think of the carcere well now i will show you another accomplishment i have draw teeth cut claws i can drill holes also palamone what the devil are you talking about poet says he always quick to be amused why this i said i will come down to you in the piazza we have it to ourselves i held up my pistol by the nozzle he saw the butt he said oho that's your work is it you are growing in grace don francis and i am not the little man to disoblige you many a score is on my slate to your name and short scores make the longest friendships come down my son and play a better game than faro by the time i got down he had taken off his cloak and came smiling towards me with both his hands held out he was going to embrace me i knew that very well he would have kissed me on both cheeks warmly and with sincerity and then before his arms were loosed from my neck by a sudden surging of his lust he would have throttled me all that was as clear in his looks as are the marks on this paper but i could read my gentleman by now and was in no mood for his freakish humours take warning i said that if you move one step nearer to me i shoot you like a rabbit i crooked my arm and levelled at him as i spoke i suppose he saw truth in the mouth of the barrel for he stopped and looked at me breathing hard i admire you francis he said i admire you more than ever before if i had kissed you as i intended you would have known it i do know it damn you i replied but you would have strangled me afterwards why so i should he confessed even as surely as i mean to shoot you now but that is neither here nor there i'm a wild hungry old devil of a frate but no man denies that i love a high spirit i should have kissed you for that and wrung the breath out of you afterwards for a starved misbegotten spawn of an english apothecary as you are my son now hand me one of those pistols of yours and say your paternoster while you are in the mind i handed him the weapon telling him that i had loaded it myself overnight but that if he wished to satisfy himself i had both powder and ball at his service he looked somewhat offended do you think my lad that i doubt you he said i tell you that i love you i would as soon doubt my mother who is in heaven or believe my father who is not you shall join one or the other of them said i in a few moments have no doubt of that and let me alone one condition i will drop my arm and walk into the house placing my back at your disposal if you in the article of death as you now stand will pledge your word to save virginia from semifonte what do you say he gazed at me open mouthed eyes aglow as i stood waiting i could see that he was torn i could see the fiend working and gouging within him and i believe a good angel contending against him some time this lasted then palamone gave a bitter laugh like the barking of a leopard in the night say he mocked me why i say that you are an exquisite adorable fool the very pink of fools for two ticks i would have taken you at your word for two ticks it was the third that prevented you says i you are not such a villain as you think yourself i believe that i am not indeed he says ruefully i have lost a chance well i am ready but here the shadow is bad let us go to the obelisks and stand each back to one there is a passable light there as you will i went directly out into the middle of the piazza and he followed with my life between his wild hands i know not to this hour whether that act of mine was one of sublime courage or of the crassest folly i remember that i strode blithely forward and that he followed that some chance thing or another caused me to turn my head the sun burning in a casement a pigeon a cat some speck of accident that motion saved my life for immediately afterwards i heard the report and felt the ball flicker through my hair the fiend had gouged him again and he had tried to murder me at that certainty in all the fury of disgust that came with it my stomach turned and i was possessed by blind rage i rounded full upon him and he must have seen cold death in my eyes for round went he too and ran for his life i pelted after him he made for the angle of the church whence he had come there were railings there about a loggia much broken down by which i suppose he hoped to get some sort of a screen but i intended him to fight me in the piazza so increased my speed and cut him off that retreat he doubled and scoured past the steps of the church round by the hospital making for the via del fosso i cut a segment of his circle and stopped him there round he span slavering at the lips and went dead over the piazza to the obelisks i so close on his traces that i could not have missed him if i had chosen for murder it was like coursing a hare for hare like in his pains he began to scream not very loudly a wretched wrung and wiry appeal like some bad woman's was all he could muster between the obelisks he fell on his knees and when i reached him was praying sancta mater diva mater ab hostium incidiis libera me i saw a head at a window a head in a night cap a man's over it peeped another a woman's but i knew my florence there would be no interference in a duel i said get up palamone and fight with me he was wild with terror cried no no no spare me i give you my word my sacred word you have none to give you have broken it i told him i will have no word in pieces get up liar and fight i got him to his feet set him by his obelisk to face me i loaded his piece for him put it into his hands then stepped back facing him always till i was fifteen yards away drop your glove when you are ready i told him and fire first he took as good aim as he could i am sure but i could see his shaking arm quite well he missed me by a full yard at least then he waited for me having got his courage back i shot him in the breast and he fell at once and lay still the faces at the window had disappeared looking round the piazza i could see nothing but blank green shutters when i went up to palamone he opened his eyes he was not bleeding freely and seemed more weak than in pain i am a dead man he said in a whisper i had to kneel down to hear him a dead man who has got his deserts semifonte intended to have your virginia but it was not giraldi it was not gir strength failed him i could not catch any more than the name of aurelia where are you hurt shall i fetch a surgeon he was hardly bleeding at all now a bad sign he shook his head and lay quiet i made a pillow of my coat when he opened his eyes again they were very dim i'm off he said in that same dry whisper you have served me right i love you for it i have always loved you but yes always loved you kiss me francis if you can i could not refuse i did kiss him and he me god receive you palamone and forgive me i shall go and fetch you a priest my face being very near him suddenly he lifted his head and caught my cheek in his teeth they met there the dying act of a savage i wrenched myself free and heard his head knock with a thud on the pavement then i felt the blood stream down my neck stopping it as best i could i went for a surgeon and a priest when i came back with them i may have been half an hour finding the couple fra palamone was gone and my pistol too which had my name on the butt gentlemen i said i am very sorry but i assure you that i left a dying man on this spot i can only ask you to excuse me for breaking your repose the priest said he has been found and taken away no doubt of it he has walked off most like said the surgeon i shook my head i was sure i had killed him if you are sure of it said the surgeon there is little i could have done for him and as it is far more to the purpose to dress a living man than a dead one permit me to attack that ugly flesh wound in your cheek god of mercy he cried as he looked into it your man must have shot you with a currycomb when he had done his best for me i went to bed and immediately fell asleep chapter xxviii virginia on her mettle i slept like a log until the hour of noon perfectly dreamless sleep it was virginia who awoke me then by shaking my shoulder not as usually by opening the shutter i heard the bells of the hour ringing and guessed the time i remembered that scipione was away i remembered everything i have your chocolate don francis she said drink it and rise as soon as possible you must be out of this i replied i see no reason for haste i will write a letter ser bartolo shall take it for me the answer will be satisfactory virginia kept herself calm by main force the house is surrounded she said you will be taken in your bed if you don't leave it soon i sat up virginia i ask your pardon she shivered and turned away speak no more of that but i must you were right and i she threw up her head with a little cry fell upon her knees she took my hand and covered it with kisses no more i cannot bear it who am i what am i say what you please to me but never plead with me i could see her shoulders shaking i must say what i have to say i would have continued she gave another sharp cry shivered again miserably in the half light of the room i could see her lift her pale face towards the ceiling it seemed to me that she prayed after a while she looked down again and said quietly speak now and have done with it i told her what had occurred in the small hours i did not spare myself when i said that i had shot fra palamone she shook her head you might as well hope to shoot the devil all you have done is to give yourself into the hands of them who hire him you are to be sent to volterra or the galleys for this the men outside are sbirri i told her that i should write to count giraldi she laughed your count giraldi will be out of florence do you think him a child his one desire is to get rid of you no no you must disguise yourself this is a trap i refused to take your word last night my dear i said and should be sorry to do it again if the sbirri want me they can take me on a warrant they have no warrant they will get that afterwards do you think them so stupid while they were getting their warrant you might get clear away or suppose you appeared the whole story might come out and a number of fine people implicated and what of your english resident and what of your donna aurelia if you are not careful of yourself do you wish to get her name abroad no no in tuscany we imprison a man first and get the warrant afterwards if necessary that is how they will work quietly with decency no conversations they have been here since eight o'clock this morning and the piazza is quite empty they have seen to that of course if you look through the shutter you can see them they are in no sort of hurry i did look and saw that she was right there were no people in the piazza at midday but four men who stood at intervals in attitudes of detachment and irresponsibility far too pronounced to be real the church was closed most of the houses were shuttered all this was too remarkable not to have been arranged virginia and i looked at one another but she watched me like a cat keeping guard over every movement of mine one hand pressed her bosom the other was stretched downwards a straight tense line from shoulder to finger tips virginia listen to me i began a heedless invocation every fibre of her listened and watched if this is a trap as i agree it is then you are the mouse nobody in florence would care whether i have shot fra palamone or he me the count taking him as you take him knows that i have no intentions but honest ones towards donna aurelia taking him as i take him he will defend me no my child this is the marchese's affair i can see that he has been after you from the time he saw you playing the handsome lady at prato he thinks he has you but i will show him that he is wrong let me once get you away be assured of your safety and i shall open the door to the pleasure of these gentlemen father carnesecchi the count oh i have no fear of palamone's posthumous acts i can assure you i spoke cheerfully confidently but virginia was put into great agitation she began to flit about the room like a moth wringing her hands and whimpering to herself o dio she fretted o dio caro what shall i do madonna madonna madonna what will become of me she was quite inarticulate could only repeat her names and wail and beat herself into a fever i went to comfort her and then as if some tie were cut by the act she turned upon me in a white tempest of fury no longer a girl but a devil do you dare she raved do you dare oh but i could kill you now with my hands she took me by the shoulders and stared into my face panting her fierce breath upon me blasts of breath as hot as fire look at me francis look at me i say you see the one person in the world who loves you you fool you fool with your giraldis and aurelias and jesuit dogs with your head in the air and your heart in your hand to be thrown like soldi to these routing swine misery ah misery she flung her head sideways that she should not look at me and with her hands gripped my shoulders till i winced she tossed her hair from her face and leapt into the battle again scolding rating praying like a mad thing her words came so fast that i cannot attempt their semblance here and her voice rose and fell in a kind of querulous chant to which sometimes she nodded her head as if she was beating the time yes i know yes i know i will tell you the truth for once and you shall kill virginia with your own hands and lay her on your bed and go away and be a fool your jesuit wants your money and your count your mistress and palamone will take you stripped of all and sell you to the grand duke so you will kill your virginia because she loves you and love your aurelia because she does not and all those others will trick you and play with you and suck you dry and throw you away like the rind of an orange ah now you have the truth and now you will kill me kill kill francis she had a fit of shivering which made her teeth chatter together and her breath draw in with a moaning most piteous to hear she showed the whites of her eyes swayed about was on the point of falling when all of a sudden she came to herself again caught me in her arms pressed her bosom against me kissed me on the lips kissed until i felt her teeth then sprang from me and before i could stop her was out of the room and half way downstairs half divining her purpose i flew to get her back but was too late i heard the street door open and shut she was in the piazza my landlord he was a notary by trade and by name ser torpe was dismayed to see me in bedgown and slippers never go as you are sir he cried go like an eccellenza bid them fetch a chair light of light what a costume for volterra i ran upstairs past him took down my birding piece primed it and went to the window virginia was talking to two of the sbrri putting up her hair as she did so with complete unconcern of what she displayed she was in her usual negligent undress all her class are the same in the mornings of a loose shift and stuff petticoat her bosom was bare her bare feet were in slippers for her hair she had but a single pin it was to be seen that the men viewed her with admiration as some wanton newly from her bed they used an easy familiarity not at all pleasant one of them who could not take his eyes off her said nothing the other put his hand on her waist i was angry with her i confess without reason she disengaged herself i heard her impatient no no ma senta she continued in rapid undertones one of the men looked up at my window and saw me gun in hand he shifted his glance a little higher and affected to be searching the roof of the house a third man joined his companions there was much laughing and jesting no doubt some rough compliments passed virginia however steered her way to her main purpose through the tangle of confessions excuses and refusals which they forced upon her but i suppose she had to give some ground for presently two of their heads came very close to hers i saw their eager faces and virginia's considering look it was a courtship she was playing her part and they believed her to be what she appeared that applied only to two of the three the third he who watched her so closely and said nothing held apart he had an ugly look the others absorbed in the pursuit took no notice of him but i kept my eyes upon him and was not at all surprised at what followed virginia after long debate pretended to yield something was proposed to her she considered it it was pressed upon her by two ardent voices she looked awry and laughed the chase quickened one of the men took her hand the other brought a coin from his pocket spat on it and pressed it on her as she hesitated with the money on her palm the silent watcher of all this whipped out a long knife and drove it into his comrade's back between the shoulders he groaned deeply flung his arms out and fell the fourth man came running over the piazza from his point virginia shrieked and ran back to the house i saw as if invisible barriers had been removed men women and boys come running in from all side streets it was like a performance in a theatre virginia white and shaking stood in my presence it is you they want francis i have heard all you must go at once at once what were you doing with the sbirri i asked her they made love to me all three of them but that dark man meant it and the others not it is very fortunate it will give us time which we need your count giraldi is in the country as i told you he would be there is no warrant come we will be off it will be perfectly safe while this confusion lasts dress yourself put on your cloak take your sword and pistol and come you too must be dressed child i said she no i am better as i am i can be of more use but she had a wiser thought it appears for by the time i was ready she looked modestly enough the plot if plot it had been had failed i got out of the house unnoticed and unfollowed virginia with me in a hood there were soldiers now in the piazza keeping back the crowd the dead man lay there still and his assailant wore shackles boys were racing in and out among the people singing the news which everybody knew martirio d'un pio frate assassino per amore ohe ohe we went down the via belle donne and crossed a small piazza taking our way said virginia to the ghetto where she thought we might be perfectly safe for the rest of the day there were so many hunted men there said she that in the confusion some must needs get away the curtains were drawn over the barbers' shops all doors were shut it was the hour of repose a few beggars sat in converse on the steps of san michele many were asleep in the shade there were no passengers no sbirri to be seen until we reached the via campidoglio here virginia drew me back into the shadow of a great house that way is stopped they are watching the market come we will try something else i admired her resourceful audacity and followed whither she chose to lead we ran up the via vecchietta without disturbance or alarm and reached the church of san lorenzo we entered the cloister which breathed the full summer late as it was in the year bees hummed about the tree the glossy leaves of the great magnolia seemed to radiate heat and glitter above us the sky was of almost midsummer whiteness and i could see the heat waves flicker above the dome you shall hide in the sagrestia to night if you will be ruled by me virginia said to morrow morning before first mass we will gain the ghetto i know a woman there who will keep us my word don francis you little guess how near the bargello you have been i think she was eager for my praises poor soul by the shy light in her eyes a kind of preparation for the blushes with which she always met any warmth in my tone if i gave her none it was because she had displeased me by cheapening herself to the sbirri but i was soon ashamed of myself i asked her when did you find out that the sbirri were waiting for me the second hour of the day it was she replied when i went out to buy milk for your chocolate there were but two of them then they asked me if you were in the house i said no they said that you had killed a frate and i that i was sure he had deserved it one of them laughed and said that had nothing to do with it he had been sent there to be killed the other one that black browed fellow who stabbed his comrade said nothing at all but just looked at me hard he never took his eyes away once so i guessed how his barque was steering and you saw what wind i blew i saw it virginia and disapproved per esempio you disapproved tears filled her eyes she shrugged her shoulders pitying herself povera virginia she said this made me ashamed enough to say dear virginia i know that you acted for my safety yes i did yes i did but i would do worse ah you little know how bad i would make myself and you reproach me she was on the edge of a frenzy but checked herself what does it matter now that you are safe we will stop in the sagrestia all night they will never look for you there but my dear said i we have three hours to wait before the sagrestia is opened do you ask me to stay here in this cloister for that time she looked embarrassed for the truth is that she would have asked me if i had not spoken of it she had forgotten that i was not of her nation no no she said hastily that is ridiculous how could i ask you to do such a thing as that the question i am glad of it i returned because there i can't oblige you i must break my fast so must you by the time we have done the sagrestia may be ready for us observe also that in spending the night in that place i am obliging you for i don't at all see why we should do it she searched my face with those grey eyes of hers hunting my raillery out the thing above all which she dreaded was to be laughed at she never laughed herself except bitterly in anger and hated the indulgence suspecting still what she failed to find she fell in with my desire to eat though she must have thought it preposterous and me a madman to have it she could never understand my attachment to custom and never think of more than one thing at a time just now she was engaged in hiding me from justice to succeed in which task she would have sat still for an eternity and gone without a thousand meals what an outcry she must have had ready for me and how she must have loved her hard taskmaster she did violence to all her feelings fell in with my desire at once naturally don francis you must eat naturally i must eat naturally by the time we have finished the sagrestia will be open very good don francis but as to spending the night in the sagrestia shall i be impertinent if i tell you that by this time there is not a locanda in florence that has not got a full and exact description of you and me and not a landlord among them that would not hand you over for two baiocchi how do you know that my dear i asked she stretched out her arms how do i know hear him how do i know that my mother is a woman and my father a man dio buono have i lived in my sty with my eyes shut and herded with thieves and taken them for marchesi but you shall be fed don francis leave that to me do you stay here quietly i will get you some food i said that i must come with her whereupon she began to cry bitterly to call me heartless and cruel to pity herself in the most deplorable terms she nursed and fondled herself by name povera virginia poor little virginia that works so hard for her tyrant and gives herself no rest but he is cruel more cruel than if he beat her stabs her heart with cold words rends it with sharp fingers poor little virginia poor little outcast from the madonna i have not a heart of stone i confess that her distress made me dreadfully ashamed this good soul whose only happiness lay in mine who had trusted her all in all to me without flinching whose life was now at my disposal as her honour had been for so long unworthy of the name of man had i been if i could wound her so lightly i put my arm round her waist and drew her towards me with tenderness i took her hands from her face and implored her forgiveness i promised to offend her no more to stay in the cloister until she came to sleep in the sagrestia to do all her behests in answer the sun came out in her face she listened to me with soft rapture beautiful to see and before i had done the dear generous creature snatched at my hand and kneeling kissed it with a frenzy of devotion which brought the tears to my eyes immediately afterwards she was gone on her errand of mercy leaving me in a glow of truly honest gratitude which was to have its speedy fruit in an act which though it fell short of my intention was to prove for my ultimate content chapter xxix i take sanctuary past fatigues and present danger did not disturb my happy meditations i paced the cloister of san lorenzo without regard for them absorbed in considering my future conduct and the relationship in which i stood to my little world of circumstance it was necessary that i should make plans for myself and for virginia and i made and rejected many without modifying them one and all as well i might have done by allowing for the part which the gallows the gaol or the hulks might play in them as my habit has always been i endeavoured to judge the case upon its merits and to adjust myself to it not so much according to my desires as to my duties towards it here to remind the reader are the three factors of my problem i had of my own act withdrawn myself from aurelia's society having done her all the reparation i could and obtained her forgiveness i had constituted myself virginia's champion against the marchese semifonte i had killed fra palamone now to take these in order it was plainly my duty to quit the side of the fair aurelia even though she were and were to remain for me the shining orb of my firmament in whose beam i must for ever walk i must not see her again i had obtained from her all that i could hope for and given her quite as much as if not more than she desired to stay by her now would be to compromise her i could not be blind to the conviction of all my acquaintance which saw in me that horrible spectacle the lover of a married woman accepted as such by her lawful master robbery of which i could never be capable no more of aurelia then no more she must depart like a dream before the stern face of the morrow or i must depart happy perhaps for her whatever it may have been for me that she herself had taken the first step when she turned her back upon me in pique i disregarded palamone's bloody end i had executed a criminal a procurer for hire a vile thing unworthy to live but what was i to do with virginia there was a young woman of capacity merit and beauty whose honour i had taken in charge so far i had maintained it and there were two ways in which i could continue so to do in return she had given me devotion of the most singular kind for it is extreme devotion that a girl should bear obloquy and humiliation for the sake of a man who has defended her there was no doubt also but that i was master of her heart no doubt at all but that she would give herself to me without thought if i lifted a finger the conviction of such a truth is a dangerous possession for a man and i don't pretend that i was insensible to it any more than i was to her definite and personal charm he is divine not human who remains cold and unbiased with the knowledge that here at his disposal is a lovely and ardent female longing to be in his arms now i had withdrawn her from her home defied a claimant to her and killed a man who sought her ruin and what was i going to do i saw that there were two courses open but that unless it were possible to do as the rest of her acquaintance had tried to do there was but one was i to kill palamone in order that i might ruin her myself good heavens my name was strelley of upcote there was one course and i must take that i did not love virginia i admit it i knew that she was beautiful and knew that she was mine for the asking but a truce to casuistry in her safety was involved my own honour to her defence must go my own life i admired i respected i was grateful i wished her well i determined to marry her and the sooner the better having come to this conclusion i knew myself well enough to believe that no power in the world could shake me from it when therefore the good girl returned to me white and out of breath with sausages bread and a flask of wine under her apron i welcomed her as befitted one in the position in which i now designed her to stand i took off my hat to her and relieved her of her burden she noticed the courtesy the colour flew back to her cheeks but i observed that her breath was not thereby restored she became very voluble to hide her confusion for by ordinary she was sparing of speech or did she guess the lover in the master who can tell the wine she told me was easy got and the bread the sausage she went on ah it would have been as easy to give you one of my legs for sausages i went first to il torto's in the borgo it was shut for mezzodi i begin tapping the wife opens 'chi e' says she and i see a sbirro in the shop eating polenta 'niente niente' i say and run that told me that the babbo was away and that his wife had a lover in the constabulary remember it don francis we may have need of her who knows shall i confess to you that i stole your sausage confess what you please my dear said i i shall shrive you her eyes were dewy but she lowered them too soon it was a sin she said but i do not intend to eat any sausage so i shall be forgiven but you see that the spies are all abroad now i have just thought of something don francis we cannot remain in this cloister at least i cannot if a canon awoke before his time and it needs but a fly to settle on a nose to cause it and if he poke his head out of his door the first thing he will do will be to look at me naturally virginia i said it is what i am doing i am well aware of it said virginia and showed that she spoke the truth but the second thing he will do will be to look at you i don't think we can afford ourselves this honour so let us go there is a way from here into the library thence into the church and from there to the sagrestia nuova if we could only find it whither nobody goes but a grand duke and he only when he is dead let us go by that will you not come it is true that i am rather frightened by now i got up at once come then child let us hunt out our way we went upstairs the long library was quite empty we went to the further end on tiptoe there were three doors at the bottom in three bays surmounted by busts we chose for the right hand and turned the handle it gave into a narrow passage lined with bookcases and dimly lighted i think this will be the way virginia said and took the key out of the door and locked it on the inside we followed the passage to a flight of stone steps descended these in their curving course round a pillar and came upon a little arched doorway virginia opened it it led directly into the church of san lorenzo we saw the hanging lamps before the altars and a boy in a short surplice asleep in a confessional wait here wait here says virginia i will make him lead us into the sagrestia i saw her go lightly as a hare in the grass towards the boy and wondered she stooped over him where he was huddled anyhow as children are when they are asleep and whispered in his ear carino carino do you sleep i am talking to you carino do you hear me say yes si si the boy murmured and sighed and struggled i am speaking to you carino i am tired i want to sleep also tell me how to reach the sagrestia where the monsters lie sleeping and waking whisper it whisper it and i will kiss you for it i heard her soothing hush hush as he stirred she went on whispering in his ear it seemed to me that she was insinuating herself into his dreams he stirred more than once turned his head about every moment i expected to see him open his eyes but no as virginia continued to whisper he began to murmur in his sleep she directing him he answered laughed softly turned about slept always i saw virginia kiss his forehead then she came winging back to me she seemed hardly to touch the pavement come come i know the way the door is open she flitted away towards the high altar i following we gained the ambulatory behind a door from this stood ajar virginia pushed in i after her we followed a flagged corridor for some distance and found ourselves in the sagrestia nuova with michael angelo's monsters sprawling and brooding in the half light virginia clasped me in her arms francesco mio i have saved thee sanctuary with thee oh love thy poor virginia she pressed closely to me and began to touch and stroke my cheeks she put her hand at the back of my head as it were to force my face down to look at her touched excited amorous in my turn i encircled her with my arms and kissed her fondly dearest best kindest virginia i said you have proved my friend indeed i have much to thank you for much to say to you let us choose a place in which to eat our breakfast i am as hungry as the devil cruel abominable speech of mine i wounded her dreadfully scalding tears testified to a bruised heart but to her relief came pride stop said she you shall not eat yet i am hungrier than you whom bread will satisfy i am famished i would have made amends but she drew away from me and folded her arms let me understand you kissed me just now were you false to aurelia did you intend to insult that girl whom you taught to fear insult i said no that had never been my intention but it had been quite otherwise donna aurelia i said has been restored to her proper place she will find salvation where her happiness is and i have been considering mine whether i can find it in my happiness also one thing at a time said she breathing very fast has donna aurelia's husband returned i told her that he had not but that there were good hopes of him shortly and you have said farewell you are free free as the air it is my duty i told her never to see donna aurelia again and i will not if i can help it she frowned then threw up her hands i don't understand anything about you is this love or madness you love a lady who loves you you find her here alone you meet you speak you look at each other you take her by the hand and lead her back to her husband and tell her that she will never see you again and she allows it not only so said i but it was she who turned her back upon me and she did rightly why did she so she asked me i had to tell her that it was on her account it made her peer with her eyes in which however a keen light burned she took a step towards me i thought she would be in my arms but instead she stopped short breathing fast through her nostrils 'tell me this tell me this she said was she the fool or were you i laughed my girl i told her if i am a fool it is not for you to say so but i believe for all that that you are paying me a compliment she did not comprehend me so took refuge in a quip tossing her head at me she said i wish your worship joy of my compliment i took her i intend that you shall do more than wish me joy child i intend that you shall give it me and be my joy this altered her tune she quickly released herself and pointed to the victuals she had risked herself to get let us eat she said and talk afterwards forgive me if i troubled you just now i have suffered and am a little over wrought forgive me i kissed her again she not forbidding me we put our cloaks below that enormous figure of the thinker and sat down to our breakfast we ate our sausages and drank our wine colour came back into virginia's grave face light danced in her eyes she became more herself but with an excitement latent within her which betrayed itself in little hasty acts of affection quick movements half caressing half petulant as if she would soothe me and half way change her mood and be minded to scratch i became interested i wondered how long she would leave our affairs in doubt rather unkindly i held my tongue just for the pleasure of seeing her make the next advance and then in spite of my curiosity fatigue began to creep over me i had been thirty six hours awake had bid an everlasting farewell to a mistress restored or done my best to restore a banished wife to her husband's arms shot a man saved a virgin's honour made matrimonial advances run for my life here was a good day and a half's work after a profusion of yawns which try as i would i could not stifle i said forgive me my dear if i go to sleep i find myself mortally tired and you must be in the same case let us lie down here and rest ourselves sleep my lord sleep said she with beautiful tender seriousness and spread my cloak on a bench for me she took off my sword and knelt as her custom of old had been to kiss my hand i felt then that i must needs love this loving child i lifted her up and kneel no more to me my girl i said you and i are ruined together i cannot obey my father who will disinherit me you are no better off hunted animals don't kneel to each other but league themselves to face their persecutors virginia be mine she said nothing and would not meet my eyes i drew her to me embraced her with my arm kissed her cold lips do you know what i am doing virginia i said do you know what i need of you my only friend yes don francis she said you are making love to me and it is your right i have never refused you and never shall but you must not ask me to marry you if i were nettled it was because a man having made up his mind is not willingly thwarted for no other reason but i do not know that i can accuse myself even of so much i did not let her go nor did i cease to kiss her i told her i believe with as much calmness as is possible under the circumstances that i was perfectly determined i said that she need have no fear of the future even though in taking me she would take no such fortune as i ought to offer to my wife she flamed up at this and cried out that she wanted no fortune and had never led me to believe it well and good child i replied in that case you need have no fears at all for i on my side can ask you to admit that i have given you no reason to suppose me a villain if i take you and all that you have believe me i shall give you in return my mind and affection as well as the respect and gratitude which you have already believe me virginia she moaned and rocked herself about oh i love you so oh do not tempt me oh my lord my lord what shall i do oh madonna purissima help me now i caught her to my heart virginia as beautiful as you are true you are worthy of a better love than mine i cried but a more tender love you will never have friend saviour dear and faithful beloved companion i need you come she struggled faintly to put me away she withheld her lips by averting her head but i caught at her wrists and held her arms to her sides by and by she let me have my will and gave me kiss for kiss i had won her she was mine utterly from that hour my lord and my love she said you have conquered me i will be yours in the manner you desire you may be humbling yourself but you are exalting me have no fear i will make you happy ah but how i will work for you you have never seen me work yet i am your servant still your faithful servant we shall serve each other i hope my child i said there will be work for me to do also but what is immediately before us is to escape from florence virginia got up sleep you here my soul i will go out and see how the land lies before morning i will see you again she clasped me to her bosom and kissed me fondly then went quickly out as swift and salient in her joy as a keen wind of spring that carries health in its forceful pride i slept profoundly until daylight little knowing what her immediate errand was chapter xxx i marry and go to lucca virginia was pleased to be very mysterious on the subject of our marriage keeping me in the sagrestia for three or four days visiting me only to give me food and such news as she cared to impart she told me for instance that professor lanfranchi had undoubtedly arrived in florence and that he was staying with aurelia at the villa san giorgio as to our own affair she said that everything was in good train she had found a church and a priest in the ghetto she would need a little money not very much and promised directly the coast was clear to get me over to that safe quarter to be done with this part of my history so she did and was made mine in the church of sant' andrea on october three years almost to a day since my arrival in padua in i took her back to a mean lodging in that meanest part of florence and spent three days with her there alone i then wrote to my father as i felt bound in duty to do fully unreservedly with candour and i hope modesty i wrote to father carnesecchi to professor lanfranchi such money as i could consider mine by right i converted into cash the rest which i thought to be my father's being that share of my monthly allowance which i had received after i had decided to disobey him i returned by bills of exchange to his london bankers i believe that on the day of my departure from florence i stood up possessed of some fifty guineas no great capital upon which a man and his young wife could begin the world nor had i any great idea how i should increase or husband my little store but i was young zealous proud i believed in myself i loved virginia in a word as always happened to me i looked studiously forward and was happy as for her she hardly touched the ground with her feet when she walked you never saw so radiant a creature we left the ghetto at a good hour of the morning intending for lucca but at the gate of san frediano a difficulty about post horses bade fair to detain us for a day in very unfortunate publicity the man of whom we had bespoken them met us there with despair upon his face he was vexed he was harrowed his nicest feelings of honour were wounded at least he said that they were the horses had been fed and watered he was about to put them to when an order which he dared not disobey had supervened no less was this than a precept from the pratica segreta that the horses were to be put at the disposition of the cavaliere aquamorta of whom the state was most anxious to be rid had it been anything under a government order said he he would have laughed in the bearer's face not even the grand duke could make an honest man break his word c c but i could see he was helpless i saw nothing so clearly as that i was i expostulated offered more money than i could afford virginia stormed all to no purpose i was for walking and was about to command virginia to accompany me when who should appear but my gentleman himself the cavaliere aquamorta inquiring the cause of the uproar he presented a truly magnificent appearance in that squalid place no sooner was he informed that he was the cause of our distress than he addressed himself to me with elaborate politeness all the more singular as that my appearance and equipage contrasted most unfavourably with his my clothes had not been improved by the adventures i had undergone my linen was soiled i had no baggage virginia was respectably dressed and looked beautiful but had no pretensions to a rank which she did not possess of herself and which i did not propose to give her for i had thought it only honourable in me as i was dispensing with my father's injunctions to dispense also with his money i had renounced the world in which i had gained nothing but misery and crime in this fine gentleman's eyes therefore i must have seemed a simple young artisan and virginia a pretty country girl however he begged to be of service to us he was himself going to lucca he said if he took our horses it was only fair we should take seats in his chariot in fine we should hurt him deeply if we did not all this was put before me with so much frankness and good humour that i could not well refuse it i saw moreover that in addition to my horses he had two of his own i accepted his offer therefore with many thanks he handed virginia in with a bow he begged me to precede him which i did but to the back seat he took the place next my wife and we left florence if said this remarkable man i lay it down as an indispensable preliminary to our acquaintance which i hope may be long and warm that you accept me for a gentleman it is because as i do not happen to be one i have devoted all my energies to demonstrating the exact contrary no man can help the accident of his birth my mother was an actress of venice god knows who was my father but i tell myself that he was peculiarly mine i was educated in the slips of the theatre of san moise at ten i ran away from home and from the age of twelve made my fortune my own care it was then that i found out the advantages of being what i was not for i observed that while nobody scrupled to cheat a gentleman if he could safely do it nobody on the other hand resented the fact that a gentleman cheated him at the age of fifteen when i served in zante in the company of the noble mocenigo and received a decoration for gallantry and a commission of lieutenant i killed my captain for permitting himself to doubt my gentility i should be sorry to have to reckon how many more have gone his way or for how many years i have been obliged to shed blood in every new state i have chosen to inhabit those days are past and over my reputation is made this order which i wear was presented to me by the holy father and is at once my patent and my passport if i need another it is here he pointed to his sword which reposed upon a narrow ledge of the chariot behind my back i then told him a difficulty of my own which was that although i was a gentleman by birth who had waived his rank for reasons unnecessary to be named i had no passport into the republic of lucca i think it right to inform you cavaliere i added that i also found it necessary to shed blood in florence and that consequently i have left that city somewhat abruptly and without a passport i should be sorry to put you to any inconvenience on my account and assure you that you have only to express a doubt a hint will be enough to be relieved of me and my wife at our first baiting place he clasped my hand saying i like your frankness it pleases me vastly and i see that i can help you i have a very commodious passport which will pass your charming lady yourself and half a dozen children if you had been so precocious as to have them let us talk of more pleasant things than my magnanimity if you please the subject is naturally familiar to me this cavaliere aquamorta he had the order of the golden spur from his holiness was a tall spare man of a striking if truculent presence with a high forehead prominent eyebrows densely black cheekbones like razors a complexion of walnut and burning dark eyes he carried his head high and punctuated his vivacious utterances with snorts and free expectoration he was as i had seen at once very much overdressed his jabot was too full he had three watches ring laden fingers not unduly clean and no less than five snuff boxes which he used in turn he had certain delicate perceptions however which i must do him the justice to record for if he was overdressed i god knows was not and yet not one glance of his penetrating eyes was turned in my direction which was not of deference and amiability he treated me in every respect as if i had been his equal in appearance address and fortune his gallantry to virginia would have been i thought excessive if displayed to any woman in the world before we had gone a league he had hold of her hand to illustrate a story he was telling us of an intrigue he had had with the princess of schaffhausen i took her highness' hand thus says he and took my wife's 'madame' i said 'upon the honour of aquamorta the affair having gone so far must go all lengths logic and love alike demand it' the story was long by the end of it it was to be seen that he still held virginia's hand indeed he held it more or less until we stopped at empoli to dine and when we returned to the carriage if i may be believed this knight of the spur resumed possession and as if it had been a plaything nursed flourished flirted made raps with my wife's hand until we were near the end of the day and within a few miles of the frontier of lucca then at last he released it kissing it first popped his head out of the window looked about and started gave a prodigious ha cleared his throat spat twice and sat down again he looked at me pleasantly but with penetration we have arrived at the dreadful field of altopascio where castruccio castracane cut up the florentine legions says he and now friend your trials begin my dear signor francis believe me that i shall never forget the honour you and your charming lady have done to the equipage and solitary splendour of aquamorta nor the many marks of confidence and esteem you have both shown me throughout our delightful journey unhappily so far as you are concerned dear sir it is over for a while it will be necessary for you to leave us my passport he produced it is made out for the cavaliere aquamorta his lady and servants your plan therefore will be to mount the box i would take your place and give you mine but that i am too well known to be supposed my own lacquey nor could my sensitive honour brook it if i were i would offer you my cloak again but that i fear it would betray you it is perhaps a little out of key with the rest of your apparel better after all take one of those rascals' for the next few hours you are fritz remember fritz from buda pesth and i he cried with a sprightly air am the happy the indulged possessor of the most lovely of women again he kissed virginia's hand deeply annoyed as i was there was nothing for it but to obey and it was under these by no means dignified circumstances that i entered the republic of lucca for the first time worse was to follow much worse the man was without conscience in exacting from me the uttermost farthing of the bargain arrived at the inn where it seemed he had already bespoken the whole of the first floor he led virginia upstairs with the greatest deference hat in hand past the bowing landlord and all his array of scullions maidservants lacqueys porters and cooks and took no more notice of me than he had done of the horde of beggars at the door full of indignation i started to follow him but his body servant an assured rogue if ever there was one stopped me with a firm grip of my elbow softly comrade softly says he they won't need you yet awhile when hot metal is on the anvil my master is accustomed to strike what do you mean you rascal i cried and he still holding my arm why my fine man says he since you won't take a hint i must deal plainly with you as we were then at the foot of the stairs he suddenly wheeled me to the right about and plunged me into the crowd of inn servants landlord cried he take this fellow in and give him his hire on my master's account 'tis a runaway gaolbird by the look of him for whom we have no sort of use here a few pauls will be handsome he carried out his part with such bounce that he was completely successful between him and the landlord and his crew i was hustled into the kitchens where i found the preparations for the cavaliere's supper in full blast chapter xxxi my adventures at the inn i hope i may say that in the painful position in which i found myself i did what was becoming to a man of honour more jealous of his wife's than of his own i reasoned with myself that a scandal an uproar an exhibition of my resentment would not only be no protection to virginia but would be on the other hand the clearest evidence that i doubted her it could only end in my being turned out of the inn and in her being held by every man and woman of the place for what she was not i remembered here with admiration the conduct of father carnesecchi who having on one occasion conducted two ladies and their cavaliers about the church of san giovannino and pointed out what beauties it possessed and many which it did not was mistaken by them for the sacristan and offered a small gratuity at the door he thanked them and humbly accepted it and as i think did well for as he said afterwards it would have hurt their esteem much more to have been refused than it could possibly hurt his to have been offered the gift it was in the spirit of this that i acted in the present state of my affairs virginia was undoubtedly my wife and therefore of my own rank to doubt a gentleman in any situation however delicate were to be offensive it could not therefore be less offensive but must needs be more to doubt a gentlewoman not only did i not doubt her in truth but i would not let it be supposed by any one that i did there then in that steaming kitchen among sweating cooks and greasy cook aids did i stand with what countenance i had they were too busy just then for any notice to be thrown my way i sat in a corner out of sight and watched their preparations for a superb banquet it might have seemed that the cavaliere was going to entertain all the ancients of the republic to judge by the capons and turkeys the strings of ortolans the quails the partridges roasting basting or getting trussed there was a cygnet i remember there were large fish stuffed with savoury herbs crawfish lampreys eels in wine there were pastry shapes of cream jellies custards you never saw such a feast and i am sure there were a score of persons of both sexes busy about it the maids flew from saucepan to stewpan the boys staggered under piles of plates the dressers and servers were always in and out carrying dishes to the lacqueys of the table or coming back for more the head cook a mountain of brawn and lard seemed fresh from the bath so he dripped and shone the hubbub bustle heat and worry are not to be described by me when the dinner was at last completed and sent to table the master cook straightened himself and gave a short order which was immediately obeyed i saw him go into the scullery near by and souse his head and neck in a bucket of cold water in a trice the tables of his late business were cleared and the scullions laid out the materials for supper these were as may be supposed distinguished by abundance rather than refinement a dish of tripe a chine of beef spaghetti in wash hand basins onion salad with garlic sausages blood puddings pigs' feet in vinegar high wicker flasks of wine stood in iron cages to be swung down by the finger there was one bottle of water all was ready but nobody sat down until the master cook appeared the men stood on one side of the table the maids on the other like soldiers on parade he entered the huge fellow red from his cold douche his hair all rumpled from the rude embraces of the jack towel and walked over to the men's side wiping the wet from his ears as he went he stood this captain of the kitchen in front of his company and with a sweeping and appraising eye surveyed the ordered nymphs he selected the partner of his choice a modest mannered creature who answered to the name of gentucca she came forward and stood by his side with no more waiting he took his seat at the head of the board and plunging his fingers into a steaming bowl of spaghetti began to gobble at it in the unedifying way which his nation have and which indeed the dish demands gentucca sat at his right hand but took nothing until she had helped him to drink meantime the others had made their arrangements from the second in command down to the merest pot boy selections had been made from among the maids i heard lisabetta come here or no no liperata i have chosen you or it was caterina or giocosa or bettina as the case may have been to be brief down sat everybody in the kitchen jack by his gill save my unhappy self it was the highly favoured gentucca who pointed me out to the grand master of the cooks as i still wore the cape and long coat of aquamorta's servant i was naturally accepted as such the master cook who saw directly that i was a foreigner courteously invited me to the right hand of gentucca ordering a bouncing girl of the name of maria maddelena to make room for me she very pleasantly did so my plate was heaped my cup was filled all the company stood up and drank my health nothing could have been kinder than this humble society my eyes clouded more than once to recognise it my host exerted himself to entertain me though he tried and i cannot blame him to entertain the company at the same time perhaps his curiosity got the better of his good nature certainly he pumped me as dry as i could be induced to go and it was not until he had learned everything i cared to tell him that he remembered that he could impart as well as receive he discussed my master as he supposed him to be the cavaliere and by what he told me gave me some entertainment not unmixed with anxiety that obliging and imperturbable person was i found out a gentleman of fortune a term which implies that he was not a gentleman at all and had no kind of fortune but what he could secure of his neighbours he travelled like a prince and spent his money freely but all was as my host said a case of casting nets not but what my gentleman loves his belly as much as you or i said the master cook and small blame to him if he do a man's head has no more stout ally than his paunch while it is well lined and no more arrant deserter if he cut short the supplies but if you suppose sir that the banquet which i have sent upstairs is all for aquamorta and his lady to consume en tete a tete you know very little about him why i'll wager that demirep of a valet of his has collected half our young blades to the board good food good wine good talk there will be never fear and afterwards what follows so soon as the tables are cleared out come the cards and the fishes his excellency to oblige the company will make a faro bank the company well fed and well drunken to oblige his excellency will punt the signora will do the same for the ladies the ladies for the signora now do you see the drift of his net should any little dispute arise as will be on occasion the cavaliere's sword is at the disposition of the gentleman offended he is something of a marksman too as you cannot fail to have heard if you are a traveller he has killed a man and undone a couple of ladies in every court of europe he has been under the leads at venice and out again deuce knows how he has been expelled from half the cities of italy and has turned the story into capital in the other half a most exorbitant irresistible droll of a master you have there sir but who his decoy duck of the moment may be i dare say you can tell better than i a fine young woman and a cool hand i could see for myself i thought she looked waspish and gave herself more graces than were hers by nature he has a taste for a bitter with his food it appears something tart and sharp to give an edge to his palate perhaps do you happen to know her name i said she was known to me as donna virginia whereat he laughed gaily and taking gentucca round the waist kissed her heartily saying that she was the virgin for him shortly after this with a few words of polite excuse he broke up the table and retired with his partner the rest of the company gave itself up to pleasures which were as zestful as they were free it may be imagined that i had little taste for such simple sports as these worthy persons could devise i sat an unhappy spectator of their gambols but a diversion of a vigorous kind was at hand in the midst of the scuffling and babel of voices in the kitchen i heard the strident tones of the cavaliere evidently in a great rage where is that dastardly dog where is that villain of a cook i heard him roar on the stairs bring me that scoundrel that i may slit his ears at this moment he burst through the doors a terrific spectacle of fury his eyes burning like fires his face inflamed his drawn sword in his hand the company scattered to the walls or dived beneath the tables chairs were overturned the maids began to scream he glared about him at the desert he had made produce me the cook you knaves cried he or i mow you down like thistles the master cook's face peeped through the gently opened door and the cavaliere across the room in two strides seized his victim by the ear and pulled him headlong into the kitchen hound he roared and son of a hound take the punishment you have earned sir sir says the unhappy cook what have i done done cries the cavaliere screwing him unmercifully by the ear you have compassed my death by your infernal arts i am poisoned a dying man but my last ounce of strength shall be enough to avenge me so said he began to belabour the wretch with the flat of his sword and at each stroke the cook gave a howl of terror his poor little mistress ran out of her concealment and clung to his helpless person seeking to receive upon hers the blows as they fell it was then that i interposed cavaliere i said you are acting with i know not what justice against a man who has just proved more hospitable to me than yourself has thought fit to do i must now tell you that any further indignity offered to him must be considered as done to me he paused in his furious attack and ha says he here's the husband he began to laugh he laughed with such gusto and abandoned himself to such uproarious mirth that very soon all the company except myself was laughing with him all of a sudden he stopped with a mighty serious face harkee my friend says he to me upon reflection i do believe that i have been hasty the spasm passes it may well be that it was the excellence of this honest man's catering which betrayed me and not any infernal design a passing cholic after all he smiled benevolently upon his recent prisoner rise my worthy friend said he and receive a pardon from the right hand of fellowship sugared as i hope to your liking his hand was full of gold pieces nobody shall say he added proudly that aquamorta cannot requite good service because he knows so well how to reprimand bad service the cook humbly thanking his excellency the storm was over but i had another brewing or thought that i should have as the cavaliere was about to retire i stopped him and said that i wished to accompany him he scratched his head why my dear sir says he that will be plaguily inconvenient at this moment my rooms are full of guests d'ye see your charming lady is entertaining all the senators' mistresses and i am in the midst of a carouse with their serenities i am not one for hard and fast categories as you know your dirty shirt and ragged elbows are nothing to me but zounds i can't answer for the most serene ancients i said then that i would retire to my room and wait for my wife but to that he objected that in strict truth and to keep up the fiction upon which my safety depended i had no room at all my wife was considered to be his wife while i was supposed to be what i had professed myself his servant would i he asked me for the sake of a night's gratification imperil the many happy years which he hoped and would take care should be in store for me i was somewhat slow in meeting this preposterous question as it deserved and when i opened my lips to speak he stopped me with say no more i don't ask your thanks your safety is as dear to me as my own he beckoned to one of the scullions and hi you says he show this fellow of mine where he can sleep and see to it that his company be honest with that he ruffled upstairs with the airs of a grand duke and left me once more stranded with the cooks to come to an end of this humiliating page rejecting all offers of company i was accommodated with a wretched cupboard below the stairs which smelt vilely of sour wine and mildewed cheese and ruefully prepared to spend what sort of night i could with my thoughts for bedfellows i know not what hour of the night it was when i was roused out of a dream tortured sleep by the creaking of my cupboard door looking up the light of a candle which she held showed me virginia behold virginia she said did you doubt whether i should come i never doubted but you would come if you could i replied but i did not see how it was possible she blew out the candle and crept to my side the cavaliere by diverting his friends with your plight she said revealed to me where he had left you i excused myself to the company and retired i think he will be disagreeably surprised before morning i was much touched by her devotion and wifely duty and assured her of it by every means in my power chapter xxxii we live happily in lucca whatever trick virginia may have designed for the humiliation of the cavaliere and i never inquired of her what it was it failed of any apparent effect he presented himself before us in the morning with undisturbed serenity and the same elaborate professions of good will he was going he said to spend the day in my rehabilitation be of good cheer my dear don francis were his comfortable words for i never yet failed a friend it would indeed to put it at its lowest be a deplorable want of policy on my part for since i wish to be thought a gentleman every act of my life must be more gentlemanlike than that of the greatest gentleman in europe as you have found me hitherto so you shall find me now make me your banker at the tailor's the perruquier's the barber's the shirtmaker's the hosier's and the hatter's add the shoemaker to your list to oblige me i go out to beat at every influential door in lucca in your favour before nightfall you shall have papers of identity and safe conduct which will take you all over our peninsula i thanked him but declined any assistance whatsoever i had money enough for my needs my wife was prepared to share the fortunes of her husband i said that i intended to take a small lodging to settle myself there and by honest industry to make my way in the world both of us could work we had no desire for fine society and as for credentials the excellency of our handiwork and our obedience to the laws would be the best in the world he was vexed and showed that he was as for your handiwork my dear sir says he all that i have seen of it is that it has left you with scarce a shirt to your back your respect for the law has induced you to shoot a capuchin in broad daylight and forced you to leave florence disguised as a manservant however these things are no concern of mine go your own way young gentleman consider me your friend and permit me to kiss your lady's hand vowing myself her grateful and obliged servant for more favours than perhaps you would care to hear recounted scorning such insinuations as they deserved virginia held him out her hand which he kissed as if he would have bitten it i ought to have been warned by the glitter in his hard black eyes but being conscious of my moral altitude above the base wretch i took no further notice of him i had still in my possession my fifty guineas with which judiciously laid out i had no doubt but that we could make our way good in lucca full of hope and fortified by all the privileges which the church can bestow upon a christian or a complaisant wife upon her husband i set about my business which was to secure honourable employment for both of us after much discussion with virginia and the exhibition of reasons on my part with which i shall be less particular to trouble the reader since i have dwelt upon them more than once already i decided to begin in one of the humblest positions a man can take up i would do journeyman's work of any sort or kind until i had won what in the finer walks of life we call the spurs not to be behind me in effort virginia would work also i hesitated for some time between the carpenter's and the gardener's profession for both of which i had always had an aptitude but the former had my choice virginia ultimately chose for laundry work because that took her more into the open air which she dearly loved i remember that we came to these decisions after a day or two of talk about them upon the grassy ramparts which overlooked the beautiful city on one side and the green meads of the serchio with their background of purple hills on the other it was there that virginia holding my hand in hers spoke in this manner francis said she my lord and master i have never yet asked you why you paid me the extreme honour of making me your wife when as you know very well i was yours to dispose of in any other way you pleased and i shall never ask you it is enough for me that you have raised a poor girl out of the mire and made her a proud woman but proud as i am or because i am proud i shall not forget to be humble don't suppose that i think myself raised to your degree because you have taken me in your arms no indeed i am a little peasant and shall always be a little peasant if i was found good in your eyes as i am bound to believe i was it was for that reason such as i am for such as you have taken me i shall never fail you i will work the flesh off my bones for you i will lie cheat steal commit any sin under the sky if you bid me i am utterly yours to take or put away to live or die for heaven or hell you have only to require of me it is in my power to sink for your pleasure for we can always go lower than our best but i cannot rise without you if you ask me to set up for a lady i tell you plainly i cannot have patience with me francis do not condemn me to fail you if i cannot rise you must stoop if i cannot be a fine lady you must be content to do without your gentlehood if i am a peasant you must be a peasant as such i shall please you i am certain of it in any other way you will stab me at every turn of your head i shall break my back for you and do well in my own way but in yours i shall break my heart and not advantage you one inch remember this too that you may abandon me whenever you please and get no reproaches from me she spoke modestly courageously and well i kissed her saying you are a good wife to me virginia i agree with everything you say come my dear kiss me i think we shall be happy she dashed her hand across her eyes as if to fend off a sudden storm of tears then threw her arms round my neck and pressed me close to her bosom she kissed me a thousand times eagerly and warmly i love you my lord i love you my saviour and king if you are kind to me i shall die beat me misuse me neglect me be unfaithful it is your right and i shall serve you the better for it but if you love me i cannot bear it i shall suffocate with joy my heart will crack o francis francis wilt thou never understand thy poor girl all this time she was straining me to her with frenzy kissing me almost blind with tears she was frantic panting and struggling for breath i had seen her before in possession of this dangerous ecstasy of love and though i could not but love her for it in my turn it was not the kind of happiness i wished her to enjoy her scene ended in a very passion of weeping distressing to witness but no doubt soothing after which moaning like one sore beaten she lay lax and languid in my arms deeply touched i laid her down upon the grass and watched her fade off into a quieter sleep in this state she lay for an hour of more and awoke refreshed her usual shrewd and reticent self therefore loving and being passionately loved in return working diligently at a clean trade living in the sweat of my brow owing no man anything the next few months of my life few as they were not more than six all told were some of the happiest i have ever spent they recalled those weeks at pistoja but only to excel them for then i was idle and virginia not satisfied then i had none of the sweet uses of domestic life the hearth in common and the heart too the nuptial sacraments of kiss and embrace the united outlook the rational hope of increase we forgot the world which had forgotten us our appetites were simple and easily satisfied we fed each other and knew deep content happy happy days at lucca too soon ended we shared the uses of a single room with a couple as young and newly wedded as ourselves rose at five in the morning and worked at our employment until late in the evening we ate frugally drank a little wine and water loved temperately and slept profoundly on sundays and festivals we went to mass together and spent our leisure in excursions in the fields and pleasant groves with which lucca is engirdled we never ventured outside the territory of the republic but felt secure within it trusting to our honest intentions our simplicity and complete insignificance ah blessed content blessed thrice blessed obscurity would to god that you had been assured to us for ever on rare occasions one or other of us had sight of the cavaliere aquamorta who maintained the same magnificence at the albergo del sole and was reputed to be making large sums with his faro bank a new scheme of his for a state lottery upon a scale never before conceived by this thrifty little state was said to be under the consideration of the senators working in my master's yard i used to see him now and again being carried in his chair to this great house or that half a dozen link boys before him and his valet behind carrying his sword and gloves virginia often met him in the course of her errands but as she said was never recognised by him we nattered ourselves that he had forgotten our co existence with him upon this planet hope never stooped to falser cozenage we were to be rudely undeceived chapter xxxiii treachery works against us one evening i believe as i said that it was after nearly six months' calm and temperate life that our troubles began upon returning from my day's work i found virginia in a pensive mood she accepted but hardly returned my salute was very silent throughout the preparation and eating of our supper now and then glancing at her i caught her gaze fixed upon me and fancied that there was a hard light in her eyes our companions gioiachino and his wife teresa rallied us on what they thought to be one of those domestic differences common to the most affectionate couples a tiff a tiff said they nudging each other virginia has caught him with the gardener's wife we shall get no sleep to night this gardener's wife was an obese and asthmatic matron of some two score years who occupied a room in our little house and was kinder to me than i cared for it was not until gioiachino and his teresa were asleep that i could hope to discover what had affected virginia she then told me that as she had been at work that afternoon kneeling on the boards by the river with the other women the cavaliere aquamorta with a party of gentlemen had come by the meadows and stopped to jest and bandy familiarities with the laundresses although he had pretended not to recognise her virginia was not deceived finding his opportunity he drew near to her side and whispered in her ear can i believe my senses you my charming consort of a few weeks ago in such a plight in such a company virginia had replied that the company had been of her own choosing up to this hour and that what he complained of now could be remedied very easily and by himself only he said no my honour will not allow it i must needs remember what i might have made you and what you have become count upon aquamorta who has never yet failed his friends count upon his memory and passionate aspirations i told him said virginia that i should do nothing of the kind i said that i was wife to a gentleman born who also happened to be an honest man 'if' i said finally 'you wish to do virginia a real service you will be pleased to forget that you ever saw her' he laughed and said that that was impossible to a man of his tumultuous passions and went away with a profound salutation this said my poor virginia has troubled me more than i care to own i think we should be wise to leave lucca until evil wind that he is he blows over though i comforted her pretty well and bade her think no more about the man i very soon had reason to be of her opinion two or three days later as i was sawing planks in the yard to make a trellis that saturnine person came in resplendently dressed and filled the wholesome place with the reek of his essences he saluted me with extravagant politeness telling me that he had words for my private ear which he was sure would interest me when i took little or no notice of him he came to closer quarters hearken signor manifold says he my news concerns donna aurelia how he knew that sacred name i cannot conceive it had never passed from my lips into his wicked ears but i was unprepared for it and started violently the moment i heard it ha cried he now i have passed your guard don francis have i now perhaps you will do me the honour of conversing i blush to record that i led him within the workshop and begged him to be quick with his news there is no need for any reader of mine to tell me my duty i ought not to have allowed her name to rest upon his mouth i ought not to have allowed it to touch mine i ought not to have remembered aurelia i ought not to have adored her was i not wedded was i not beloved o god of heaven and earth if regrets did not avail me then how can they avail me now but i will no more look back than i will anticipate in this narrative i will repeat with what face i can that i led this hardy ruffian into the workshop cleared a bench for him to sit upon and bade him tell his story then said he my news would at any other time than this give you great pain don francis for it is not altogether to the credit of one to whom you have paid the most tender of your vows but seeking as i have always done your honour and advantage i feel that i shall really increase both of them by what i have to say for if i remind you that you are a fortunate husband it ought to enhance your consciousness of that fact when i go on to tell you that donna aurelia was unworthy of your attentions since she took no pains to deserve them i said here that i knew beforehand his malice and the reasons for it i said you have proved yourself already so unworthy of belief that i tell you now i shall not credit one word you say how dare you speak of the unworthiness of any lady being yourself the most worthless of men he smiled and continued what will you do but thank god my dear don francis when i tell you that it was she herself who put fra palamone in your way what will you say when you know that you were not intended to kill the capuchin so that you might be chased out of florence as you have supposed but instead it was hoped that he would carry off miss virginia to her marchese what will you now say to donna aurelia's share in that plot when i tell you that she he paused here grinning his triumph i will tell you what i have to say i answered him standing up with folded arms i say that you lie you have never done anything but lie and cheat since the moment i saw you you live by cheating and will die lying that is what i have to say i salute you and beg you to be gone the fair and cruel kind aurelia he began unconcernedly but i struck the bench on which he sat cavaliere i said if you speak one word more of that lady i shall kill you here in this place i had an adze in my hand and i suppose he believed me for he shrugged his shoulders got up and walked out of the carpenter's shop he had accomplished one part of his infamous design at least with every symptom of the most exquisite torture of mind i recalled throughout that day and night the lovely fleeting unattainable image of aurelia gualandi she was fatally present every bend and turn of her head every motion of her bosom the weaving of her hands every flutter of her breath every sigh every flash of her eyes danced before me mocking deluding beckoning beguiling enchanting me my poor virginia had reason to complain of my dejection coldness inattention god knows but he knows too and will reward her for it that the brave girl never once did complain my torment endured atrociously all night and all the next day then subsided somewhat and by the sunday following was almost gone on the monday moreover i had something else to think of this namely on monday evening just as i was about to leave the yard virginia with a hood over her head came into it this was extraordinary and so did she appear vividly coloured with the eyes of one in a fever but not alarmed elated rather and full of strong resolve before i could speak she put her finger to her lip and said hush come with me to the ramparts instead of going home i have something to tell you i followed her at once the ramparts were very empty as it was nearly dark she took my arm and began to walk slowly under the trees speaking calmly mastering the excitement which she evidently suffered she said at noon to day after the dinner hour the padrona gave me three baskets of linen and told me to carry them to their owners with the bills which were pinned upon them i put all three on my head and went away the first errand was to the apartment of that old colonel of artillery where i have often been before i delivered the basket unpacked it in his presence received the money and my buona mano and departed the second took me to don filiberto the parroco of santa lucia as usual he inquired after you asked me that certain question which you know gave me two whites patted my cheek and hoped for better news next week when i came to look at my third basket judge my dismay to find that it was addressed to the cavaliere aquamorta at the albergo del sole it was the largest by far and that was why i had put it at the bottom and had a substantial bill upon it including the arrears of three weeks i suppose he had planned it with the padrona for i had never been to him before and did not even know that we washed for him however there was no help for it i must go he received me with a grin expressing surprise which i knew he had not and pleasure which i fear he had i was as unconcerned as i knew how to be and began unpacking the linen but he came behind me at once and kneeling beside me on one knee began to be unpleasantly attentive praising my beauty extravagantly talking joking whispering and worse doing all he could in fact to make me as bad as he was he owned that he had laid this 'little stratagem of love' as he called it and that the bill far from being in arrear had been paid and twice paid there then was the price of my betrayal then he spoke of you francis asking whether i had discovered the cause of your recent distemperature 'i have given him some news of his aurelia of late' he said 'which may have inclined him to neglect a far more charming nymph' i replied to that that if he had put himself to the trouble of telling you lies of donna aurelia there was no wonder that you were unhappy for says i 'to have her name which you held sacred tripped off lips which you knew to be profane was a horrible thing' he laughed at me and called me his incorrigible charmer his dearest tease delight and provocation he grew very attentive and would have embraced me whereupon biding my time i gave him such a slap in the left eye as he won't soon recover from then while he was cursing me and calling for his servant i made my escape i praised her warmly as she deserved she had done what became her with the only weapon she possessed the rest i said is mine i shall know how to maintain your honour and my own this very night i shall send a friend to the cavaliere and leave him the choice of weapons she stopped our walk and faced me with agitation dio mio my lord what are you saying i repeated my words and she became dry as she always did when she disapproved good my lord she said and may your handmaid know the name of the friend whom you propose to send with your cartel to the cavaliere aquamorta i said that i should ask gioiachino our fellow lodger to oblige me excellent said virginia with irony excellent indeed gioiachino a cat's meat man waits upon the cavaliere aquamorta on behalf of his friend francesco a journeyman carpenter this made me more angry than i had any business to be for she was perfectly right from the cavaliere's view of the thing i said virginia my condition in this world has never been hidden from you apart from my birthright which is an advantage not of my own making i hope i have never been to you other than an honourable man gioiachino who has been a good friend to you and me certainly deserves no less credit if a gentleman as i claim to be is condescending enough to send a person perfectly honest to a vulgar libidinous lying bully and cheat who happens to have robbed to better purpose than i have worked then i say you should agree with me that i am paying more honour to a thief than he can hope to deserve i am sorry to have to speak so plainly to you but it is not for you any more than for me to reproach gioiachino with being an honest man she was silent for a few minutes then knelt down and kissed my hand when i raised her up and embraced her i found tears on her cheeks we walked home in the dark without another word said and i prevailed upon gioiachino to convey my challenge though he did what he could to dissuade me this he said is madness do you not know that the less your man is assured of his gentility the more exacting he will be in the profession of it do you know what will occur he will call for some lacquey or another to kick me downstairs my answer to that was that such conduct to the bearer of a gentleman's cartel was unheard of i added that if the cavaliere prided himself against all evidence upon being a gentleman he was not at all likely to convict himself of being a ruffian very ruefully in the end the good natured gioiachino went out to oblige me it happens that i was right or had good grounds for thinking so the cavaliere received the poor fellow with perfect affability and after a short colloquy with some of his companions introduced a certain prince gandolfo dolfini with whom gioiachino was to arrange a meeting in the fields for seven o'clock on the wednesday morning the cavaliere having the choice of weapons his friend the prince decided for whips if this was to make me feel ridiculous it failed i was much too angry whips he shall have said i and went to bed on the morning appointed i rose at my usual hour and went to the workshop intending to go on with my duties until the time appointed i left virginia in tears and teresa no less wretched clinging to her in her bed at a quarter before seven gioiachino with me armed with a stout cart whip i left the porta del vescovo and walked briskly over one or two water meadows towards a retired grove of trees not far from the pisa road i flattered myself that we were first in the field but there i was mistaken i found a numerous company assembled tall persons in cocked hats coats and badges a posse of police and the villainous cavaliere smirking in the midst so soon as we entered the grove he pointed to me with his cane and said in a loud voice there signor sindaco there is the fugitive assassin the betrayer of an innocent girl speed him back to tuscany with the added wages he has richly earned in lucca the police advanced seized me bound my wrists an old gentleman without teeth read a long legal instrument without stops at the end of which i was stripped to the shirt horsed upon gioiachino's back and vigorously whipped i was then haled by my harsh executioners some league or more over the marshes to the confines of the republic of lucca and told to take myself out of sight unless i wished for more taste of the whip without prayers without words without a coat without money rich in nothing but innocence and despair i reached the hillside and flung myself face downwards upon the sward there i lay far into the night chapter xxxiv i fall in with the players my present situation was of that shocking description which defies thought and paralyses the will i was utterly alone deprived of the means of joining the only person in italy who loved me utterly destitute of means placed in a country from which i had been banished as a criminal i shall be understood then when i say that for a week or more i wandered over the face of the land not regarding whither i went so only that i avoided my kind nor what became of me how i subsisted i am at a loss to tell i have no clear recollections nothing but a confused sense of abiding despair hunger haste and desolation i know not through what regions i passed the names of what villages i avoided the names of what farm houses i pillaged of eggs and milk in order that i might keep a soul in my body it is true that i became a common thief it is very true that during this most dreadful period i spoke not to one living person for whenever i saw man woman or child i crouched in whatsoever shelter i could find and lay there trembling like a beast of chase until the enemy as i deemed him had passed and i could venture out again to seek for food providentially for me my banishment from lucca had taken place in the summer i suffered nothing from exposure and had no real lack of sustenance i used to rummage the streets of villages at night to get broken meat as i have said i did not scruple to rob henroosts or to suck the teats of cows and goats in the byres during this time i neither prayed to god nor thought of virginia in her horrid peril all my efforts of mind and sense were directed to hiding and finding food i was very near losing my wits gradually however i recovered my self possession and with that one by one my proper faculties returned i was surprised at myself when one day seeing a man hoeing in a field i felt the desire to speak to him and ask my whereabouts i was in a dreadful fright when it came to the point that i had gone too far towards him to recede but i mastered myself by an effort and brought myself to accost him without any surprise at my appearance which was indeed no worse than his own he told me that i was in the vale of chianti between certaldo and poggibonsi and that if i persevered upon the road i saw before me i should reach the latter place by nightfall but brother said he you look to have seen better days and i advise you to push on to siena may be you'll find employment there for that is a rich city here i tell you there is nothing it is little use my offering you a crust for i have not got one i thanked him and having broken cover stoutly took the road and limped along as best i could perhaps i had gone a league and a half when i came to a village full of people half a dozen miserable houses placed streetwise one of them a disreputable inn formed a background to a motley assembly of tattered vagrants of which peasants of the countryside of both sexes children pigs and turkeys formed a small part the others were men and women of the most extravagant attire and behaviour it is possible to imagine i saw a punchinello on stilts wading among the rest there were women flaunting feathers on their tousled heads and moustachioed bullies who might have come from the ruck of some army on the march pages minions magicians astrologers women's ruffians castrati it was as if one of the wildest hours of the piazzetta of venice had been transported by witchcraft to this quiet place as i approached wondering at what i saw a creature i knew not then whether man or woman came and stood in my path and with a great gesture of the arm greeted me in this remarkable apostrophe hail all hail bombaces king of the halicarnassians he or she repeated this shrilly three or four times but nobody took any notice this hermaphrodite had a face of the most vivid and regular beauty i ever saw a face of perfect oval freshly and rarely coloured a pair of dark and lustrous eyes a straight fine nose and a mouth exquisitely shaped provokingly red its hair which was dark brown fell in a tide of wealth far over its shoulders it wore a woman's bodice cut square in the neck after the fashion of unmarried women in venice and short in the sleeves but at the waist that sex stopped and the male began for it had on a pair of man's breeches worsted stockings and venice slippers and its shape as revealed by these garments was not that of a woman the creature as a fact declared itself to be a male and when he began to declaim against me again i addressed him for what he was my good young man i said i am too weary too desperate and too hungry to be entertained by your antics and too poor to reward you for them being as you see me an exile and a stranger if you can find me something to eat i shall be grateful if you cannot go in peace and leave me to do the same the droll beauty changed his tone in an instant follow me sir said he and you shall have everything you want i entreat your pardon for inflicting my impertinences upon you at such an ill judged moment he took me by the hand and addressed himself to the crowd about the inn doors by pushing punching jostling cursing praying and coaxing in turns he made a way into the house but that was full to suffocation of the actors and their belongings and of the peasantry who had come to gape at them everybody was engaged in getting drunk who was not drunk already some were fighting some lovemaking some filching i saw a curious sight a man dressed like a harlequin was picking a countryman's pocket and having his own picked while he was in the act by some sharp featured imp of a castrato in fine the whole house from floor to rafters was full the bedchambers to call them so which had no beds in them were worse than the kitchen i could not see that i had gained anything by following my questionable guide but he who had more resources than i knew of having snatched a half loaf and bottle of wine from the lower quarters trampled and fought his way upstairs with them showed me a ladder which gave on to the roof and went up it like a bird without using his hands i followed him and saw a proud light in his eyes as he invited me to survey my private room we were in the valley formed by the two pitches of the roof nothing between our heads and the evening sky the revellings and blasphemies of the house were not to be heard pigeons clustered on the chimney pots or strutted the ridges of the house a cat huddled up watched them from a corner stars showed faintly here and there we were sheltered from the wind i heard far off the angelus bell ringing here at any rate you won't be disturbed said my protector eat sir drink and repose yourself when you feel inclined you shall tell me how i can serve you further the evening bell and this kindness of the lad's had reminded me of what i was i said my friend i shall first thank god for having made your nation the boldest the most ingenious the gentlest the most modest most open hearted in the world you see before you a man of all men most unfortunate but yet i say to you in the presence of god and of his household whose lights are kindling even now that but for the like of you many and many a time i should have died unannealed he was confused and boylike tried to laugh off my praises you give me too high a character sir said he i am a graceless devil of the veneto without prospect or retrospect to be proud of a poor creature who has to go to market with what wares he has if i can look forward it is because i dare not look back what i am doing for you now for which you are so kind as to praise me is not virtue i wish to heaven virtue were so easy got eat however drink and rest if i am no better than i should be i suppose i am not worse than i could be and i cannot allow you to praise me for that you are of the race of the samaritans said i whether you hail from venice or tuscany i am an englishman my name is francis how are you called he said i believe my name is daniele but they call me here in the company belviso and they do well i returned for that you certainly are and as far as i am concerned you prove as good as you are good looking he shrugged his shoulders no one is better than he can help i fancy sir he said there is every inducement to be wicked in this world but i will say this of myself and i dare say everybody else can say the same that when i am good i am as good as gold for i realise perfectly well my unusual estate and become a very usurer of virtue but this is of rare occurrence seeing that i am an actor by ordinary for the fifteen years that i have been in the world i am remarkably vicious i cannot hear you say that belviso i told him without giving you warning that so long as i am in your company and to the utmost of my powers i shall restrain you from being anything of the sort he started looked at me for a moment then kissed my hand i believe our saviour sent you here to be his vicar in my regard he said i don't know how long you may be in my company for it depends mostly upon yourself but i promise you in my turn that i shall never take ill whatsoever your honour may please to say to me and i say that if i have the misfortune to lose sight of you this very night i shall be the better for having known you and shall go to sleep with more prospect of a decent to morrow than i have ever done in the whole of my life i judged that the best thing for this youth was to think more about my misfortunes than his own i therefore told him how it was that i came before him in this plight barefoot bareheaded bleeding and in rags i told him of my concern for virginia of the deadly perils that beset her and concluded by assuring him that the one service of any moment which he could do me was to devise me some means of communicating with gioiachino the vendor of cat's meat in lucca belviso had put his head between his knees and so remained for some time after i had done speaking in earnest meditation after a while he lifted up his face and said i shall go to lucca for you don francis it is certain that you must not cross the frontier and equally certain that there is no other person here who could strive more heartily to help you but i dare not myself go alone i shall get il nanno to go with me a very good old fellow and as shrewd as a winter wind we shall disguise ourselves of course and be off before dawn to morrow he shall go as my wife your wife my dear i exclaimed i should like to know what old fellow could play the woman beside you seeing that i get my living by so doing i don't mind owning that there is no one he agreed the trouble is that i should do it too well when you see il nanno you will admit that my proposals are as prudent as they seem the reverse i'll go and fetch him and you shall judge remember always that his name is aristarcho it would be a mortal affront to use that nickname of ours for he is sensitive to a degree like all these hunchbacks and as fierce as a wild cat stay here i will bring him up to you he disappeared into the house and presently returned followed by his proposed wife signor aristarcho was a dwarf of the most repulsive and uncompromising type he cannot have been much more than four feet in height he had a head nearly as large as his body the strong jawed big nosed slit mouthed head of some condottiere of old some fortebraccio or colleone of history and equestrian statuary his eyes were small staring but extremely intelligent his flesh spare and strained under the skin he was beardless and as warty as a toad's back he never smiled spoke little and seemed to be afraid lest the air should get within him and never get out again for he only opened the corner of his mouth to emit a word or two and screwed it down immediately he had done his poor deformed body was like that of punchinello a part for which he was famous in the theatres protuberant before hunched up between his shoulders behind and set upon little writhen fleshless legs like wooden spigots in manner he was excessively punctilious grave collected oracularly sententious i know that he was exquisitely sensitive to ridicule and remorseless in punishing it it was not hard to understand the moment i set eyes upon this poor monster that with the young and beautiful belviso masquerading as a woman by his side trouble must succeed trouble without end on the other hand i could not for the life of me see how the parts were to be reversed with any reasonable assurance but the good youth himself had no misgivings after an exchange of careful courtesies i addressed myself to the dwarf signor aristarcho i said this charitable young man has assured me of your active sympathy with my anxieties you see before you a victim of fortune's extremest spite who can sue for your favours with nothing but his tears don't shed them says he at the side of his mouth they are precious and offer you nothing in return but his thanks but i am speaking to a gentleman you are not he said gruffly you are speaking to a man of honour i pursued and sensibility in a word i am speaking to a christian if then you a christian can save the soul of my young and newly wedded wife ah jesu my darling from the lions he put up his hand no more he said i will do what i can i said sir my boundless gratitude no more he stayed me i am paid already alas sir i felt that i must go on but he would not have it you have called me a christian he said no one has ever called me that before i thank you i would die for you live for me i cried sir sir sir i do find that the lower my bodily fortunes descend the nearer i get to the kingdom of heaven aristarcho bowed gravely and said i thank you count upon me he bowed again profoundly and i returned the salute when he had retired i told belviso that i saw nothing in his state to deserve our pity but that on the contrary i envied him the possession of a constant and discerning mind my friend replied yes yes he is a good fellow and will serve you well you have earned his gratitude but let me warn you again never to hurt his feelings you will be sorry for it for many a day when we went down long after dark to the inn kitchen i found the actors seated at supper and was kindly received belviso presented me to the principals to a pleasant plump old gentleman who looked like the canon of a cathedral foundation and was in fact the famous arlecchino 'gritti to the prima donna a black browed lady who because she came from sicily was called la panormita her own name being brigida and her husband's minghelli to the cheerfulest drunkard i ever met who played the lovers' parts and was that same minghelli to the sustainers of pantaleone scaramuccia matamorte don basilio brighella and the rest of them a crew all told of some twenty hands all males with the exception of la panormita the reason of that was that the company was very poor and that fine women did not get sufficiently lucrative side issues as i may term them to be tempted to join it and again there were several restrictions placed by some states such as those of the church upon female performers only to be overcome by heavy fees to the officials if it was inconvenient to them to drop signora minghelli in one place and pick her up at another to have had more women in the same case might well have ruined them they therefore had with them half a dozen boys and lads of whom belviso was by far their best pamfilo narcisso adone deifobo and the like wicked graceless little wretches as they were belviso took the leading woman's part in la panormita's absence and when she was present he came second notably he was columbine in the comedy and as they said one of the most excellent i found all these people as i have never failed to find italians of their sort simple good hearted and careless sometimes happy sometimes acutely miserable but always patient and reasonable and always expressing themselves unaffectedly in very strong language of their kindness i cannot say too much of their moral behaviour i must not their profession no doubt which forced them to exhibit themselves in indelicate or monstrous situations for the pleasure of people who were mainly both had made them callous to much which is offensive to a man of breeding il nanno was a great exception to their rule i never knew him but once behave otherwise than as a gentleman i never heard him hold unseemly conversation belviso too was as far as i was concerned honest decent and self respecting i am inclined to hope and have some grounds for believing that he had given himself a worse character than he deserved all i shall say about him here is that had he been my son i could not have been troubled by anything which he said or did so long as i was in his company sufficient of my story had been made common property by il nanno to save me the trouble of trying to enlist their sympathies they were mine from the moment of my appearance in their midst they were entirely willing to let my two champions go to lucca on my account and i was glad to hear that the company would not stand to lose much by so generous an act they were on their way to siena and except for an open air performance or two in mean villages would not need either belviso or the dwarf until they reached that city where the pair would rejoin them they offered me their protection and hospitality in the frankest manner in such terms indeed that i could not but have accepted them had my necessities been lighter than they were i took them thankfully and asked leave further to propose that as i had a good memory and a person not otherwise unsuitable i might place myself and my abilities at their whole disposal use me gentlemen said i if i suit you make me of service elsewhere than on your scene if i do not by so doing you will lighten my load of debt and make me feel less of a stranger and a burden i have won two friends already by the recital of my sorrows here i placed a hand on belviso's shoulder and gave the other to il nanno let me hope that i can gain yet more by some exhibition of my talents this was loudly applauded stand up don francis said belviso to me and spout us out whatever bombast you can remember i gave them first the opening speech of the orfeo of politian where the sad shepherd accounts his plight his pursuit of the nymph euridice her abhorrence of him and the like all eyes were fixed upon me i saw those of la panormita glisten the smooth flowing verses moved her they were silent when i had done which a little disconcerted me but presently the dwarf snapped out more emboldened i began upon the aminta of tasso reciting the opening speech of daphne in the fourth act to my delight the part of silvia which virginia in our old days at pistoja had been wont to take was caught up and continued by belviso we fired each other capped each other and ended the great scene the last six lines of it to be spoken by the choragus were croaked by il nanno in his bull frog's voice we stopped amid a storm of bravas and la panormita with a great gesture crowned us with flowers i was made free of the company by acclamation belviso set off early in the morning with his monstrous old wife of the occasion he embraced me warmly before he left me keep a good heart don francis he said and trust in your friends all that is possible shall be done you may be sure i shan't dare to look you in the face if i come back without your virginia chapter xxxv tempted in siena belviso saves me the company of which i was now enrolled a member moved on towards siena that city for which as aurelia's cradle i had a feeling of profound reverence towards which now in spite of all that had occurred i could not approach without a quickening of the pulse an aching heart and a longing mind we travelled with a large caravan of donkeys and mules to carry the baggage and women la panormita her gross old mother and two hags who called themselves the mothers and were really the owners of the boys the rest of us the men and the boys themselves trudged afoot we begged jigged or bullied for food as we went having scarcely any money among us for just now after a disastrous week in florence the company was by way of starving until it could earn some pence halfpence in siena the first night we slept in a rick yard a bitter wet night it was the next we reached certaldo and cajoled the landlord of the ghirlanda out of house room this he only consented to upon the condition of our giving free entertainment then and there to his customers we had been all day on the road but what choice is open to the needy traveller footsore muddy to the eyes hungry thirsty as we were our clothes of the stage sodden with rain our finery like wet weeds our face powder like mud and our paints like soup we must perforce open our packs don our chill motley daub our weary faces and caper through some piece of tomfoolery which if it had not been so insipid would have been grotesquely indecent all i remember about it now is that it was called la nuova lucrezia ossia la gatteria del spropositi a monstrous travesty of the story of lucrece one of the castrati pamfilo by name played the part of lisetta una putta di undici anni and exhibited the most remarkable turn of satirical observation and humour i have ever seen before or since horrible in a manner as it was it would have redeemed any performance this demon of ingenuity and wit was little more than fourteen years old and sang like an angel of paradise another of them was the lucrezia the roman matron put into the short skirts spangles and mischievous peering glances of colombina belviso would have sustained it had he been present adone his understudy took his place my own share in the mummery was humble and confusing in toga and cothurnus i had to read a pompous prologue and did it amid shouts of basta basta from the audience i don't believe that i was more thankful than they were when i had done the less i say about the rest of the evening and night the better the people of certaldo more than maintain the popular reputation of their great townsman boccaccio they are as light hearted as impertinent as amorous as he and they diverted themselves with our company in a manner which did credit to his example such things i hope i may say were very little to my taste but it was necessary for me not to seem singular and i fancy that i did not after a similar night's entertainment at poggibonsi we set out intending to be at siena that same night i need hardly say that the so near prospect filled me with various and contending emotions i might hope in the first place to find belviso there returned with virginia my faithful and tender wife to know her safe to have her by my side to be conscious as i could not fail to be of her deep and ardent love for me testified in every glance of her eyes such could not fail to be a satisfaction to any honest any sensible man such too i hope they were but i must needs confess that not this confident expectation for confident i was of belviso's success alone moved me and elated me at the moment no it is the truth that the nearer i came to siena the more i realised the abiding influence of aurelia upon my heart and conscience i could not but tremble at the thought that in so few hours i should be treading the actual earth which her feet had lightly pressed during the years when she must have been at her happiest and if not also at her loveliest since when was she not at that assuredly at her purest and most radiant hour before she had been sullied by the doctor's possessory rights before she had been hurt by my dastardly advances this then this it was which really affected me to feel like some pilgrim of old to loreto may be or compostella to walsingham to rome nay to the very bourne and goal of every christian's desire jerusalem the holy city itself to feel i say singularly uplifted singularly set apart and dedicated to the privilege which was now at last to be mine from the moment of departure from poggibonsi to that moment when i saw upon a background of pure green sky the spear like shafts the rose coloured walls and churches of siena i kept my eyes steadily towards my mecca speaking very little taking no heed of the manner of our progress i had other sights than those to occupy me i saw hedge flowers which aurelia might have plucked shade where she might have rested orchards where she might have tasted fruit wells which might have cooled her feet some miles before i was in actual sight of my desired haven i was in a thrill and tension of expectancy wrought upon me by these hopeful auguries which i cannot describe i was in a perpetual tremble my lips were dry we passed castiglioncello we rested for noonday at monteriggione at castello del diavolo in full sight of all men i kissed the stony road in my own country i know very well i should have been hooted as a madman but here where a man does what nature or something higher prompts him without shame or circumspection i was never molested my companions were undoubtedly curious pamfilo said that i was going to meet my amica at siena la panormita supposed that i regretted some bouncing girl of certaldo but i was soaring now to such a height that i cared nothing we entered the porta camollia at half past five o'clock in the evening and trailed up the steep via di citta between houses like solemn cliffs and in the midst of a throng which in the dusk of that narrow pass seemed like dense clouds lit up by innumerable moons to our lodging at an inn called le tre donzelle these moons i found out were the wide straw hats of the lovely daughters of siena sisters of aurelia companions of her maiden hours it made my heart jump into my throat to see in the doorway of the inn a girl of her own tender and buoyant shape to hear her very tones with that caressing fall which never failed to move me and to see the quick turn of a crowned head exactly in her own manner before many hours were over i found myself stabbed more or less vividly by every young woman i met there was no escaping from aurelia in aurelia's own city indifferent alike to the orgies of my companions or to their reproaches of me for not sharing them i spent a solitary wakeful night in great exaltation of mind with the first ray of dawn i was out and about gaining in entire loneliness my first view of the sacred city i stood awestruck and breathless under the star strewn roof of the great church i knelt where aurelia's knees must have kissed the storied pavement i walked in the vast campo which has been called and justly called the finest piazza in europe wondered over the towered palace of the ancient commune prayed at the altar of st catherine prepared then by prayer and meditation i made solemn and punctilious visits to what i must call the holy places of aurelia's nation the madonna del bordone the madonna delle grazie and the madonna called of provenzano before each of these ladies mournful helpful heaven conversing deities i prayed devoutly on my knees i anointed the feet of each with my tears i offered up to each the incense of a sigh from my overcharged heart from the last and most gracious of the three ladies i received what seems to have been a remarkable counsel i fell into conversation with the sacristan of her church santa maria di provenzano is its name who told me the tale of this wonder working image a mutilated bust of the holy virgin veiled and crowned he said that his madonna was kind to all the unfortunate world and famous all over it but that to the most unfortunate of all she was mother and friend and whom do you call the most unfortunate of all i asked him he looked at me as he uttered these curious words the most unfortunate of all sir he said are they that have to pretend to love when they do not feel it and theirs is the class of which our madonna is the patroness padrona degli sventurati helper and friend of those who must serve love without loving what a goddess was this i drew apart from my informant and communed alone with the mysterious emblem o most tender advocate of them that need thee said i o loving mother of sinners clean champion of the unclean stem leaf blossom and fruit of the abounding promise of heaven that a seed of hope may fructify in our ineffable corruption cast down thy compassionate eyes upon me too that in their light i may strive again this was my prayer a general one for grace rather than a particular for some specific grace now for what i consider to have been a direct answer to it on the steps of the church on going out i saw belviso waiting for me i saw that he was alone and that at once brought before my mind the picture of virginia the brave and passionate dark browed girl my stormy lover and my wife whom i alas was hired by gratitude and the sacrament to love though love her as i ought i did not i stood speechless and thunderstruck here now sinner is the answer to thy prayer art not thou poor francis one of love's hirelings dost not thou need the padrona degli sventurati i asked myself these questions belviso would answer them for me he told me how he had sped he had been to lucca and seen teresa gioiachino's wife gioiachino poor fellow was in prison but not for long it was thought virginia was gone but aquamorta remained in the city my poor girl had left a note for me with teresa which teresa handed on to belviso and he to me to this effect i read it with tears master lord and excellent husband it began padrone signor ed egregio marito mio thy child is unhappy but having learned from thee how necessary it is to regard her own honour is resolved to fly danger rather than brave it i have gone to arezzo with all thy money safe in my bosom to put the breadth of tuscany between me and my persecutor make thy affairs as thou wilt thou art free of virginia who will never blame thee if thou need her or what she hath of thine thou wilt find her at arezzo an honest woman who kisses thy hands virginia without a word of explanation i returned to the church and held up my letter before the veiled image of the madonna of provenzano here lady is my duty i said here is my hire the lowliest of thy clients i will never shirk the yoke put upon me yet do thou patroness make it sweet i kissed the letter and put it in my bosom then i went back to belviso embraced him thanked him for his extraordinary pains on my behalf and said that as soon as possible after the forthcoming performances of the company i should go to arezzo he sighed and looked unhappy i knew that you would leave us he said it was only to be expected yes yes belviso said i i must indeed rejoin virginia i see very well that she is my only means of redemption and what is to become of me don francis says he suddenly catching hold of my hand and staying me in the street what is to become of me without you who are in turn my only means of redemption i said my poor youth you are putting upon me more than i can bear or rather you are putting a fresh weight upon virginia if by her i can be redeemed and by me only you can be redeemed then that untried girl is charged with the redemption of both of us a singular tax for one whose redemption was originally my own care he agreed with me that the position was unusual but affirmed with energy that he had truly stated it so far as he was concerned i owe you sir he said the dearest thing a lad can possess which is his self respect restored his courage reborn in the light of your approbation i can face even my miserable trade and hope to grow up as i should if you cast me off i am undone after which as i made no immediate reply with a pretty gesture as of a girl wheedling for a favour he touched my cheek with his hand and begged me to take him with me to arezzo i told him i would consider of it but made no promise chapter xxxvi my unrehearsed effect and its midnight sequel i do not know whether any other man in the world has been so unfortunate as i in making resolutions and finding opportunities to break them but i am persuaded none can have made more abundant use of his occasions my only consolation is that my performances have been exemplary since punishment has ever followed hot foot upon the offence let it be observed that on the eve of my public appearance upon the scene in siena with the rest of the company i was resolved and had fortified myself with a solemn vow to the madonna of provenzano to return to virginia's side and act if i did not feel the part of her faithful and assiduous husband never mind whether i believed this to be due to aurelia and that it was the strongest testimony i could give her of my love this did not in my opinion make me disloyal to my wife because the very act of pleasing her involved the putting out of mind that dear mistress of my heart my resolution was indeed my final offering at the shrine of mystical love it was to be an act comparable with dante's who loving beatrice married germma donati and proved the reality of his tie by making her the mother of many children it will readily be believed i suppose that so fine a proposition made me enthusiastic that i was impatient for the moment when i could put it into practice recover virginia press her to my bosom and cherish her as so beautiful and loving a girl deserved to be cherished but it must be almost incredible to every reader of my book that in one moment i could not only quench my own fire but make it impossible to light it again this however is the plain state of the case in honour of the grand duke's birthday a great many festivities were preparing in siena the city was full of visitors for a palio was to be run in the campo the cardinal archbishop of florence was to celebrate pontifically in the cathedral and our company of actors not because it was the best but as being the only one available was commanded to perform in the theatre before the podesta the gonfalonier and senate and all the representatives of government of the university and of the garrison the whole of the boxes was bespoken and our manager was given to understand that his expenses for this night were guaranteed as we had so far had very indifferent houses it may be gathered that he looked upon this as the occasion of his lifetime we were put into vigorous rehearsal and worked most of the day besides playing at night we were to give the artaserse a tragedy of extreme length and magniloquence and conclude with the donne furlane the night arrived the theatre was full from parterre to gallery the boxes presented a truly brilliant spectacle the curtain went up and the play began i shall only say of artaserse that la panormita was the aspasia of the piece and belviso the berenice her foster sister and companion my role was that of the messenger and only gave me one long speech recounting the miraculous preservation of artaspe and spiridate sons of king artaserse and lovers of the two ladies the treachery discovery and violent end of dario in fact the untying of the knot firmly twisted in the third act the audience paid visits talked laughed played faro so far as i could learn throughout the play nor do i wonder at it for not the finest acting in the world could have galvanised into life any one link of its dreary chain when the curtain was raised however upon the second piece there was a perceptible settling down to listen behold and be amused tragedy was the fashion and must be endured but all the italians loved the masks the donne furlane was the piece a comedy of art as they call it here or as we say a comedy of masks wherein the stock characters of harlequin columbine brighella and pantalone are given a rag of a plot and are expected to embroider that with follies drolleries and obscenities according as their humour of the moment may dictate the persons who give the title to this particular farce the donne furlane are the lowest class of venetian women and their ceremonious name implies what we in england imply when we speak of the nymphs of drury lane or the sirens of radcliffe highway calling them in fact exactly what they are not according to the plot of the play pantalone is an old merchant of rimini who arrives in venice with his family colombina is his daughter and was played of course by belviso arlecchino and brighella are his simpleton sons they were the manager and myself il nanno was punchinello his neapolitan servant il dottore his travelling physician they come ashore in the quarter of the furlani and all the zest of the play lies in the equivoque which contrasts the knavery of the inhabitants with the naivete of the visitors pantalone's family is fair game a bully called truffaldino poses as a marchese and wins the affections of colombina brighella is entrapped by a donna furlana into a promise of marriage the dottore finds himself engaged to cure half a dozen of the same sort of ladies of the maladies incident to their career finally pantalone is claimed as their long lost uncle who was supposed to have abandoned them in their days of infant orphanage such promise of diversion as this imbroglio had it was rendered still more to the taste of the audience by the license which the actors allowed themselves belviso was perfection as the simple country girl one could hardly credit a lad of his age with such niceness of observation such humorous yet whimsical representation of an honest foolish young woman flattered by the attention of a villain his la la his sissioria and 'lustrissimo si which marked so well the growth of self esteem his finger in the mouth his twisting apron corner which betrayed embarrassment when the siege was too vigorous his io non so gniente when sheepishness was the only defence here was the highest art of the stage i as brighella his brother aped him as well as i could i was a clown tickled by yet pondering the hardy advances of a baggage who in the expert person of pamfilo was only too well performed if it was my business to look a fool god knows i played better than any the audience stormed us with delight and i do believe i was having my share of the triumph and might have been emboldened by success to have deserved it had not all my sham tremors been shent in one moment by a shaft most real and memorable whose fatal delivery i must now relate we had reached a point in our absurdity where by the direction of il nanno who had a sure dramatic sense a little touch of tragic meaning was to be brought into the action the play was suddenly to deepen into seriousness the masqueraders were to be discovered momentarily for men and women with hearts to be broke and souls to be tortured i believe it was i who gave him the hint for he had said to me one day at rehearsal don francis you have tragedy in your face a mouth of pure sorrow that is a valuable asset for our business may be that he had thought to use me at my best when he suffered this little shiver of serious surmise to be blown across the painted scene the worthy little monster was pardonably proud of his conception and explained it to me point by point touchy as his infirmities had left him his vanity of author made him as tender as a green wound he set all his hopes upon his invention rightly rendered he said the whole theatre would be moved by it it should be received with a moment of absolute silence a sixty seconds' silence then with one consent the audience would rise en masse and cheer the actor myself and the poet himself admiring the thought feeling the force of it i promised him that he might depend upon me his point was this at a certain stage in the play brighella the country clown observes his pretended inamorata the sham contessa in the embrace of the pretended marchese truffaldino who by his lies and flatteries has ensnared the heart of colombina now colombina is the beloved sister of brighella and the doubt is to dawn upon him that possibly his wonderful contessa and his sister's imposing marchese are no better than they should be why is she in the arms of the marchese are these perhaps the customs of the world of fashion punchinello the family servant suggests that the marchese and contessa may be brother and sister o dio no cries poor brighella i know what brothers and sisters do i love colombina and she me but we don't kiss and hug in a corner that is what the contessa taught me to do i thought it very beautiful it was our secret do you see but she seems to have taught the marchese and it is a secret no more and not beautiful at all he begins to wonder to himself and grows suddenly homesick under disenchantment he has many artless touching things to say concerning his happiness with his sister in his own country there far away on the lonely adriatic shore i was doing my best with the part il nanno as punchinello was at my side watching and moving every turn of the dialogue in the back of the scene were truffaldino and the furlana at their kissing the audience quick to feel the pathos was very quiet and gave me courage go to your mistress brighella says punchinello reproach her pull her away no no say i that would not be honourable that would show that i doubted her that would be an insult to her ladyship and no comfort to me there was a murmur of applause low but audible and that stir which i know is more enheartening to the player than all the bravas in the world but just then as if directed by some inward motion my eyes wandered about the auditorium and as happens but rarely i saw faces there in a box on the grand tier i saw aurelia herself in a yellow silk gown and a hood of the same half fallen from her dark hair there she sat as if absorbing the light aurelia and no other in a gallant company she was smiling interested eager her lips were parted i saw her little teeth i saw the rise and fall of her white breast starting violently a sharp intense pain pierced my heart i shut my eyes and tried to recall myself while the theatre was hushed like death i felt myself swaying about and to save myself from falling stretched out my hand for some support unfortunately i found it for i caught and held the bony ridge of the nose of il nanno which was just on the level of my elbow and drove my fingers into it until he yelled with pain risu solvuntur the audience rose at us in wild delight but i in my horror and concern knew nothing but that here was i a poor fool in motley and there at some few paces from me radiant as a star in the firmament was the adorable being under whose maddening rays i had fallen as struck by the sun i gave one short cry and fell on my knees pardon pardon queen of my soul i began when il nanno beside himself with mortification sprang at me like a wild beast and gripped my throat had not the contessa and truffaldino pulled him off me i should have been strangled the audience hushed the curtain fell i knew no more until i found myself lying on my strand paillasse at the inn and saw belviso yet in his skirt and spangles leaning over me with vinegar in a sponge refusing me leave to talk he told me that he had done his best to pacify the dwarf and hoped he had succeeded the audience had been entirely misled they had believed this ending to have been devised for their entertainment and had completely approved of it our manager had been sent for by the syndic congratulated and rewarded by a handsome present the piece was to be repeated next evening and for the sake of that it was even promised that the public would sit through the artaserse again higher testimony said belviso could not have been given to aristarcho as author or to me as his exponent far from being in disgrace i was the hero of siena the piazza the cafes were alive with my performance my stage name of francesco de' pazzi was in everybody's mouth i murmured the name of aurelia but belviso had no notion of that part of my story and begged me to sleep so after a time i think i did and he also at some later hour of the night which must have been near the edge of dawn belviso woke me by springing off his bed and going to the door presently i heard voices downstairs stern short official voices and the hasty whispers of two or three answering at once what was this steps resounded on the stair a chink in the door revealed a light growing in brightness we were broken in upon where we crouched in alarm and i saw a corporal of the guard two or three troopers the scared faces of some of our companions the corporal held up his candle to look at me our colloquy was very brief you are francis strelley an englishman i am you killed a capuchin in florence and fled to lucca i did you were chastised and expelled the republic i was you are my prisoner in the grand duke's name get up dress yourself and follow me il nanno had betrayed me or some other more inveterate enemy i rose put on my shoes and a cloak and told the officer i was ready as i was tying my shoe belviso whispered in my ear courage i follow he bade me a mock farewell with tears and embraces and i went out a prisoner i understood that i was to be taken at once to the fortress of volterra now indeed this famous infamous prison was to have me and bury me alive chapter xxxvii i commit a double murder francis antony strelley tennis ball of fate should be inscribed upon my tomb unless like the wandering jew i were not destined to have any other than that restless globe upon whose shelving surfaces i was for ever to slip and slide here was i once more buffeted on to the road and yet i could not fairly pretend that there was no fault of mine concerned in the stroke o fatal dower of beauty that was thine aurelia could i say that had i maintained my firm resolve of a few days' date and fixed my heart and inclination where they were due towards the loving bosom and welcoming arms of my virginia this new shame had come upon me alas what malign influence drew thee lady to siena to rekindle my flame to melt my conjugal desires to betray me into the old passion to draw me into the old despair thus i bitterly questioned myself as guarded on either hand by mounted men i descended the silent street on the way to what i must needs consider perpetual imprisonment going out of the porta romana where we were obliged to wait in the cold drizzle of a cheerless dawn for the porter to open the gate a deeply veiled respectably dressed young woman asked the favour of our escort from the corporal and received it probably on account of her good looks which should be extraordinary she was going she said to join her husband at volterra and feared the brigands who were notoriously rife in that country the corporal offered to take her pillion behind him willingly sir she said and was lifted up by the troopers as we went out of the gate she raised her veil to use her handkerchief and to look at me in a moment i saw that it was my brave and affectionate belviso and was no little comforted by the thought that here at any rate was one heart in siena generously inclined to mine we baited at colle and rested there two or three hours from thence we mounted a very steep hill and reached a country of abounding desolation and misery where bare grey hills alternated with dense thickets and were told that there was not a human habitation for the rest of the journey to volterra our guards saw to the priming of their muskets before they started from colle and kept a sharp lookout on all sides of the way we met nothing however threatening or otherwise for nearly half our journey but somewhere about four o'clock of the afternoon when we were traversing a barren moor the corporal gave a sharp cry and reined up his horse before i knew what he was about a pistol had been placed in my hands and he said every man for himself now you are free sir how free i asked him his reply was to point ahead of us brigands he said and the kingdom of heaven in view the troopers got off their horses lashed them by the bridles head to head and stood behind them with their muskets pointed the way the enemy was coming they were upon us almost before i had seen anything but a cloud of whirling dust they came on at a furious pace yelling and discharging their arms and made short work of our defenses the three soldiers were killed and rifled i and belviso had our hands tied were strapped on to horses put in the midst of the band who were all masked and carried off at a terrible rate across the open country we went down a mountain side crossed a torrent and crashed into a thick belt of woodland which lay beyond it in the midst of this a ruined chapel or hermitage seemed to serve our captors for a camp for here they drew rein and disposed of us their booty my feet were bound as my hands already had been and i was thrown thus helpless on my face on one side the miserable belviso whose disguise and beauty made him appear what he had so unhappily pretended to be had his hands tied behind him but his ankles left free him they placed on the other side of the ruin at some distance from me they had made no effort to search me my wretched rags of a clown of the theatre being my protection and by that means only i was able to keep the pistol given me by the corporal mercifully i had not used it yet for when the attack was made i saw that i had better make no defence if i wished to save my life and i could not see that i had any good reason for risking it on behalf of the soldiers i suppose it must have been evident that i was a prisoner and that it would be better worth their while to keep and sell me as a slave than to blow my brains out it was only too clear what they intended to do with my poor friend the brigands so soon as they were rid of us set to work preparing a meal for themselves they lit a fire in the chapel filled a cauldron fed and watered their horses very soon they were all about the pot eating and drinking like wild beasts and when the meat was done they went on with the wine and brandy which they had in abundance played cards and dice quarrelled or caroused far into the night it was densely dark save for the chance flames of the fire when i heard them all wrangling together and had some hopes of a fight which might turn to our advantage but whatever was the subject of their disputations their fury died down into grumbling they had decided on drawing lots for possession of us as i now understand but some were too drunk to take a part and some too indifferent it came down to three who went on with the contest while three fell asleep and snored through all the noise i saw the whole affair how three billets were put into an empty crock and one was drawn out the man who drew it had won me i could tell because when he had shown his paper to the others he came over to where i was and touched me with his foot to learn whether i was safe i shammed sleep and never moved so presently he lay down by the side of me and himself slept meantime another of the remaining two had drawn belviso and had gone towards his victim i saw the loser creep after him and lost sight of both in the dark but then after a horrible pause i heard my wretched friend begin to cry for mercy to confess the truth to pray to god to shriek in a way i shuddered to hear the ruffian at my side like his companions by the fire slept through all and this dared me to what sounds like an act of madness with a temerity born of my anguish on belviso's account i rolled over and over until i was close to the fire there i thrust my ankles into the flames regardless of the excruciating pain and burnt away the cord that tied me i served my hands in the same way and springing up crept swiftly to where i heard the crying lad and the scuffling by what light the fire afforded i saw that the two men were fighting for possession one was full length on the ground the other crouched over him and upon him with a knife in his teeth but so intent upon his murderous design that he had no eyes for me i came quite close made a sudden snap at the knife and plunged it with all my force into the neck of the topmost it drove right through him and pierced his victim i think they must have died at once for except for one horrible gasping snort i heard nothing at the moment i felt myself caught by the ankle and heard francis francis it is i i pulled belviso to his feet cut the cord at the wrist and plunged forward into the black of the wood running downhill as near as i could judge towards where i knew the brook was we were pursued but in a darkness so impenetrable the chances were in our favour and we were never within a quarter mile of being caught we gained the river side jump i cried and dragged belviso in after me we could just bottom it there we stayed under a shelving bank up to our necks in cold water until the day began to break not daring to move lest we should happen upon our enemies our teeth chattering together in a state of semi death how we endured it i don't know but life is sweet to young men looking about with great caution i could see nothing nor hear anything of the brigands we crossed the river and ran as fast as we could belviso in dripping weeds and myself in my wet rags of the comedy by very good luck he had had some four lire in the pocket of his gown when we had recovered something of blood and heart by our running i told belviso to keep himself snug in some bushes while i went marketing with his four lire i had seen some herdboys on the hill and was determined to supply him with clothes proper to his sex i went up to the boys and offered a lire for a pair of breeches half a dozen pairs were off and under my nose before i had done speaking i chose two pair begged a hunch of bread into the bargain and made them happy as kings with three lire i asked them my whereabouts and learned that i was four leagues from volterra and seven from pomarance i was south of volterra south west of siena but pomarance was on my road to arezzo to pomarance therefore so soon as we were clothed in the one indispensable garment of manhood we determined to go to reach our haven it was necessary to cross one of the main lines of communication with siena that from florence namely by the val d'elsa or that from rome by san quirico and the val d'orcia we agreed that the latter was the safer for us as being further from the seat of government though much the more difficult the country was mountainous and thinly populated if we ran in no danger of robbery as how should we who had nothing but rags and empty stomachs about us we might easily starve or keep the beasts from starvation there were wolves in these hills and dogs turned rogue which were as bad or worse all this however we were ready to face so soon as we had eaten bread washed ourselves at a well by the roadside and commended ourselves to god come brother i said our fortunes must needs mend since they can never be more broken in this world there is no stay but a thing gets better or worse i believe we may be happy yet brother replied belviso i am sure of it and i promise you i have never looked forward to happiness before this well in which i have washed myself is lustral water i have fouled it with the vile thing i was once in return it has made a new creature of me thanks to god and you bravo said i and now avanti pronti says belviso and we struck east along a fine grassy valley where the trees were in the full glory of early summer i was full of hope which i could neither explain nor justify and though i did not know it then i had some grounds to be so i shall not inflict upon the reader the vicissitudes of our wearisome journey of three weeks over the sharp ridged valleys of lower tuscany we sometimes begged sometimes worked for the bread we ate and the sheds in which we slept we were tanned to the colour of walnuts healthy as young cattle merry as larks in the sky we gave each other our full confidence or so i believed at any rate i kept nothing from my friend he was more reticent the past is past he used to say my safety is only in the future let me talk to you of that and so he did a friendship was sealed between us which no difference of race degree or age could ever break in upon we loved each other tenderly we were as brothers belviso was at one and the same time the most affectionate the shrewdest and the most candid boy that ever was conceived in sin and nurtured in vice no shameful dealing had left a mark upon him he was fine gold throughout but so i have found it always in this dear country of my adoption that it takes prosperity never misery to corrupt its native simplicity the lower you descend in the scale of human attainment the greater the hopes you may conceive of what humanity may be permitted to attain the poor drab the world's hire for the price of a rush light the lurking thief the beggar at the church door the naked urchin of the gutter these though they live with swine and are of them have the souls of children new and clean from god neither malice nor forethought of evil nor craft nor hatred nor clamour nor the great and crowning sin is in their hearts a kind word a touch a kiss redeems them thus they whom the tyrants of italy have enslaved are in truth the very marrow of italy without whom she would never have done anything in this world and the sorrowful verity is that slaves they must remain if italy is to live on for prosperity which fattens their bodies chokes and poisons their souls chapter xxxviii an unexpected messenger lifts me up destitute as we were of anything but the sinews of our backs and arms we were forced if we would live to work our way to arezzo and it often fell out that the piece work we engaged to do kept us long in one place near sinalunga in particular in a green pastoral country we hired ourselves out to a peasant to hoe his vines and were busy there for nearly three weeks i cannot say that i was discontented indeed i have always found that the harder my labour is and the straiter my lot the less room i have for discontent with this peasant his family his pigs hens and goats belviso and i lived in a hovel which had it not been roofed over might have been a cote or a pigsty the man's name was masuccio his wife's gioconda between them they had a brood of nine children a grown daughter of fourteen three stout lads four brats and a child not breeched and in addition to all these and to belviso and myself to a sow in farrow four goats and hens innumerable the good man's father was posed as veritable master of the whole an old man afflicted with palsy who did nothing but shake and suck at his pipe but who nevertheless had by virtue of his years and situation the only semblance of a bed the first of everything and the best and the most of that the rest of us higgledy piggledy lay by night on the mud floor with a little pease straw for litter and scrambled all together for the remnants of the old tyrant's food yet nobody questioned his absolute right and nobody seemed unhappy nor looked out at any prospect but unremitting barely remunerative labour from year's end to year's end this is i am now convinced the true philosophy of life that labour is a man's only riches and food shelter rest and the satisfaction of appetite his means whereby to grow rich in other walks of life the practice is reversed and labour is looked upon as the means appetite and comfort as the end inconceivable folly since labour alone brings health and health content but i must relate how i was cozened out of my own healthy contentment one day when i was afield in the vines not far from the high road which ran from sinalunga to still distant arezzo as i was resting on my hoe in the furrow i saw a man come by walking a pretty good horse he was an elderly bearded man very portly and wore the brown garb of the capuchins which i certainly had no reason to love his bald head gleaming in the sun was of the steep and flat topped shape of our english quartern loaves and it came upon me with a shock that here was that fra palamone whom i had last seen extended shot by my hand in the piazza santa maria at florence this alarming discovery was verified by his nearer approach i recognised his twinkling tireless eyes his one long tooth like a tusk and even the scar on his right brow it was fra palamone in the flesh and in great and prosperous flesh although this apparition made me vaguely uneasy i was relieved to find that i had not his death upon my conscience on the other hand i felt no yearning of the bowels towards him and did not propose to go one inch over the newly turned clods to bid him good day supported by my hoe chin on hands i watched him tolerably sure that he would never mark me down i was as brown as the earth in which i delved scarce distinguishable from it i had on my head an old felt hat of no shape at all i had a cotton shirt open to the navel and a pair of blue cotton drawers which failed me at the knees i was bleached and tanned again stained and polished by the constant rub of weather and hard work a perfect contrast to my last appearance before him then it had been my heart that was rent not my garments then my spirit was fretted and seamed not my skin then i had had a fine cloth coat and lace ruffles but my soul was soiled and my honour in tatters the hand which shot him down had been covered in a scented glove but pride had flaunted it upon me naked and unashamed the contrast assured me while it gave me confidence enough to watch my wily enemy he saw me however he saw me and reined up his horse he beckoned me towards him in the way of free command which a mounted man assumes with peasants as it would have been more singular to stand than to obey i went slowly over the furrows and saluted him responding to his bluff buon di with a servo suo the shadow of my hat was now my only hope but i felt his sharp eyes burn their way through that and now i am sure that he recognised me at the first moment he pretended however that he had not saving up as i suppose his acclamations to be the climax of the little drama he had schemed addressing me as his honest lad he asked his way to fojano with particulars of fords bridle tracks and such like this was a game of which i at least was soon weary i never could play pretences i said i have told you what you want to know fra palamone it is three good leagues to fojano i hope you are sufficiently recovered of your wound to attempt it at the same time i pushed up the brim of my hat and looked him in the face he maintained his silly comedy for a little while longer the old knave staring at me as if i had been a ghost muttering names as if to recall mine then with a glad shout of it is it is my francis of old he threw up his arms to heaven and broke into doggerel 'si benedetta tu o maria madre di gesu regina coeli intemerata atque hominum advocata o what perils by land and sea he continued what racking of entrails what contumely what anguish of hunger and thirst have i not undergone for this for this for this now i can say domine nunc dimittis with a full heart now indeed is the crown of lilies set upon the life work of wayworn sad browed palamone sad browed palamone he threw a leg over his horse's ears and slid to the ground with a thud which made earth shake he stretched out his arms to beckon me home and when i would not budge he scrambled through the briery hedge and took me whether i would or no into his strenuous embrace he wept over me as a long lost child of his slobbered me patted my head back breast he held me at arm's length to look at me better hugged me again as if at last he was sure this is verily and indeed he cried my friend and companion for many years ardently loved ardently served lost for a season searched for with blood shedding and found with tears of thankfulness o dearest brother let us kneel down and thank the giver of all good the only true fount for this last and most signal instance of his provident bounty he did kneel and had the hardihood to drag me with him i believe he would have prayed over me like a bishop at a confirmation but this blasphemous farce was too much for me i jumped up and away in a rage fra palamone i said i don't know whither this pretence of yours is designed to lead you but i know well whither it will lead myself namely with this hoe of mine to complete the work which i bungled in florence and to the achievement of that i shall instantly proceed unless you get up from your polluted knees and tell me your real and present business with me here he got up at once one of those lightning alterations of his from the discursive to the precise va bene says he you shall be satisfied in a moment he fumbled for his pocket book and from that selected three papers which he handed to me in silence and in due order they were a power of attorney to fra palamone by name from sir john macartney his britannic majesty's representative at the grand ducal court authorising him to use all diligence and spare no expense in finding francis antony strelley of upcote esquire wherever he might be in italy and with further authority to secure honour for his drafts upon the banking house of peruzzi in florence to the extent of five hundred pounds sterling a letter to the said sir john macartney from mr simcoe of gray's inn square announcing the death of my father antony strelley esquire a letter addressed to me by my honoured dear and now widowed mother over these documents especially the last two of them and my mournful reflections upon them i draw that veil which no one who has been a bad but repentant son to a saintly parent will ever ask me to lift up my first desire was to be rid of palamone my next to think i turned shortly on the frate i am obliged to you for your diligence in my affairs i said to him though i don't understand how you procured the means of using it however as you seem willing to serve me you will have the goodness to ride on to sinalunga and buy me three horses two suits of clothes with riding boots and cloaks for each body linen sufficient for two persons valises and whatever else may be necessary all being duplicates remember the whole of these necessaries you will bring back to that house which you see in the valley together with a proper supply of ready money within three hours of this now be off it was his turn to salute me now and for him to say servo suo i found belviso helping filippa the daughter of the house to milk the goats and when he had done drew him apart and told him my news he received it gravely without surprise don francis he said what do you expect of me except 'of course' it did not need much penetration on my part to see that you were a signorino the whole of our company knew it as far as i am concerned it only makes your goodness to me the more inexplicable while it perfectly explains my willingness to serve you and since you have added condescension to charity i am the more sincerely grateful as you will now wish to be rid of me i can assure you that i am strong enough to stand alone i believe that i shall make my way in the world by honest courses in the future but i shall never cease to bless your name belviso i said as to leaving me that is your affair for i tell you that the separation will never spring from me we have been brothers in misery and may be no less so in good fortune at any rate i shall not leave you to this life of a beast come with me to arezzo and after that to florence then we will talk of all our businesses and hear what virginia has to say he looked serious ah he said i know beforehand what your virginia will say she will say as i do i will follow you to the gates of heaven or hell don francis but only in one capacity i said there is only one possible capacity i know that very well replied the boy we agree to that point but differ beyond it what do you mean i asked him puzzled he was very serious and said don francis if i go with you from this place i go as your servant and in no other fashion to that i said never and invoked the aid of heaven shrugging he turned away saying as you will then it is farewell padrone you will make me angry i said and he answered it is your right my right is it said i if so then i command you what he exclaimed you command me to be your brother dear sir at this i became angry in good earnest and showed it very plainly he was extremely patient under it but equally firm he said don francis your generosity has gone near to be your ruin because though it would be good logic in heaven we are not there yet you say that you and i are equal i say that we are nothing of the sort and the proof would be that if we started level from this door and as we stand in six months' time you would remain a gentleman and i the son of a shoemaker of cadorre a gentleman you are because you were born so if you took me up to your right hand whether in this hovel or in the palace which is yours by reason still you would be the gentleman and i the cobbler's son and though i might prosper in business and become rich and finding you in want might take you up to my right hand call you my brother make you my heir still you would be the gentleman condescending and i the cobbler's son making myself ridiculous your misfortunes every one of them have arisen from the fact that you persist in treating your inferiors as your equals i should be sorry to tell you it would be a great impertinence how far back into your career in italy i can trace this foible of yours he was no doubt in the right a little more generosity on my part would have told him so i said that i could not convince him and that i should leave virginia to do that oh sir it is she that has convinced me already says he the return of fra palamone with the gear put an end to our talk i said come with me belviso as you will but come and his reply was servo suo i left the honest family at sinalunga calling blessings on my name and rode forward on a good horse to arezzo by my orders fra palamone kept behind me by his own determination belviso held him company and led the sumpter horse chapter xxxix virginia declines the heights i took up my lodgings at the bear in arezzo and made all such preparations to receive my wife as were becoming i engaged a woman to wait upon her had a withdrawing room as the french say a boudoir fitted up and caused her bedchamber to be hung with the best curtain and wall furniture the place could afford i then proceeded to dine but told the landlord that he must be prepared at any moment to place a fresh cover on the table with a bottle of his most excellent wine to belviso who persisted in playing valet and who told me that he had been in arezzo before more than once i entrusted the privilege though i grudged it him of seeking far and wide through the town for virginia's lodging i said brother you failed me once in spite of yourself when you tried so bravely to find my wife don't fail me this time i beseech you he looked troubled he fingered the tablecloth before he spoke i encouraged him to open me his mind well don francis said he most uncomfortably the task you put upon me then was very easy but for the one little circumstance that virginia was not there but this present is of enormous difficulty why so my dear i asked him for the one little circumstance that virginia is here said he and then seeing my bewilderment he added you don't know the tuscans of her class as well as i do that's certain you know them as children as warm hearted passionate simpletons but you have yet to learn how tender they are of their reputation and how quick to feel a touch i have never seen your virginia but i'll warrant her as proud as fire i believe that she would rather die than occupy that damask hung bed even with your honour for mate and supposing she consented to that do you not guess what would be the first thing she would do it would be to scratch the eyes out of that donna di camera you have given her and she would do that mind you in self defence for the donna di camera who is probably a little above her in degree would certainly do the same for virginia i own to having been somewhat put about my dear belviso i said virginia is liable to impulse it may be admitted but she is never likely to forget what wifely duty involves i was not a cruel husband to her and left her through no fault of my own i will answer for her that she will be a good wife a good wife for francesco the carpenter said belviso yes it may be so though i own that her marriage puzzles me but wife to don francesco nobile inglese never in the world i said belviso i never asked you to be my servant as you very well know the proposal came from you against my will but if my servant you are i will make free to remind you that i have given you an order and shall be obliged if you will set about performing it the good lad dropped on one knee took my hand and kissed it and turned to obey me without a word ashamed of myself i patted him on the shoulder in token of forgiveness and saw the tears spring into his eyes before he could reach the door fra palamone had filled up the entry panting holding out a note for the excellency of don francesco says he just delivered at the door by a young female i took it from him it was in the hand of virginia the hand i myself had guided the good and docile hand which had formed itself on mine i read o heaven can i say so the words like knives at work cut themselves deep into the fibres of my heart virginia wrote most excellent don francis that cavalcade of his lordship's of four horses and two servants entering this city of arezzo at three o'clock in the afternoon of to day was witnessed by a concourse of people always eager to see a great gentleman and to secure some part of his bounty had his lordship lifted his eyes to the windows of the shops and houses of the poor as he passed by he would have seen virginia strozzi at her needlework that poor creature whose virtue his lordship was so benevolent as to protect for which truly gracious act his same poor virginia must always be grateful it would have been a great kindness in his lordship to have allowed one who ever tried to be faithful and obedient to kiss his noble hand and his virginia cannot doubt but that she might have done so his lordship's nobility of mind and generosity of heart are so well known that for the very reason of them she has not dared to present herself i know what my duty is i cannot come to you i beg him not to seek me i am going away so soon as i have delivered this letter do not ask me to come francis i cannot i cannot i cannot your virginia who tries to be good this letter stunned me i sank under it as under a violent blow with me also fell dashed to the ground all my honourable resolutions all my hopes of gaining self respect i will not deny also that i was savagely stung by mortification for a man is so made that he does not relish a refusal any the more for being aware that he has not too anxiously sought acceptance but on the contrary his self reproach for that tardiness of his is made more bitter by the rebuff he feels that he has deserved it and is the more deeply wounded and had i not deserved it why had i not crept back into lucca in any disguise by any subterfuge when i was driven out why had i not braved a second disgrace nay imprisonment stripes even death on virginia's account alas it was because virginia's account was not heavy enough in my books pass that and have at me again why when i knew her whereabouts did i not strike off across the hills to find her was it that she would not have welcomed me naked have cherished me dying have died herself to save me alas no it was because i had been drawn on to siena by that lovely haunting beckoning beguiling vision of aurelia my torture and stem of shame why finally were my eyes not lifted up to her wistful eyes as she sat poor sempstress in that upper room it was because of my accursed prosperity it was because my eyes were cased and swollen in pride because my fine horse held them because i thought i had but to nod and be obeyed by my wife thy wife sayest thou francis nay wretched fool but thy slave out upon thee out white and suffering not knowing what to do i sat by my untasted board and gave the letter into belviso's hand to read he read it carefully and fra palamone peeped over his shoulder he was the first to speak he clacked his tongue to his palate that gross and forcible rogue he looked all about him with his arms spread abroad as if he were scouring the air to find virginia she's off he said she's off that's plain bolted like a coney to the hills now who's our man i struck my breast it is i fra palamone i am her man he inspected me for half a moment as if to judge of the possibility but took no further notice of me he walked to the window and looked out up and down the street clean heels says he and she was within reach of my hand what i cried it was she who i did not finish but rushed at the door belviso divining my insane purpose caught me by the coat stay don francis let any one go but you seeing that i paused irresolute he went on to urge me by all that i held dear to do nothing so foolish do you suppose he said that you will find her knowing nothing of arezzo and she knowing all do you think her so light that having borne the first sight of you already without faltering she will fall to you at the second you have taught me wiselier about her out of your own mouth let us question the friar he turned to palamone who had his mouth open and was scratching in his beard the frate said that virginia herself had delivered the letter into his hands as he stood taking the air at the inn door he scoffed at the notion that he could be mistaken had he not nearly lost his life for her already he described her in terms too luscious to be palatable a fine and full wench he called her bare headed bare necked with the breasts of hebe and says he don francis you may call her your wife or by what other pleasant phrase you please but though i'd allow you to do you pleasure that that were what she ought to be wife at least to somebody saving your respect she's no wife at all there's not a wedded woman in all italy would go abroad with a bare bosom you may take the word of an expert for that she's tricked you sir or you have tricked her she has had what she has had without responsibility and now she's away and if i may be allowed the remark i should say you were well rid of her an excellent dinner awaits you here more than enough for one a bare pittance for two a courteous banker awaits you in florence old palamone will scratch his eyes out to save you after dinner sir half of arezzo i said palamone i lay this command upon you since you profess yourself my friend find me virginia wheresoever she may be i will give you a thousand guineas without her you have not one farthing of mine he seized my hands a thousand devils would not send me faster consider her in your arms he went gaily out of my presence with a song on his lips i heard him singing it lustily down the street of the town and saw no more of him for some days belviso was of great comfort to me during my time of anxiety without the faithful creature i should have run my feet off my legs and my wit out of my head in futile search he was much too tactful to remind me of his warnings but did not cease to show me all sorts of reasonable grounds for virginia's conduct which had the effect of keeping his first prognostication always before me the girl he said i repeat the sum of his many discourses is evidently a good girl and of strong character she is perfectly reasonable she married you i take that for granted when you were broken beyond all prospect of repair she now finds you restored to your proper station in the world and will be no party to pulling you off your throne she sees very well how that must end unhappily how can she hope to be a companion of your companions a friend of your friends a sharer in your amusements mistress she might be your toy wife she can never be that parade of her neck and bosom a desperate measure i assure you shows to my mind that you will never possess her again but as you would not care to do you assure me that you married her you name the church describe the rites all seems to be in order but the more i understand your virginia in these late proceedings the less i understand that wedding in the ghetto everything i learn of her from her own acts convinces me of her good sense but of her acts as reported by you don francis i reserve my judgment my heart and whole mind being now set upon finding her my chagrin may be imagined when fra palamone returned without her he demanded money to prosecute his researches beyond the confines of arezzo she's a deep one he said she's as deep as the sea who can tell where she is by now may be in venice may be in rome may be in the attics of this inn i gave him twenty guineas and he disappeared again for ten days at the end of that time he returned once more horribly dishevelled dirty and extended he looked to be just out and about again after a ruinous debauch he talked in hollow whispers he trembled in the limbs he started and turned pale at a shadow or the sound of a mouse in the wainscot he said he had been to ancona gubbio rimini ravenna chioggia venice udine trieste he demanded money fifty guineas but this time i gave him nothing i was preparing to go to florence and had other agents than him in view i dismissed him from my service and told him to go to the devil he left me for the moment vowing as he did it that he should never never quit my service and i found that it was no easier to get rid of him now than it had ever been i saw him on the morrow i saw him every day the more i saw of him the more i abhorred him and the more i made this plain the more devoted he professed himself wherever i went he shadowed me he lurked in the dark corners of churches where i made my devotions or studied the monuments until i rose from my knees if i rode in the country i knew that he was not far away if i frequented public assemblies i saw his keen eyes upon me and his wide mouth fixed at a patient grin he was oppressively sickeningly affectionate his role being that of the old friend of my family who had rocked my cradle and held me by my leading strings at meals he came skipping about me with little offerings a rose bud for my bosom's king he would say fresh pulled radishes for my heart's blood and once while i was at dinner he danced up to the table with a large and bleeding rabbit saying a coney for my dear of old palamone's wiring this was too much for my patience i swung the beast about his ears drove him from the room and flung his catch after him he brought me no more presents but did not cease to be my shadow chapter xl i get rid of my enemy and part from my friend when the day drew near upon which i had appointed to depart from florence i saw that i must come to terms with the fellow i sent belviso out to look for him and to find him at no greater distance than the other side of the door with his eye at the keyhole he came in blinking like an owl still weak with his recent excesses and very nervous i felt my gorge rise at the sight of him but did my best to be cool palamone i began it appears that you have recently done me a service he leered at me my francis when and at what hour of day or night have i not been ready to serve you why that's as may be said i i think i could remind you of a night attack at pistoja oh cruel he said oh cruel of a ravishment of the strappado applied to a man bound hand and foot he pretended to weep cruel cruel francis of detestable treachery in florence when you set to work to entrap a good girl who had done you no harm in the world and fra palamone i think i may remind you of the payment of those services of yours in kind in the piazza of santa maria with clasped hands streaming eyes he beamed upon me generous hand oh healing life giving blood i am glad i said that you consider yourself healed by bleeding but now it appears you have appointed yourself messenger from my friends and have succeeded in benefiting me without extraordinary robbery i cannot suppose that you did this for love believe it says he believe it francis you must forgive me if i cannot said i on the contrary i believe that you have acted for what profit you can make out of it i never asked you to interfere in my affairs and owe you less than nothing but to make an end of you since you do perhaps believe that you have served me with this late news of what you no doubt would call my 'good fortune' i will give you more than you deserve i counted out ten guineas or their equivalent and held them out to him his eyes gleamed as if a fire had suddenly been kindled in them by the sight of money he pounced at my hand and emptied it as a dog scrapes in the ground holding his coins close to his breast he snarled at me of his astuteness and took obscene pride in his guile is palamone an old fool then eh mercy and truth was there ever such a wise old fox born into this world did i not when i saw you at rovigo lay this finger to this nose and say 'la la palamone fratello here is a pigeon for your plucking hand' did i not know you for an englishman for a nobleman born for what do you take me i knew that you had run away out of a scrape i knew that the money bags would be emptied to find you wise old palamone deep browed old night bird darkly thinking quickly acting old fox palamone and now take heed to this i have never lost you but have been hard on your heels though jesuits and ministers and woman after woman have beset you on all sides and what have i gained by all this a wound in the breast my conscience a slug through the lung on the word of a christian and my francis the child of my sorrow fed upon my tears talks to me of profit o dio o dio he wrung his hands and howled then grinning like a wolf he came creeping to me his fingers gripping the air like claws give me more money francis you who have so much give me the guineas of england fifty a hundred a thousand what are they to you to me they are meat and drink paradise and the mercy seat he was now hovering close to me terribly possessed by greed if you do not give me money francis i shall kill you with these hands so he threatened me raving my anger got the better of my judgment you black souled thief i said you shall have just what you deserve he still grinned and glared i think he still hoped for more money i had my malacca cane in my hand caught him with the other by the neck gear and beat him till the stick was in splinters it was like thrashing a sack of flour for he lay like that under his punishment and the dust that flew out of him filled the room when i had done i threw him from me went to the door and opened it belviso was outside pale and trembling i sent him for a corporal's guard at the sound of which order before the lad could obey it the frate rose howling like a lost dog ran swiftly to the window and leapt out into the street he was not hurt apparently for i heard his howls far down the via di citta and he must have run like the wind for when they searched the country half an hour later there was no sign of him to be seen belviso who had witnessed this startling end came trembling out of the corner of the room with his hands stretched out he knelt down before me his face hidden between his arms terrible man he said shuddering but oh signore he has awoken the god in you have no fear he will trouble you no more i believe not said i on the other hand he will not find me virginia get up belviso let us take counsel together what is your opinion belviso thus adjured rose to his feet and stood humbly before me he was agitated if by fear then curiously but it did not seem to be fear which put the slurred accents into his voice senta don francesco he began what virginia has done was all for love she has acted according to her nature as many would act as all would act towards you who knew your worth o dio cried the lad suddenly gripping his chest with both hands o dio i would prove my love in the same sort if i were if i were not if you were if you were not he began to weep piteously i stared what is the matter with you belviso i asked him what would you do if you were or were not something which you are or are not riddles riddles my dear i was sorry he had seen me in such a rage and laid a kindly arm upon his drooped shoulders but belviso sprang away don't touch me do not touch me he said panting you little know you cannot guess and you never shall what shall i prove such an ingrate you have befriended me lifted me out of the mud i have a soul now it is worth saving virginia that savage fine girl is not the only servant in the world no mother diana we have hearts too in the veneto he swept the storm from his eyes and calmed himself by the gesture don francis he said let me leave you at this moment i will find your virginia that fine girl trust me leave all to me i know tuscany and the tuscans i will give her to you never fear in six weeks from now i will have her snug in lucca there you shall find her if you still want her and if you do not if i do not i said you may blot the name of francis strelley from the book of life and judgment god bless you belviso dear friend your words convince me go in peace take money take what you choose my love my gratitude i choose nothing but your confidence and a kiss of your noble hand said belviso you shall grasp not kiss my hand i told him you are a man or will be one as i am let us love trust meet part as men i held out my hand he took it pressed it seemed unable to let it go suddenly he dropped down and kissed my knee but with ardour with reverence indescribable devotion then sprang to his feet and was gone i made all preparations for my journey to florence chapter xli i return to florence and the world of fashion upon my arrival in the capital my first care after securing a lodging on the lung' arno was to pay a visit to the ghetto where i had spent those happy three days with my newly wedded wife if wife indeed she had been i found the church but not the priest i found the old jewess miriam in whose house we had lodged she made short work of my doubts you are no more married to your virginia than you are to me she curtly said you are as little married as any young man of my acquaintance married indeed why that church hadn't had a mass said in it to my knowledge for fifty years except a black one now and again to oblige the jaded vicious and as for your priest 'tis true he was a priest once but he had been degraded for a bad affair of robbery with violence and inhibited from his business and now i come to think on it he was hanged outside the bargello no earlier than last week i was aghast at this news which as it was delivered i could hardly doubt virginia then had deceived me i had trusted her in all things and she had played me false designing to do her honour i had done her the greatest dishonour but through her means blind fool that i was playing the husband complacently accepting her play of the wife as serious o heaven and she had let me ruin her and now was gone i own that i was angry at being made the victim of a trick indignant at having been forced into a thing which i should never have dreamed of doing but when i turned severely to miriam and accused her of being a party to the fraud she laughed in my face and put the case before me in a way which made me sing a tune in the minor fiddlededee she retorted her arms stuck out akimbo what in the world had i to do with your fooleries 'twas the girl arranged it all and for reasons which do her more credit than you seem able to do her i think she's a very good girl a thousand times too good for you if you find her again i shall be sorry for her and i'll tell you this much that i shan't help you she had me pleading after this but it took two or three visits and very liberal treatment before she would condescend to tell me anything finally however she gave it as her opinion that fra palamone whom i had been so short sighted as to dismiss was more likely to know of her whereabouts than any one and that i had better beware of the marchese semifonte a man well known to her she plainly told me that she thought next to nothing of my chances and that the best thing i could do was to go back to england you don't understand our women nor will you ever you and the likes of you she said they have more sound sense in their little fingers than your nation in its collected parliament do you imagine a girl like virginia wants to be your lady what on earth should she do in such a place lie on a couch and order menservants about oh preposterous what pleasures does virginia know but those of bed and board and hoard she'll be merry in the first and hearty at the second and passionate for filling the crock with gold pieces but your manners would freeze the heart out of her and if you have more guineas than you can spend where's the joy of sweating to get 'em or of hiding 'em under the flag stones against a lean year no no she knew better than you and did better a gentleman may play the beggar for a while but sooner or later his own will have him and what's virginia to do then do you dare she said sternly do you dare to blame her for what she has done she has done incredibly well and if you in all the rest of your life can prove a tithe of her nobility you will be a greater man than i have reason to believe you i cannot blame her miriam i said i love her too much i shall never rest until i find her the tears stood in my eyes i was indeed humiliated but my shame though bitter was not without fruit shortly afterwards in order to clear up the affairs of my inheritance i presented myself before sir john macartney the english minister at his weekly levee in the palazzo c a bluff soldierly man of irish birth and english opinions he received me with particular civility in which curiosity may perhaps have played its part he deplored my loss of an excellent father rejoiced in my gain of an excellent estate hoped i should return to england cry for king george hunt the country and keep a good head of game he alluded as delicately as he could to religious differences i know very well that you're no turncoat mr strelley he said no dammy your house is inveterate for the pope but your father was never a stuart's man and i hope you'll follow him there you'll stand apart 'tis only natural but curse me let us have no jesuit rogues in our women's quarters hey no no you must uphold the protestant succession mr strelley like your father before you my reply i fancy somewhat sobered the heart of sir john i said that i preferred the republican form of government as i had seen it in venice and lucca and that i should certainly have nothing to question in the authority of king george seeing that that authority had been conferred upon him by parliament i added that my plans were very uncertain and did not at present include hunting the county of oxford i have done much hunting since i have been in italy i said ruefully i have been as often quarry as huntsman at present i am hunting for my but there i stopped wife i could not say mistress i would not sir john saved me the trouble he was a man of the world young blood he cried i envy you that at your age my dear sir that too was my game he took snuff then said in an undertone i am not too old but i can feel for you and not so young neither that i shall pretend more ignorance of your troubles than you could believe me to have for reasons of your own you chose not to seek my good offices when you were last in florence and it was not for me to thrust myself upon you there was a lady i believe pooh man never blush for that there is always a lady at your happy age well i can give you news that lady is still here in florence a charming creature mr strelley upon my soul if i were younger by a decade tut tut what am i saying what was he saying indeed he was reminding me of one i desired extremely to forget he was diverting my mind from another whom i must by all means remember honestly i did not wish to see donna aurelia but sir john must have out his news he told me that donna aurelia and her husband were established in florence count giraldi said sir john had used his great authority with the sovereign to obtain a fine position for the professor dr lanfranchi had been made a judge of the court of cassation and had been in residence some six months or more fine as this position was however it was nothing said sir john to the position of the judge's lady she's a leader of the mode i can assure you said he and any little difficulty you may have had in that quarter you may be sure will be none now count giraldi will no doubt be enchanted to present you there i recommend you to keep in with the count i felt that i could not love count giraldi any more i told sir john that my duties towards donna aurelia and her husband were of a peculiar kind not to be assisted or made more difficult by count giraldi there was a moment i added when his excellency could have served me when having played the part of an honest man i called for the help of one who had pretended himself my friend he failed me then i know not why and he might fail me now if you will pardon me for saying so what i now have to do in the case of this lady if there is anything for me to do is by no means the business of his excellency i hope not i hope not said sir john go your own way and count upon me at least in the pinch if pinch there is to be but remember this count giraldi is the chief minister of this government and this government is your host count giraldi is therefore major domo keep in with him my dear sir by all means unless you desire a your conge or b an extortionate bill for breakages and arrears i need only mention the name of the marchese semifonte no more on that head no more indeed says i very short but as to count giraldi i can assure you that i have no quarrel with his excellency who idle rumours apart has never to my knowledge impugned my honour why no said sir john with a queer frown nor need he ever so long as you clearly perceive wherein your honour lies i do perceive it most clearly i replied and believe that i have always perceived it since that fatal night when i forgot that i had any i am so sure of it now that i shall not hesitate for a moment with your permission sir i shall set about it this very hour what the devil are you going to do my dear sir cried the minister i am going to leave florence i said so soon as ever i have done my present business sir john puffed out his cheeks and let his relief escape in a volley poh how you put me about said he i thought you were for the count's throat i thought body of me i know not what i thought as for the doctor you'll find him easy handling the good man knows where his comforts are and whence they come why supposing that you had never gone into his wife's cupboard and stalked out of it again would he at this day have been snug upon the bench with house room at the villa san giorgio here was something strange at the villa san giorgio i echoed with astonishment is donna giulia then sir john looked sly donna giulia he said was a sensible woman she knew very well the length of her shoe donna giulia has joined her husband at naples a court appointment and a good house dr lanfranchi occupies the villa san giorgio now do you see how the land lies i frowned and squared my chin i think that i was disturbed because i did not then see how the land lay i suspected however that sir john knew more than he chose to tell me i rose to take leave of him there was something about me which he noticed you are going to the doctor he said you will find him in court i am going i said to the villa san giorgio he showed his alarm by saying you may regret it you may regret it all your life long i shall regret that i ever lived if i do not go said i as i went out sir john threw up his hands chapter xlii i stand at a cross road i did not go immediately to the villa san giorgio it was necessary that i should be clear why i was to go there at all how did i stand with regard to donna aurelia did i love her still or was i cured of my wound if i loved her to go to her now were to play the criminal if i did not it might be to play the fool because if i did not love her why was i going that is easily answered i was going because i suspected that all was not well with her why was donna giulia in retirement why was the villa at the disposition of the learned judge why was sir john macartney so guarded in his admissions and why so desirous that i should not see count giraldi apart from my private grievance against that person which after all was only based on surmise and the convictions of virginia i could see no possible reason why i should not meet him but one that was that he was fallen a victim to aurelia's charms and to a certain extent i felt that i should be responsible for that misfortune for if i had never loved her she had never been in florence and if she had never been in florence she had never seen this accomplished scoffing cynical tuscan i was not ashamed to confess that i still thought aurelia the most beautiful woman in the world the most heavenly in conversation as in person the most superb all the old glamour was upon me still i knew that i should be a child at her knees the moment i set eyes upon her again i knew that i should be imparadised longing after impossible goodness filled with impossible joys but i knew also that i did not desire her she was sacred she was so little of the earth that as well might one hope to wed a seraph all compact of fire as she i set by her in my mind's eye that passionate virginia that faithful clinging serving mate of what i knew were my happiest days ah my sweet lovely loving wife virginia's long kisses virginia's close arms her beating bosom her fury of love the meekness obedience steadfastness into which it could all be changed at a mere lift of my brows ah nuptial love wedded bliss the joys of home and the hearth english joys virginia meant all this and more to me i swore to myself that without her i could not live that to deserve her i would renounce the world my patrimony my country and that not even a changed aurelia changed from seraph to calling siren could keep me from her side but aurelia aurelia gualandi that delicate flower of siena that youngest of the angels that fount of poesy what of her what had she to say to such a certainty as this of mine in my mind's eye i saw them stand together she and virginia those two beautiful girls virginia a head the taller proudly erect with arms folded over her chest and her dark brows forming a bar across her forehead i saw her in white bodice and green petticoat her arms and neck bare her feet in old slippers her black hair loosely coiled and stuck with a silver pin i saw her hold herself aloof and dubious proud and coldly chaste call me and i come she seemed to say to me between her shut lips call me and i follow you over the world like a dog at your heels send me into infamy and i go expect me to woo you there and i will die sooner yours if you will have me nobody's anybody's if you will not in my fancy i could hear her very words see her steady eyes her pure and moving lips and aurelia how did she stand there i saw her too in my mind's eye dazzlingly provokingly like a creature of pure light with thrown back head and parted lips with jewels about her neck as i had seen her in the theatre at siena and jewels also in her hair like a queen of beauty at a love court conscious of her power loving it proving it she smiled she shook her cloudy tresses she demanded my worship as of right if i choose i shall call thee she seemed to say and thee and thee and thee again to stand behind my chair to kneel at my feet to be my slave and wilt thou deny me francis or thou or thou her soft eyes how they peered and sparkled her soft lips how they faltered between laugh and pout if i need him i can have him here i heard her say i have but to thrill his name to call checho checho and he comes is it not so checho is it not so call you me virginia call you me in turn my girl what said she now but povera virginia che fara don francesco non ti ama piu ebbene pazienza virginia shrugged her proud shoulders and turned her grey eyes away virginia refused to plead and was too proud to command so stood i in my fancy irresolute between these two their battleground the prize it would seem of one who now refused to fight for it and of one already sure of victory but this was very odd about the affair that the stiffer virginia grew as i saw her there the more indurate the more ruggedly of the soil declining battle the more aurelia shrank in my eyes the less confident her call to me the more frail her hold of my heart virginia stood apart like a rock and turned away her eyes from me thou shalt seek me out of thine own will francis for i will never come to thee again of mine but aurelia's halo had slipped her wings drooped lifeless her glitter was dimmed her appeal was now urgent her arms called me as well as her voice but i seemed to shrink from them as if there were danger in her this very singular hallucination of mine decided me to go for now i was curious the strife in which i had had so little to do had been most vivid the parties to it so real that there were moments when i caught myself speaking aloud to one of my phantoms that one was always virginia therefore i dared to go knowing full well that she would now go with me and it was so at six o'clock of an evening i went out of doors and turned my face towards the east it was a mild evening as that on which i had seen virginia for the first time in the wood her faggot on her head i seemed to see her now going bravely before me so clearly did she show i quickened my steps to overtake her and again my heart beat and again i thought of the nymphs and all the soft riot of the woodland scents and sounds strange how the slim figure of the peasant girl possessed me i thought of her as i entered the grove of cypresses which led to the villa and if my heart was in high trouble as i asked for donna aurelia it was the surmise that i should again see virginia fluttering among the trees that set my blood a tingling but she left me there as i waited in the saloon open to the shadowed garden and i knew not whether i felt her the more certainly for her absence than for her former persistent company chapter xliii agitations at the villa san giorgio the servant an old one of donna giulia's who knew me well by sight had grimaced pleasantly as he saluted buon di signoria he had said and servitore del 'lustrissimo the padrona he felt sure was in the house and the excellency of the count was paying a visit let the 'lustrissimo accommodate himself take repose walk in the garden do his perfect pleasure in two little moments the padrona should be informed with that he had gone away leaving a volley of nods winks and exclamations behind him the windows stood open the hour the season invited i saw the long velvety vista of the cypress avenue the slender feathers of trees in young leaf the pleasantness of the grass heard the invitation of a calling thrush thought poignantly of virginia and went out hoping to see her spirit there i paced the well remembered long avenue to where it opened into a circle to meet two others a sun dial stood here in the midst and marked a point from which you could look three ways behind you to the house to the right and to the left i chose for the right and sauntered slowly towards the statue of the dancing faun which closed that particular alley strange indeed it was to be within the personal circle of donna aurelia and undisturbed but i did not realise then how near her i was the sound of voices in debate broke in upon my meditations a woman's clear no no at this hour no and a man's which urged signora if my devotion i knew both voices the woman's was not to be mistaken aurelia was there the divine aurelia close at hand without thinking what i did i took a strong breath and stepped forward to my task i reached the statue of the faun which leered and writhed its leathery tongue at me and in the bay which opened out beyond it i found aurelia and the count together the fair aurelia was flushed and disarrayed her hair was half uncoiled her bodice undone she lay or rather reclined upon a garden seat one hand was clapped to her side one hand guarded her bosom the count who had his back to me was upon one knee before her he was or had been eloquent at the moment of my appearance he had finished his period and still trembled with the passion of it for the cynic philosopher he professed to be he was at the moment singularly without relish of the humours of his position coming upon all this i stopped suddenly short aurelia saw me and uttered a cry at the same instant her hands were busy with her dress the count on his feet in a moment turned his head started violently then controlled himself and advanced to meet me whom he had once called his friend my dear don francis he said briskly let me be one of the first to welcome you i had heard of your arrival only to day indeed i came here to prepare donna aurelia for a pleasant surprise i believe i was being eloquent on your account at this moment you may have overheard me if i was too partial blame my esteem i scarcely heard him and was perhaps barely civil i went past him hat in hand towards the lady i saluted her profoundly madam i said my intrusion is pure accident i was told that your ladyship was in the house ten thousand pardons that i come unannounced before you unwelcome i must needs be unworthy of your clemency since we parted unhappily forgive me i beseech you i then offered the count my hand oh signor francesco says aurelia in a twitter i am glad to see you again she was tremulous beautiful she had her old wayward ardent ways her childish bloom and roundness had not left her nor her sumptuousness nor her allure and yet i could look calmly into her face and know that she had no charm left for me madam i said since you showed me so plainly that my company was not to your taste i have no right to be here my fault my old fault is so clearly before me that i should not have dared commit another if i may once more ask your pardon oh my pardon cried she faltering why what harm have you done me now pray madam says the count my young friend's fault is a very natural one if he is a sinner what must your ladyship be for if it is sinful to love is it not worse to inspire it the lady made no reply at this gallant diversion the position was very awkward i could not speak as i felt or as i ought to feel the count would not and donna aurelia was on the verge of tears obviously i must retire madam i said i intruded upon you by misfortune and may not trespass i beg my service to the learned judge my profoundest respect to your ladyship the young man who once showed himself unworthy to be at your feet may now stand upon his own don francis has offended donna aurelia oh no no no said aurelia in distress oh checho don't leave me i came off my stilts for i saw that she was unhappy can i serve you i asked her can i be so honoured yes yes she said brokenly stay with me i need you stay count giraldi took a step forward madam he said i salute your ladyship's hand and shall do myself the honour to wait upon you upon a less urgent occasion don francis your humble servant to meet again no doubt he bowed himself away and left me alone with aurelia for some time neither of us spoke she sat pensive with signs of distress storm signals still displayed she was very nervous looking at her fingers at play in her lap i stood up beside her not knowing in truth what in the world she wanted with me the silence as it became oppressive made aurelia angry she bit her lip well she said at last well have you nothing to say to me now that you have found me madam said i my fault oh cried she in a rage your fault do you not see how hateful your 'fault' makes me appear do you think the best way of amending this wonderful fault of yours is to be for ever bewailing it has a gentleman never loved a lady before or am i a lady whom no man should love do you suppose i am flattered to learn that you have hunted me all over italy only for the pleasure of telling me that you are ashamed of ever having loved me i said i loved you unworthily i played a knave's part i distorted your lovely image i presumed upon your gracious kindness i was accursed accursed i did sacrilege i profaned the temple i strode about before her declaiming against myself not looking at her she laughed her vexation away my poor checho she said if you knew if you could understand those days and nights of ours were very sweet come let us walk a little it is chilly here come we will go into the house and you shall tell me of your travels she took my arm i led her back to the house i sat by her side in the little saloon which had been donna giulia's boudoir and served aurelia now for the same purpose and judging honesty the kindest and only course i told her everything of my defence of virginia hinting at the same time at my suspicions of count giraldi i said that the poor child had certainly been betrayed to the marchese that the count and father carnesecchi alone had known her story that i could not suspect the jesuit and therefore at this point aurelia stopped me not by any words but by her appearance of being upon the point of words she was very much excited but she controlled her speech and i went on to tell her that in consequence of that betrayal i had felt bound to make virginia my wife at this i thought that she was ill she stared at me as if i had suddenly stabbed her she went perfectly white your wife she whispered you have madam i said that is the truth i have never shrunk from my duty i believe and never saw duty plainlier than then i married virginia or thought that i did but it now appears that my marriage was none at all not by my fault but by that noble girl's mistaken generosity and now that i have lost her i must by all means find her she must be mine for ever aurelia had recovered her colour and self possession she was now also very angry tapping her foot and breathing fast she looked disdainfully at me and reproachfully but she said with scorn but what i am to think of you don francis do you purpose to spend your life seeking ladies whom you have compromised no sooner have you lost me than you look for another and when you find your wife as you choose to call her if you are so fortunate shall you treat her as you have treated me i hope so said i my first duty will be to ask her forgiveness my second to convince her of my repentance my third oh spare me your thirdly said aurelia drily i have no doubt what your third duty will be and i am sure you will perform it admirably she grew red tears gathered in her eyes she stamped her foot vexatious boy she cried out i wish to heaven i had never seen you you loved me once but i was not ready now that i am what i am you are not ready i did you a wrong i was a villain a great terror struck me god have mercy upon me i cried aurelia is it possible is it possible that you she came very near me so near that her quick breath fanned my face so near that i could distinguish her heart beats she took my hands tried to draw me to her yes yes it is possible it is possible it is certain it is true i love you i need you i will follow you across the world do you think me bold judge then of my need do you suppose such a confession easy to a woman or lightly made do you think me a bad woman i shall not deny it but i shall add to your judgment that i am a loving one ah there was a time she said bitterly for she saw my dismay there was a time when you prayed me to love you and i refused if then i had agreed would you have gone white and red by turns would you have averted your eyes would you have looked on the ground she took me in her eager arms she clung to me she strove panted for a kiss to me to me francis you loved me first you taught me i am yours by right of conquest here i am on your breast the forgiving the longing aurelia i cannot express what i felt during this scene painful as it was to me to know myself unaffected by it it was exquisite grief to me to have her unqueen herself before my eyes o aurelia to stoop from thy celestial commerce to barter for a kiss i know not what i said nor can remember exactly what it was that i did i was i trust gentle with her i disengaged myself without abruptness and led her to a seat i said nothing but when she was more at ease within herself i knelt before her kissed her hand respectfully and left her it was i am sure a case where fewest words were best i believe that she was weeping i know that i was going out of the villa gates into the street i was aware of a cloaked figure standing at the first corner towards florence evidently upon the watch for me the moment i was clear of the gate he came to meet me and i saw that he was followed by another muffled man and that both carried swords i kept my course however as if they were no concern of mine and made room for them to pass me on the side of the wall but the first of them stopped in front of me a fine night don francis he said it was count giraldi chapter xliv i confront my enemies i could not see his face for besides that it was now very dark he kept his cloak up and had pulled his hat downwards over his brow but his voice was perfectly familiar his companion was similarly muffled i did not then recognise him i saluted the count and admitted the fineness of the night it seemed to me that he had more to say and he had i have wished a little conversation with you don francis he said shall we walk together you are returning to your lodging after an interview which to judge from its duration must have been pleasant my dear count said i donna aurelia as you know is an old friend of mine we had much to say i will walk with you by all means but your friend here he laughed my friend will not disturb us let me make two gentlemen acquainted who should know each other at least by name marchese let me present you to my friend mr francis strelley don francis be pleased to salute the illustrious marchese semifonte i began to smell mischief indeed i had smelt it already i knew that the count was no longer my friend and as for semifonte no doubt he would murder me if he durst here then were these two worthies in league and waiting for me in a lonely place lucky that i had my sword in the meantime semifonte raised his hat and bowed i returned the salutation and said that i had had the advantage of meeting his lordship already to that he made no reply we then walked on together i on the inside next to me the count the marchese on the outside the count began by congratulating me upon my escape from florence and from what might have been a most awkward affair luckily for me he added i was out of the city at the time or between my duty and my inclination i should have found myself in a dilemma to that i replied that it was sufficient for me to be sure that he had been absent if i had known that donna aurelia was still in the villa san giorgio i went on at the time when i was hiding from your excellency's servants i believe i should have pushed my importunities so far as her door you would have asked donna aurelia to interest herself in the cause of your charming your too charming i could not see his face but could have sworn that he was showing his teeth not at all count i said not at all but i should have asked the grand duke's principal minister to remember that he had betrayed an innocent girl's whereabouts to those who sought her ruin and to give fair play to him who had risked his life to protect her you wrong me sir he said warmly you accuse me of treachery of that i am incapable as for my distinguished friend here let your distinguished friend deny that he purchased virginia strozzi from her parents i retorted that he has sought her ever since that he sent palamone to murder me that he still intends some mischief let him deny these things and i speak no more of them the marchese said not a word the count took up the tale let me in my turn trouble you with a few denials i do not deny that donna aurelia was in florence earlier than you supposed nor that i kept you in ignorance of it it was judged better on all accounts father carnesecchi was of that opinion i believe that the lady had no desire to see you perhaps you will pardon my franchise when i say that it would have been singular if she had she desired to be accommodated with her husband and that was done my part in that affair which i am very ready to defend need not concern you though if i remember rightly you professed yourself anxious on that account now for my denials i deny flatly that i did any service to my distinguished friend at your expense i deny it point blank and i deny that when not for the first time you took the law into your own hands i purposely removed myself from the city that suspicion of yours is not worth so many words what should my purpose be what object could i have why should i become your enemy that sir i said is what i intend to find out be so good as to add these to your denials if you can will you deny that you witnessed the performance of the donne furlane in siena on the occasion of the grand duke's birthday last year he said i remember it and a remarkable performance it was and did you see it in company of donna aurelia i did and did you give yourself the pain to send officers to arrest an actor called de' pazzi he was silent i said then and did you not know that i was that actor now count giraldi since you cannot deny these facts i will ask you why you are my enemy for you are not a man who acts without reason we were upon the river bank a little short of the rubiconte bridge the water rippled languidly over the muddy reaches but the rush of the weir was audible not another sound was to be heard not a soul was in sight we three stopped i was facing the two men my back to the low river wall i heard giraldi's breath come short and whistling through his fine nose i heard semifonte breathing through his mouth shorter breaths he was panting count giraldi spoke using great command of himself measuring his words i think i will tell you the facts he said i think that will be best you can then judge my actions and as a reasonable man govern your own by them man of the world as i am he continued i must confess that you surprised me upon our first acquaintance i could not tell whether i was consorting with a very refined profligate or forgive me a very singular fool you came into the city in search as you told me of a lady with whom you had had an abortive affair but you came in company with an attractive person in a relationship with her which could only bear one interpretation no no you must hear me out if you please he said peremptorily stopping my protest before it could be framed in words upon your representations i interested myself in donna aurelia i judged her attractive by your report i found that your discernment was even better than i had expected she came to the convent in some distress i saw her she was charming she charmed me she was in a chastened mood subdued softly melancholy i believe indeed i know that she had a tenderness for you well i was prepared to be loyal no one is to say in my presence that i am a false friend i was loyal until pest cried he what did i find i found that while you professed the most extravagant regard for the lady you asked nothing better for yourself than that she should return to the arms of her horrible old spouse i found also that you had recovered possession of your straight young contadina by means which were more ingenious than lawful that she was in your lodgings your friend your semifonte here gave a harsh guttural cry giraldi spoke to him in an undertone then resumed you may remember my interest in that young woman's appearance and manner when i chanced to find her in your lodgings in the dress of a fine lady you remember that you then told me her history believe me when i say that i did not tell my illustrious friend here of the adventure he was told it is true but not by me if it will satisfy you i will take my oath to that i had no intention of depriving you of your mistress far from it that would have destroyed my particular object which i will now confess was to take your place in donna aurelia's regard for which you would not ask i own also that i did not care to have you in her neighbourhood and that i very much desired to get rid of you why because i could see that donna aurelia was in love with you he paused while i admired his affectation of candour presently he went on when my friend here proposed to secure your mistress by means of the capuchin i gave him a free hand that is to say i gave you no warning i admit that why again because i knew you don francis and was certain that you would never allow a hand to be laid upon her i was right you did not you did precisely what i desired you as good as killed the capuchin and you went into hiding i wished to keep you there and so i did if i had not sent carabineers into the piazza if i had been accessible to your messengers you would have been fatally in my way you were never in danger of arrest or imprisonment but you believed that you were and that served my purpose you left our state all was well until you entered it again i admit that when i saw you in siena i was in donna aurelia's company and feared the effect of your apparition upon her she did not recognise you but i did i confess that i had you arrested and assure you that you would never have gone to volterra but to leghorn you would have been placed upon an english ship and sent to your own country where your peculiar qualities would have had freer play lastly i admit that i was vexed at your reappearance here in circumstances of prosperity which forbade my touching you i admit that i have resented this late visit of yours to donna aurelia and am still smarting at the length of it ridiculous but so it is i know that she has a feeling for you i am not secure i wish you to go you are really unconscionable you must let me say you have deprived the marchese of a possible mistress and now you seem inclined to deprive me of an actual mistress you are exorbitant my young sir stop there count giraldi i said in a voice which i myself hardly knew for my own stop there repeat your last words you say that i am for robbing you of what donna aurelia said he deliberately has done me great honour i am her accepted cavalier she has accorded me the highest favour she occupies my villa the doctor is my humble servant you will not wish me to enlarge upon this you are a liar i said you are a liar and struck him full in the face with my open hand his white face was nearly all i could see of him he recoiled he had not expected it i am sure at that moment before he could recover his self possession semifonte gave another hoarse cry and leapt at me with a dagger i caught him under the arm pit closed with him and threw him easily his back gave at the first jerk there was no strength in him and when he was on the ground i disarmed him with ease and bade him lie still i put my foot upon his neck and drew my sword if you stir assassin i shall run you through i said now count giraldi i am at your service you are bolder than i thought and readier the count said but you have gone too far and i shall meet you as soon as you please i don't know whether you believe that this has been part of my plan or whether you care to hear me deny it if you believe me a liar you can easily believe me assassin also i will bid you good night don francis we know where to find each other i told him that my friend mr robert malcolm of the english legation would receive any friend of his at any hour the sooner the better he went away i removed my foot from the marchese's neck and told him to get up you see my lord what your friend thinks of you by the way he has disavowed your performance and left you in the mud i said give yourself the trouble to go to your own house i gave him the road and waited while he walked swiftly away i incline to believe that he was mad this miserable man he said nothing not one word but did exactly as he was told i could barely make out the outline of him in the darkness and could not see his eyes i know that they were white and scared chapter xlv the meeting bob malcolm came to see me early in the morning with news that the count's cartel had been delivered in form he told me that i might as well fight the grand duke for if you kill frank if you kill says he you'll be in a fortress for life and if you don't kill why then you're a dead man body of a dog as they say here you're a dead man either way good bob was much put about i did my best to hearten him i said that i would take the risk of volterra as i had taken it before and should do my best to kill the count he was i said a lying blasphemer whose death would be an act of justice malcolm whistled this is a devilish sharp set affair says he for that is just how the marchese put his man's frame of mind he stipulates it seems that you fight to the death look out for him too frank he added he is dangerous i never liked him and to day he looked like a sick wolf who is your marchese i asked without interest semifonte says bob and as mad as a march hare i got up at once i said i shall kill count giraldi we met in the cascine at six o'clock of a foggy morning the light bad the ground heavy from a night's rain the marchese wore black i remember and looked horrible a wan doomed face a mouth drawn down at one corner a slavered untidy red beard and those wide fish eyes of his which seemed to see nothing count giraldi bore himself gallantly as he always did i was extremely cool we stripped and faced each other the swords were produced and measured we saluted and the count at once began a furious attack i think that on any ordinary occasion he would have proved the better man he was fully as strong as myself and as good in the wind for he lived temperately and he had had more experience but to day as i soon discovered he was flurried and made mistakes twice in the first five minutes i could have disarmed him and once i very nearly had his life he was foolhardy to an extraordinary degree his eyes were unsteady it seemed to me that he was thinking of something else and before we had been long engaged i discovered that he was thinking of two things the first his own certain death the second the state of mind of the marchese semifonte my finding out of the second of these made me resolute to bring about the first of them otherwise so wildly was he at work i don't believe i could have brought myself to kill such a tyro as he was proving the fact which determined me to kill him was this i had pushed him vigorously after parrying with ease half a dozen of his frenzied attacks i had pushed him and he had given ground as usual but although i did not perceive it at the time in giving way he had worked back towards his second who had not budged so that as i advanced i got to be actually within wounding distance of the marchese bob malcolm ought to have knocked our swords up no doubt but he did not in the full tide of my attack then when i had my man almost at my mercy i felt a sudden and sharp pain in the side and at the same moment heard malcolm's cry ah bloody villain none of that almost immediately i heard the clash of swords and turning my head for a moment saw our seconds engaged in that same instant of forgetfulness giraldi was upon me lunged furiously and ran his blade through my sword arm there was an assassination planned and nearly achieved red rage now possessed me i do not believe an angelic messenger could have stopped me now changing my sword hand i attacked my man who ran lightly back to avoid me i pursued him i closed with him we had a desperate rally for perhaps a minute and a half i know that i pinked him twice for i saw the blood on his shirt in another few seconds i had his sword flying out of his hand and himself his full length on the sward there then lay this shameful enemy traducer of ladies treacherous friend hirer of murderers why should i spare him i did not intend it i went up to him fully prepared to deal death upon him fallen though he were at that moment i thought that no power of earth or heaven could have saved his life and yet there was one power which could and did the power of aurelia's name his pocket handkerchief was stuck in his waistband and as i stood above him full of meditated and most reasonable murder i happened to see upon it in red letters his cipher a coronet and under that the initials of his name amadeo giraldi they struck me like the writing on the wall as if they had been letters of fire a g i read there the letters of aurelia's virgin name a g aurelia gualandi untried maiden of siena once innocent of all the evil that men could devise against her unsullied rose dropped from the lap of mary the mother of us all could i dare could i indeed dare to slay one who bore though shamefully those letters of hers whose perfection i was here to maintain i knew that i could not i lowered my sword i looked at him where he lay perfectly still calm now with his black eyes fixed upon mine i said i hope that you are prepared for justice count giraldi at my hands he replied with a smile i am prepared for anything my dear sir least of all perhaps for justice at this moment it is what you least deserve i said since it is what you practise least but there are circumstances at work in your favour you must however confess yourself a liar that is indispensable come now what do you say at this moment malcolm came back with a red sword i have paid him in his own coin he said but i think we had best be off go my dear malcolm i told him do not delay a moment i shall not leave florence in any case are you mad my dear he cried i said that i had no notion whether i was mad or not but that i had work to do in florence and intended to finish it i persuaded him at last to get away to lucca at once where i hoped to join him the doctor came up to report semifonte quite dead i returned to the count who said to me every man over forty is and must be a liar since in a sense his very existence is a lie if it will satisfy you i will assure you that i am over forty i accepted that periphrasis and now i said i will tell you to whom you owe your life it is to that lady whom you have dared to traduce to her and no other i gather that you will not repeat your slander i promise you that sir said he but i am curious to learn how donna aurelia can have interceded her name in maidenhood i said was aurelia gualandi there upon your handkerchief i read her initials 'a g' the handkerchief is my own i swear it he cried with passion will you make the merest coincidence accuse her again shame upon you sir never in the world said i i never doubted but it was your own the cipher saved you not the handkerchief i suppose that he was too faint by now to understand me for he only put his hand up and shook it to and fro exquisite fool i heard him say and then with a groan gesu i die he fainted in earnest i helped the surgeon carry him to his coach then walked to my lodging leaving the marchese astare at the trees chapter xlvi the discovery i was to dine that night with the prior of saint mark's a former acquaintance of mine and i kept my engagement though i left the party early my wound which was painful but not dangerous was not the cause of that the fact is that i was arrested while we were sitting over our fruit and wine at a moment when i was enunciating a favourite theory of mine that this world is a garden for every man alive of us who happens to be a gardener and for no other and that he only is a gardener who lives for the joy of his labour and not for the material profit he can make out of his toil the grand inquisitor that pock marked dominican who had treated me with uncharitable harshness upon my first visit to florence was present at table and was upon the point of denouncing my argument as perverse unchristian and i know not what else he had said it is my deliberate opinion that detestable beliefs as are atheism calvinism mahometanism and the tenets of the quietists it were better for a man to embrace all of them in one vast comprehensive blasphemy than depend for their refutation upon any argument which mr strelley can advance when a friar opened the door and ushered in a lieutenant of police and his guard the officer saluted the company in general and myself in particular sir he said politely to me i have the honour to arrest you in the grand duke's name for the barbarous murder of the most illustrious marchese deifobo semifonte for the attempted murder of his excellency count amadeo giraldi and for contravention of the law of duelling by express command of the syndic i am to put your honour in irons corporal do your duty i said nothing in reply but took leave of my host with all the proper form of society assuring him that i should take with me whithersover i went a grateful memory of his beautiful and peaceful retirement i bowed to my fellow guest and then suffered the corporal to chain my hands behind me a coach was awaiting me at the gate i entered it with the lieutenant and was driven to the bargello i was not ill treated by any means i had a small but decent chamber assigned to me and i was alone when i demanded that my accusation should be read over in order that i might engage a lawyer for my defence i was assured that this would not be at all necessary as there would be no trial in that case i begged them to leave me to repose and meditation which they were so good as to do i had an excellent night's rest and was very ready for my chocolate at eight o'clock in the morning whilst i was sipping this expecting every moment the arrival of my servant with my clothes clean linen letters and a barber i heard the key turn in the lock and made sure that it was federigo but the warder introduced a muffled figure of a woman who when he had retired came quickly towards me as if she was about to stab me miserable young man she said fiercely it was aurelia i sprang up took saluted her hand madam i said this is a condescension which i am far from deserving i have done nothing but my duty her eyes were very bright and she was distressed for breath but there was an intensity in her manner a fire a flame which made her vehement your duty indeed she cried when may i expect you to find your duty elsewhere than in my affairs am i never to have paid off my original debt to your lordship it is not enough it appears that you make love to me but you must tell my husband all about it it is not enough that he drives me out of doors and that you refuse to come with me no but you must wander about by yourself telling all the world what you have done it is not enough that you make me love you but you must needs intrigue with a low born girl a thing of naught and now finally you come galloping into florence again and you you oh heavens i have no patience left to speak of such things how did you dare she stamped her foot furiously her cheeks were flame red how did you dare do such deeds you have killed the marchese dead you have given count amadeo three dangerous wounds and a fever you are in every mouth and not you only you wicked boy but myself and my husband and and she wrung her hands she shook with anger but at last she was silent i ventured to say that she did me wrong though any wrong she did me would be benevolence compared to my trespasses against her i said that i had not killed the marchese who on the contrary had done his best to murder me twice and that as for the count who had slandered her vilely and deserved a felon's death i had spared his life upon his retractation of his calumny i hope i said in conclusion that he told you to whom he actually owed his life he did sir said she haughtily he told me that you had been very absurd and had made him feel a fool which he did not at all relish oh oh oh she broke out with a little burst of laughter how could you be so mad as to spare him for his pocket handkerchief for a reason madam i said which does not amuse me at all nor should it she agreed that was a serious thing that you did checho it was more serious than you seem to suppose the wounds in his person are nothing compared to what you did beside he is a proud man and you have wounded his vanity i doubt if he will ever be healed of that stroke do you know what he said to me just now she was perfectly friendly now by my side almost touching me with her quick beautiful hands with what seemed to me a levity no longer becoming the woman she was grown to be she talked of serious things with sparkling eyes and would give me confidences which she had received from an impudent liar in reply to her question i shook my head i could not speak to her just then nor could i look at her she told me her story count amadeo said to me this morning 'my friend the fact that i owe you this preposterous debt of initials makes it more than doubtful whether i can ever endure to pay it off i could have had no objection to stand indebted to don francis for my life but i am a man of honour with a name which i have some reason to value and i assure you that it is not tolerable to me that i should owe its continuance in my person to the fact that my mistress's maiden name began with the same letters' he said also but i had caught her by the arm no more i cried no more o god she was alarmed you are ill you are ill checho i said i stand at a death bed love lies dying down there hush we should be on our knees she was now weeping bitterly o lasso o lasso what have i done to you i fought in your honour madam i said commanding myself i dared a murder in your defence i would have stormed hell's ramparts and put the baleful city to the sword in the same cause from that accursed day on which i first saw you until now i have held you high before my face as the glory of womanhood and now you repeat the slander for which that monster lay at my mercy you repeat it you allowed him to say it in your ear she was pale her eyes were wide but she did not retreat but she said but it is true checho it is true what he said to you was true and now she frowned as she pondered out what was to come clouds gathered over her beautiful soulless face she folded her arms clenched her teeth and stormed at me you fool you fool you fool she said fiercely panting for breath with which to end me oh you dream child you moonraker what are you doing in a world where men work for their pleasures and women have to cringe for the scraps what was i to do when porfirio shut me out of doors and you you who had caused it refused to come with me was i to spread my wings and fly straight into the lap of the madonna you would say so i suppose your flights were very fine but one cannot live on the wind any man but a poet would have picked me up at the door and taken care of me with a 'come my beloved we will fly together' but no you were making eyes at the stars and protesting that two of them were my eyes and the moon my forehead and then o dio and then when you found me again in florence what did you do i was at my wit's ends and you kissed my hands there that was all all all on the word of a christian did i not try to get more from you any one but a poet would know that i did i heard your long poems i touched you i ran to meet you i was kind i was cross i called you to me and then turned my back upon you and then i found out sir what your baciar di mani and bowings and reverences were worth they were worth myself you had your virginia snug at home in a brocaded gown and a fan my word do you think i could not guess the truth of your story about her her honour indeed what have such rubbish to do with honour a virginia a baggage for your arms and i to have my hand kissed and to yawn over dreary verses by the madonna but i did my best to stop that play let me tell you don francis that it was i i i she struck her bosom with each naming of herself who told semifonte where he could lay hands upon his chattel you believed it was the count it was i quivering breathing fire and anger beautiful as a goddess and wicked as a fiend what was i to say to this terrible witness she had stayed for lack of breath panting tapping her foot her bosom heaving like the sea under her close arms and i was face to face with her alone with ruin between us so with a stamp of her little foot so with a flick of the fingers it seems she had broken her own image and killed love outright there and then love died and his funeral knell was the horrid barking laughter with which i greeted this end of her story madam i said when i had laughed hatefully and long i have robbed you of a lover and you in return have robbed me of my love you ought to be as much obliged to me as i am to you she scowled at me darkly i think she would have stabbed me gladly but just then the warder entered with my servant and an official from the palace this latter with a profound salutation handed me a letter from the count asking leave i opened it and read as follows my dear don francis i have just learned with concern that you are in prison upon two charges one false and another which is trumpery i hasten to assure you that orders have been given which will satisfy your sense of justice and i hope improve your opinion of myself i believe that by this time you will have been assured that it was not i who betrayed your confidences to semifonte who between you and me has got his deserts or according to the orthodox must now be getting them as for my more recent offence the real ground of our little encounter i can assure you of this that if i ever make any such assertion again and you again call me a liar i shall not resent it for a liar i shall be i kiss your hands and am with the most perfect esteem my dear don francis your most obedient faithful humble servant count amadeo giraldi p s it may be discreet in you to repair to lucca for the summer heats pray command me in any occasion you may have my doors were set open the first use i made of my freedom was to escort donna aurelia to her chair without a word spoken between us i handed her in and shut to the door the chairman asked me for a direction to the house of dr lanfranchi the learned judge i said chapter xlvii the final proof free in every sense of the term free of prison free of debt for if aurelia had paid me i had now paid her husband free of every obligation but guilt i was all on fire for lucca and that service which is perfect freedom voluntary bondage to virginia whom i could now love whole heartedly as she deserved artemis artemis chaster than a fire what wonder is it that she had prevailed in that dream strife which i had witnessed in the villa garden what wonder when she had to contend with the soiled wife of a vile man with aurelia the lovely caressing silken woman bought by a place bought by a house who possessed by two men sought yet another ah thou glowing honey tongued unhappy one in what a horrible web of affairs was i enmeshed along with thee what a world was that into which i went ruffling with my money and rank and fine prospects never more never more would i enter that world of bargain and sale so i swore and so purposed but in pursuance of a plan which i had formed in my most private mind i travelled to lucca in a coach and four horses with postillions before and my body servant behind on this occasion i was furnished with a passport and abundance of money all my property in florence all my household gear had been transferred to the city of my choice i left behind me in florence not one vestige of myself and so far as i know not one true friend i intended to be two days upon the road and lay the night at empoli early on the following morning a fine day in early autumn i departed from the inn for my final stage and fared without incident as far as ponte a cappiano before the hill of altopascio is reached the traveller must accomplish a lonely stretch of road which runs for some three miles through a ragged wood this place bears a bad name it is debatable land as we say between the republic of lucca and the grand duchy and a well known haunt for footpads highwaymen outlaws and other kinds of cut throat so at least my servant said when stopping the carriage i got out and proposed to walk through the wood by a direct path and meet my conveyance at the top of the pass he begged me very earnestly to do nothing of the kind the road is the only tolerable way for your lordship he assured me and then with a start he added hark sir hark as i live by bread we are pursued even now i listened and could hear a long way off the regular pounding of a horse however i paid no more attention to that than to see to the priming of my pistols i had been near death too often of late to stand on any ceremony with it and there are times in life when one can see beyond it i had a certainty that i should not die until i had found virginia therefore i dismissed the carriage and walked on now and again as i entered more deeply into the thicket i caught the sound of hoofs but i soon grew to disregard them and presently forgot their menace altogether this wood of holm oak holly and beech for the most part rises and dips twice before it climbs the final ascent to the crown above altopascio a cart track runs through it deeply rutted and always miry on either hand of which glades are revealed of great beauty here if the trees are remote the grass grows lush and green hereabouts are the flowers tall and plenty foxgloves and mullein such as we have at home and loosestrife lysimachia both the yellow and the purple the sun shone brilliantly between the leaves the air was sweetly tempered the wood was empty i felt exalted as i always do when i am alone i was hopeful i was still young god methought was about to bless me abundantly after making stern trial of me my secret thought ran rhythmically in my head i walked briskly up the first slope surmounted it and stood looking down upon a scene more charming than that which i was about to leave a deeper greener glade with a clearing in the midst and a rude gipsy tent and a little fire and two persons beside it as i stood looking i heard the crackling of the brushwood and dead twigs behind me the horseman whoever he was had entered the wood and was following the track but the encampment below me engrossed all my eyes in that windless hollow a thin spire of smoke rose blue towards the blue an iron pot was suspended on three poles the smoke hugged it closely united above it and rose in a column the couple a young man and woman sat still watching it their meal was ended i judged and they were summoning resolution for the road the woman with a pretty weary gesture put her head upon the man's shoulder he embraced her with his arm bent his head and kissed her stooping yet lower he kissed her lap i saw that she had a child asleep there just then both of them heard as i did the horse's hoof strike on a stone they both started and looked up towards me my heart stood still my tongue clove to the roof of my mouth those two were belviso and virginia and the child the child in a flash of instantaneous reflection i remembered that a year ago belviso had gone to lucca to find virginia had reported her to me as not there and at arezzo had asked leave to seek her again oh monstrous thought oh monstrous thinker francis but i was incapable of justice or reason i thought here to see the mockery of god and i who imagined so wickedly went on to deal wickedness i strode down the hill upon them without a word my eyes blazing like coals both recognised me at the same moment virginia stood up holding her child close to her but never budged belviso cried master and started towards me when he saw with what countenance i was coming he faltered and stood ill at ease in my blind fury i put this down to his guilt good god what more did i meditate oh horrible i stopped and cocked my pistol ah false wife once i said terribly and now false mistress traitress with this traitor whom i believed my friend belviso here gave a cry and held up his hand he was looking not at me but behind me to the slope down which i had come master beware beware he called out in his ringing young voice palamone is behind you treachery indeed i turned and saw that he spoke the truth fra palamone booted and spurred with a huge black cloak flagging about him was close upon me walking his horse tenderly down the hill his face was distorted with a grin there was a light scared look in one of his eyes whose brow was lifted more than the other if ever appearance foretold mischief that did his he saw that i was armed no doubt for he reined up out of shooting distance bowed to me and spoke my name i asked him what he wanted a little talk if you please don francis he said in his blandest tone a little friendly talk you rascal said i a cudgelling was the upshot of your last do you want another have you earned it yet god do so unto me if i meditate any harm to your excellency said the old villain upon christ's life and death i can do you a service at last and so i will know first of all that the most charitable deed you ever did in your life was to break your cane over my wicked body yes yes i tell you truly you saved a soul that day and i care not who knows it sir sir said he earnestly i am here not only to thank you for having restored me my soul but to give you a letter which will restore you your wife and tell you the whole truth about her into the bargain who wrote your letter i asked him and he told me one who knows miriam the jewess i am to confess that he deceived me again i was fool enough to believe that he could explain to me the guilty history of these two persons behind me these two and their child we believe what we desire to believe whether it be of good or evil report i bade him give me his letter he dismounted and came towards me fumbling in his cloak 'tis here he was muttering to himself no no that is my pardon from his holiness ah what have we here nay 'tis my certificate of communion how how have i lost it grumbling and mumbling grating his loose tooth he was close upon me his hand deep in his cloak ha ha he suddenly cried now i have it and whipped out his hand belviso shrieked my name aloud francis my lord and king and flung himself upon my breast there was a shocking report of a pistol discharged close at hand belviso shuddered and fell limp a dead weight i raised my arm levelled and shot palamone through the head we picked up the lifeless form of that lad whom i had once loved for his love of me and laid him by the fire virginia knelt beside him pale and tearless pale stern and tearless also i stood above him my weapon still reeking in my hand woman said i hoarsely would that i had fired that shot do you dare to say that he has not got his deserts she did not answer me she was busy with the dead she opened his jacket and vest and put her hand below his shirt to feel if his heart yet fluttered then she lifted to me a stern pure face his deserts my lord say you come kneel you by me and see whether he have them or no some impulse i know not what made me obey i kneeled down by virginia she opened reverently the clothing of belviso laid back the vest laid back the cotton shirt wonder terror a flood of shame came scalding into my eyes i had looked upon but now could not see the young breasts of a girl my proof had turned to my reproof i was humbled to the dust poor child said virginia very softly poor sinner who died to save him that had once saved thee i pray to god that thou knowest now how innocently he did thee this wrong she stooped and kissed the cold lips but i fell upon the cold bosom and wept bitterly she let me sob my full not until i was calmer did the noble girl touch me upon the shoulder and call me by my name francis she said do not reproach yourself any more this poor soul has done what she must in any case have done her heart was yours and yours she knew could never have been given her she was loyal to you through all and deceived you through loyalty she is repaid in the only coin she could have asked god have her soul footnote belviso's tragic masquerade was not at all uncommon in italy at the time of which i write if a girl were desirous of becoming a comedian she must unless her talents were extraordinary appear to be a male the salaries of women to begin with were high and out of the reach of poor companies of players and secondly as i have said in the text some states such as the roman forbade the appearance of women upon the scene women's parts therefore would be taken by castrati or boys whose sex it was necessary for a woman to assume there was another reason which i fondly believe induced belviso to adopt that name and appearance a woman appearing as such must be morally ruined i never heard of an exception to the rule belviso's real name was geronima sastre and she was a native of the trentino f a s i looked up at my beloved now at last my entirely beloved wife bare as she was her neck bare of covering her finger of the ring she was my wife before god and the angels i rose and faced her she met my looks without flinching in her eyes was no shame the child lay sleeping in her shawl my heart beat high i lifted up my face to the sky and laughed aloud o god o god thou hast redeemed me i cried then to virginia i said this child of thine it is thine said virginia my arms embraced both mother and babe but with a hand i took her by the chin she turned her face to me and with her clear eyes searched my face it is ours she said and blushed and i am yours my virginia i said and stooped to her our lips met and stayed together we kissed long drinking the joy of one another the fool would err no more chapter xlviii the last here belviso lies who died to save his friend under this superscription we consigned to the dust the dust of our dear benefactor and that reverently done we settled ourselves in lucca where we have remained ever since where i have written these pages where i intend to live and die of my true marriage with my beloved expect no raptures in this place seek no further ask no more this is holy ground in all these years wherein she has been spared to be my well of bliss my fountain of nourishment my stem of solace i declare with my hand on my heart never for one moment did she cease to be my loving willing chaste and discerning wife we have been poor for i renounced my inheritance in favour of my next brother retaining nothing of it and began the world again where i left it when i was driven from lucca by misfortunes and by industry and thrift we have risen to a competence enough to educate our children according to the degree marked out by their birth i did this deliberately having found out by hard experience that money was the bondslave of lust and rank the breastplate of inanity had i taken my wife to england i must have retained my wretched panoply but england also i renounced and that also deliberately i shall take leave to close my relation with a few words upon my choice of life it has been said with truth and reason that our vices are but the excrescences of our virtuous essence if i am justly to be called a fool then and my folly a vice it is because it has ever been a ruling need of my nature to be naked and to desire to deal nakedly with my neighbours who to serve my ends must themselves be unclad let the light scoffer understand me i speak of the soul and of spiritual and moral matters all my good fortune and i have had much was due to my ability to indulge that spiritual urgency of mine and to my having been dealt with as i desired to deal all my troubles and they were not few were bruises inflicted upon my simple soul by others who opposed their mail clad might to my tenderness not once but many times in the course of this narration i have had occasion to show how the poor the outcast the forsaken and the very young entreated me as one must suppose the saviour of us all his divine mother and the guardian angels would entreat each other or us the proud the greatly circumstanced the rich the enclosed the sitters in chief seats wounded me shocked rebuffed cast me down but in this land the genius of the place delights only to dwell in the hearts of the poor they are the true tuscan nations and in spite of governments they remain the salt of the earth and the heirs of all that is good in it in england it is not so there the poor are serfs there feudalism forbids intercourse there the weak suspect and rightly the benevolence of the strong and the strong can only be benevolent in proportion as they are weak consider for a moment what flows from these axiomata it will result i think that honour religion and love the three fortresses of the human soul will be found deeply involved with them honour as i understand it consists in the nice adjustment of what is due to me from my neighbours and to them from me here among the poor where a native reserve has not grown as a fungus upon it a native cant where there is no desire to seem better than one is and no belief that one is so by seeming here i say among the tuscan poor there is never any difficulty for here there is no excrescence to the substantial quality of the soul but precisely to the contrary there is if anything a denudation the fault of the tuscans is perhaps a carelessness of opinion and an ignorance of it and springing from that a lack of reserve which occasionally approaches the shocking be this as it may here it is possible for man to envisage man each as he really is and can be discerned to be in england it is not so honour is an artificial manufactured thing depending upon accepted volunteered relationships what is due from me to my lord differs from that which his lordship owes to me so in any traffic between me and my valet or my valet and the kitchen boy so also it is with religion the englishman dare not even strip before his god but will bear his garter or his worsted braid his cocked or cockaded hat his sword or his dung fork up to the very sanctuary rails lest forsooth by leaving them at home he should either seem so poor as to be without them or so rich as to be able to discard them but here what a difference not only is man naked before god but god stands naked before man the church is their common ground the church is their inn and the blessed table their market ordinary at this board god and man man and the saints meet as friends the sweetest intercourse possible on earth is not denied them they may be gossips god and man they may be lovers bosom friends is this not a hopeful estate for the tried and erring naturally affectionate soul i trow that it is and as with honour as with religion so with that child of the pair so with love boy and maid man and woman in this country stand as children hand in hand before their parent who is god hand in hand in seemly innocence naked without shame or underthought or afterthought they stray about the flowery meads their hearts are by chance enkindled each burns fire seeks the embrace of fire they touch they mingle they soar together wedded love which neither soars nor leaps like a furnace but glows steadily with equable and radiant heat wedded love ensues this passionate commingling but the pair remain what they were at first simple naked unashamed unshameful with all things displayed even to the very aspirations of the secret soul in blessed sympathy in union blessed and to be blessed such i say may be and indeed is the case with many honoured wedded pairs observed by me such i thank god has been my own lot since that day when after long tribulation i took virginia into my arms and held her to my breast but of that and of her i dare write no more judge me favourably reader for her sake and so farewell lucca october mr strelley lived i believe until the spring of and was buried behind the altar of san romano his house now a hospital is still intact and may be visited by the curious as it was by me m h

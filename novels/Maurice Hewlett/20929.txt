found a girl more winning in a tender sort than giovanna scarpa of verona at one and twenty fairhaired and flushed delicately shaped tall and pliant as she then was she had to suffer her hours of ill report but passes for near a saint now in consequence of certain miracles and theophanies done on her account which it is my business to declare before those she was considered if at all as a girl who would certainly have been married three years ago if dowries had not been of moment in the matter in a city of maids as pretty as they are modestwhich no one will deny verona to bethere may have been some whose charms in either kind were equal to hers while their estate was better in accord but the speculation is idle giovanna flower in the face as she was fit to be nosegay on any hearth posy for any mans breast sprang in a very lowly soil like a blossoming reed she shot up to her inches by adige and one forgot the muddy bed wondering at the slim grace of the shaft with its crown of yellow atop her hair waved about her like a flag she should have been planted in a castle instead giovanna the stately calm with her billowing line staid lips and candid grey eyes was to be seen on her knees by the green water most days of the week barearmed splashed to the neck bareheaded outatheels she rinsed and pommelled wrung and dipped again laughed chattered flung her hair to the wind her sweat to the water in line with a dozen other women below the ponte navi and if no one thought any the worse of her none unhappily thought any the betterat least in the way of marriage it is probable that no one thought of her at all giovanna was a beauty and a very good girl but she was a washerwoman for all that whose toil fed seven mouths her father was don urbano curate of santa toscana across the water this may very easily sound worse than it is in don urbanos day though a priest might not marry he might have a wifea faithful diligent companion that isto seethe his polenta air his linen and rear his children the church winked at her and so continued until the jesuits came to teach that winking was unbecoming but when can grande ii lorded in verona the jesuits did not and don urbano good easy man cared not who winked at his wife she gave him six children before she died of the seventh of whom the eldest was giovanna and the others in an orderly chain diminishing punctually by a year ran down to ferrantino a tattered shockheaded rascal of more inches than grace last of all the good drudge who had borne these and many other burdens for her master died also don urbano was never tired of saying how providential it was that she had held off her demise until giovanna was old enough to take her place the curate was fat and lazy very much interested in himself his stipend barely paid his shot at the fiore del marinajo under whose green bush he was mostly to be seen vanna had to roll up her sleeves bend her straight young back and knee the board by the ponte navi i have no doubt it did her good the work is healthy the air the sun the waterspray kissed her beauty ripe but she got no husband because she could save no dowry everything went to stay the seven crying mouths then on a day when half her twentyfirst year had run after the others old baldassare dardicozzo stayed on the bridge to rest from the burden of his packon a breezy march morning when the dust filled his eyes and the wind emptied him of breath baldassare had little enough to spare as it was so he dropped his load in the angle of the bridge with a smothered accidente or some such and leaned to watch the swollen water buffeted crosswise by the gusts or how the little mills amidstream dipped as they swam breasting the waves in so doing he became aware in quite a peculiar way of vanna scarpa baldassare was old redeyed stiff in the back possibly he was rheumatic certainly he was grumpy he had a long slit mouth which played him a cruel trick for by nature it smiled when by nature he was most melancholy smile it would and did however cutthroat he felt if you wanted to see him grin from ear to ear you would wait till he had had an ill days market then while sighs curses invocations of the saints or open hints to the devil came roaring from him that hilarious mouth of his invited you to share delights you had needs laugh with him and he cursing high and low beamed all over his face to make baldassare laugh became a stock periphrasis for the supreme degree of tragedy among his neighbours about this traitor mouth of his he had a dew of scrubby beard silvered black he had bushy eyebrows hands and arms covered with a black pelt he was a very hairy man also he was a very warm man as everybody knew with a hoard of florins under the flags of his oldclothes shop in the via stella having spat into the water many times rubbed his hands mopped his head and cursed most things under heaven and some in it master baldassare found himself watching the laundresses on the shore they were the usual shrill shrewd and laughing linethe trade seems to induce high mirthand as such no bait for the old merchant by ordinary but just now the sun and breeze together made a bright patch of them set them at a provoking flutter baldassare prickly with dust found them like their own cool linen hung out to dance itself dry in the wind most of all he noticed vanna whom he knew well enough because when she knelt upright she was taller and more wayward than the rest and because the wind made so plain the pretty figure she had she was very industrious but no less full of talk there seemed so much to say the pauses were frequent in which she straightened herself from the hips and turned to thrust chin and voice into the debate you saw then the sharp angle the fine line of light along that raised chin the charming turn of the neck her free young shoulders and shapely head also you marked her lively tones of ci and si and how her shaking finger drove them home the wind would catch her yellow hair sometimes and wind it across her bosom like a scarf or it streamed sideways like a long pennon or being caught by a gust from below sprayed out like a cloud of litten gold vanna always joined in the laugh at her mishap tossed her tresses back pinned them up both hands at the business and then with square shoulders and elbows stiff as rods set to working the dirt out of don urbanos surplice baldassare brooded chewing straws what a clear colour that girl had to be sure what a lissom rascal it was a fine long girl like that should be married by all accounts she would make a man a good wife if he were a dozen years the better of four and fifty he mightthen came a shrug and a ma to conclude in true veronese baldassares ruminations shrug and explosion signalled two stark facts baldassare was fiftyfour and vanna had no portion yet he remained watching on the bridge his chin buried in his knotty hands his little eyes blinking under stress of the inner fire he had so it befell that la testolina saw him and said something shrill and saucy to her neighbour the wind tossed him the tone but not the sense he saw the joke run crackling down the line all heads look brightly up the joke caught fire he saw the sungleam on a dozen perfect sets of teeth vannas head was up with the rest sooner up and the sooner down even from that height the little twinkling beacons from the bridge shot her through he saw her colour deepen head droop she was busy long before the others had wrung their joke dry soul of a cat grunted baldassare between his teeth what a rosy baggage it is he waited a little longer then deliberately passed the bridge rounded the pillar by the steps and went down to the women like a man who has made up his mind lizabetta of the roving eye caught the first hint of his shadow her elbow to nonnas ribs nonnas pst in ninas ear spread the news vannas cheeks flew the flag buon giorno ser baldassare shrilled la testolina plump and blackeyed leader of mischief giorno giorno la testolina growled the old man vanna very busy grew as red as a rose the others knelt back on their heels compliments of a homely sort flew about sped on by flashing teeth baldassares own were black as old channelposts in the lagoon but in tonguework he gave as sharp as he got then a wicked wind blew vannas hair like a whip across her throat fit to strangle her she had to face the day baldassare pondered her straight young back when vannas a nun shell have no more trouble with her hair quoth la testolina matchmaker by race when vannas a nun the river will be dry said vanna from between her elbows when vannas a nun the river on the contrary will be in flood this from baldassare hey whats this caterina cried and nonna pinched her arm adige will go crying that she comes no more to dip her arms said the old man with the utmost gravity and a broad grin the women screamed their delight slapped their knees or raised witnessing hands to heaven la testolina caught vanna round the waist and gave her a resounding kiss compliments my little vanna compliments her voice pealed like a trumpet vi ringrazio signore said vanna under her breath and la testolina held up a tress of her long hair to the light when vannas a nun you would bid for that eh baldassare i will bid for whatever she will sell me says he with a blink whereupon the matchmaker made no more music the scent was too hot for that yet for all his adventuring he got little reward she turned him no more than the round of her cheek vanna never stayed her work and he ordinarily a silent man paid no more complimentsyet ceased not to look going up the street at dinnertime he made his bid he limped by the tall girls side without speech from either but at the door he looked up queerly at her and pinched her ear go in and feed the youngsters my chuck said he i know where to meet don urbano and please madonna you shall feed your own before long yes ser baldassare says pretty vanna in a twitter the conference between the high contracting parties was wordy bristled with the gesticulations of two pair of hands and was commented on by all the guests in the fiore del marinajo the girl said don urbano was the very pride of his eye prop of his failing years a little mother to the children she had had a most pious bringingup never missed the rosary knew the little hours of the virgin could do sums with notches in a stick market like a jews housekeeper sew like a nun and make a stew against any wife in the contrada dowry dowry what did such a girl as that want with a dowry she was her own dowry by bacchus the thracian look at the shape of herwas that not a dowry the work she could do the pair of shoulders the deep chest the long legs she hadpick your dowry there my friends a young woman of her sort carried her dowry on her back in her two hands in her mouthah and in what she could put into yours by our lord rather it should be the other way what now was ser baldassare prepared to lay out upon such a piece of goods baldassare shivered grinned fearfully and shook his head many times money was money it was limited it bore its value in plain figures upon its face you knew where you were with money but you could get wives cheaper than ducats and find them cheaper value soul of a cat besides what was he a poor pedlar by his faith at this he spread out his arms and dropped them with a flop upon his knees the priest sat back in his chair and cast appealing looks at the rafters the company chuckled nudged each other guffawed baldassare was made to feel that he had overcoloured his case true he admitted he had a roof over his head shared fortune with the rats in that but look at the thing reasonably comrades vanna would make another to keep a girl of her inches must be an eater body of a dog had his reverence thought of that his reverence made a supreme effort held up one pudgy forefinger and with the other marked off two joints of it of mortadella so much he said of polenta so muchand he shut one fist of pasta so muchand he coupled the two fists and of wine by the soul of the world not enough to drown a flea i tell you baldassare he said finally emboldened by the merchants growing doubti tell you that you ask of me a treasure which i would not part with for a cardinals hat no indeed not to be bishop of verona throned and purfled on can grandes right hand will i consent to traffic my vanna eh sangue di sangue because i am a man of the church must i cease to be a man of bowels to have a yearning a tender spot here he prodded his cushioned ribs go you ser baldassare dardicozzo he cried rising grandly in his chairgo you you have mistaken your man the father stands up superb in the curates cassock and points the door to the chafferer of virgins the tavernroom on don urbanos side to a man beat the tables with their glasses baldassare had to surrender at discretion the bargain finally struck was written out by an obliging notary on the scoringslate in the name of the holy and undivided trinity it was declared to all men living and to be born that baldassare dardicozzo merchant of verona was obliged to pay to the reverend father in god urbano curate of santa toscana in the borgo san giorgio the sum of sixty florins veronese and two barrels of wine of val pulicella under condition that if within thirty days from those presents he did not lead in marriage giovanna daughter of the said reverend he should be bound to pay the sum of one hundred and twenty florins veronese and four barrels of wine of val pulicella the notary executed a monstrous flourish at the bottoma foliated cross rising out of steps on the last step he wrote his own name bartolo de thomasinis and then baldassare smiling as he should but feeling as he should not stuck his seal upon the swimming wax and made a cross with the stile like the foundations of a spiders web the affair was thus concluded before the thirty days were up vanna was taken to church by her father and taken from it by her new master within a week she appeared at the doorway of baldassares little shop very pretty very sedate quite the housewifeto sit there sewing and singing to herself from grey dawn to grey dusk ii tertium quid a year passed two years passed vanna was three and twenty no more round but no less blooming in face and figure still a reedy goldenhaired girl but baldassare was fiftyseven and there was no sign of issue the neighbours who had nudged each other at one season whose heads had wagged as their winks flew about now accepted the sterile mating as of the order of things pretty vanna mother as she had been to her brothers and sisters was to be a mother no more there was talk of may and december baldassare was advised to lock up other treasure beside his florins some indeed of the opposite camp gave hints none too honest to the forlorn young wife the piazza sant anastasia at the fallingin of the day for instance thus they put it all girlsand what else was vanna a wife in namewalked there arm in arm others walked there also she must know byandby some pretty lad an archer perhaps from the palace some roistering blade of a gentlemans lackey a friar or twinkling monk out for a frolic came along with an eh la bellina and then there was another arm at work so for one whispered la testolina dipping a head full of confidence and mystery close to vannas as the girl sat working out the summer twilight the via stella was narrow and gloomy the tall houses nearly met in that close way looking up you saw the two jagged edges of the eaves like great tattered wings spread towards each other when the green sky of evening deepened to blue and blue grew violet these shadowing wings were always in advance more densely dark there it was that vanna worked incessantly sewing seam after seam patching braiding and fitting the pieces by no chance at all did a hint of the sun fall about her yet she always sang softly to herself always wore her pretty fresh colours and still showed the gold sheen in her yellow hair her hair was put up now pulled smoothly back over her temples she spoke in a low sober measured voice and to la testolinas sly suggestions responded with a little blush a little shake of the head and a very little sigh ser baldassare is good to me she would say would you have me do him a wrong last friday he gave me a silver piece to spend in whatsoever i chose i bought a little holywater stoup with a gesulino upon it bowered in roses on sunday morning he patted my cheek and called me a good girl to say nothing of the many times he has pinched my ear all this was very kind as you must see with what do you ask me to reward him fie la testolina snorted and shrugged herself away vanna went on with her sewing and her little song giovanottin che te ne vai di fuora stattene allegro e cosi vo far io se ti trovassi qualche dama nuova lha da saper che tua dama son io so sang she innocently enough whose sweethearting went no farther than her artless lips there was not a spice of mischief in the girl what she had told la testolina had been no more than the truth master baldassare was good to herbetter than you would have believed possible in such a crabbed old stub of a man he was more of a father to her than ever don urbano had been to anything save his own belly but it was incontestable that he was not father to anything else that alone might have been a grievance for vanna but there is no evidence that it was baldassare was by nature gruff by habit closefisted like all such men the more he felt the deeper he hoarded the thought under his ribs the most he would venture would be a hand on her hair and a grunt when she did well so sure as she looked up gratefully at him the old man drew off with puckered brows and jaws working together he may have been ashamed of his weakness it is dead certain that no one in verona least of all vanna herself suspected him of any affection for his young wife mostly he was silent thus she became silent too whenever he was in the house this was against nature for by ordinary her little songs bubbled from her like a birds but to see him so glum and staring within doors awed her she set a finger to her lips as she felt the tune on her tongue and went about her business mute baldassare would go abroad stooping under his pack she took her seat at the shopdoor threaded her needle her fingers flew and her fancy with them the spring of her music was touched and all the neighbours grew to listen for the gentle cadences she made so passed a year so two years passed vanna was twentythree looking less when along there came one morning a tall young friar a carmelite by name fra battista with a pair of brown doves eyes in his smooth face these he lifted towards vannas with an air so timid and so penetrating so delicate and hardy at once that when he was gone it was to leave her with the falter of a verse in her mouth two hot cheeks and a quicker heart this fra battista by birth a bergamask accredited to the convent at verona by reason of his parts as a preacher was tall and shapely like a spoilt pretty boy to look at leggy and soft in the palm his frock set off this petted appearanceit gave you the idea of a pinafore on him he did not look manly was not manly by any means and yet not so girlish but that you could doubt his sex his eyes which as i say were soft as a doves pair he was not fond of showing and this gave them the more searching appeal when he did his mouth full and fleshy in the lips had a lovely curve he kept it very demure and when he spoke spoke softly this was a young man born to be lancilotto to some ginevra or other and to do him justice he had had his share of adventure in that sort at an early age he had learned more out of ovid than from the fathers of divinity you may believe very popular he was in whatsoever convent he harboured as a preacher famous all over lombardy and the marchin bergamo in brescia even as far as mantua he had been heard of the superior at verona did his best to spoil him by endearment flattery and indulgence but this was difficult since he had been spoilt already he passed down the via stella morning and evening for a week morning and evening his eyes encountered vannas the third evening he smiled at her the fourth morning he saluted her the fifth evening he stopped and slipped in a gentle word the first evening of the second week he stopped again and that night la testolina being by there was quite a little conversation la testolina had black eyes a trim figure and a way of wriggling which showed these to advantage fra battistas fame and the possibility of mischief set her flashing she led the talk and found him apt it was not difficult to aim every word that it should go through and leave a dart in vannas timid breast the girl was so artless you could see her quiver or feel her at every shot for instance was his sanctity very much fatigued by yesterdays sermon eh la bella predica what invocations of the saints what heartgroping what reachings after the better parts of women it was some comfort to know that a woman had a better part at allby the saviour for their handling by men gave no hint of it let fra beatoah pardon fra battista she should have saidsend some such arrows into mens hides see them for the grossfeeding surly spendall takeall knaves that they were one or two she might name if she had a mindah one or two in this very city of verona in this very street of the star whobut there vanna must go and hear the frates next sermon she must indeed and if she could take her old curm pshutt what was she saying how she ran on she did indeed fra battista leaning against the lintel kept his eyelids on the droop seemed to find his toes of interest but now and again he would look delicately up and so sure as he did the brown eyes and the grey seemed to swim towards each other to melt in a point swirl in an eddy of the feelings in which vanna found herself drowning and found such death sweet la testolina still ran on but now in a monologue fra battista looked and longed and vanna looked again and thrilled it grew quite dark nothing of each other could they see and little know until the friar put out his foot and found vannas a tremor beginning at her heart ran down to her toes battista felt the flutter of it and was assured when he left her that night he kissed her cold hand then la testolinas which he found by no means cold and moved off leisurely towards the piazza dell erbe neither woman spoke for a while la testolina was picking at her apron vanna sat quietly in the dark holding her heart she was still in a tremble so ridiculously moved that when her friend kissed her she burst out crying la testolina went nodding away and the end of the episode may be predicted not at one but at many sermons of the tall carmelite did vanna sit rapt not for one but for every dusk did he stoop to kiss her hand all verona saw her devotionall verona that is but one old veronese the essence of comedy being that the spectators shall chuckle at actors in a fog here was a comedy indeed iii the seed of discord when vanna announced her condition the neighbours looked slyly at each other when her condition announced vanna they chattered the gossip sank to whispering behind the hand as time went on and ceased altogether when the baby was born that was a signal for heads to shake some pitied the father many defended the mother it did not depend upon your sex sides were taken freely and voices were shrill when neither was by down by the river especially upon that bleached board below the bridge ci and si whistled like the wind in the chimneys and the hands of testimony were as the aspen leaves when storms are in some took one side some another but when in due season it was seen what inordinate pride baldassare had in the blackeyed bambino there was no question of sides he had ranked himself with the unforgivable party the old man was an old fool a gull whose power of swallow stirred disgust vanna had the rights of it they said such men were made to be tricked as for fra battistas pulpit it was thronged about with upturned faces for those who had not been before went now to judge what they would have done under the circumstances having been there were no two opinions about that messer gabriele arcangelo some said judging by the honeytongue san bastiano others considered him who went by his comely proportions and these gained the day since his beardless face and friars frock induced the idea of innocence which sebastians virgin bloom also taught the quality of his sermons did not grow threadbare under this adventitious criticism he kept a serene front lost no authority nor failed of any unction there was always a file at his confessional and at corpus christi when in the pageant he actually figured as sebastian his plump round limbs roped to a pinestock drew tears from all eyes unhappily you have to pay for your successes there were other preachers in verona and other eloquent preachers who being honest men had had to depend upon their eloquence these were the enemyfranciscans of course and dominicanswho got wind of something amiss and began to nose for a scandal what they got gave them something besides eloquence to lean on there were now other sermons than young fra battistas and the moral his person pointed had a double edge in fact where he pointed with his person the dominicans pointed with their sharp tongues the franciscans more homely pointed with their fingers fra battista began to be notoriousa thing widely different from fame he also began to be uncomfortable and his superior with him they talked it over in the cloister walking up and down together in the cool of the day it has an ugly look my dear said the provincial send the young woman to me what of the young woman meantime let me tell the truth motherhood became her so well that she was brazen from the very beginning no delicacy no pretty shame no shrinkingshe gloried in the growing fact when she was brought to bed she made a quick recovery she insisted upon a devout churching an elaborate christening of the doubtful son whereat if you will believe me no other than fra battista himself must do the office thenceforth she was never seen without her bimbo while she worked it lay at her feet or across her knee like a stout chrysalis the breast was ever at its service pillow or fount when it slept she lifted up a finger or her grave eyes at the very passersby her lips moulded a hush at them lest they should dare disturb her young lords rest the saucy jade was ever such impudence in the world before it drew her too to old baldassare in a remarkable way this the neighboursbusy with sniffingdid not see she had always had a sense of the sweet root under the rind always purred at his stray grunts and pats taking them by instinct for what they were really worth and now to watch his new delight filled her with gratitudeand more she felt free to love the man for one thing it unlocked his lips and hers she could sing about the house since cola had comethey had christened him after good saint nicholasbecause master baldassare was so talkative on his account the old man sat at home whenever he could in his shiny armchair his cup of black wine by his side and watched vanna with the baby by the hour together poring over every downward turn of her pretty head every pass of her fingers every little eager striving of the sucking child there were indeed no bounds to his content to be a fatherpoor old soulseemed to him the most glorious position in the world can grande ii in the judgmentseat the bishop stalled in his throne the holy father himself in the golden chambers of his castle at avignon had nothing to offer ser baldassare dardicozzo the oldclothes man though the neighbours knew nothing of this inner peace they could not deny that monna vanna brazen or no was mightily become by her new dignity or as you should say indignity she was more staid more majestic but no less the tall swaying crowned girl she had ever been she was seen without doubt for a splendid young woman the heavy child seemed not to drag her down nor the slant looks of respectable citizens her neighbours to lower her head she met them with level eyes quite candid and a smiling mouth to all appearance pure when she found they would not discuss her riches she talked of theirs when she found them oversatisfied with their children she laughed quietly as one who knew better this was a thing to take away a womans breath that she should grow the more glorious for her shame party feeling had been stormy like crossing tides between those who held baldassare for a gull and those who resented vannas unruffled brows but now there was but one party it was very well to hoodwink an old skinflint but by the mass not honest to flaunt your methods in the worlds face and since our own dignity is the skin upon which we rely for all our protection while contempt for our neighbours is but a grease we put upon it for its ease it was selfdefence which brought it about that the party against vanna grew ominously large while baldassare gained quite a host of sympathizers the girl was now shunned ostentatiously carefully shunned even la testolina was shy of her but bless you she saw nothing of itor cared nothing she chattered to her grossly deceived husband went nominally you may be sure confessing to the grossly deceiving friar she cooed to her baby warbled her little songs looked handsome carried herself nobly as if she were the blessed virgin herself no less this could not be endured a thousand tongues were ready to shoot at her and would have shot but for fear of old baldassares grim memberreputed forked while he was in the way fatheaded fool there was no moral glow to be won by a timely word the tongues lay itching two or three barren women in the via stella were hoarding stones then just about the time when the prior of the carmelites bid fra battista send him the young woman baldassare took the road for a round of chaffer which might keep him out of verona a week the via stella felt and fra battista knew that the chance had come iv the harvest of little ease verona stormy centre of strife whose scarred grey face still wears a blush when viewed from the ramp of the giusti garden was in those times a place of short and little ease the swords were never rusty a warning clang from the belfry two or three harsh strokes the tall houses disgorged the streets packed capulet faced montague bevilacqua caught ridolfi by the throat and della scala sitting in his hall knew that he must do murder if he would live a prince it seems odd that the suckling of a little shopkeeper should lead to such issues but so it was and thus it was on the morning of baldassares settingout for the mantuan road la testolinaat that time much and unhealthily in fra battistas hirecame breathless to the via stella craning her quick head round the doorpost she saw vanna sitting all in cool white for the weather was at the top of summer stooped over her baby happy and calm as always and fingering her breast that she might give the little tyrant ease of his drink that baby was a glutton hist vanna hist la testolina whispered and vanna looked up at her with a guarded smile as who should say speak softer my dear lest cola should strangle in his swallow but la testolinas eyes were like pinpoints centring all her alarms you must come to the carmelites vanna there is a great todo the warden of san francesco has been to the bishop and the bishop is with can grande at this moment you must come indeed at oncesubitissimo vanna laughedthe rich quiet laugh of a girl whose affairs are in good train and all other affairs the scratch of a flea why what have i to do with the bishop and can grande la testolina says she my master is out and i must mind the shop there is baby too by saints pan and silvanus my girl it will be the worse for you if you come not said la testolina with a tragic sniff eh you little fool dont you know that it is you and your brat have set all verona by the ears vanna had never thought of the ears of verona and knew not how to think of them now but she saw that her friend was in a fever of suppressed knowledge therefore she shawled her head and her baby in her seablue cloak locked the shopdoor and followed la testolina the sealed gates in the white convent wall were barred and doublelocked a scared brother cocked his eye through the grille to see who was there it is she hissed la testolina dio mio the causa causans cried he and let them in through a cranny follow me mistresses and god give good ending to this adventure he prayed as he slippered up the court vanna blank and smiling la testolina with wandering fearful eyes followed they found the prior sitting well back in his ebony chair and in meditation his chin buried in his hand behind him and behind his back his hands was fra corinto the pittanciar pockmarked thin and mortified he looked the priors reproach and was now women said the prior testilya fat and flabby old man with a sour mouthnow women which of you is at the bottom of this accursed business where is the baby let me judge for myself la testolina protesting her remarkable innocence by every quiver of her head edged vanna to the front vanna stood up straight as a candle and unveiled her bosom do you want to see my little son reverend prior she said behold him here eccololi she held him out proudly in her arms as if he were monstrance and she priest now whether it was that motherhood had fired a comely girl with the beautiful seriousness of a woman so that she was transfigured before him or whether some chance passage of the crossing lights played tricks with his visionwhich it was or whether it was both i know not he saw or thought he saw a tall smiling lady hooded in blue over white holding up a child he saw or thought for a moment that he saw the image of all mothers displaying the image of all sons his fingers pattered over his scapular eh my lady the virgin what dost thou here glorifying this place as soon as he had said it he might have known that he was a fool but vannas large grey eyes loomed upon him to swallow him up her colour of faint rose glowed over him and throbbed vera incessu patuit dea by her presence ye shall judge her quoth the prior to himself and hid his eyes there was a hush upon all the group in the chamber during which you could have heard afar off the nasal discords of the brethren in choir droning through an office no one spoke the priors lips moved at his prayers fra corinto looked frowningly before him la testolina was fidgety to speak but dared not vanna her long form like a ripple of moonlight in the dusk cooed under her voice to the baby he unheeding cause of so much strife in high places held out his pair of puckered hands and crowed to the company so with their thoughts the prior thought he had seen the holy virgin fra corinto thought the prior an old fool la testolina hoped his reverence had not the colic and vanna thought of nothing at all fra corinto it was looking not for madonna in a baggage who by discreetly coughing brought his master back to his senses the prior cleared his throat once or twice looked at the young woman and felt quite himself ridiculous what tricks a flicker of sunlight will play on the wisest of men monna vanna said he i have not brought you here to judge between you and my brother battista now at discipline in his cell the flesh which he should have tamed has raised it appears a bruised head for one last spite my brother was bitten and my brother fell into sin whether as of old the tempter was the woman it is sure that as of old the eater was a man i will not condemn you unheard lest i incur reproach in my turn but our order is in peril the enemy is abroad with envy hatred and malice barking on their leashes what can the poor sheep do but scatter before the wolves fra battista his penance duly done must leave verona and you my sister must do penance that god be not mocked nor the veronese upraised to mock him of this solemn appeal vanna to all seeming understood not one word true she blushed a little but that was because a prior was talking to her her honest grey eyes were quite untroubled her smile as tender as ever she spoke as one deprecating temeritythat she should speak at all to so great a manand by no means any judgment i am only a poor girl reverend prior said she most ignorant and thickwitted pray what have i and my baby to do with these high matters of fra battistas error the prior grew angry tush my woman he grunted i beg you to drop the artless it is out of place here let me look at the youngster yes yes mistress let us see the child said fra corinto who croaked like a nightingale in june vanna moved forward on a light foot willingly reverend fathers said she he is a fine child they all say and reputed the image of his father a sublime utterance full of humoursome matter if it had been a time for humours but it was not la testolina could not contain her virtuous indignationfor who is so transcendently righteous as your rascal for once in the right hey woman she cried shrilly what grossness is this do you think the whole city dont know about you vanna turned quivering and what is it that the whole city knows but does not say if you please the prior wagged helplessly his hands like pilate he would have washed off the business if he could he looked at the two women eh by the lord there would be a scene but the whole thing was too impudent a fraud there must be an end of it he caught fra corintos eyes and raised his brows fra corinto was his jackalhere was his cue he went swiftly to the door set it open came back and caught vanna roughly by the shoulder he turned her shocked face to the open door and his dry voice grated horribly upon her ears out with you piece was what he said and vanna reeled for a full minute she gaped at him for a meaning his face taught the force of his words only too well she sobbed threw up her high head bent it like jesus for the cross and fled the old porter leered by his open gates he he they are all outside he chuckledmagpies and dustyhoods parvuses minors and minims benets and austins every cowl in verona come along my handsome girl you must move briskish this day she heard the hoarse muttering of the men and a worse poison for good ears the shrill venom of the women out of the gates she blindly went and all the pack opened their music upon her stones flew but words flew faster and stuck more deep the mob as she blundered through the streets shuffling gasping stumbling at her caught gown dryeyed openmouthed panting her terror her bewilderment her shame and amazethe mob i say dizzied about her like a cloud of wasps yet they had in them what wasps have notvoices primed by hatred to bay her mad there was no longer any doubt for her the pittanciars word which had not been piece was tossed from pavement to pavement from balcony to balcony out at every open door shot like slops from every leaning casement and hissed in her ears as it flew it was a mad race the franciscans tucked up their frocks and discarded stones that they might run and shout the more freely the dominicans soon tired their end was served the cloistered orders were out of condition the secular clergy came to weary of what was after all but a matter for the mendicants the common people however had the game well in hand they headed her off the narrow streets where safety might have been and kept her to the lung adige round the great s the river makes she battled her blind way trying for nothing with wits for nothing without hope or understanding or thought she ran a hunted woman straight before her and at last shook off the last of her pursuers by san zeno stumbling headlong into a little pinewood beyond the gates she fell swooned and forgot it was near dark when she opened her loaded eyesthat is there was no moon but a great concourse of stars which kept the night as a long time of dusk the baby was awake too groping for food and whimpering a little she sat up to supply him though in that act her brain swam it is probable the duty saved her fearing to faint again she dared not allow herself to think for children must be fed though their mothers are stoned from the gates vanna nursed him till he dropped asleep and sat on with her thoughts and troubles happily for her he had turned these to other roads than the lung adige she knew that if he was to be fed again she must feed also v the miracle of the peachtree directly you were outside the porta san zeno the peachtrees beganacre by acre of bent trunks whose long branches tied at the top took shapes of blown candleflames beyond these was an open waste of bents and juniper scrub which afforded certain eatage for goats here three herdboys luca biagio and astorre simple brownskinned souls watched their flocks all the summer night sleeping waking to play pranks with each other whining endless doggerel praying at every scare and swearing at every reassurance simple puppyish folk though they were madonna of the peachtree chose them to witness her epiphany it was a very still night of wonderful starshine but without a moon the stars were so thickly spread so clear and hot that there was light enough for the lads to see each others faces the rough shapes of each other it was light enough to notice how the square belfry of san zeno cut a wedge of black into the spangled blue vault sheer through the milky way it ploughed a broad furrow which ended in a ragged edge you would never have seen that if it had not been a clear night still also it was you heard the cropping of the goats the jaws champ when they chewed the crisp leaves the flicker of the bats wings in the marsh half a mile away the chorus of frogs when it swelled up drowned all nearer noise but when it broke off suddenly those others resumed their hold upon the stillness it was a breathless night of suspense anything might happen on such a night luca biagio and astorre under the spell of this marvellous night lay on their stomachs alert for alarms a heavywheeling white owl had come by with a swish and biagio had called aloud to madonna in his agony astorre had crossed himself over and over again this was the angel of death cruising abroad on the hunt for goats or goatherds but no no cried luca eldest of the three the wings are too short friends that is a fluffy new soul just let loose she knows not the way you see let us pray for her there are devils abroad on such close nights as this pray they did with a will ave maria o maris stella and half the paternoster when biagio burst into a guffaw and gave luca a push which sent astorre down why tis only a screechowl you fools he cried though the sound of his own voice made him falter an old mouseteaser he went on in a much lower voice whos afraid a black and white cat making a pounce had sent hearts to mouths after this though they found her out before they had got to dominus tecum she left them all in a quiver it had been a cat but it might have been the devil then before the bristles had folded down on their backs they rose up again and the hair of their heads became rigid as quills over the brow of a little hill through the peachtrees which bowed their spiry heads to her as she walked came quietly a tall white lady in a dark cloak hey powers of earth and air but this was not to be doubted evenly forward she came without a footfall without a rustle or the crackling of a twig without so much as kneeing her skirtstood before them so nearly that they saw the pale oval of her face and said in a voice like a muffled bell i am hungry my friends have you any meat she had a face like the moon and great round eyes within her cloak on the bosom of her white dress she held a manchild he they passed their sacred word lifted in his mothers arms and turned openhanded towards them luca biagio and astorre goatherds all and honest lads fell on their faces with one accord with one voice they cried madonna madonna madonna pray for us sinners but again the lady spoke in her gentle tones i am very hungry and my child is hungry have you nothing to give me so then luca kicked the prone biagio and biagios heel nicked astorre on the shin but it was luca as became the eldest who got up first all the same and as soon as he was on his feet the others followed him luca took his cap off biagio saw the act and followed it astorre who dared not lift his eyes and was so busy making crosses on himself that he had no hands to spare kept his on till luca nudged biagio and biagio cuffed him soundly saying uncover cowface then luca on his knees made an offering of cheese and black bread to the lady they saw the gleam of her white hand as she stretched it out to take the victual that hand shone like agate in the dark they saw her eat sitting very straight and noble upon a tussock of bents astorre whispered to biagio biagio consulted with luca for a few anxious moments and communicated again with astorre astorre jumped up and scuttled away into the dark presently he came back bearing something in his two hands the three shockheads inspected his burden there was much whispering some contention almost a scuffle the truth was that biagio wanted to take the thing from astorre and that luca would not allow it luca was the eldest and wanted to take it himself astorre was in tears cristo amore he blubbered you will spill the milk between you i thought of it all by myself let go biagio let go luca so they whispered and tussled pulling three different ways the ladys voice broke over them like silver rain let him who thought of the kind act give me the milk she said so young astorre on his knees handed her the horn cup and through the cracks of his fingers watched her drink every drop that done the cup returned with a smile piercingly sweet the lady rose saints on thrones how tall she was the bimbo will thank you for this tomorrow as i do now said she goodnight my friends and may the good god have mercy upon all souls she turned to go the way she had come but astorre covering his eyes with one hand crept forward on three legs as you might say and plucked the hem of her robe up and kissed it she stooped to lay a hand upon his head never kiss my robe astorre said sheand how under heaven did she know his name if she were not what she wasnever kiss my robe but get up and let me kiss you well of truth to think of it up gets astorre shaking like a nun in a fit and the lady bent over him and as sure as you are you kissed his forehead astorre told his village next day as they sat round him in a ring and he on the wellhead as plain to be seen as this paper that he felt at that moment as if two roseleaves had dropped from heaven upon his forehead slowly then very slowly and smoothly as they report did the lady move away towards the peachtrees whence she had come in the half light there wasfor by this it was the hour before dawnthey saw her take a peach from one of the trees she stayed to eat it then she walked over the crest of the orchard and disappeared as soon as they dared when the light had come they looked for her over that same crest but could see nothing whatever with pale serious faces the three youths regarded each other there was no doubt as to what had happeneda miracle a miracle with one consent thensince this was plainly a church affairthey ran to their parish priest don gasparo he got the whole story at last nothing could shake them no detail was wanting thus it was the blessed virgin carrying in her arms the santissimo bambino gesu had come through the peachtrees asked for and eaten of their food prayed for them aloud to messer domeneddio himself and kissed astorre on the forehead as they were on their knees she walked away stopped took a peach ate it walked on vanishedecco the curate rubbed his head and tried another boy useless the story was the same third boy same story he tucked up his cassock with decision took his biretta and walkingstaff and said to the three goatherds my lads all this is matter of miracle i do not deny its truthgod forbid it in a simple man such as i am but i do certainly ask you to lead me to the scene of your labours the boys needed no second asking off they all set the curate went over every inch of the ground here lay luca biagio and astorre the belfry of san zeno was in such and such a direction the peachtrees in such and such good there they were what next according to their account madonna had come thus and thus the good curate bundled off to spy for footprints in the orchard marvel there were none this made him look very grave for if she made no earthly footprints she could have no earthly feet next he must see by what way she had gone she left them kneeling here said they went towards the peachgarden stayed by a certain tree which they pointed out plucked a peach from the very top of itthis they swore to though the tree was near fourteen feet highstood while she ate it and went over the brow of the rising ground here was detail enough it is to be hoped the curate nosed it out like a slothound he paced the track himself from the scrub to the peachtree and stood under this last gazing to its top from there to its roots he shook his head many times stroked his chin a few then with a broken cry he made a pounce and picked upa peachstone after this to doubt would have been childish as a fact he had no more than the boys my children said he we are here face to face with a great mystery it is plain that messer domeneddio hath designs upon this hamlet of which we his worms have no conception you my dear sons he hath chosen to be workers for his purpose which we cannot be very far wrong in supposing to be the building of an oratory or tabernacle to hold this unspeakable relic that erection must be our immediate anxious care meantime i will place the relic in the pyx of our ladys altar and mark the day in our calendar for perpetual remembrance i shall not fail to communicate with his holiness the bishop who knows what may be the end of this he was as good as his word a procession was formed in no timechildren carrying their rosaries and bunches of flowers three banners the whole village with a candle apiece next luca biagio and astorre with larger candleshalf a pound weight each at the least then four men to hold up a canopy below which came the good curate himself with the relic on a cushion it was deposited with great reverence in the place devoted having been drenched with incense there was a solemn mass after which things the curate thought himself at liberty to ruffle into verona with his news vi the visitation of the golden fish when a beast of chasehartroyal bear or wolfhas been bayed and broken up the least worthy parts are thrown to the curs which always come in at the heels of the pack so it is with a kingly seat the best of the meats after the great officers of the household have feasted go to the dependants of these the peelings and guttings the scum and scour of the broth are flung farther to the parasites of the parasites the ticks on ticks backs round about the castle of verona where can grande ii misused the justice which his forefathers had set up lay the houses of his courtiers beyond them the lodgings of the grooms beyond them again down to the rivers brink were the stews and cabins and unholy dens whose office was to be lower than the lowest that there might still be degrees for the gentlemen of gentlemens gentlemen and since even cockroaches must drink in this fungusbed of misery there flourished a rather infamous tavern by the sale of vino nostrano black and sour of certain sausages black also and nameless speckled with white lumps and of other wares whom to name were to expose this was the tavern of the golden fish on the evening of the day of the translation of the peachstone this tavern was full to suffocation stefano the purplefaced host in shirt and breeches stood dealing the liquor from a tub two outlaws lay under the benches partly for fear of a visit from the watch partly because having already fallen there once they feared to fall there again if they rose in one hand each held his knife in the other his empty mug two ladies intimates of theirs robaccia and crucciacorda sat immediately above them with petticoats ready to make ambush the moment a staff should rattle at the door round the table half a dozen shabby rogues bickered over their cards picagente the hairy brigand lay snoring across the threshold and his dog on him on a barrel in a corner a gigantic shepherd in leather with bandaged legs and a patch over one eye shut the other eye while he roared a hymn to bacchus at the top stretch of his lungs the oillamp flickered flared and gloomed half drowned in the fumes of wine a smell of wicked bodies foul clothes drink and bad language made the air wellnigh solid the hour was at the stroke of ten outside the streets seemed asleep in the middle of the uproar stefano the host looked up sharply listening stop your devils ferment malabocca he thundered at the shepherd stop it or ill split your crown bacco trionfante amante e spumante evviva lubbriacchezza roared malabocca screwing up his eye stefano brought down a mug full of wine upon his pate which gave him a red baptism mum you blockhead mum said his host there is a stir outside the door i tell you the shepherd grew sober in a moment there was a brief scramble in the roomthen silence the ladies petticoats went farther than they were ever intended to go picagente rolled over and over till he reached cover under the table the cards were hidden all the players heads buried in their elbows stefano blew out the light then they heard distinctly a fluttering knock at the door timid but continuous feigning a yawn stefano growled whos there at this hour the answer came in a womans voice saying open open in the name of high god it brought every head into the air again but hushed every breath the shepherd broke the silence with a groan he brought his hand splashing on to his wet head then fell to his knees and began to confess his sins my fault my fault my exceeding great fault o mary o jesus o nobis peccatoribus thus the shepherd voicing the suspicions of the rest so he became their prophet as well as their priest he towered in the room i tell you comrades that the hour of our visitation is come not can grande and his hounds are hunting us this night not the tumbril the brandingirons nor the carts tail are for us but the pains of death the fire eternal the untirable worm the trumpet of the last things who comes knocking in high gods name who saith openi will tell you it is she who last night lit upon my village and my own sisters son eh bodies of all dogs what will become of us sinners here the shepherd beat the drum of his breast as a signal before he fell flat on the floor from behind his wailful voice the gentle knocking was heard running on it had never ceased it was insistent crossing himself desperately stefano slid back the bolts then paused then turned the key then paused again to breathe hard his hand upon the latch he threw his head forward with a gesture of abandonment to what must be flung wide the door and dropped upon his two knees against a mild radiance softer than any lamp could shed was a tall shrouded womans figure they saw the round of her cloaked head they saw the white stream of her underrobe run from a peak at her bosom in a broadening path to her feet they saw the pure grey moon of her face guessed by the dark rings where her eyes should be watched with quicker awe the slow movement of her arms lifted their own to what she held up and to the running undercurrent of the two sobbing drabs muttered in one voice their remembered adoration the tall shepherd rose up by the help of the table swayed and spoke no one knew his voice again hollow as it was like the seagrumble o holiest o rose o stem of sharon o tree of carmel said he what wouldest thou with us sinners and the woman at the door said my friends i have no roof to my head will you take me in i am hungry have you no meat for my child and me the host in stefano jogged the sinner to speak surely surely sweet lady surely surely i entreat your graciousness to enter to step in to accommodate to sit down to be pleased to be easy tototo inspiration failed himto sit down in short was his lame conclusion his sweat as he said next day would have blinded any other man through the backing ranks of the scared companyrobaccia leaning face to the wall sobbing her heart out picagente the hairy brigand breathing short and hard the shepherd glorified exalted bursting with prophecy two thieves at their prayers and a wanton taking the words from themthrough such an assembly the lady of the peachtree who else pray walked to the table a soft grey light from without filled the room there was no need of a lamp nor did any eye then on watch fail to see all that followed bread and wine were served by stefano on bent knee bread and wine but sparingly did the lady eat from cup and platter that cup that platter encased in gold leaves and crusted with turquoise are to this day in the treasury crutches have been cast before them hearts innumerable burn about them when she had finished she sat a little while with her white cheek against her hand whispering words in an unknown tongue they said who knew no baby language to the child on her lap he lifted up a little hand and eh my son my son she said wilt thou take of me then she gave him the breast while not a soul said anything but prayers for half an hour when the child slept the lady folded up her dress covered him with her cloak and rose up in their midst only the poor love the poor said she in those low tones which all verona came to know by heart and only they who have little to eat give to them that have less my little son will bless you for your charity and i good friends will pray my master to reward you when he comes addio addio be with god then she would have gone and left them crying had not robaccia the blowsy wench and goodfornaught wailed aloud and caught her by the knees mother mother mother whimpered this hardy rascal bless me a little more than the others a very little more i am badeh god i am vile enoughbut i will never let thee go save thou kiss me you could have heard the roomful of them catch breath together crucciacorda the other woman laughed horribly the shepherd made a step forward to drag the slut away but no the light seemed to swell and grow towards that point where it threatens to be music so charged with messages it isit came undoubtedly from the heart of the lady through her smile for smile she did as sweetly as tenderly as a breaking cloud the sun of her smile was like a clean breath in the stivy den and behold she took robaccia by the hand and lifted her up she encircled her with a mothering arm and drew her close to her own breast her lips touched the bad girls cheek lingered for a moment there wistfully withdrew and madonna of the peachtree none staying her now went out into the dead street and was seen no more of that company the sun at noon looked down upon verona at peace upon her citizens at their prayers never was such a scene in the stormy little city before all the bells of all the churches pealed all daywith no lack of arms to pull them men and women ran to and fro kissing whom they met with a save you brother save you sister well met well met the grey brethren the black brethren the white brethren of carmel held hands and confessed to each other as many sins as they had time to remember can grande went unarmed about his own city bevilacqua unbarred his door giusti married his mistress the bishop said his prayers the cripples at the church doors had no need to whine as for the tavern of the golden fish it smelt of lavender and musk and bergamot the day through at one time there were eight litters with their bearers eleven stallions trapped and emblazoned held by eleven grooms in livery outside its door the ladies of the litters were in the room upon their knees the knights of the horses their great helmets on their backs knelt in the kennel praying devoutly the wail of dies irae went down the corso and up again salve regina wavered over the sunny spaces of the bra in the amphitheatre after an openair mass the cardinallegate solemnly exposed the relics of last nights miracle and a bodyguard of twenty noble youths six chaplains and a benedictine abbot went to the suburb to escort into the city the curate with the peachstone it was a glorious day never to be forgotten in the annals of verona charity and the open heart went side by side with compunction and the searching of the heart tears were shed and kissed away kisses induced the fall of gentler tears it might be stoutly questioned whether verona held one unshriven soul one sin unspoken or one solace unawarded it might be reasonably questioned yet it must be denied within the walls of the friars of mount carmel were two uneasy spirits fra sulpicio the fat prior was extended face downwards before the high altar fra battista the eloquent preacher chewed his thumb in his cell the pittanciar on the other hand was of the common mind he was ambling down the via leoni with brother patricio of the capuchins on one arm and brother martino of the dominicans on the other singing in exitu israel like a choirboy but the prior who had half believed before was sobbing his contrition into the pavement and fra battista was losing faith in himself the only faith he had vii last considerations of can grande ii you are not to suppose that the spectacle of verona garbed in a gown of innocence singing hymns and weaving chaplets of lilies was to go unnoticed by the ruling power can grande ii was lord of verona a most atrocious rascal and one of many but like his famous ancestor and namesake he had a gibing tongue which was evidence of a scrutiny tolerably cool of the shifts of human nature human nature he had observed must needs account to itself for itself if it met with what it did not understand it was prompt to state the problem in a phrase which it could not explain the simplicity of the plan was as little to be denied as its convenience was obvious it was thus that can grande ii understood the emotions of verona it was thus indeed that he himself confronted with statements and an explanation which did not satisfy him accounted to himself like any mothers son of his lieges he explained their explanation but only by another inexplicable formula the energy with which he expounded his own view to those about him betrayed perhaps a lurking uneasiness in the burly tyrant pooh my good lord said he to the bishop who had come full of the days doings and nights report dont you know your own flock better than this did you ever hear a man with a broken limb attribute his mishap to other than domeneddio however drunk he may have been however absurdly in a hurryact of god if it thunder and lighten of a summer night if it turn the milka judgment luckily monsignore has broad shoulders by all accounts per baccohe had need now then look at this case a belated woman with a baby stumbles upon a company of shepherds all in the twittering dark hearts jump to mouths flesh creeps hairs stand tiptoemadonna of course whom else could they call her pray they dont know the woman name her they must well who is there they dont know whose name comes readiest to the tongue madonna of course good ecco madonna this was very eloquently reasoned but the bishop shook his head it was not a brace of goatherds last night excellency but a roomful of brigands and their trulls in the golden fish the worst company in verona excellencythe most brazen the most casehardened but the story is the same from their mouths as from the lads not a detail is wanting not one point gives the lie to another excellency i would bow to your wit in any case but this the affair is inexplicable short of a miracle can grande knit his black brows he objected to be crossed and the more so when he had a sneaking thought that he was rightly crossed i should like to see my lady this night with my own eyes bishop said he hey excellency cried the other there are many devout souls in the same case can grande pished devout jellyfish he grunted and thenshe seems to haunt one quarter eh it is so excellency save that yesterday she must have passed through the porta san zeno unseen of the guard have you interrogated the guard asked the tyrant sharply it was done highness nothing entered between compline and prime but a couple of bullockcarts and a cavalcade of merchants from brescia what was in the bullockcarts bishop birchbark excellency for the yards hm was all can grande had to say to this he changed the conversation i have had the warden of the minorites and the provincial of the dominicans here this morning he said about that accursed business of the ragpickers wife it is another example of what i told you just now that these people attribute what they cannot understand to persons they can only dream about they put down the whole of your miracles to a special reward for their zeal in hounding down the carmelite and his mistress they want the order expelled i think they would like the house razed and the church washed out with holy water or fra battistas bloodthe latter for choice now i cannot pull down religious houses lord of verona though i be because a herd of frightened peasants have gone capering over the city singing salve festa dies i must really do the parties the honour of an interview before i draw the sword let me be sure which back i am going to score before i begin to carve you had better bring the prior and fra lancillottobattista to me and if you can collect the young woman and her brat so much the better alas excellency i fear the young woman is in pieces said the bishop she has never been heard of since the day of her expulsion the advice however was good the judgment good enough but before it could be followed a stroke more telling than any can grandes sword could have made was wrought by madonna of the peachtree on the night of that same day can grande was sitting in the palace with two chosen companions as daredevil as himself waiting the hour of an assignation it was about ten oclock at halfpast the hour they were to go out cloaked into the streets bent upon the lifting of a decent burgesss wife from her bed hence they were not in the castle which is near san zeno but in the della scala palace in the very heart of the city the two accomplices were baldo baldinanza a grey villain and young francesco della rocca rossa all three were armed with swords and daggers the cloaks lay with the masks on the table a servant came to the door knocked and waited can grande who to be just feared no eye upon his goings shouted him into the room well son of a pig was his greeting and what is it now the fellow whose teeth chattered in his head announced a veiled lady very tall who would not be denied baldinanza grizzled and scarred as he was took a quick breath and glanced at rocca rossa the younger man was at no pains to conceal his emotions his face ran the gamut from white to red from red back again to white it ended ashen neither looked at his master let her in said can grande and each noticed how laboriously he spoke the servant turned to obey there in the doorway stood the lady tall enough she was her head seemingly about a foot from the crossbeam of the door she was cloaked from crown to foot nothing but the oval of her face colourless white with lips very wan and a droop to them inexpressibly sad showed out of the dark column she made the servant shrank into the passage and stayed there praying of the three men at the table only one can grande himself had the spirit left to be courteous he got up the other two remained seated francesco with his face in his arms madonna began the tyrant but she uncloaked her hand and put a finger to her sad lips i may not stay she said in a voice so weary that it drew tears to baldinanzas wicked old eyesi may not stay but i must warn you can grande before i go walk not in the streets this night walk not by the piazza pass not the arched way peril lies there no sword shall help you nor the royal seat you haveenter it not now i have warned you let me go she put back her lifted hand under her cloak can grande saw the round head of the babe asleep for five minutes after her disappearance no one spoke francesco was the first he groaned god have mercy upon me a sinner between his hands then baldinanza began to swear by all devils in christendom and jewry not blasphemously but in sheer desperate search for a little courage can grande shook his head like a waterclogged hound as if to get the ring of that hollow voice out of his ears the first to rise was the eldest of the three his eyes were very bright and you could see the long scar plainly shining on his cheek i am a sinner too said he but this night i will sleep clean he made to go do you desert me comrade can grande asked the old dog turned upon his master mother of pity he said in a whisper you are never going after this i am going good sir what of you baldinanza blinked hard i am your servant can grande he said shortly where you go i follow that is how i read the book of the law well checco the tyrant went on turning to the youngster still at the table what of you francesco threw up his arms never excellency never he groaned in his anguish i dare not i dare not he concealed neither his tears nor his despair nor his bodily fear can grande shrugged are you ready ubaldo he asked baldinanza bowed his head the two men cloaked and masked themselves and went out of the palace the moon shone broad over the piazza it was a cold white night they crossed at the farther corner went up a few steps and then were lost in the glooms of the arched way they never came out alive six hired daggers hacked the life out of them and their hearts from their bodies to this day the unwholesome place is called for a testimony the volto barbaro the horrid entry so died in his sin can grande ii a man who feared nothing and won nothing but fear and can signorio his son reigned in his stead you might trust the clothwhite lackey and the stricken conscience of francesco della rocca rossa to spread the news they had viii the reproaches a scared city of blank casements a city of citizens feverishly asking questions whose answers they knew beforehand a city of swift feet and hushed voices was verona on the morrow of can grandes murder they carried the two torn bodies covered with one sheet to sant anastasia and laid them there not in state but just huddled out of sight while the bishop and his canons sang a requiem and dirige and placebo went whining about the timbers of the roof nobody mourned the man yet he had his due his yellowskinned wife knelt at his feet can signorio the new tyrant frozen rigid armed in mail knelt at his head the mercenaries held the nave the bodyguard the door archers lounged in the piazza all this parade of force was mere superfluity verona had no desire to revolt the veronese were for rending their hearts and not their rulers that day in the afternoon the show of a trialatlaw was made the depositions of the lackey of rocca rossa of the finders of the murdered and the hunters for the murderers were taken and recorded by the podesta in the presence of the council after that the six unknown dastards were publicly condemned to death by the civil power from the loggia of the palace and as publicly excommunicated by the bishop from the steps of the cathedral it was felt on all hands that on this occasion the bishop had wielded the heavier arm at least in the absence of the criminals he had brought his chances level but what gave him most weight was that which had made the testimony of francesco and the lackey overshadow every event of a week full of eventsthe interposition of madonna of the peachtree not a soul in the city was left to doubt it might be said that not a soul was left to save if faith can save you the churches were packed from dawn to dark not an altar in a chapel went bare of a mass there were not enough of them altars were set up in the squares and the streetends blocked by a kneeling bowing weeping adoring crowd the bishop spoke the common mind when at vespers that night he gave notice that he should go forthwith to purge the carmelite church of the stain upon it at the request of my reverend brother the prior provincial of the order he set out then and there in solemn procession of the whole cathedral chapter rank formed on rank behind him till his ordered following trailed across verona like a host now although as it has been said and truly said there was no soul in the city who doubted there was one soul very much in doubt that was fra battistas the offer of purgation had come in frenzy from the lips of his prior by its acceptance fra battista saw himself driven to one of two courses he must destroy his reputation for obedience to heavenly commands which it had been rank heresy in him to overlook or that other reputation he had won for being a desperate lover upon which he shrewdly surmised some of his fame depended he may have been right about thati am not here to defend him if he admitted his guilt he would be unfrocked he would show like a chanticleer stripped of his hackles before his hens if he denied it he could never preach to the women again admit it be degraded eh that would be a nasty shift deny it oh preposterous the whole day he battled with himself voice crying against voice without result observe it was a mere case of expediency he had no thought to own a fault or repudiate a slanderthe fellow had no conscience at all expediency indeed was his conscience his attention to it the ladder whereby he hoped to climb to the only heaven he knew no imagination had he but very tender senses applausethe hushed church the following eyes the sobered mouths a sob in the breathstood him for glory he had worked for this and by the lord he had won it and now he must lose it eh never never stated thus he knew the issue of his battle he knew he could not give up these thingseyeservice lipservice heartserviceof which he had supped so thirstily rather be unfrocked driven out of the city reviled and spit upon than admit such a shame as that other to prove himself a vapourer before his slaves to be pricked like a bulging bladder slit open like a rotten baggod of the love of women never never in life the other course then he pictured himself the tall and comely youth standing up alone before the grim assembly of elders flinty old men who knew nothing of my lord amor how he rides afield in a rosecoloured garment throwing a flower and a dart to boy or girl as he goes he saw a dewyeyed battista owning himself loves priest the women called him sebastian for his beauty a sebastian he was per dio stuck all over with amors fiery darts like sebastian by his persecutors he would be stripped bare like that martyrs enemies they would wound his tender flesh like sebastian he would endure casting his eyes upwards and like sebastian he would infallibly be wept by the women if women will weep for you they will bleed for you the fount of tears feeds a river as well as betrays a hidden well good then good then he saw a future in all this from the other spike of the dilemma he saw nothing but his impaling in this case if he was impaled balm at least would be laid upon his wounds fra battista determined to brazen it out before verona they lit the tapers in the sanctuary betimes and then all the brethren in their hoods sat in choir awaiting the bishop with him and his clergy should come the reverend prior fra battista was to stand on the roodstep to make his purgation he would be backed by the light so much of grace they would do him that he should face a sea of dark and be seen but in outline by it the bishops procession long announced by the indefinable hum a great crowd breeds swept up the nave with a slippering of countless feet the bishop in purple his canons in scarlet his crossbearer his chaplains and singingmen the bearer of his mitre his ring on a cushion after these the archdeacon and his chaplains the clergy of the city heads of religious orders representatives of the civil arm can signorio with the officers of his household finally the silent eager people edging past each other whispering craning their heads to see what there was and what there was not to be seen so came verona in a multitude to the great business of fra battista and the ragpickers wife in reality thrilling with but one thought madonna of the peachtree was in the city for any waking soul to see after the penitential psalms a litany and the office appointed the bishop stood with his back to the altar and spoke urbi et orbi from the text god who in divers times and in divers places etc i cannot do more than report the sum of his discourse which was that as it was plain these late marvels had some root in the hidden ways of mens hearts so it behoved him as a father to lay all such ways bare that for himself if he might speak as a man only he was conscious of no sin unpurged which the apparitions might condemn and certainly alas of no graces of his own which they could have been designed to reward let each speak for himself if there was any man in that vast assembly unshriven let him confess now what his fault was so that instant prayer might be made to their glorious visitant for forgiveness by intercession if on the other hand there was some christian virtue blossoming in secret let them brethren find it speedily out that thanks might be given for mercies vouchsafed it was noticed afterwards that the death by butchery of the feudal lord was passed by without a comment there might have been reason for this in the circumstance that can grande ii had been warned of his sin had nevertheless set out to commit it and had died in the act as it had been foretold to discuss all this in the hearing of can signorio his successor might have been a task too delicate for the bishop but i believe that the scent of the miraculous which was all about him was too much for him he could nose out nothing beyond the line which that fragrance seemed to point all his thoughts with those of his auditors were upon madonna of the peachtree whom there was nothing absolutely nothing to connect with fra battista his doings and undoings no one detected this so can grande may have been inspired a great todo which no one had the rights of was followed by mysterious appearances which no one pretended to understand what more natural than that one mystery should be allowed to explain the other the bishop having ended the prior who was very nervous began there were certainly foxes here and there in the vineyard wild grapes on the vines as well as grapes no community was so holy but that through excess of zeal overinflamed by charity it might nurture upon its bosom a fanged snake might he not allude to the detestable and neverenoughtobecondemned sin of simony which as they knew only too well had fattened in the dominican convent at b what should he say of that friar minor the famous preacher of s who had been found dead of a surfeit of melons and white wine alas he brought the taint of gluttonya deadly sinupon his order wonderful then would it be in such days as these if the most renowned of all orders and most venerable that of mount carmel should pass unscathed through the tempting fires not only wonderful but in itself a snare what a temptation to the sin of pride in the order what a drawing on of others too disposed already to the sin of envy to uncharitable speakingah and to unlovely dealing let sin be owned therefore since men were born sinners but let purgation be done the wicked member plucked out etc he passed to the sin of fra battistathat promising young apostlehandled it soberly yet gingerly hinted extenuating circumstancesthe pride of life young blood the snares of women satans favourite sittingplaces etcdrew a tear or two from his own eyes and floods from la testolina and then called fra battista to come forth that he might purge himself or be purged by the canon law thus exhorted fra battista becomingly tonsured delicately combed with an aspect most meek and hands at a pretty droop came demurely out of the friars door into the full light of the chancel to the bishop he bowed to the altar he bent a knee to his father in religion he bent both to the hush in the nave he cast a glance of wistful appeal it was truly aimed they could see nothing of his face nothing but the shape of him yet the women were sure he made a wistful appeal many were affected the anxiety to hear him was intense the squeezing fearful an enormous fishseller from the lago di garda who had come in express leaned over la testolina and ground a braized heel into her toes achi whimpered the little laundress but snakes of purgatory said the other whats a toe more or less when madonna is round the corner with a blessing for us in her maunch in a rapt silence with no preface at all fra battista made direct confession to all his gods whether remote or throned within the sanctuaryrail that he had committed the sin whereof he was accused a perceptible shiver of sensation swept over the church although everybody in it was sure before he had uttered a word what that word ought to be indeed he had never denied it but not to deny is different from bold affirmation the prior whose avowal had also been tacit looked pained avowals are painful things the bishop more used to avowals did his best to look shocked the archdeacon professionally enough thought avowal the most indecent part of an indecent business the dominicans looked at each other frankly delighted the friars minor told each other what they had always said what the people thought can only be guessed for the nave was in darkness but when battista had made an end a shuddering sigh came from a woman far down the church and then stopped hidden in some hasty new movement there which could not be accounted for there seemed to be a stampede a sudden rush to the side the surging of some great unsuspected wave which broke as it were in the midst of the throng and washed an open space to right and left up in the choir after the first surge of this wave which made every heart beat all ears heard the longdrawn following ahnot fear only not expectation made real but rather awe expectation shown just it began low and hollow ran up to a hiss then the silence was such that the cracking of a mans anklebone by the door sounded like a carters whip to him upon the bishops throne in that deathly state the whole body of people remained breathless waiting what was to ensue out of the dark stealing it appeared from the middle of the nave and floating down the church upon a bodily silence came a cold voice like a wind from the snowmountains it came in a thin stream before which fra battista shrivelled visibly o thou craven it said thou wicked man what sin can be greater than thine if thou hadst done this thing thou ownest to it had gone better with thee than now when thou standest a liar and boaster in a filthy cause wilt thou foul thyself battista and think it honour i tell thee that it was more tolerable for that stoned simple wretch than it shall be for thee and it were better that men should go unsouled like the dogs committing offence with their bodies than souled horribly like thee thou sinner of the mind idolater of thine own image dost thou yet make slippery the ways of mount carmel battista dost thou yet hang the pearls which are the tears of mary about thy neck it shall be in such case that carmel will be her holy hill no more and those same pearls turned to leaden bulls to seal thee in tophet there is no mercy for the coward and none for him that serves false gods go forth thou groper after vainglory kennel with the swine the voice ceased fra battista who had been rocking under its chill breath fell with a thud the bishop adored the altar the restpriests monks people alikebroke into salve regina so loud so wild the very church seemed to shake at that time the west doors flung open of themselves and a roaring wind swept round disastrous to candles a quick flicker of blue flame jagged across the nave the thunder came instant pealing crackling braying ruin fading at last to a distant grumble and then the rain no one got home that night with a dry skin but it was madonna who had quenched the doubting of fra battista and washed fragrant the memory of vanna to whomsoever had loved her once as her lovers in early days had been many it follows that they all forgot in the delight of reminiscence any harsh judgments she had received ix the crowning proof the week went its way without further miracle but verona had supped full of miracles and had need to digest the signs and wonders she had witnessed as one soul in the church of the carmelites had been so astonishing that you will easily understand how all little differences between order and order were forgotten the root of disturbancevanna and her baby fra battista and his luxurious imaginings baldassare and his additionwere also forgotten baldassare was at mantua vanna had been stoned to death martyred was now the wordall was well fra battista had been quietly ridded the very next morning unfrocked he took the way of the brenner and the mountains and veronese history knows nothing further certainly of him it is thought he may have got so far as prague where at any rate a perfervid preacher called baptist von bern was burnt for heresy in the year a spreader of anabaptistical doctrines he was gospels of the spirit philadelphianism and what not everything settled down to routine can signorio to tyranny and coquetting with visconti of milan who finally swallowed him up the bishop to accommodating the claims of god the pope and his temporal lord to those of salvation and his stomach and in like manner did every person in this narrative after his kind then on a bright morning in early september old baldassare came limping up the ponte navi with his pack on his back paused a minute on the bridge as his habit was to look down on the busy laundresses by the water spat twice and so doing was observed threw a cracked buon giorno la testolina over the side and went on his slow way to the via stella it was still very early but not so early that vanna was not in her shopdoor sewing and crooning to the baby on her lap she heard his step the moment he rounded the bottom corner of the street blushed prettily from neck to temples caught up the child and went out to meet her lord standing before him in her cool cotton gown there was no sun in the dusky place but what her halo of hair made no warmth but that of her welcoming mouth half shyly she stopped holding up the baby for him to see it was not for her to make advances you must understand but it needed no magic to make one believe that what a mans wife should be to a man that was young monna vanna to her ragpicker baldassare blinked and tried to look harassed the next minute he had pinched vannas cheek she put the baby into his wiry old armsa very right move of hers eh bambinaccio he muttered highly pleased it is good to see thee so thou art come out to meet thy old dadthou and thy little rogue of a mother come the pair of ye and see what my pack has in store the baby crowed and bubbled vanna nested her arm closer in his ribs and the trio went into the house a keen shot from one eye sufficed to assure the old fellow that as well as a little beauty he had a domestic treasure to wife the house was as fresh as her cheeks as trim as her shape now the saints be good to this city of verona said he as to me they have proved not amiss this was great praise from baldassare his generosity gave it point from his pack came a pair of earringswagging tinkling affairs of silver and coral next some portentous pins shining globes like prickly pears a coral and bells for master niccola and a scaldino of pierced brass for the adornment of the house thank you baldassare said vanna to her blinking old master then she kissed him before she knew where she was before she could say gia he put his arm round her and whispered in her ear then she clung to him sobbing laughing breathing quick and the rest it were profanation to report verona rubbed its eyes as it came out yawning to its daily work there was the open shop ever the first in the street there the padrone there by the manger of bethlehem were the padrona and the baby whom they had last seen huddling from their stones vanna wore her colours that morning she was rosy like the dawn she was smiling she had very bright eyes but there was a happy greeting for man or wife who looked her way and when la testolina came peeping to behold the discomfiture of baldassare vannas gay looks found her out and buon giorno la testolina came more cheerfully from her than it had come from her husband on the bridge all the little woman could do was to squat upon the threshold at her friends feet and pretend that she was troubled with spasms the crowning proof remains to be told as la testolina who blazed the story abroad is reported to have said you might have drummed the guard out with her heartbeats vanna by way of weaning her baby it seems was tempting him with gobbets of peach from a wineglass she bit a corner from the peach and tendered it in her lips to the youngster on her lap the baby a vigorous child made a snap at it like a trout at a fly and a gulp so soon as he had it the peach was hard the morsel had many cornerswent down bristling as it were cola had his first stomachache was hurt was miserable prepared to howl at that moment la testolina happened to look at him she stared she gasped she reeled against the doorpost hey mother of jesus she cried look at the baby it was a cornerpiece im afraid said vanna with great calmness but the natural juices will thaw it no no no it is not that woman her friend went on feverishlyit is not that look at his face look at his face vanna looked well she asked what of his face the bambino to express his agony was grinning from ear to ear this was the last miracle wrought by madonna of the peachtree ippolita in the hills i the glorious ippolita almighty god that supreme architect who alone among craftsmen knows when to give and when to stay the rein has chosen the plain of emilia to be as it were the garden of italy a garden set apart betwixt alp and apennine to be adorned within a garden has filled it with every sort of fruit and herb and flowering tree has watered it abundantly with noble rivers neither stinted it of deep shade nor removed it too far from the timely stroke of the sun has caused it finally to be graced here and enriched there with divers great and grave cities man who has it not in him to be thrifty in so prodigal a midst has here also thought it lawful to go free out of that lake of rustling leaves rise like the masts of ships crowding a port church towers the belfries of pious convents the domes and turrets of great buildings walled into cities among which prized as they all are and honourably additionedvicenza treviso mantua verona ferrarathere is none more considerable than padua root of learning and grey cupolas chosen to be the last restingplace of antenor king priams brother and the first of titus livy it is of padua that i am now called upon to report certain matters which may seem strange to one who does not know her well to the others verbum satis whether it is their university too famous perhaps for so quiet a place or the suspiration of their greatest citizen which has kindled their wits whether that cauldron of brick the santo bubbling with silver domes is the stem or flower of their exaltation whether their seat at the head of a sunsteeped marsh at whose mouth is venice hath itself unseated them whether petrarch set boiling what saint antony could not allay what it was how it was who gave them the wrench i know notbut the fact is that the people of padua have been as freakish a race as any in italy at the mercy of any head but the aggregates packmules of a notion galleyslaves of a whim driven hither and thither in a herd like those restless leaves souls once whose nearer sight first made dante pitiful not that they for their part asked for pity or got it mostly they paid their tavern bills when the last cup had been drained and the last chorus led when ezzelin was master of the revels they paid in blood that tower of his by the river is dark with it yet petrarch from his mountainvineyard at arqua tipped them a brighter stave they broke their hearts for pretty women and had every one the comfort of a swanlike end since sonnets are a knack with antony they flagellated with carrara defended walls with gattemelata knocked them down then venice took what padua could never keep the euganeans hailed on either side the lion of saint mark the arts flourished squarcione cut out smallclothes and taught anatomy none the worse mantegna dreamed of julius caesar smouldering while he dreamed and ippolita the stonemasons daughter from too much courting fled in breeches to the hills she like all the padovani paid her score without flinching it may have been run up without leave asked but it was run up in her name the rule in padua was so i never heard that she repined maybe that she had her moneys worth but of that you will be able to judge as well as i padua is a city set in meadows full of light it is well spaced plentifully watered arcaded green with gardens the streets are like cloisterwalks as in lucca the plane is the sacred tree and next to that flag of green on a silver staff the poplar shows the city blushful in the spring and thrilling all a summer with the memory it is a place of brick and marble painted orange brown yellow and warm white where every cornerstone and every twig is printed sharply on a sky of morning blue quivi le mura son fatte con arte che parlano e rispondono a i parlanti a tale of padua should have the edge of a cut gem so let ippolitas be told in her daythat day when at sixteen years old or so the sun briefly lit upon her golden head and showed her for the lovely girl she waspadua was passing through a time of peace novello was dead at last poor heroic gentleman verona was shaken off venice was supremeeasy but unquestionably mistress of the emilia there was time to make madrigals to make eyes to make love to imagine portraits mantegna was painting giants in the eremitani and bellini picking his brains but not as yet a quarrel the classics the ingenuous arts lovely womanalways interwoven when times are happiestflourished in that sunny place it was not really wonderful that ippolita the stonecutters daughter classically fair indisputably a beauty should win all seeing eyes and be the despair of all rhymers given the vision to the visionary and both came in their time she might be trusted with the rest for she was remarkable by contrast there were none like her the paduan girls are all charming and mostly pretty ippolita was neither she was beautiful and when you came to know her face lovely they are brown she was fair they are little she was very tall they have eyes like a doves glossed brown hers were deeply blue the colour of the adriatic when a fleeting cloud spreads a curtain of hyacinth over the sheeted turquoise bed beautifully hued in mingled red and white delicately shaped pliant supple and shy such as she was an honest good girl heaven knows she might have lived and died in her alleysweetheart of some half dozen decent fellows wife of the most masterful mother of a dozen brats unnoticed save for her qualities of cheerful drudge and broodmare beautiful as a spring leaf till twenty ripe as a peach on the wall till thirty keenfaced and wise mother and grandmother at forty and so onsuch she might have lived and died and been none the worse for her reclusion had she not leaned more than half out of her window in the vicolo one bright april morning of her sixteenth year to exchange lively banter with a friend below and been seen by messer alessandro del dardo who within the cuirass of subprefect of padua nourished the heart of an approved poet been seen of him for the miracle of young beauty she really was chance sparks kindle chance tinder and so here i am far from alleging the heart of messer alessandro to be dry tow but i do repeat it padua was a freakish cityful ippolita lovely exceedingly amorous poetry in the air he then passing by saw her stoop flushed and sparkling from above him the sun caught her shining hair a loose white smock revealed so much of her neck as to picture him the snowy rest snow and rosebudso ye little gods as he stood in ecstasy she saw him at the end of the lane and blushing drew back with a finger in her mouth to thrill and giggle at ease she saw a great gentleman stare he saw a rosy goddess stoop and laugh then blush and hide vitas hinnuleo me similis chloe away he went his heart leaping like a woodfire to report to meleagro de martiri and stazio orsini to donna euforbia donna clarice and donna simpaticafriends and poets alikethat he had had a most rare vision to me it seems he said that that fairhaired daughter of the greeks madonna elena the slim the rosyfingered disturber of the repose of cities hath appeared to distract this our city of padua me at least she hath distraught fair friends sister and brother poets you shall understand that henceforth i devote myself to this lady and her praise more i vow a vow and call upon you to register it in the golden book of the amorous gests of padua that i will never cut my nails again until i have enthroned her sovereign lady of me and of you all and of this our humane commonwealth by golden venus and her son by mars armipotent powerless in such toils and by vulcan in chains too cunning for his pincers by saints ovid and sappho the chian the mantuan and the veronese i swear this oath it is well done alessandro assented the listening company that evening in his fellowship meleagro and stazio cloaked and lurking under the arcades saw ippolita walk down the via pozzo depinto arm in arm with two shawled friends transparently in the ranks of the popol basso but as obviously not of them her golden head was bare also by a head she sailed above them they followed her by the via zitelle over the ponte della morte further yet between garden walls topped with lilac into the prato della valle there the three unconscious girls mingled with the concourse of those who took the air under the still trees ippolita that slim tall marvel seemed not to be remarked by any alessandro swooning on his friends arms could scarcely believe it edge up alessandro edge upaccost accost said meleagro but do you think i would profane the aura of her by my abhorred presence cried the lover ah god of love i would die sooner i feel indeed my daemon at work let me sit upon this benchmy tablets ha he sat finely disordered verse rime sciolte resulted but ippolita was so far unperturbed gradually however it came to her notice that she was watched there was singing under her windows at night the day brought parties of noble youths into the vicolo scarletcapped feathered slashed and booted youths ladies were with them as often as not garlanded ladies with squarecut bodices showing half their bosoms flowers came verses platters of urbino gubbio faenza she was saluted in the street followed to the church door waited for at the coming out from mass it came more or less to this that whenever she went abroad by ways where the honourable might pass her going resembled that of the processional host rather than of a respectable young woman her friends were no protection the girls thought it fun courted it found stuff in it for giggling and peering with the eyes into dark corners the lads of her station shrugged at it then sulked and at last fairly fought shy of such a conspicuous mate ippolita herself tried to laugh it off but failed absurdly she became plaintive what do these signori mean by their myladying she cried to annina her bosom friend why do they send me these things platters what use are platters to the likes of us who as often as not have nothing to put on them annina looked demurely it is easy to see what they want of thee dearest what does a gentleman always want of a poor girl that takes his fancy ippolita tossed her high head eh she snapped they may fill the house with crockery at that rate im not rubbish she was not but she wronged her adorers who neither thought it nor hoped it of her messer alessandro was not growing his nails for that sort of ware nor could he have treated the pope with more respect he had never ventured to speak though he had never failed to salute her what he wrote was chiefly in verse and as ippolita could not read it really did not much matter what his letters contained meleagro had opened his mouth to pay her a compliment he won a frightened look out of her blue eyes a fine blush and lived upon them for a week the ladies were bolder some of them had walked with her once in the prato there was very little to say except that they loved her and thought her like a goddess ippolita was rather scared laughed nervously and said chi lo sa donna euforbia then told her the story of the original ippolita the scythian queen of king theseus and the child born to them in seawashed acharnae the paduan ippolita said gia several times and asked if her namesake was a good catholic finding she was not she took no further interest in her fortunes than to suppose her deep in hell for her pains the ladies asked her to come and be their queen she said she couldnt leave her father they offered her jewels for her hair neck fingers wrists ankles she laughed and said that they were not for the likes of her they spoke of alessandro the poet she asked if he were any relation to the signor sottoprefetto he was that same said they dio buono cried ippolita is he the gentleman who wants to undo me they were shocked he asks no more than to sit at your feet ippolita and read the secrets of your beautiful eyes it is your soul he loves he asks nothing of your body they never do madonna said ippolita but i am a poor girl so please you who have to look every way at once as the saying is domeneddio is the only signore i ever heard tell of who could get on with peoples souls men want more of us than that protests were wasted and alessandro watchful of his nails went mad in numbers this it was to be tall out of common this to lift up in darkbrowed padua a brave golden head this to carry the bosom of an oread beneath the smock of a girl in her teens this merciful heaven to be a vortex when poets are swirling down the stream of time ii messer alessandro thinks to cut his nails not to weary you it is clear that ippolita was the fashion the poets the courtiers the painters of whom in that age of peace padua was full were wild about this glowing girl this sumptuous nymph of the via agnus dei they were melodiously caperingly symphonically wild according to their bents she saw herself on plates of faience where the involutions of a ribbon revealed ippolita bella to the patient eye she found herself or they found her an inordinate trisyllable for a canzone saw her colours of necessity reproduced on her lovers legs and shoulders as colours of election one by one she could appraise her own possessions and those they fabled of her her hair was demeters crown of ripe cornshe knew nothing of the lady but hoped for the best her eyes were dark blue lakes in a field of snowthis she thought very fine her lips were the amorous petals of a rose that needs must kiss each other kissing they made a folded flowerah la virtu della bocca che sana cio che tocca sighed the poets but bless her good innocence that sweet mouth had touched nothing more mannish than her fathers forehead or the feet of the crucified her cheeks said they were appleblossoms budded her neck the stem of a chalice her breastbut i spare your blushes though they never spared hers there is a book gli ornamenti delle donne which will tell you what that bastion of a fair girl should be and what it should be those paduan lyrists will more than assure you ippolitas was thus passionately they fingered every part dwelling here touching there with no word that was not a caress what she had not too they gave herthe attributes she sowed in them she was vagha since they longed lontana since she kept them at a distance nascosa since they drove her to it cold since she dared not be warm the painters not to be behind expressed what the others hinted she saw herself first as daphne behind a laurelbushthe artist kneeling in the open offered his heart smoking upon a dish second as luna standing in shrouded white on a crescent moonthe artist as endymion asleep in a rocky landscape waiting to be kissed third as leda naked in reeds beside her pair of eggsthe plumed artist near by ruffling and flapping his wings luckily their allusiveness escaped her she knew nothing of the diversions of the ancient gods but of all the vantage she gave them none equalled that for which her gossips should have answered her most commendable name of ippolita the verses she received on that theme would have made a theseid those she had to hear would have kept the rhapsodists for a twelvemonth those she saw the very sala del consiglio could not have contained ippolita at war with the athenian or leading her amazons afield ippolita turning her unmaimed side to an adoring warrior the painter and you or suckling ippolita with the artists strongly marked features in an ivied ruin with peacocks about it ippolita in a colonnade at athens on the right hand of the kingthus she saw herself daily thus the old palace walls of padua if they could yield up their tinged secrets through the coats of lime would show her rosy limbs and crowned head mantegna has her armoured with greaves to the knee and spiked cups on her breastplate gian bellini carried her to venice to lead scythians in trousers against theseus in platearmour and a blazoned shield giorgione set her burning in the shade trying to cool her golden flank in deep mosses by a well all this and much more ippolita endured because she was a good as well as a beautiful girl sometimes she wept in a friends arms sometimes really frightened she sought her parish priest mostly it was the wonderworking virgin in sant antonio or at the greatest stress the saints own black sarcophagus in the lighted chapel to lay upon it a feverish palm or hot indignant cheek by some such aids as these she preserved entire her head her heart all her precious store so that no flattery ever tarnished the clear glass of her mind no assaults however fierce could bruise the root of modesty within her her father vexed man at first felt the glory of his daughter shone by her reflected light guessed and had reasonable grounds for guessing the profit it might be but lastly seeing the suitors sought not to marry her and she would do no less he grew disgusted with so windy a business beat her for what was no fault of hers and bade her be sold or begone ippolita who began her days processioning with music and flowers ended it mostly in tears and stripes there seemed no escape if she went to draw water at the well the courtiers jostled for her first salutation if she went to mass in the grey of the morning so blinking did they the priest who confessed her paid her compliments the blind beggar at the church door looked at her out of one eye she was incredibly the fashion and the women far from being jealous were as wild about her as the men she could have had a court of virgins or gone like artemis buskined through the thickets with a hundred highgirdled nymphs behind her all for her sake locked in chastity they also made her presents which her father sold until learning to fear the greeks their brothers she gently forbore them whereupon the honest stonemason had fresh cause for chastisement of so incalculably calculating a child the hunted fair at last came to a point where she must stand or deliver from three desperate lovers there seemed no sure road all that was possible she did she consulted her priest he patted her cheek a very old woman of her intimacy advised her to look in the glass she did and blushed at her own distressful face a friar of the order of saint francis plumply told her to choose the most solid of her pursuers and make the most of him such roses as yours my daughter said he should be early to market you are sixteen now but remember that by the mercy of heaven you may live to be six and sixty thats the time when the pot wants lining if you have not the experience pray how are you to direct the young in the way they should go yet that is the trade for an old lady whose life has been an easy one for my part i regret that the rules of our convent do not allow me to open the gate she pouted and went out into the sun again to find her way to the santo barred the three poets with three lutes were singing a madrigal in her honour they were understood to say that her going was over the tired bodies of lovers that she went girdled with red hearts that her breast was cold ivory and her own heart carved in ice nymph rhymed with lymph and ippolita with insolita the whole ingenious as it was was not ad rem and as for the poor subject of it all her heart far from being ice was hot with mutiny she knew herself for a simpletonjust a poor girl she knew herself made ridiculous by this parade could see herself as she was her crisping hair was over her ears and knotted behind her neck without garland or fillet or so much as a brass pin her green dress though it was low in the neck was tightly drawn over her bust for what were glorious to be shown in a great lady in her had been an immodesty when she lifted her skirt out of the gutter you could see some inches of bare leg her hands were brown with work though her neck was like warm marble in the sun eh she knew herself through and through just a lowborn wench and o gesu re her heart cried within her why can they not leave me alone the three poetsstazio orsini in white and yellow alessandro del dardo in white and green and meleagro de martiri in a plumcoloured cloakaccompanied her down the via pozzo depinto to her poor house in the quarter of santa caterina she lived in the vicolo agnus dei to their florid exercises in the language of courts she replied in monosyllablessissignore grazie signore or servo suo the humble words were as much her daily use as padre nostro or ave maria at the door she must have her hand kissed three times in face of the nudging neighbours and to each salute her honesty prompted a fresh grazie signore a curtsy and a profound blush meleagro beat his forehead to see her so lovely and so unapproachable orsini bit his lip but alessandro mindful of his nails and not to be subprefect for nothing went away to find the girls father this worthy bowed to the earth before his visitor in what way could his excellency be served by the acceptance on matteos part of twenty ducats benissimo e tante

am your servant everything shall be as you wish he did not add though he might well have added that it was more than himself had dared to hope for at time of sunset home he came but not to beat his beautiful daughter on the contrary he made much of her fuddled he was but not drunk he took her incontinent upon his knee and began to deal in rather liberal innuendo divining him darkly she went to work with such arts as she had to wheedle the worst out of him carissimo padreso she coaxed him with hands interwoven about his scrubby facetell me more of this gallantry of young blades chuck chuck chuck he babbled oozing wine come and feed out of my hand bill me sweeting and i bill thee ho ho two doves on a branch what turtle wilt thou mope for ever she trembled nay nay ill mope no more father says she but do thou tell me who my mate is to be slyly he looked at her burning face and slyly kissed it then he began to sing quell drudo messer amore ha scelto un dardo per cuore dardo acerbo ardente che fa gridare le genti ohime dolce dolore she had been a fool indeed to miss such a rebus so the peril was worse than her dread the lees of twenty ducats shabby in his fist told her how near the peril was going to bed he folded her in his arms making her prop while he mumbled comfort it is all for the best my beautybright he hiccoughed all clearly for the best messer alessandro is a lover in ten thousand i shall be as good as a fatherinlaw any day of the week why its my honest friend that he hails me already that is what a man may call climbing up i hope when a poetical roaring blade cuts out your servo suo in that fashion and hes sottoprefetto remember that means all padua yours for the asking sleep sound my pretty bird ippolita bella after this night you shall sleep by day so he found by good luck his bed and she a time for tears iii the jew in the via della gatta if there is not much to be said for the via della gatta in these days there was even less when ippolita was the reigning toast it was cloistered as now it was cobbled shabbywhite secret blind it echoed silence was a place for slippering crones for furtive cats and the smell of garlic and charcoal fires of nights by the same token it was not the place to choose for an aftersupper walk the watch used to go through it with swords before and daggers behind lanterns were little use save to reveal the cutthroat blackness all about now on the very night when matteo was fuddled ippolita in tears alessandro in a fever and the more reputable padovani turning down their beds the watch came rattling at the subprefects door to report a dead jew in the via della gatta of all nights in the year this the eve of the glorious ippolitas homebringing to be vexed by a dead jew messer alessandro was exceedingly annoyed take your accursed jew he said to the lieutenant and stuff him underground i am busy i am absorbed in work when i have leisure i will attend to him you can dig him up again and i take this opportunity to tell you lieutenant that your visit is most inopportune for six months you have brought me nothing of the sort and tonight for example you plump a jew on my doorstep bury your beastly jew and leave me in peace but excellency stammered the lieutenant your excellency will see that i have no control over the assassins of padua this jew has not died happily there is a great hole under his ribs he is scarcely cold yet that is soon remedied said alessandro put him in the ground but excellency a murdered jew a jew in holes the jews have been damned from the beginning of our dispensation cried the subprefect in a rage well i add my malediction i say damn your jew and he shut the door in the face of the watch the lieutenant was hungry if his chief could damn the jews so could he corporal says he i am going to supper do what you like with the jew so long as you put him decently away when you have finished good night the corporal conferred with his men here was the jewwhat should they do with him one of the archers suggested a source of profit he might be shown in the wineshops at a quattrino a head agreed off they set they showed him at the codalungathere were some lowbrowed hovels there as was usual about the gates the jew did well thence they skirted the walls by the riviera santa sofia tried him at the outer gate of the carmine worked their way from tavern to tavern till they came to the vicolo agnus dei it was a thousand pities matteo was drunk in his bed he had quattrini enough and would not have missed the treat for the world ippolita whimpering in hers wondered what the buzzing and sliding of shoes in the street below could be about she had troubles of her own poor girl but she could not stand this up she got a single glance out of window was enough she shuffled on a shift and a petticoat snatched a shawl and tiptoed out annina her bosom friend had no troubles she was half undressed but she too slipped a shawl over her head and went peering into the alley there she met ippolita and joined hands flaring torches a swarm of eager black heads whispers grunting the archers plumed helmetsmadonna whats all this cried the two girls together in a stew of curiosity a dead jew a murdered jew o gesu they borrowed a quattrino apiece from a neighbour and were richly rewarded ah the blood the staring his grey old fingers there was a something if you like to talk about at the house door and a something to dream of per bacco i believe the jew engulfed all her annoyances of the past and all her fret over the immediate future when they had done with him came the question of his interment it was the small hours very near the time to relieve guard the jews hosts found themselves out by the porta santa crocean empty quarter of the town abounding in gardens over the wall with him said the corporal well plant him here it was done the jew who by the look of him had earned more money an hour after death than in all the years of his life was put a foot and a half underground among the pumpkins in a garden of the via di vanzo padua went to sleep iv ippolita lifts up her eyes to the hills waking from a late troubled sleep ippolita found her little room possessed by three noble ladiesemilia malaspina euforbia di ponterotto and domenica di campodarsegodressed all in saffron and white her sacred colours they told her who announced themselves with much kneeling and folding of arms over breasts as her handmaids sagro cuor di gesu thought poor ippolita what a way to undo me but aloud she only murmured tante grazie gentildonne and got out of bed they had prepared for her a scented bath into which in her dazed condition she entered without overmuch persuasion true she thought to find her death in so much water and crossed herself vehemently when first it touched her back but there might be worse deaths she supposed than drowning for a poor girl bought and sold and not so very long ago a jew had been baptized in santa giustina in water up to his neck nothing however would induce her to sit down they dressed her then in silk tied and garlanded her hair put a gold chain round her neck silken shoes on her feettalking in quick whispers to each other all the time and so announced with curtsies that she might enter the litter as soon as she would she was at the disposition of these ladies was her faltered reply emilia waved her hand out of the little window chords of music sounded from the street the voices of men and ladies rose upon a madrigal fior di maggiosoave pio e saggiosalve ippolitathe work of alessandros muse upon that night of discord from the jew so she went downstairs the vicolo agnus deia blind alley of low jutting houses over arcades full of squalor pink wash children and catswas on this early morning ablaze with colour and music from wall to wall and eight feet will measure that it seemed packed with the nobility tousled heads from above looked down curiously on heads elaborately frizzed on scarlet caps on plumes on garlands on jewelled necks poverty and riches touch at their extremes like houses in the south the shoulders of the ladies at play were no barer than those of the slatterns who gaped at them playing but for ippolita who had always been a decent girl let us hope her blushes were a cloak she felt naked and the bath remember had unnerved her what these neighbours of hers may have thought is no concern of ours since the actors in the play took no concern in it twenty pieces of silver had bought an incomparable peg for their conceits they were rescuing they said to each other a lily from the gutter taking a jewel from a dirty finger glorifying the gloriesa pious act which could not fail of returning honour to those who took honour in doing it the people sacks to be filled with garlic and black wine liver and bloodpuddingsgrunting hogs let them keep their sty let them not dare and in truth it never occurred to them to dare interfere with the diversions of the great yet as the veiled sacrifice went to mount the litter one browneyed rascal from an upper window holding a towel over her neck shrilled out in homely patois a vederti polita mia and ippolita turned her lovely head and showed for a moment her shining wet eyes to those who watched she smiled tenderly at the sendoff but addio annina addio she said softly and turned bowing to her bowing gaolers as the swaying litter of gold and white went out into the pozzo depinto and turned up towards the pontecorbo gate as the music and chantingcandida ippolita premio damore grazia insolita del sommo fattoredied away to a murmurous underflow of sound perhaps a tongue or two was thrust into a cheek or two perhaps a bare shoulder shrugged or one shockhead wagged to another the air was sharp beds still warmwhose business was it the street was left to the rats and snuffing dogs again but annina had sparks of fire in her brown eyes and panted as she tugged at her staylaces it was not long before she clattered downstairs on her clacking heels and went to mark the cage they had gilded for her dear ippolita those hierophants that collegio damore as the new style ran bearing in their midst the garlanded victimgoddess at once and sacrificeawoke the echoes of the streets without comment the city gates were open it is true in some churches the doors stood wide for the first mass they passed a priest or so just up a friar or so furtive truants from their beds then at the edge of the piazza del santo ippolita peeping through her curtains saw a little company of goatherds blanketted brownlegged shabby rogues their feet white with country dust new in from the hills with their flocks they blinked to see the gay procession but wistfully longingly she looked after them from her cage they were not so much marketstuff per dio they walked at large over bright hillsides singing to the sky and the winds they were not pestered with love or fine buzzing ladies or capering signori who larded poor girls with compliments and showed their teeth most when they meant least ah if she could run away if she could hide with them lie on the hillsides while the goats cropped about her lie on her back her hands a pillow and sing to the sky and the winds because she was so happy the thought possessed her she ached for freedom felt the water of desire hot in her mouth the sleepy shepherds huddled in their rags watched her go by they little knew what a craving the sight of their dusty ease had stirred in a heart whose covering was fine silk and strung pearls her wrongs came back upon her like heaped waters of a flood that shameful bathah soul of christ to strip one naked and let souse in hot water like a pig whose bristles must come off more than songs which she did not understand more than compliments which made her feel foolish and pictures which made her look so was this refined indignity seethed in water like a dead pigah madonna she arrived sulkyif so humbleminded a girl could be sulky defiant suspicious at least the place chosen for the new collegio damore was the villa venusta whose shady garden can still be seen from the riviera businello this garden is full of trees myrtle wisteria lilac acaciaflowering treeswith a complement of firs and shining laurel to give a setting to so much goldengreen and white it has a canal on two sides is a deep leafy place where nightingales sing day and night it abounds in grass lawns flowers weeping trees and marble hermae the villa itself is very stately a threestoried house in the venetian style from whose upper windows you can command a fine stretch of country below you on either hand the piazza del santo the prato della valle with their enormous churches pink and grey beyond these the city walls the green plain lastly the ragged outline of the far distant hills it has a courtyard with lemon trees long dim rooms empty of all but coolness shuttered against the glare of noon above a great saloon coffered in the ceiling frescoed on the walls with a dais and a throne an open loggia full of flowers above all this again raftered bedrooms smelling of lavender a roomy stately place for those whose lives move easily in such surroundings for ippolita the girl of the people happy in her dark tenement in the vicolo gossip of the upper windows shy beckoner to the street burnisher of doorposts at sundownfor ippolita this windy great house was a prison neither more nor less it was a prison at least conducted according to the best rules of gallantry then obtaining they bowed her up the staircase to the refectory they sat her down and plied her on their knees with fruit and cups of wine they led her to the throne room where high above them all she was to sit and being crowned hear them contend in verse and prose for the privilege of her love for the day it was all arranged she was to have a favourite every day man or maid favour was to go by merit among her slaves the theme was always to be her incomparable virtuesher beauty discretion wit poor dumb fish her shining chastity power of binding and loosing by one soft blue ray from her eyes etc they displayed her emblems on the wallsthe peacock because her beauty was her pride her pride her beauty doves because they were aphrodites birds rabbits because the artist understood rabbits the beaver that glorious witness of virtue who makes himself less certainly a beaver that he may be more safely a saint the beaver i say in white on a green field other symbolsthe lily of her candour the rose of her glowing cheeks the crocus of her hair the pink anemones which were her toes the almond for her fingers she saw herself articulated her fauna her flora her moral and physical attributes cried at her from the four walls ippolita sat very scared on her throne and endured what she could by catching firmly to the knobs of it and blinking her eyes one by one they came creeping these silken ladies these slashed and curled young lords to kiss her hand dio mio thought she what is all this about and are maids courted this way among the great she knew very little about it yet was quite sure they were not she wondered when alessandros business was going to begin as a matter of fact it had begun he was now removing several inches of superfluous fingernail with a sword for the first day that same alessandro del dardo won her to himself by his descant upon the theme how a gentleman may dismember himself without dishonour for a ladys love and how not now he has me thought poor ippolita and set her teeth but he lay at her feet most of the day and though at night he led her into the garden if you will believe me he never even kissed her hand who is mad thought she to herself staring from her bed into the shadowy angles of the room am i mad are these signori all mad is this a madhouse dio it soon should be at this rate she cried herself to sleep at last next day it was meleagro who won her by a careful consideration of the question whether or no when a gentleman has served a lady for ten years and she falls sick of the smallpox he is ipso facto absolved of his vow meleagro decided that he was not and was accepted by ippolita not because she admired his reasoning but because she thought it part of the game next came the turn of donna emilia a very burning poetess for a sapphic ode and so on and so on after three days ippolita found herself yawning her head off the longing for freedom returned for the open country the hills the goatherds not for her home in the vicolo this everlasting lovemaking with its aftertaste of stale sugar had turned her sick of padua the whole city to her mind reeked of bergamot she guessed a fawning lover at every street corner a pryer at every windowbasta basta la citta no it was to the hills she lifted up her eyes to the hills and the swart goatherds free of their mystery that riviera across the canal where the budding planes made a mist of brown and rose was a favourite haunt of theirs there they assembled and milked their goats thence set out homewards at night sitting in the pleached arbours with two adoring ladies at her feet and a little cluster of youths behind and beside her she used to peer long and earnestly through the branches to see them collect their flocks and start for the hills at dusk lithe brown sinewy lads they were what long legs they had with what bravery wore their ragged cloaks one carried a great bulging skin under his armbagpipes she was sure they made good music to each other in the green country places very early in the morning she heard them come in they were known by their bells she jumped out of her luxurious bed at the first tinkle and was at the shutter watching for them before ever they rounded the angle of the ponte della morte there they came colour of dust with the straggling goats following after in a cloud of it her impulse was to fling wide the casement hold out both her arms call to them with all her might ha help in the name of the trinity take me with you to the green hills i am weary of life in this place then knowing she could not she would hold herself back by main force stare about her run back throw herself on the bed lie there sobbing wildly and so be found by her ladies who came to put her in that detestable bath she was sure her skin was being rotted by so much water she used to feel her arms and thighs secretly to see if they were palpably more flabby it stood to reason that the water must soak inwhere else could it go to she thought that she walked like a bladder supposing a bladder were to take itself legs the whole affair was clean abominable but she saw no way out the way came v annina as demiurge they held a tournament in the courtyard of the villa quite a concourse thronged the painted lists ippolita a miracle of rose and gold in a white gauzy robe her hair crowned with daisies was queen of love and beauty fanned by ladies in red del dardo tilted with vittore marzipane gottardo de brancacci with giacomo feo a young lion from the romagna messer meleagro very nearly fell off his horse they were all in gilt armour their steeds blazoned with peacocks but there was no dust for the ground had been wetted with rosewater no bones were broken and no blood drawn the gallants of the quattrocento could not abide what gave the salt to their grandfathers feasts they had other ways of deciding issues which appeared satisfactory and when at the end the conquering champion went down on his two knees before the throne when ippolita with deprecating hands and downcast eyes rose timidly to crown him the silver trumpets pealed as shatteringly as ever over a bloodfray and the company cried aloud to the witnessing sky evviva ippolita bella they could have done no more for a sheaf of broken necks this was a great day but at the close of it its glorious occasion locked herself into her chamber with breathless care and sat tearful by the window with crisping hands and heaving bosom watchful of the happy idlers she could see afar off in the broad green prato under the shimmering trees there walked mothers whose children dragged at their skirts to make them look handfasted lovers were there a lad teased a lass a girl hunched her shoulder to provoke more teasing an old priest paused with a finger in his breviary to smile upon a heap of ragged urchins tumbling in the dust the air breathed benevolence the peace of afternoon the end of toil round about so still and easeful after the days labour were the white houses greenshuttered half hidden in the trees the minarets the domes the coursing swallows over them the golden haze of afternoon a sky yellowing at the edge beams of dusty sunlight coming slantwise broad pools of shadow further still the far purple shoulders of the hills ah those velvetsided bluebathing birdhaunted windkissed hills but what was that the jangle of little bellsthe goatherds were going out of the city this poor prisoner then this watched and weary beauty whispered to herself of her despair oh madonna madonna madonna she fretted let me go as by miracle they announced a visitor one annina a girl of the town would her majesty see her ah heaven but her majesty would in came staring and breathing hard a browneyed girl with a shawl over her head below it a blue stuff gown below all a pair of sturdy bare legs corpaccio thats a lady thats never my polita she stammered when she saw the white silk wonder of the room the jewels in her neck the chains of gold the bosom oh annina annina it is it is your poor ippolita panted the beauty and fell into the red arms of her friend sakes dear sakes thoult spoil thy glory my lovely dear cried the other but there then but there then theres nothing to wail about tell me the trouble tell thy good nannina so she petted her like a mother her child donna euforbia stood confused but dutiful ever has her majesty any further commands grazie grazie said her kissing majesty niente and so was left alone with all that she held true in padua oh come nannina come and sit with me come to the windowlet us have the air she led her there o lasso said she then and sighed how good it is to see thee child before the other could let out a madonna she began her plaint they give me no rest nannina no rest at all day long night long they are at their postures i am dressed undressed put to bed taken out fed watered like a pet dog they put me in a bath they do my hair out every day to get me up in the morning according to their fancies is an hour and a halfs work for three ladies figure it christian souls cried nannina whats the meaning of this a bath what water full to the brim with water on the faith of a catholic of course if this continues i must die oh sicuro sicurissimo she agreed this is very serious ippolita eh let me feel you are you ever dry my poor child dry to the touch nannina dry to the touch but it is within my body i fear it i must be sodden dearest send for a priest ippolita that is the only chance but remember when they have washed you they put clothes upon you like these ah but it is worth a girls while to have silk upon her and these chains and these pearls corpaccio there is no madonna in padua with such stones as these nor any bishop either upon my faith ippolita shook her beautiful head they are not worth the price of all that smelling water she complained try it nannina before you speak seriously i am very unhappy let me tell you something well nocome nearer ill whisper the two heads were very close together nanninas eyes became a studyattention suspicion justified prophecy hopefulness then saucerfuls of sheer surprise to smother every other emotion ma impossibile and they have never never so much as a finger but what are they dont they ippolita shrugged pouting chi lo sa i tell you nannina i shall go mad in this place and why not cried the other with a snort you have examples enough about you my conscience what is all their singing and stuff about i think it is about me nannina and their disputing it is about me and the rhymes they are about me and you have never never never never what not in the garden even no never i tell you only my hand your handpouf the nightingales sing there i suppose all night and there is moonlight floods of moonlight dio dio santissimo cried nannina striking her friend on the knee you must be out of this ippolita this is unwholesome i like not the smell of this faugh fungus mawkish i will see your father this very night ippolita shook her head again my father is paid by these signori then the priest must do it father corrado must do it he dare not a convent no never that is worse than this butoh nannina if i dared i would do such a thing well let me hear if it can be done it shall be done ah sighed ippolita with a hand on her heart ah but it cannot be done then why speak of it because i want so much to do it listen then ippolita clinging to her friends neck whispered her darling thought the goatherds on the hills there was freedomclean untrammelled freedom no philandering for no one would know she was a girl no ceremony no grimacing no stiff clothes no hairtiringshe must cut off her hairno bathing ah heaven if she might go for a few months a few weeks until the hue and cry was over until the signori had thought of a new game then she would come back and her father would be so glad of her that he would not beat her more than she could fairly stand it was a great scheme indeed it was the only way but how to do how to do i suppose it is a dream of mine sighed she knotting her fingers in and out of the gold chains annina said nothing but frowned a good deal i see that you are not safe in padua she said in the end you are really too handsome my child you couldnt show your nose without being known and reported you must go outside if you are to be in peace but i cant go nannina you know it as well as i do i am not so sure do you mean what you say ippolita ah nannina then you shall go it so happens that i know one of those goatherdsa rough lout of a fellow called petruccio i could tell him that a youngster had got into trouble in the city and wanted to lie quiet for a week or two i can do it ippolita oh and will you will you corpaccio if you mean business i mean nothing else then it is done they clung together and kissed annina was to return the next evening at the same hour that night it was remarked on all sides that ippolitas beauty had never been so disastrous her eyes so starry bright her colour so fireflushed messer alessandro who loved her like a maniac went shivering out alone into the moonlit garden to expostulate with nature thou hast formed most cruel mother cried he an image of thy fatal self whose eyes are sharp swords and her breath poison of ineffable sweetness whose consummate shape killeth by mere splendour to whose tint of bright fire every arm must stretch as moth to flame and by it be blasted all this thou hast done and not yet content hast set this glory so low that all may reach for it and yet so remote that none can touch burningpure is my beloved at whose approach i faint what hard miracle is this of thine goddess that all must love and none be found worthy thus we may reflect as alessandro beat his resounding forehead to what a pass poetry may bring a youth who buys for twenty ducats what twenty thousand cannot give him the use of pygmalion made a woman one day moulding all her gracious curves as his experience taught him there went his twenty ducats but not he could warm that image into glowing flesh however much he sang to it and hymned that was anothers affair so here annina came on the morrow full of secrecy and other things more equivocal still in appearance her burden proved however to be a bundle of rags which she assured ippolita represented all that was necessary to the perfect goatherd we will do what we can here child said she in the way of staining your skin cutting off your hair and such like then you shall veil and come into the garden with me but whereas you shall come in as the madonna of these heathens you shall leave per dio as silvestro who murdered the jew in the via della gatta and has to hide in the hills do you remember him ippolita of course i do said ippolita have i killed that jew annina it is to be understood my dear now come there is everything to arrange there was indeed del dardo would have swooned to see how annina handled his unapproachable her burnished hair was off with a clip or two of the great shears a mixture of soot and walnutjuice hid up her roses and transformed her ivory limbs to the similitude of a tanners ippolita did not know herself veiled up close she crept into the garden with her confidante and in a bower by the canal completed her transformation not daphne suffered a ruder change a pair of ragged breeches swathes of cloth on her legs an old shirt a cloak of patched clouts shapeless hat of felt sandals for her feet shod staff for her handbehold the peerless ippolita idol of half padua turned into a sheepish overgrown boy in tatters whose bathing could only have been in sweat and the scent of his garments the rankness of goats on the floor in a shining heap lay the silk robes the chains and jewels only witness with annina of what had been done that same annina clasped in her arms the tall boy oh my dear my dear she said half sobbing if any ill should come of this i shall kill myself no ill will come nannina believe me replied ippolita quite calm you are sure they expect me i see them on the riviera now slip into the boat i will put you across on the other bank ippolita was received by the herdboys all agog to see the champion who had killed the jew addio silvestro said annina keeping up the play addio nannina said silvestro with a chuckle are we ready boys petruccio called out turning about him we must be careful what were doing hist silvestro whispered one with a nudge did he bleed much cosa terribilea flood silvestro spread out his hands cristo the glory of it valentino i scrag you my man if you speak of the jew till we are out of the porta san zuan growled petruccio the leader avanti and the drabcoloured crew moved off towards the sunset vi silvestro the guard at the porta san zuan let them go unheeded one ragamuffin more or less made no odds the heart of the newborn silvestro gave a great bound as they cleared the gate and she saw before her the straight white road with its border of silver stems and the spreading tentroof of golden green these stems were so obviously like the pillars of a church that silvestro ventured to remark as much to her neighboura broadfaced thick fellow not quite her own height but twice as big in the girth his mouth was large his eyes were small and rather hot he blinked a good deal was very sulky and met her advances with a grunt chi lo sa was as far as he would go along with her in the matter of treetrunks it was annoying every one had seemed friendly at first but being free she could not feel daunted long and at the second bend of the road the hills sailed into full visionthe solemn hills in a long line of peak and hollow velvety dark and brooding sleep like a bank of cloud edging the pale sky the frogs were singing vespers in the ditches the sharp chorus of the cicalas shrilled on all sides at the sight of this enormous calm silvestro forgot rebuffs for a murderer he was in a very cheerful humour he began to sing soon he had all the boys except that blinker rapt to attention andrea slewed round his bag and pipes and began upon a winding air they all sang going at a trot the goats pricked up their ears they too began to amble it became a stampede the sun went down behind monte venda the bats came flickering out the great droning cockchafers dropped on the road like splashes of rain the night found them still far from abano but still talking and nearly all friends silvestro was hand in hand with petruccio and another boy called mastino because he was heavyjowled and underhung their tongues wagged against each other about nothing at all silvestro strengthened his position by hints and shrewd winks but it was decided that the jew should be kept for the night fire that was too choice a morsel to be eaten on the road that must be rolled on the palate to get the flavours it was a pity certainly about the pigeyed boy who snorted whenever the exploit was mentionedbut never mind him thought silvestro i have all the others they passed through abano monte ortone was ahead a spur of the great body of the hills theres the hermits candle said petruccio a twinkling light showed deep in the trees there was a most excellent miracle therethe blessed virgin in a tree two girls saw her and thought she was a kite entangled but they fetched a priest from abano and he knew better so then they built an oracle or some such place and paid a hermit to pray there and now whoever has ague or is with child or hath bandylegged children or witchcrossed cows always goes there and the hermit cures them that was money well laid out i suppose per bacco cried andrea ill tell you some more did you ever hear of monna bettas short leg petruccio cuffed him well a palsy on her leg and a palsy strike thee he thundered if with thy old womens tales we miss the path go drive the goats in thickchops and stay that clapper of thine till they ask for a crowkeeper move now be off tis a hard thing petruccio blubbered andrea if one may not tell the honour of his own land to a stranger but petruccio sent him flying with grit in his ear by a brambly path they climbed monte ortonepetruccio first the others after him the newcomer as best might be then musically the goats that roundfaced blinking boy whom they called castracane was behind silvestro now much diverted by her panting efforts to go up without panting what he could rise on with closed mouth and scarcely any sharper whistling at the nose hey comrade said he grinning one sees that the jews stair was easier going for thee than ortone and he prodded her with his staff this was not friendly ippolita did her best to humour him i go up as well as i can castracane she said but do you go first if you will nay nay he replied with a chuckle i make very good practice in the rear so saying he caught her ankle in the crook of his staff and brought her down into the bushes like a running ram silvestro was hurt in his feelings all the rest laughed his latewon empire seemed slipping and it was very strange treatment for the queen of the collegio damore if wholesome she arrived wet and breathless at the top feeling moreover that she must by all means make a friend of this ugly fellow the fire was made the pot put on the pot boiled then for a time though jaws worked like millclappers it was to better purpose than words but when the last shred of garlic or last gobbet of pork had been fished up when the wineskin was flabby the last crusts memory faded from the toothpick petruccio slapped silvestro on the knee now comrade cried he well have the jew for dessert the jew the jew now for the jew went the chorus silvestro coloured the jew eh well i killed himecco the flaming logs lit up a ring of tense pale facesnot one of which silvestro saw would rest content with that the interrogatories began a dropping fire of them how did you do it with my knife of course where did you strike under the ribs i took him by his great goats beard the old dog and jerked up his headso then i drove in between his ribsping surely that would do not at all the left ribs ah did he gurgle didnt he blood choked himeh per bacco you stabbed him on the stair gia did he roll down no no he just lay where he fell why did you kill him said castracane suddenlybolt upright this was awkward silvestro fenced eh corpo di bacco why does one kill the jews the others at first took the same side why indeed the question seemed absurd did they not crucify young children and eat them afterwards did they not kill gesu cristo everybody knows that they did and as for proof look at them with a dish of pork ugh but castracane blinked his small eyes and held to it did you kill him because of gesu cristo he asked silvestro shrugged it was partly that of course what else silvestro grew hotdesperate why after all would one kill a jew something must be urged something solid there was annina you know said silvestro at his wits end anninathat girl you were with what of her castracane licked his lips well this jew you must understand was a limber young fellow young shouted the other you told me he had a great grey beard like a goat it wasnt very greynot so grey as a goats well he was always following annina about making her presents cadging for favours accidente i couldnt stand it you must know so thinking of annina and of gesu cristo and one thing and another i decided to follow him back to the via gattaand so i did andrea leaned forward hoarsely whispering blessed diversion say silvestro what colour was the jews blood silvestro opened wide those blue eyes which had wrought such havoc among the paduan nobility black andrea he whispered again black as pigs blood andrea crossed himself pio cristo he prayed let me kill a jew some day even then castracane the sceptic was not satisfied all i know is said he that i saw a jew cutting bread at the albero verde last martinmas and he slipped into his own thumb and came off as red as a dogs tongue bah damn the jew said petruccio yawning lets go to sleep boys vii castracane she woke early with the full light of day in her eyes she felt tired but not inert languid and luxurious rather and explored to the full the happiness of stretching round about her were huddled the drowsy boys on the slopes of the steep place where she lay she could see the goats browsing on lentisk and juniper acanthus bramble mountainash misty on the blue plain lay padua a sleeping city white and violetremote now and in every sense below her and her concerns the sky was without cloud very pale still glowing white at the edge the sun not yet out of the sea the freshness of the air fanned her deliciously larks were climbing the sky singing their pricksong scores of finches crossed the slopes dipping from bush to bush ippolita clasped her hands behind her head and looked lazily at all this early glory the freedom of her heart seemed explicit in that of her limbs what she could do with her legs for instance how she could sprawl at ease she was just like all the othersas ragged as dirty at least and soon she would be as brown dio buono the splendid life of a goatherd then she found that castracane was watching her out of one wicked eye he had rolled over on to his belly his face lay sideways on his hands one eye was shrewdly on her she considered him rather scared out of the corner of hers decidedly he was a sulky boyyou might say an enemy as unconcernedly as she could she got up stretched herself with elaborate ease and strolled off along the edge of the hill castracane followed her she affected not to know it but her heart began to quicken and when he was close beside her she found that she had to look at him good morning castracane says silvestro he grunted look here silvestro he began about that jew the accursed jew who so far from denying the resurrection of the dead seemed a standing proof of it was she never to have done with the jew well what about him did you kill him or not thats what about him i told you last night yes but i dont believe it what i dont believe it now then silvestro looked about for help they were out of sight of the others and there lay padua slumbrous in the plain it seemed as if castracane meant quarrelling well what must be must be i dont care whether you believe it or not now then the blue eyes were steady enough on the black by this time look here said castracane after a pause ill fight you if you like thatll settle it silvestro laughed nervously why should we fight castracane besides we have no knives how can we fight like this said the other between his teeth his left arm whipped out like a lizards tongue and silvestro lay flat on his back among the cistus flowers seeing ink and scarlet clouds stick a jew indeed cried castracane stick a grandmother why youre as soft as cheese silvestros shoulders told a tale he had turned on his face but his shoulders were enough lord lord look at that scorn in his conqueror gave way to amazement amazement to disgust disgust to contempt last came pity whod have thought such a leggy lad such a green one he was crying like a girl castracane had no malice in him he was sorry for those sobbing shoulders he stooped over the wreck he had made and tried to put it together again come silvestro he said gruffly i never meant to hurt you the wet face was up in a momentred and wet and angry its not that its not that i never killed the jewthere but i was a stranger and i tried to be friendly and you hated me i hate being hated why should you hate me what have i done this was too subtle for the youth the trouble was he said that i hit you in the right place thats the knockout blow that one morte di ercole and down you went well im sorry will that do yes yesi want no more let us be friends castracane benissimo he helped his late enemy up they kissed each other then sat together on the grassadmirable friends so you didnt kill the jew castracane began i knew it but what did you do to run away ah you mustnt ask indeed i cant tell you it was rather bad castracane looked keenly at his new friend was it a girl he said silvestro blushed yes it was a girl ah ah then i say no more i like girls myself but they get you into trouble quicker than anything you would rather not tell me any morequite sure no i cant indeed lets talk of something else how old are you seventeen im not sixteen yet is castracane your real name castracane looked pleased im glad you asked no they call me that among ourselves because of a little knack i have but my name is pilade thats a very nice name said silvestro i believe youits a splendid name theres no better its the name of a romanemperor of rome and sultan of padua he waswho killed a giant called oreste having first caused him to become a christian but why did he kill him when he had made a christian of him asked silvestro greatly interested or why did he make him a christian if he was going to kill him pouf what questions cried castracane he made him a christian because he was a good catholic himself and killed him for being a giant of course or take it this way if he hadnt been a christian how could he have made a good death he couldnt naturally so the emperor christened him first and killed him afterwardsecco its always done like that they tell me i see it now said silvestro it was very fine i like your name of pilade best i shall always call you that if you will let me call me what you like says pilade lets go and wake the others im as hungry as the devil with all this talking the result of this was that silvestro became pilades footboy his slave the lout was in clover nothing could have suited him so well no more goats to herd in the heat of the daysilvestro would do it no share of foraging for him no more milk to carry into the valley no more fires to make up nor strays to follow nor kids to carry to new pasturessilvestro would do it the luxurious rascal lay out the daylight stretched on his back with his hat over his eyes he woke only for his meals he would not be at the pains even to swathe his own legs or strap his own sandals silvestro bathed in sweat his fair skin burnt and blistered his delicate hands and smooth legs scratched by brambles his slender neck bowed beneath the weights he carried on shoulders stretched to cracking pointsilvestro worked from dawn to dusk rejoicing in the thankless office thankless it was since master pilade took no sort of notice yet silvestro gave thanks pilade allowed the other to stoop to his shoeties to wind the swathes about his sturdy calves to carry his very cloak and staff while he slouched along with hands deep in breeches pockets and his hat pulled down to his nose silvestro would proudly have carried him too had that been possible most unmanly of silvestro all this but the rogue he petted was too snug to consider it at the fallingin of night having his belly full of meat and drink which silvestro had prepared and served him with he might if the mood took him pull out his reed pipe silvestro he might say you have been useful today perhaps ill play you something and the beautiful silvestro tanned counterpart of the glorious ippolita would hang upon the melancholy noise and observe with adoring interest every twitch and distension of the fatcheeked hero and at the end sigh his content saying ah thank you pilade you have been very kind to me the truth is pilade would allow i am a goodnatured devil if you take me the right way ill tell you what silvestro you have pleased me today you may sleep at my feet if you like it will keep them warm to begin with and youll be near me dont you see thank you thank you dear pilade cried the enraptured silvestro the world is a very odd one and it is most true that the man who is for taming hearts should pursue ostensibly any other calling not that pilade had that in view he only sought to be comfortable good lad viii resurrection of the jew this idyllic state of things might have lasted no one knows how long with ippolitasilvestro finding joy in unreasonable service and pilade both ease and reason where either partner was so admirably suited it might have been interesting to see what would have happened whether ippolita would have betrayed herself or pilade found her out she was over head and ears in love but he was vastly well served and there is nothing like content for drugging the wits things however fell out otherwise the jew to begin with fell out of the grave to which he had been hastily recommended and most insecurely at that he made himself felt in a variety of ways was discovered by the gardener in the via di vanzo and stuck into a gutter in the via man di ferro he was discovered again by some one who had either less to do among christians or more among jews than the generality in padua and this time he was carried to the guard house being reported reporting himself indeed to the watch he was reported on to the capitano by him to the prefect the prefect put the subprefect who had met him before upon the lookout the most serene republic said that authority cannot have unburied jews adrift in the city without finding out why the cemetery does not hold them and why the gutter does inquire alessandro mio inquire there was a wound in the mans ribs big enough for a nest of rats alessandro bowed but raised his fine eyebrows he was at that hour most happily unhappy over the late disappearance of his glorious lady the peerless beauty of padua the incomparable ippolita was gone his business was to devise dirges monodies laments descortz in the provencal manner to cry heigho and welladay not ban or out haro to have these high frenzies these straining states of the soul disturbed by the unclaimed remains of a resolving jew was a cruel test yet he reflected within himself if his piercing love survived this inquiry it was founded on rock and indeed alessandro believed that his heart was slowly turning to stone he felt a curious chill there when he got up in the morning a dead weight a mass to lift with every choked beat perhaps the jew would end what ippolita had begun if so well but ah ippolita ippolita bella ippolita crudel ah ohime habit set him to work he instructed his officers he visited the gates questioned took notes inspected the gutter in the via man di ferro even inspected the jew he went to the via della gatta to the fatal staircase he bullied two or three landlords of two or three low taverns went to the stews to the ghetto talked very loud flourished his sword drove his men this way and thatin fine did everything that becomes a young official of spirit the result of his labours was that the jew got posthumous fame out of all proportion to his merits the city fairly hummed with him nobody talked of anything but the dead jew the goatherds coming in by the porta san zuan a day later were shrewdly scrutinised by the guard they were numbered off their names taken they were pulled about and flustered asked questions contradicted before they had time to answer and then called prevaricators because they said nothing they were in fact brought to that state of breathless hurry in which a boy will say anything you choose this as everybody knows is the only way of getting at the truth there were more of you fellows the other night said the corporal of the guard where are the rest of you come now out with it no lies here petruccio who had some sense shammed to have none but andrea less happy was a real fool at this invitation he looked wise castracane is not heretrue but it wasnt castracane he muttered and found his neck in a vice who was it then son of a pig who was it mercy mercy my lord i will tell the truth he whined as he twisted gesu morto tell anything else and i cut thy liver out hound swore the man who held him ah dio i will i will it was silvestro who killed the jew you shall come with me to the signor sottoprefetto said his holder theres a ducat for me in this affair the poor little company were driven into the gatehouse and there pent but andrea went off between two archers to be examined at greater length by messer alessandro and to give blubbering confirmation of the fact all the unfortunate particulars wrung out of silvestro on his first night of monte ortonethe stab under the ribs the jews beard his black blood etc etcwere now screwed out of andrea and went to prove his story by the twentyfour ears of the twelve apostles swore the corporal weve got him at last messere the subprefect felt that he must act upon this news so much insistence had been laid upon the affair by his chief he dared not send his lieutenant he must go himself this is what comes of neglecting newkilled jews he might have thought he little knew what was to come of it two mounted men andrea with a rope round his neck himself very splendidly booted and cuirassed made up a sufficient cavalcade to fetch home one snivelling goatherd it was four by the time they were off seven before they were at abano eight when they reached the foot of monte ortone and faced the deep chestnut woods in which that precipice dips his flanks but though it was getting dusk there were eyes sharp enough on the top of the mountain to watch for what sharp ears had hearda most unaccustomed sound in those leafy solitudestrotting horses and jingling steel castracane from the summit saw it all and what is more guessed at once what andrea in a halter meant ix pylades finds his orestes silvestro he called softly without moving from his ambush or turning his eyes from those he watched silvestro come here the obedient stripling came eagerly and knelt as close to his master as he daredjust so as to touch him eccomi pilade says he get back over the brow as fast as you can said his friend and hide in the cave wait there till i come go now do as i bid you silvestro went at once castracane squared his jaw and waited every now and then he muttered to himself with lazy lifted eyebrows it was too much trouble to shrug poor little devilit would be a shame and i knocked him down for nothing and he loves me per bacco certainly i have never been loved beforeby a man i meanexcept by my big old mother out yonder and she is a woman shell be sorryshes oldeh shes horribly old accursed most rotten ass andrea the whole story out of himand a lie at that cospetto i cant let the poor lad swing and i did knock him downand he cried like a girl but not because i grassed him by my soul ill do itthere then then he mortised his chin in his brown hands and blinked while he waited he had not so very long but you might have given him an hour it would have made no difference to castracane then the guard came reeking to the brow of the hill andrea haltered was with them alessandro mopping his head and cursing the flies came last look yonder marco said one the other said ha and pounced upon his treasure he had him by the ear and was pricking him with his sabre in the fleshy parts easy friend said castracane im not running away he went like a sheep to the subprefect andrea watched him twittering what is your name fellow said that heated officer andreas eyes yearned for his mates castracane gave him a terrible look silvestro is my name signore says he and andrea knew his game we have found our bird i think said alessandro turning to his men yes excellency this is the lad we want there was another of themcastracane they call him ah yes where is castracane fellow he is over venda gone to noventa to his mother replied castracane well we dont want him so far as i know now attend to me you are suspected of that business in the via della gatta castracane shrugged chi lo sa says he we shall see about that meantime what have you to urge castracane scratched his head what would you have me say messere i am a poor lad you are many and i am one alessandro turned to his archers bring him down to the hermitage he said i am going to eat something tie him up and wait for me there you can let the other go this is the lad fast enough avanti so the shackles were taken off andreas raw wrists and transferred to castracanes the neck halter was shifted castracane was bond andrea free then messer alessandro went down the hill to what supper the hermit could afford in about half an hour silvestro who had been fidgeting in the cave came out restless to have stayed so long beyond sight or hearing of his pilade his reception by andrea was shocking the gaping boy sprang forward with his arms out ha here is a terrible affair he wailed our castracane is taken and for your fault he will be hanged and for you make your supper of it you jewjerker what sacrifice dio mio there has been nothing like it i suppose since giulio cesare kissed brutus or judas gesu cristo you kissed him this morning you know you did you always do you blushfaced sneak and for that kiss he has taken your sins upon him and is to be hanged fie judas fie oh madonna maria the terrible affair so ending as he began he danced about the hilltop wringing his hands but silvestro very pale came quickly up and laid hold of him tell me all andrea says he for i know nothing except that i love castracane and will save him who has taken him it is a lordthe sottoprefettothe hooknosed gentleman with thin eyebrows him they call messer alessandro castracane is tied like a netted calfhis hands behind him and them to his neck whats the good of his strength he is as strong as the town bull but if he writhes his hands he strangles and if he thrusts his neck he chokes ecco silvestro was staring down into the valley where is messer alessandro andrea tell me quickly for i can save castracane he is eating with the hermit in the wood but what can you do you stay here said silvestro with decision thats what you can do ill go down the sound of breaking through undergrowth was followed by rapping at the hermits door what do you want boy said the pious man to the ragged figure in the dark messer alessandro my reverendmesser alessandro at once are you come about the jew he will bear no more he is eating he tells me he knows more about the jew than he does about our holy religionwhich is a dangerous state of things except that he is sick to death of him it is not about the jew father said silvestro out of breath tell him it is aboutippolita va bene said the hermit stay where you are messer alessandro dropped his tools with a clatter wiped his mouth beat his breast and began to walk up and down the cell send him in hermit send him in forty ducats if he has any news ten ducats in any case for bringing my thoughts from jews on earth to ippolita in paradise despatch despatch send me the goatherd the pale apparition of a fairhaired boy timid in rags cloaked in rusty black with bandaged legs and his old felt hat crushed against his breast stood in the doorway oh boy cried alessandro gesticulating with one hand may you be my hermes my swiftfoot messenger tell me what you know of the divine ippolita i know where she is signor sottoprefetto says silvestro huskily tell me by venus and all her doves for answer the blushing boy looked appealingly at alessandro with eyes so deeply limpidly searchingly blue with lips so tenderly parted with a smile fluttering so timidly and limbs so drooping under their disguise yet so quickly transformed from frightened lads to bashful beautys that saints of the heavenly courtah god of love cried alessandro and the subprefect fell upon his knees before the goatherd later you might have seen that same goatherd enthroned in the hermits armchair his hands locked in his lap his legs modestly disposed his head gracefully bowed a blush on his burnt cheeks his long lashes casting a shade his breath coming and going with a pretty hasteand at his feet a splendid gentleman booted and cuirassed who poured out voluble assurances of eternal respect of love undying of the sovranty of venus urania and the communion of beautiful minds i will see you again yes i will certainly see you again since you so desire it said silvestro after a good deal of this and i will give you what you ask if it is in my power but you must trust me so far you must go away from here and wait till i send word i shall owe you every gratitude every reward i can give you now however you must let me go and i must take with me the goatherd who is as innocent of the jews death as i am ah i will do all that you wish sighed alessandro sacred lady i will do it but surely you will have pity upon a humble slave who has served you long and faithfully and now is putting himself in peril for your pleasure pay me my poor fee lady enrich me boundlessly with what costs you so little so he urged until well says silvestro i will do it rise up messere take what you will messer alessandro shut his eyes and slowly rose to his feet having kissed the goatherds hand he very delicately kissed the goatherds proffered cheek i am paid immeasurably most holy one he said lead now i will do what you desire out sped silvestro into the wood the subprefect bareheaded behind him in a glade not far from the hermitage sat the two archers the horses were tethered to one tree castracane to another seeing their chief the men sprang to attention their astonishment at what followed was no greater than castracanes silvestro that timid slave now as bold as brass walked straight to him the subprefect tiptoeing behind loose him signore says silvestro the subprefect with a knife cut his bonds your will is done thank you signor alessandro god be with you come pilade silvestro took castracane by the hand but not before the gentleman had kissed his own with profound respect then silvestro led his friend away through the trees and the subprefect was understood to say we have been on the wrong scent men mount to the cityavanti whats all this whither now stammered castracane silvestro squeezed his hand oh dearest let us go to the cavelet us go to the cave on the hill castracane felt his friend trembling trembling is infectious he began to tremble too yes yes we will go to our cave he agreed in a quick whisper x cymon finds his iphigenia they struggled upwards through the bushwood and starry flowers it was a scented night the air heavy with the burden of midsummer the fireflies spread a jewelled web before their faces great white moths flapped and droned about them on they pushed their hands locked through all hazards of brake or briar neither would let go for a whole world but silvestro was always in front leading castracane for this once one knew the way as well as another but silvestro led it they rounded the hilltop here we are at last said silvestro let us sit here and look at the splendour of the night oh pilade oh dear friend how couldst thou do so much for me what else could i do said he gruffly you never killed the pigjew nor did you pilade tell me why you gave yourself up because you didnt do it of course but you didnt do it either well but i knocked you down did you do it because of that or becausebecause you like me pilade grunted suppose i did silvestro sighed and leaned his head on his friends shoulder o wondrous night said he whispering look the stars are like moons it was certainly a wonderful nighta night of enormous silence of great steady stars of golddusted air of a sky like a purple dome encrusted with jewelled lights the two boys sat together blinking at so much speechless glory castracanes arm was round his fellows shoulder that fellows lips parted and his breath came soft and eageryet too quickly for ease it was certainly a night of wonder castracanes arm slipped down to silvestros waist silvestro sighed and snuggled into the haven it made o holy night said he now might miracles happen and we be by ah said castracane the miracle of choice would be an angel with a basket of bread and cheeseor a beautiful maiden to come and lie in ones arms silvestro thrilled castracane gave a responsive squeeze and went on i am not too sure you must know that one has not happened already to see you lead that signore by the nose you came swimming among the treestems like an angel you might have knocked me down with a feather and how he kissed your hand miracles why if you had been the maiden i dream about he couldnt have been more respectful if you want miracles for example i do want them pilade i want them very much silvestro sighed again and leaned his cheek till it touched his friends a shock transfused castracane he was caught by the starry influences suddenly he turned his mouth towards that blushing flower and kissed silvestro silvestro thrilled but lay close buon dio ecco miracolo said castracane hoarsely and kissed again again his nestling companion gave no sign but a quiver castracane surveyed the stars a miracle has certainly happened he said i feel very queer my head swims fingers and toes tingle i seem to have hot lead in my legs it may be that i am empty i think it is a miracle but as yet i see no angel some quicker thrill of what he held made him look at silvestro at the same moment silvestro slowly turned his head and looked at him what each saw in the others face beyond a white moonshape what shining of truth in the eye what expectancy what revelation in the lips i know not two pair of lips at least met and stayed together o dio oh pilade oh carissimo she abandoned herself to joy you are the angel the miracle you are no no i am not an angel but oh i love you dearly ah la madonna i am ippolita i love you you love me you are mine thencome andrea said castracane next morning i think the others will be back before noon you must wait here till they come i am going to take silvestro over la venda to see my mother and confess to our curate it is good for the soul silvestro looks well this morning said andrea with his mouth full of bread what a colour of dawn what shining eyes he would make a proper madonna for a mysteryeh he would said castracane laconically a most proper madonna with a bambino on his lapeh silvestro silvestro blushed castracane pinched his cheek which made matters worse they took the road together through the deep hedges of the valley monte venda rose before them dark with woods castracanes arm was round silvestros waist every twenty yards they stopped to think of it cried castracane on one of these breathless halts you to be like any one of usbreeched clouted swathedand a lovely lass within your shirtmadonna do you think me lovely asked ippolita devoutly i have heard that till i have been sick to death of it but from you i shall never be tired of knowing it blessed angel oh pilade my love they loitered on you see that i am not what you thought me said ippolita with an arch look you thought i had killed a jew never per bacco cried castracane that ill swear to you thought i was a boy even last night dearest but that he denied santissimo did i treat you like a boy i ask you you knocked me down once pilade every honest man knocks his wife down once said pilade gravely and then you kissed me i can kiss you again said pilade and did i repeat padua is a freakish city the subprefect writes madrigals in vain castracane the goatherd sends silvestro sprawling and wins the golden ippolita for a willing bride what are we to make of it deus nobis haec otia fecit the duchess of nona lanima semplicetta che sa nulla salvo che mossa da lieto

leghorn having on board amilcare passavente and donna maria his wife bound as all believed for that port and thence by long roads to their country of adoptionnot pisa nor lucca nor any place tuscan but nona in the march of emilia no erasmus was not the only traveller whirled about by english kisses nor molly lovel the only simple witch in turn bewitched ii amilcare commerce and the affections molly was a handsome fool let there be no doubt about that there was no romance in her though sentiment enough she lacked the historic sense and if she thought of rome at all supposed it a collocation of warehouses jetties and a church or twoan unfamiliar wapping upon a river with a long name her sensations on the voyage were those of seasickness on the goldenhazy campagna those of homesickness unaffected affectation of any sort was far from her if she was happy she showed her white teeth if wretched she either pouted or cried if she liked you there were kisses if she distrusted you she grew red but she distrusted no one why should she since every act of hers was in seeming a caress of personal intention every one loved her as for her husband when he was not sacramentally engaged he mutely raved to the stars protesting by his dimmed eyes moving lips and strainedout arms how every breath she took was to him also an inspiration her frankness the truth lucent in her eyes her abounding receptivityfor she believed everything she was told and objected to nothingher sweet long body the tired grace with which she carried her lovely head her tender stroking ways the evenness of her temper which only that of her teeth could surpassall this threatened to make of amilcare a poet or a saint something totally disparate to his immediate proposals his nature saved him for the game which his nature had taught him in that great game he had to play molly though he loved her dearly must be he saw his prime counter coming to england to negotiate bills of exchange he had molly thrown in she would do more for him than rosenobles he ecstatised over his adorable capture but saw no reason in that why he should not lay it out to advantage it would not cheapen in the chaffer on the contrary give him the usufruct for a few years and he would be not only the happiest but the most considerable of men triumphant bacchus so he mused to himself what had he not gained a years pay for his men the confidence of the signori of nona the acclamations of the piazza and the council chamber at onceand molly lovel hey that was best of all for her sake and by her means he would be capitano del popolo what else that would do for a beginning if molly could turn his head she could turn other heads he supposed a turned head meant a disponable body a bending back an obsequious knee even a carcase at a quick hands discretion votes in council delirium in the piazza te deum in the church amilcare knew his countrymen he that knows them half as well will have no trouble in conceiving how these tradecalculations can consist with a great deal of true love and what was amilcares trade his trade was politics the stock whereof was the people of nona the shifty chattering lightweight spawn of one of those little burntbrick and white cities of the lombard plainset deep in trees domed belfried full of gardens and fountains and public placeswhich owed their independence to being too near a pair of rival states to be worth eithers conquering there were some score of these strewn over southern emilia and romagna in those days and the time was almost at hand and with it the man to sweep them all into one common net of wretchedness but amilcare had no clear thought of that for the moment nona was as peaceful as forli or rimini or pesaro or faenza thanks to him and his centaursthat famous band of free riders he had levied from the tuscan hills very much at his mercy safe under the eye of his trusted secretary awaiting his return he fully intended that peace to continue when she fell huddling to him it would indeed be his care for it was a maxim of italian politics that no man willingly stirs after dinner the situation was still pretty delicate he had done little more than win foothold in the late struggles with parma he had intrigued with great address sold himself and his centaurs to farnese brought that thicknecked hero up to the very walls of nona then in the nick of time resold himself at double the price to the city he was besieging and routed his yesterdays master by an attack in flank just as the nonesi were carrying the trenches in front in the excitement of that wonderful hourfarnese in full flight himself borne on mens shoulders round the piazza thanksgiving in the cathedral clouds of incense clashing bells wine running in the fontana delle graziehe had for a moment been tempted to believe the times ripe for a proclamation amilcar dei gratia nonarum dux etc he had his treble wages in his pocket the hearts of the whole city throbbing at his feet he was a young man tempted he certainly was but grifone the secretary touched his elbow and showed a straightened lip he would not risk it he contented himself with a footing the palazzo bagnacavallo rentfree and the title of gonfalonerius populorum libertatis which looked passably well about a broad seal pater patriae nonarum dux the control of the breadtaxall should be added to him in time if only the borgia could be fed elsewhere at the thought of that hearty eater stalled in the vatican he felt that he might indeed thank god for his lovely molly with her for decoy even that gamebird might be lured lying on the poop of the santa fina his dark eyes questing over her face her hands among his curls he seemed to molly the wonder of the world so of her world he was but he meant to be that of his owna very different world he was a lithe various creature this amilcare passavente his own paradox quick as a bird of prey he was and at times as inert dark as night eaglefaced flatbrowed stiff and small in the head cleanfeatured with decisive lips a very fluent speaker hoarse in voice but cunning in the vibrations he could lend it he was in action as light and fierce as a flame at rest as massive as a block of stone impervious to threats or prayers or tears women loved him easily men followed him blindly and both for the same reasonthat they believed him ruthless to all but themselves ruthless indeed he had been and was to all and sundry molly was the one apparent exception and in her eyes he was perfect for her immediate comfort this may have been true of him he was a brave lover he taught her to falter endearments in his own tongue he was carino caro amico anima mia sovrano del mio cuor and many other things yet more intimate in return he gave her a homage which was not without a certain depth because it was done with foresight he taught her to be his slave by professing himself hers and so touching her generosity as well as her humility at all this she was very apt there was a fund of deep affection in the girl the makings of an excellent wife a devoted motherfar more stuff than should go to serve as toy for a mans idle hours also she was very demonstrative by no means averse quite the contrary indeed to demonstrations on his part she loved to walk belted by his arm loved to put her head on his shoulder or have her chin lifted that eyes or lips might be kissed these favours which his nation was accustomed to keep at home she wore without selfconsciousness abroad it enchanted amilcare not only as a thing beautiful in itself but as a clear source of profit in his schemes he pictured the havoc she would work in a hall full of the signorikeen men allwhen she sailed through the rooms offering her lips to whoso would greet them english fashion why the whole city would be her slaveeh and more than the city bentivoglio of bologna il moro of milan ordelaffi manfredi farnese the borgia the gonzaga deste of ferrara riario montefeltro orsiniby the saint of padua he would face them each with his beautiful wife charm them turn their heads and thenping let the neatest wrist win the odd trick very pleasant schemes of witchery and silent murder did he make as the santa fina drove him through the dark blue waters on his honeymoon and at last brought him up to point out to his adoring instrument a low golden shore a darker line of purple shadow beyond and in the midst a white tower which gleamed like snow civitavecchia my queen among ladies rome beyond it beyond that nonanona and glorious life for thee and me he cried as he waved her towards these splendid things but molly snuggled closer to him and sighed he very sensitive to alien moods was conscious of the jar you are sad beloved he asked her softly you are thinking of your own land no no dearest not that now i was thinking onlybut it is foolishness of a fool said molly hiding her face you cannot be a fool blessed one since you are not so much as human as i see you now he whispered holding her close you are a rosy god at this moment my treasure you are all colour of dawn auroral colour of tender fires tell me your thought my holy one she whispered it back it wasthat you will be full of business at nona amilcare you will have no time to love your poor molly the rogue was fishing for protestations and got them love you he cried ah tell me how long i have to live and i will tell you the hours of my love o my soul but you will be abroad ahorseback with your captains in the tents why yes that must be so he owned but i shall love you the more for that molletta she pretended to pout fidgeted in his arm arched her neck but how shall i know it amilcare if i am not there by what i do to you when i return dearest love cried he and thereafter speaking by signs was better understood iii market covert they made rome a day or two after that little tender and exchange of vows having disembarked amid a crowd of clamorous amilcares in ragsshe could see some dear trait of him in each trailed across the bleached marches with the sabine hills like a blue hem beyond caught the sun at cervetri and entered the dusty town by the porta cavalleggieri on one of those beaten white noons when the shadows look to be cut out of ebony and the wicked old walls forbidden to keep still the very dust seems alive quivering and restless under heat st peters church smothered in rush mats was abuilding the marble blocks had the vivid force of lightning two or three heretic friars were being hailed by the ponte sant angelo to a burning in the vatican molly was almost blind had a headache a backache and a heartache amilcare who had fallen in with a party of lancers by the way had ridden for a league or two in vehement converse with their lieutenant to him there seemed more to say than ever to her she felt hurt and wanted to cry at their inn they learned the newsthat is amilcare learned it for molly was languishing upon a bed forgotten and mercifully forgetting pretty news it was don cesare it appeared had stabbed the duke of gandia his brother three nights ago and thrown him into the tiber the body had only been fished out yesterday it had nine wounds in it including one in the throat big enough to put your fist in it was a sieve not a body perforated his holiness ah he could be heard even here howling in the vatican like a bitch in an empty house don cesare was in hiding reported at foligno tomorrow there was to be a holy conclaveall the cardinals god knew what alexander had or had not in his mind the consciencestricken old dog it was known what he had not in his house at least vannozza had been thrice refused admission so also la bella lucrezia think of it this was very grave news to amilcares private ear cesare was his deadly enemy the one man he honestly feared the one man consequently he wanted to meet he was still brooding over it when the broadbacked butcher they call il drudo slammed him on the back fortune is with you passaventethe slut she gives you time to breathe the borgia had a sinking of the stomach he hankered after a filling of lombard sausage a little while since gandia cut in and cesare cut in per bacco but mark my words amilcare the appetite will return you will have the duke in your march before many days therefore my advice to you isavoid foligno fortify nona amilcare looked his man in the face and my advice to myself galeotto isseek foligno and so fortify nona addio he went out like a man who has found his way now what the devil did the fellow mean by that cried il drudo with his thick fingers out devilry expresses it said a sly secretary in black molly in dreams soft as a child and glossy with sleep looked too beautiful for a disturbing hand to dare anything that night it would have been the act of a brute not amilcares act in small things he was all gentleness he crept into bed like a cat fearful of waking her and next morning contrived by a fit of coughing to waken her no more than half the rest he did by methods equally adroit until by imperceptible degrees she learned that rome might give no ease to her feet he had her in the saddle and all the baggagemules away an hour after the sun arrived at foligno he found that his great enemy was at sanctuary in the convent of olivet biting his nails in a red fume there hidden behind spires of cypress olivet stood outside the walls a sundyed white building deep under brown eaves cesare it was reported was quite alone with his moods now consumed by fidgety remorse for what he might have lost in his brothers blood now confident and inclined to blusterous hilarity now shuddering under an obsession of nerves in any guise he was dangerous but worst of all when the black fit of suspicion was upon him so he now seemed for being told who waited upon him he refused pointblank to see anybody amilcare at the door heard his vattene vattene non seccami out out dont pester me rocking down the dim passages of the house and molly whom this sudden new expedition had bereft of what wit she had turned pale to hear the roaring beast ah love love love let us run away i like not this empty place whimpered the girl holding her husbands arm but he gently removed her hand kissed it and held it courage dear one i shall be by thy side much depends upon this adventure he urged in fervent whispers knowing how much to a tittle to the monk who came out distended with cesares explosives he addressed himself in a vernacular too fluid for molly to catch up i pray you reverend brother recommend me yet once more to the feet of his resplendency saying that not i alone supplicate his favours add that i have with me to present my most beautiful wife that she may assure him with her own lips how very much she is his slave the pantomime of piteous beseeching hands of eyebrows exquisitely arched told more than his words they showed to a hairs breadth how far he expected how far was prepared to tempt his customer no pedlar before a doorful of girls sidelong heads could more deftly have marketed his wares the monk too sidled his head he pursed his mouth furrowed with a finger in his dewlap tried to appraise the wares but to allow this would have been to forestall the market ah for love of the saints go my brother he was entreated with gentle persistence and so worked upon he waddled away amilcare let fall a hearty sigh and considered molly with anxiety he had not dared to say a word to her of what her entertainer was or what her part should be premeditation might throw her out of balance conscious art might exhibit her a scheming courtesan just in her artlessness lay all her magic no no he trusted her she was still adorably englishwitness her on the ship he could see how she would do how the sight would ravish him lover as he was for the rest he must trust to his early calculations yes he was ready to stake everything upon this move the borgia would be at her feet so at his feet also oh wise wise amilcare his eminence the duke will receive your lordship said the returning monk and turned once more to lead the way my saint my lamb my meek burnished dove breathed amilcare in a glow and pressed her to his heart behind the frates broad back cesare magnificently tawny in black velvet was in a window raking with a white hand at his beard a prey evidently to crosstides of fever when his visitors were announced he looked sharply round but molly was hooded her face deep in the shade of passavente he had not the slightest concern that hero was prostrate bowing and chattering and explaining with his hands molly stayed twittering by the door wonderful because she saw her king of men cringing like a footboy before a shorter than himself true it was case of a duke but she had not known such dealings in wapping there men doffed caps to my lord or his grace they gave and took their due but did not writhe on the floor and then this particular dukes blockish inattention to what her lord was saying filled her with concern there he leaned and there he looked out of window at the twinkling acacias and there he picked his beard amilcares tact must have deserted him since he could let this simple slave turn critic but the part in any case was difficult presently the duke threw him a hasty phrase a sort of pish man which cut him off in the midst of a period and walked towards molly in the doorway amilcare flew before on tenterhooks cesare came graciously onit was curious to see how his face had cleared molly dropped a curtsy covering herself closer with a hand at the hoods tie cesare showed his teeth held out both his hands passavente with a displaying air full of alacrity and deference unveiled his wife and she went forward to greet his grace she had been uncovered as by a dealer but even so thrilled to feel his touch upon her shoulders and showed herself blushing with the emotion lovelier for love cesare was really startled to see how vividly beautiful she was but with more command of himself than the other trafficker was careful not to show it he smiled yet more sunnily his words were some pleasant friendly compliment molly guessing it so came nearer took his open hands and put up her face for his kiss caesar borgia took a deep breath before he accepted of the rest then he did kiss her twice he was ridiculously pleased very much in confusion for a little while since he could say nothing and she had nothing to say the pair of them stood handclasped smiling dimeyed and red in the face like two glad childrenamilcare anxious mothering hen clucking about them the duke having recovered himself murmured some courtesy and led his captive to a seat in the window his halfdozen english words and her six italian his readiness her simplicity put matters on a friendly footing very soon molly was chattering like a schoolgirl cesare was enchanted he recovered his gaiety forgot his bloody hands his anxieties schemes fret at inaction he ordered a meal to be served at once kept molly close to his side heaped her plate pledged her in wine he went so far as to forget all common precautions and eat whatsoever was put before him be sure amilcare missed nothing he saw all perhaps more than all he was used to deal with men thought he to himself hey if this was my house of nona amico and the time six months hence you would sleep where you supped but cesare had no thought of amilcare until the end then he clapped him on the shoulder my passavente he cried you have gone far on your pearlfishing and dived deeper than most of us but by our hope of salvation you have found a jewel of price and ah madonna he said with his burning eyes on the girl you have brought the sun into italy you shall be called principessa della pace who heal all sorrow and strife by the light of your face i humbly thank your grace said molly very grateful but amilcare dropped upon one knee splendour says he deign to visit our poor house in nona if you would learn what willing service is my friend be sure of me said the borgia and meant it do you bid me come princess his looks ate her up molly hung her head i shall in all things serve your grace said she with a curtsy she kissed him again and then amilcare took her away the borgia wrote sonnets that night mollavella pearl of ladies whispered her ardent husband when they were on the north road and in the thick of the violet roman night never have i felt such joy in you as this day he looked up at the massed company of the stars fiery in all that galaxy yonder i see my own star he cried in a transport behold it points us dead to the north o star lit by a star tis you have set it burning clear my glorious princess dearest heart i shall die of love sighed swooning molly out of herself at such praise but indeed i have done little enough for you as yet more than you think or can dream he answered and spoke truly for the girl saw nothing in their late visit but a civility done to a great lord if the duke comes to nona amilcare i will try to put him at his ease she said after a little try try dear soul it is all that i wish he seemed not so to me when first we went to him amilcare amilcare shrugged eh per la madonna he began as who should say being known for his brothers butcher how should he be but he stayed in time he has many enemies he added quietly iv market overt nona little city of domes and belfries and square loggias all in a cluster behind brown walls with gates of roman masonry stolid lombard church a piazza of colonnades and restless poplar trees of a splayed fountain where the three graces back to back spurt water from their breasts of bronzenona in our time is not to be discerned from the railway although you may see its ranked mulberrytrees and fields of maize and guess its pleasant seat in the plain well enough it is about the size of parma a cheerful leisurely place abounding in shade and deep doorways and cafes having some thirty churches mostly baroque a fine palazzo della ragione in the principal square and the remains of a cathedral of the ninth century glooming behind a monstrous facade of the seventeenth all whitewash cornucopias and sprawling apostles thus it seems now to the strayed traveller who breaking his journey at castel bolognese simmers for four hours in an omnibus along with priests flies fleas and old women the cortege from papal territory saw a vastly different city of it when it approached the gates in the early spring of the young leafage shimmered like a veil of golden gauze the poplar buds were pink and brown the chestnuts had all their candles afire larks by dozens were abroad in the clear sky below the old rocca del capitan vecchioa grizzled and blind block of masonry on a spur of limestone which held not a few of ezzelins secretstwo miles from nona stood a company of boys and girls in white garments their laps full of flowers their shrill song of welcome hailed the riders and to the same hopeful music they went on the towers were all standing in those days the battlements intact at every gate stood a guard the cathedral of the santi apostoli had no apostles its great front was a cube of unfinished brick but colonnades ran in all the streets row after row of beautifully ordered arches over them were jutting cornices enriched with dancing children sea monsters tritons dolphins nymphs blowing conches nereus thetis and all their sleek familiars moulded in red clay the fountain shone the displayed graces jetted their crystal store from every window hung carpets on every tower a gonfalon from every church belfry came the riot of bells the people were massed at the gates at the windows on roofs and loggias and balconiesa motley of orange and blue crimson and green soldiers lined the ways priests with banners were on the steps of their churches evviva amilcare evviva madonna inglese ran like a river of sound from the gates about the streets until in the piazza grande where the signoria waited in the solemn estate of brocade and ermine the volume of it had the throbbing roll of breakers on a cliff thud upon thud came evviva each with a shock which made pale molly catch her breath more than once or twice her eyes swam and she felt herself wag helpless in the saddle but amilcare snuffing wine was in his glory idol of a crowd he despised and meant to rule proud he looked and very greatly a ruler firmlipped with a high head and a flush on his dark cheeks at the steps of the palazzo della ragione he halted cap in hand the trumpeters shrilled for silence the secretary of the republic read a latin speech everybody applauded what nobody understood amilcare at the end of it swung off his horse and ran up the steps he embraced the orator embraced the signori one after another greetings flashed about tears laughter clappings on the back but he kept his head throughout it was seen that he wished to present his wife present her enthusiasm grew frenzied he had to battle his way down the steps to regain her side he lifted her lightly down hand in hand they went up the steps again molly excelled herself was the wonder of the whole city how she curtsied to their lordshipswhat a figure she had for that gracehow tall how supple and how slim when she gave her rosy cheek to each in turn there was a kind of caught sob audible in the crowd the simplicity of the act brought tears to tender eyes men laughed or looked haggard according as the trouble took them women more at home with tears clung to each other as they cried a marvel all believed heran angel clean from heaven the kiss of peace la bocca della carita a young dominican became inspired he showed the whites of his eyes he spumed at the lips began to mutter with gurglings in the throat at last his words broke strangling from himo mouth of singular favour o lips of heavenly dew he stuttered with a finger on high seesawing to the rhythm o starry eyes conversant with the aspect of angels he dropped down plump in a fit barely heard at the palace door but all the square surged with his cryo mouth of singular favour o starry eyes evviva madonna men and women all told molly must have been forty times kissed twice forty times would not have sufficed for the candidates who jostled strained and prayed between the soldiers pikes below the steps it would be difficult to say which sex her pretty artlessness pleased the more she made the women cry the old men prophesy the young men dream dreams certainly there was nobody who thought ill of her for a performance so glaringly counter to italian ways whose men kiss each other while they keep their women at home the thing was so transparent done in such pure good faith there was no room for judgment in it she went among that people as in these days a child still might go to those bulletheaded captains grim and shaven close to those painted great ladies whose bare necks looked the more naked for their jewels to those cruddled berobed old men to the dapper sons of them to their stifflaced daughtersmolly went blushing smiling shy and glad and to each she gave her fresh cheek and the balm of her english lips o mouth of singular favour o starry eyes she bereft them of compliments by her speechless welcome overcame policy by having none led captivity captive amilcare might hover behind her with plots a delighted and forgotten shade molly lovel of bankside was duchess of nona and might have been queen of italy if all italy had stood in the piazza grande she was throned at a banquet escorted home by the signoria bareheaded she was serenaded all night by relays of citizens by straining poets by all kinds of music she had not a wink of sleep till morning nor the faintest idea what it was all about there was no withstanding the popular voice the nonesi went mad to be a duchy with molly for duchess amilcare might be thrown in they besieged the bagnacavallo cortile they wrote sonnets and madrigals and sang them day in day out amilcare acting with admirable discretion kept very much to himself he sent his beautiful wife on to the balcony twice a day to be saluted and more sparingly let her work for him among the higher sort with her lips her blushes and her friendly grey eyes he was humble in the council sober beneath the heapedup honours of the popular voice stern only with his mercenaries a fortnight of this swept him to the top of his hopes a deputation with a laurel crown and the title of dux in a casket waited upon him he had expected it for a week and carefully dragooned his molly i must refuse the thing he told her for your dear sake my angel the fatigues the affairs of a ruler of state are incredible i will never let you bear them the signori may pluck their beards out by the roots i am resolved molly wept to hear him when the great morning camea luminous april day of showers and warm windhe was as good as his word molly shining with pride in him herself wearing the days uncertain glory saw him fold his arms in face of the pompous line of men his seniors compress his mouth shake his cropped head the deputation was much taken aback the crowd drove hither and thither she saw head turned to head guessed at wounds which certainly any one there was incapable of feeling she however felt them rose up from her chair laid a hand upon her lords arm they saw her plead with him oh lovely sight with her they too began to plead pieta di nona signore pieta di noi madonna she was their graceful choragus or rather she like some slim daughter of the greeksiphigenia or anothervoiced the protagonists part and they wailed after her a chorus of elders finally she knelt to him wound her arms about his hips put up her entreating face the comedy was played out amilcare showed himself shaken he stooped to her lifted her in his arms embraced her o mouth of singular favour etc the convocation broke up in sobs psalmody and kisses on the cheek amilcare and his wife were led to the broad window and out on to the loggia there stood molly in all the glow of her happy toil quickbreathing enraptured laughing and afire the crown was on her head by her side her sceptred lord and below the people cheered and howled udite citt adini il vostro capitano cried the heralds duca duca evviva amilcare duca cried the throng then amilcare pointed to the crowned girl evviva la madonna di nona he brayed like a tube of brass so as madonna di nona they knew her to the end amilcare was crowned with his laurel wreath in the santi apostoli te deum was sung nona started on her new careerbenevolent despotism tempered by a girls kisses v grifoneamateur of sense grifone must now be lifted into the piece grifone the greyeyed selfcontained little secretary whose brain seemed quicksilver whose acts those of a deliberate cat whose inches were few whose years only tender one of amilcares rare acts of unpremeditated humanity had been to snatch him a naked urchin of nine from barga when after a night surprise he was raining fire and sword and the pains of hell upon that serried stronghold of the hills eh signore signore had whined the halffamished imp padding by the condottieres stirrup va via vattene al diavolo a musketeer growled at him and tried to club him down amilcare looked as one might idly glance at a shrewmouse in the path he saw a brown body pitifully lean a shock black head a pair of piercing grey eyes further he saw that the child had not on a stitch of clothing and that he was splashed to the knees with drying blood what now baby he asked lift me into the saddle signore said the boy with a propitiating grin i am getting my feet wet the little dog had a humorous twist to his eyebrow and it was true enough that the kennels were running red whose blood is that on your legs my lad passavente stayed his charger grifone shrugged misericordia who knows my fathers perhaps my mothers more certainly since my father ran away my mother would have run too but she had no time eh take me up signore i cannot swim amilcare swung him up by the hand so saved his life next day grifone saved his they burnt a monastery in the plain and ransacked a chestful of correspondence death of christ swore passavente i cant read this latin go and fetch me a monk and a rope the monk a plausible rogue began to read little grifone stood by the table at a certain point he broke into the recital with an emphatic word liar what the deuce does this mean fumed amilcare in a rage the monk is deceiving your lordship said grifone the sense is the opposite of what he reports it seemed that the boy knew latinat any rate enough to hang a few monks hanged the poor devils were and after that very much was made of grifone amilcare took him through all his campaigns had him well taught gave confidence for confidence and found by the time he was at nona making his gran tradimento of farnese that he could not get on without him the accepted remedy for such a state of the case was to kill the youth at once amilcare did not do that and at first was able to bless himself for his second forbearance grifone was privy to all his masters hopes and safeguards grifone wrought upon the signoria cajoled the clergy bamboozled the popolani descended even to the ragamuffins in the gutters and taught them how to shout duca duca when his master went proudly ahorseback or to scribble his effigy in great chalk circles on the city walls though it may be true that mollys graces brought amilcare the crown of nona it must be added that neither molly nor her duke could have got in at all if grifone had not been there to oil the hinges of the gates he had the soft purring ways of a cat the tact of a jesuit the penetration of a moneylender the sensibility of a musical amateur and the morals of a maidofhonour he had extraordinary command over himself he seemed able to do everything and wishful to win nothing there never was a young man as a matter of fact who wanted so much or asked so little it was the very boundlessness of his desires which reined him in the appetite of the caesars would not have represented his all the gratification they could have commanded would have been for him but a whet if he had a weak side it was his own astuteness he could not always see how unutterably foolish a man might be if he were let alone another foible he hadintellectual appreciation of beauty pushed to faintingpoint his senses were so straitly tied to his brains that to pluck at one was to thrill the other made on a small scale he was pretty rather than handsome had quiet watchful eyes a smiling mouth very little hands and feet he seldom dressed out of black velvet and if he wanted a man assassinated had the thing done at so many removes that it was always entered private quarrel or love affair in the reports of the city watch he generally chose friars for business of the sort because they could be about at night without suspicion and their hanging sleeves gave them such a pull for cup or fruit work he found ladies the only possible agents no one in nona would dream of taking wine from a man and as for presents of figs grifone was maturely of opinion that the last and present pontiffs had exhausted that pretty artifice finally you can easily understand how useful duke amilcare found a demure lad of this kind in the matter of moulding his new state when his master brought him a mistress he gave her great attention like all clever fellows he was at first disposed to set down her simplicity to her credit but after watching her for some time he decided that here was actually a soul clear as glassthing of inestimable value in a country where lying was an axiom of politicsand his respect for her quickened into something more if she had been only beautiful she would never have attracted him as she did there were plenty of women in italy handsome enough for his needs the flower of whose amours were mostly for the mind but simpletons were rarer this tall wistful girl told the truthbut told it incredibly think of this shortly after the coronation bentivoglio the chalkfaced tyrant of bologna came with an army on his way to forli he had an old grudge against nona finding himself within a league of its walls his men lusty and wellfed his artillery in great train nona as he judged it in fermenthe blockaded the place and in due time summoned it to surrender amilcare laughed at him told his wife in secret that he would attack on the morrow and went to the council while he was there came a new summons from bentivoglio a messenger with a white flag word was sent to the duke the duke could not be found oh said one seek madonna for answer this was done tell the lord of bologna says molly that we attack tomorrow the man bowed himself away you should have seen amilcares face when this was reported to him he rated his lovely molly like a fishfag then he had an interview with grifone told him the whole story grifone stared ebbene monsignore said he your grace will do well to attack attack man when the fellow knows we are coming are you mad not so my lord replied the secretary bentivoglio does not know you are coming what he knows is that you have said you are coming well at last amilcare saw what grifone had seen from the first the mad results which might be won by a truthtelling duchess the nonesi did attack bentivoglio of course not expecting them was scattered over the maize fields and never collected his force again until his own territory was reached that was why he could not help the lady of forli per bacco said grifone to himself truth in italy is soused in the mud at the wells bottom in england it seems to lie in a pan this pretty creature is as shallow as a crystal cup where you may study truth like a blue jewel in an inch of water he went about thoughtfully the rest of that day this newdiscovered quality of mollys was a thing very beautiful in his eyes the conclusion he came to was that he was about to fall in love with the lady and that after all was his comment might not be a bad thing if as is probable it become necessary to make her my consort then he went happily to sleep grifones proposals to himself were still very simple shortly they were to get a throne for his master in order that he might the more easily acquire one for himself my legs he said frankly are too short to get up without a footstool amilcare was to have been the footstool but then molly came into play at first she seemed to make the simple thing simpler amilcare was a strong man but stiff grifone was sure he would bungle in his handling of molly this truthtelling beauty this flawless jewel in a cup would baffle him he would neither see it the fine nor the delicate tool it was he worked best with a bludgeon which as it did brutes work might be brutishly handled so far wellhe might trust amilcare to wreck himself unfortunately it seemed only too likely he might involve molly in the mess that danger was looming already he set her to decoywork which the girl herself grifone could see did not relish the ladies of nona were gay and freetoo free molly recoiled visibly more than once the men were worse incredible as it seemed to grifone they actually ravaged this tender honeysuckle spray to drench themselves with the scent molly beautifully patient courteous meek as she was cast a scared paling face about the assembly now and again some of the talk too cut her very deep grifone was already too much interested in her to stomach this he decided to make discreet love to his duchess by a way of his own the nonesi gluttons abused her favours he would refuse them he would fast where nona feasted and be the only unkissed guest at her receptions vi grifone enters the market the first opportunity he had he took the palazzo bagnacavallo was thrown open to all worthy citizens the rooms since no one in those courting days was held unworthy were crowded ladies soldiers churchmen humanists in brocade poets in velvet a cardinal a crosseyed greek who had forsaken usury at trebizond for moral philosophy at nona madonna diamante too receptive wife of the count of cornuto madonna smeralda her discreet friend madonna saphira madonna rubina frizzed young nobles in particoloured hose humble abbates uncured and incurable a monk crowned with laurel for a sonnet and a knight of the holy ghost in retirementthese were some of the company among whom duchess molly was paraded by her discerning lord to carry her smiles of welcome and her pretty ways grifone grave attentive in black was there be sure waiting his turn it came and with it molly blushing and overwrought new from the very kindly salutations of the greek to grifone she proffered a greeting which was no less kind because her heart was troubled her well of trust in mankind was not yet dry grifone took her hand and bent over it it was as much as he did to brush it with his lips molly wondered at him you should be messer grifone my lords secretary she said faltering alas i have that misfortune replied the youth with averted eyes why i know you very well said molly but see now that i have offended you what is my injury signore what have i done madonna said grifone but so low that no other could hear him believe me that the offence is none of your wilful making it is however irremediable nothing but misfortune could overcome such misfortune as mine and that i pray heaven to keep far from you alack good grifone what sayings are these for a day that should be happy urged the warmhearted girl with eyes ready to fill madonna let me endure the thought of them alone i entreat your grace never while i live grifone you make me most unhappy will you not kiss me never while i live madonna if i am to live honest molly went white and red and stood hesitating uncertain whether to cry or be angry either might have been a vent for her distress which was real commanding herself with pains i will require you to speak with me after supper she said after a pause for the struggle grifone bowed his head and backed away from her she being boundless in capacity for the affections of her kind spent the interval with an aching heart directly supper was done she hunted for the secretary the affair had by now throbbed itself into a question of her physical ease her heartstrings were at a dangerous stretch she quivering at the point of tears master grifone for his part had taken very good care that the duke of nona should be occupied and himself not hard to find molly came upon him in a gallery of arras caught him crouching there with his face hidden in his hands she went to him at once full of the trouble he showed her sat by him put her arm round his neck and tried to draw his head up grifone turned her a white miserable face ah he said husky with reproach ah you have come with the ardours of an angel leaping in you yet no cruelty could in truth be sharper cruel cruel oh grifone nobody has ever said this of me before whimpered poor molly she was swirling in wilder water than she knew the cruelty is unconscious yet none the less bitter for that he complained and then all at once he turned fiercely to rend her what when i throb for your footfall or when i lean swooning to the wall for the scent of your hair as you pass when i urge against your chamber door that i may feed upon the sound of your breath or hunt for broken bread under your table that i may grow drunk on what your fingers have touched when i go raving at night weeping by day with a knife in my heart tears that scald my eyes when with these pains to endure these perils to skirt heights to fly you will speak touch me breathe upon me tempt me to greet you with kissing of the lipsah heaven and hell it is overmuch i would be an honest man look you i have a master to serve i bid you remember it is true enough that i love you out of all measure there is no sin in that which i cannot help but misery there is by our saviour the sin is gaping all about me itching here aching there gnawing and groping without cease or stint or allay yes yes i know this is truegod help me i love you deplorably but i will not touch you you are the everblessed thing to me but i will make you the everabhorred thing anathema maranatha i love you i worship you i adore you you are my saint my church my altar my souls peculiar food you shall be my devil his hell his cauldron my venomous offence and all this you shall be that i may love you yet more yet incomprehensibly more and withal live honest i will hate you because i adore you ah and i will prove whether by hating you most of all i cannot drown myself in love he threw himself out of her reach and rocked with hidden face here was pretty hearing for a pretty bride molly with heaving bosom stood abashed and dumb and troubled profoundly not only had she never tried to stem so fierce a torrent of love nor ever shuddered under such dry heat in mens wordsshe had never yet dreamed of so much passion in men created and glorious passion too it seemed so stern and represseda passion which hugged a fetter a splendid misery of denial of course she had nothing to say she never had anything to say yet she longed to say or do something her interest in all these fine things was painful if delicious and it never occurred to her for a moment that it could be a sin to listen where it was evidently such a virtue to declare she was conscious of no disloyalty to amilcare in so listening in being so troubled in displaying her trouble so unaffectedly poor poor good grifone so very noble so white and miserable heaven knows she would have satisfied him if she could with her to feel was to touch if i may so put it quite instinctively she stretched out her arms to draw him home the good fool would have kissed his tears away if he had had any giving him for comfort what he had screamed upon as a torment but that was a talent denied to grifone he could not cry all the same she was at the point to kiss him when he once more prevented herthis time without violence ah my lady my lady he said with a smile whimsically sad have a little pity on a torturing wretch molly now covered her face and freely sobbed the scene was heartrending and grifone judged that he might give the finishing stroke he stood over her where she was flung the poor humble soul and laid his fingers lightly on her silken shoulder love makes a good reader of a man he said slowly drawling his words long ago i discerned the clear stream of truth which is the issue of your love henceforward there is a secret pact between us two a secret wholly honourable since i have only told it that you might be won over not to dare me too far being honourable you who are the fountain of honour will keep it we go our two ways we look not on each other we greet not neither speak what either knows chance will throw us much together yet this law we will punctually observe to me the hour will sayguard thee grifone thy sweet enemy draws near to younow goodness be thy guide molly lest thou art a cause of stumbling to thy brother so let it always be he left her then knowing very well that he had sworn the good girl to faith inviolable and given her the subject of perennial thought and so he had molly kept his secret honoured it honoured him she came by tortuous ways of her hoodblind heart to glory and exult in both nor had she the wit to discern how or by what stealthy degrees the pain and longing she pitied in him grew to be more pitiable in herself she watched him wonderfully in those crowded days of court life which followed and when she was blinded by her tears held him as a martyr who for her sake lay quivering under the knife it shows the length of her road that she was never aware how much more in her sight he was than amilcare the man of her election amilcare it is true was greatly occupied one cannot be a duke for nothing not home affairs only though discontent was never far off called him from home the times were full of the shock of alarms thrones toppled there were rumours of moving hosts beyond the alps cesare the flamecoloured borgia was still meditating his kingdom in romagna already the lady of forli was flogging her sulky lieges into some sort of action for her defence now nona lay dead in the borgias way and unless the borgia could be hoodwinked again as he had been hoodwinked before nona need not cease to be a duchy but amilcare would cease to be a duke no wonder the man was a lacklove just now he intended to play molly for his great stake meantime he must be more of a duke than he was recognised as such by other powers by dukes firmly rooted by grudging republics or tyrants in thin veils and while he was consolidating his throneruffling here fawning theregrifone was always before mollys eye always plucking at her poor heartstrings always holding up his grave patience his bleeding his most eloquent refusals for her wonder wonder indeed she did and much more than that the thought sat upon her like a brooding evil spirit frayed her nerves to waste he used to move her so much by this policy of negation that she found herself panting as she sat among her women or when from her throned seat at table she saw his pale profile burn like a silver coin in the dusk the pain of her hearts beating wellnigh made her suffocate her troubles came to be daylong he haunted her by night when she began to ask the virgin mary how long she could endure it was the signal to herself that she could endure no more she sent for him then and implored him brokenlysobbing kneeling before himthat he would leave her grifone bowed his head next day amilcare or some other told her that the secretary was to be absent for some months arranging alliances abroad he went without seeing her or bidding any farewells she was prostrate for three or four days could hardly drag herself to church or away from it when she had once gained its cool sanctuary aisles after that she got better and more her old self the relief was as delicious as the grief had been she was really happy then she found that she was beginning to dread his return this was exactly what he had desired he was a most astute young man vii a pedlars round grifones tour of negotiation lasted very nearly six monthsmonths of comparative ease for molly neglected by husband and shadowing lover alike during this time the latter visited every important court in italy except naples whither he cared not and parma whither he dared not venturethe object of his journey being of course to secure his masters acknowledgment by a better title than the throats of a marketed crowd it would be as interesting as it was surprising to see the little craftsman at work the ingenuity with which he plied his handful of tools the proud patience with which he endured snub after snub his bland passivity and extraordinary rebound first of all he went to rome ever the pivot of danger to an italian diplomat mollys portrait done in his best manner by dosso of ferrara was presented to duke caesar of valentinois in this the lady with loose hair and a still looser robe spangled with stars it was and slipped off one white shoulder was sitting in a green wilderness feeding lions with confetti on a cedar near by were several parrots and a pale owl and from a lowswinging branch a great speckled snake stooped downward to embrace mollys waist in a dry fold and with his head writhed forward to lick her chin it was a pleasing piece don cesare was ravished the seed planted in him at foligno germinated produced a bud before long a triumphant flower not only would he come to nona and that soon but the holy father sent the golden rose to his dearest daughter in jesus christ maria by the same grace duchess of nona o mouth of singular favour with the scent of this rare blossom grifone went off to tickle the nostrils of the north but he must not delay us bologna he dared to visit thither the ducal pair must needs go anon milan received him to some purpose venice received him to none at all barbarigo was not doge for nothing ferrara was busy with thoughts of piety the whole court barefoot howling fac me plagis between the garden walls in other places he cried his wares and reached nona again in the heats of july he found his lovely mistress in a shaking fever languid under the breathless heat of the plain yet never at rest he found her largeeyed and bodeful horribly nervous of him she had been longing to see him yet every day made vehement prayer that she might never look on him again when she knew that he was indeed in the palace she shut herself into her chamber with a crucifix and spent the whole day at the window peeping from behind a curtain grifone saw the shape of her in it saw her hand at the selvage courage grifone mio caro he assured himself she is afraid of thee he resumed his state of armed respect molly her tossing nights and pacing days affairs were something awry within the duchy yet grifone assured his lord they were likely to be much more awry out of it madonna duchessa must certainly be shown aboutotherwise an avalanche preparations were pushed on by october the duke and duchess with a great train set outactually for bologna but nominally for milanese territory lodovico of that great principality would have been mortally affronted if he believed bentivoglio to have been considered first therefore the visit to bologna was to be a dead secret performed by the principals almost unattended meantime grifone who loved mystification prepared litters with a dummy duke and duchess to go under escort to borgo san donnino he and his wagging escort duly entered that city excuses to the podesta secured him a covered passage to the palace once there unfortunately the populace clamoured for a view insisted upon their graces appearance grifone had to set his dolls at a window there they stared embraced while three ciceronian orations were delivered from the piazza and all the merchantguilds marched round it with banners and torches next morning he got them off safely by some stroke of good luck but his joke got wind in time came round to cesare borgias ears and at last was repeated against nona for no other reason could this absurd incident claim your ears at bologna also all had gone well with the real adventurersup to a certain point bentivoglio the tyrant whose name is surely the grimmest of his pleasantries having seen the lovely molly was disposed to forgive her that disastrous veracity which you remember had prevented him before he was so favourably impressed that amilcare who never missed a chance left him alone with her for two hours in the garden after supper at the end of that time molly came to him stumbling over her dress in her haste flushed and in tears they must leave bologna at once she declared she would die else or never look her husband in the face the man had insulted her was horrible most wicked amilcare her dear lord must go and avenge her etc etc here was a pother what could be done grifone of course had he been there would have drawn his masters sword for him dragged him out of the room and sent him back in half an hours time with a bloody testimony of nothing on the blade molly would have been pacified bentivoglio snug abed the sword none the worse for a little pigs blood but grifone was at borgo jigging his dolls and listening to cicero and amilcare lost his head he poohpoohed the whole affair molly grew pale stopped crying amilcare began to feel himselfcome come she was reasonable after all he condescended to explain the fine uses of italian statecraft the wifes part the husbands part he was most explicit molly grew white ended by fainting amilcare carried her to bed she refused to sleep with him he raged she cared nothing she was wild with terror shame discovery of her lovers worth and of her loves he had to beg her pardon on his knees made an enemy of bentivoglio a fool of himself and left next morning in a tearing passion grifone who met his master at cremona lost no time in seeing that something had gone counter and very little in finding out what it was leave it to me my good lord he said comfortably i will explain it to madonna in another way before they went to bed he had a little guarded talk with his duchess half excusation of his absence which might have aggravated her alarms half condemnation of amilcare the whole consequently a veiled eulogy of himself molly was very quiet at first subdued and miserable but sincerely grateful to express this she fell into her natural way a way of little timid tendernesses little touchings of the arm urgings of the cheek grifone received them rigidly she was reduced to tears thereupon he kissed her ardently twice and fled she remained a long while in the dark breathless limp awed and absurdly happy next morning he was as distant as the alps and quite as frosty at dusk they reached milan whatever duke ludovic titular of bari actual of milan may have intended to ensue he gave them a proper reception cardinal ascanio himself came to the city gate with clergy and the council cavalry a particoloured array pennoned and feathered escorted them to the castle there on the steps within the great courtyard the moor himself sumptuous in silver brocade and donna beatrice his wife there his tired sister duchess bona and her by no means tired daughter bianca maria of the green eyes stood panoplied to await them trumpets announced the greetings that passed yet another fanfare the greetings that were to come when within the hall at the foot of the broad staircase they found and kissed the hands of the anxious little duke galeazzo gian and his pretty wifepair of doomed children even then in the cold shadow of their fate halfhearted fainting molly went through her little part with the accustomed success her pretty englishitalian her english lips again her eager hands so anxious to search friends out found their sure way to one at least bianca maria affianced of the roman king delighted to kiss and be kissed announced herself the shy girls lover pleasure broke over her face broke the glaze of her bottomless eyes with a gleam like the suns when in still water it betrays deep green paths of light she was an enigmatic rogue so clever that to most she seemed of unplumbed stupidity those blank green eyes of hers that waxen face that scarlet impenetrable mouth her even gait and look of ruminating look of a doltwho knew bianca maria not maximilian the mildmannered king not duke ludovic that creased traitor who schemed her marriage not altogether lionardo who painted half her portrait and taught her much of his wisdom certainly not poor molly of nona all milanese were her lovers and here was another heart mollys to wit laid open and soothed by the little witchs quick handstroke bianca maria had all her secrets with all her love in the first hour of their embracery the two girls sat clasped in one chair in that pretty time of dressing when half is undone and halfs to do molly feeling a fool but loving to have it so sat in the lap of the younger who mothered her after many days lionardo who forgot nothing and never her whom he thus happened on glorified her as the virgin mary on the knees of saint anne the indefinite smile the innocent consciousness the tender maiden ways wife mother handmaid of high god he thought of her as of molly in apotheosis dutiful for loves sake yet incurably a child made for the petting place grifone the secretary is your lover my molly said bianca maria the wise molly admitted the sobering truth and the other pinched her lip take care of him my dear he is more perilous than that stiff husband you now have the husband is a trading fool he uses you as a carrot to induce donkeys the other is more curious and has no use for donkeys he will use you otherwise why how will he use me then said openeyed molly she was vaguely ill at ease but the other shammed stupid all she could be brought to add was i will take care of you if i can you will never do here nor should ever have comea lamb among our lombard wolves had you no english lover to kill amilcare and prevent it molly thought of gregory drax who had been upon the north seas at the time gregory drax used to lean over the garden gate chewing straws this he did by the hour together to the perfect satisfaction of himself and understanding of the neighbours molly could not think that it would have led to the slaying of amilcare what was he like this gregorio asked bianca maria suddenly alert when she had got his name smoothly molly did her bestruddy blueeyed always blushing and laughing fairhaired very long arms he was a marinajo he sounds to be so said bianca maria then she clapped her hands and summoned lionardo the great man had no sooner appeared noiselessly in the doorway the inscrutable greybeard than she kissed her friend and bade her go with her women to the appointed quarters of the nonesi lionardo gravely saluted her as she went rosy out he had seen the virgin in the lap of saint anne and cared no more for the poor original dear lionardo said the girl in the chair to the most learned man of her day you shall do me the favour to write a letter in latin to a certain english lord messer gregorio dras marinajo londra principessa said the great man i am ready recite your letter to her very singular good lord the letter beganthe only one so far as i know written by the empress bianca maria to england certainly the only one she ever wrote to wapping the conceit of it was as follows that the lovely lady molly was at nona on the confines of emilia and romagna wife of a man who would shortly be murdered in order that she might become the mate of the assassin that a very great lord son of the holy father was intending for those parts and would probably take the same means to secure himself the position of her third husband the writer proposed that the lord gregorius whose virtue and celerity of judgment were well known throughout italy should journey out to nona with all reasonable despatch and repossess himself of the lady thus your lordship it concluded may happily become fourth husband of a lady whose charms are of a sort so noble and perdurable that they are unlikely to suffer from the arduous duties their excellence involves yet such haste as is compatible with your worshipful degree in the realm of england may be recommended from milan etc in the year of our thankful redemption how shall we send our letter speediest my merlin his enchantress laid her emerald spell over himo incomparable witch such sorcery exalted him always he lifted her question upon one of his towering flights the wings of birds if we could use them were admirable for the purpose princess he replied but for the moment the difficulty of instructing such messengers is insuperable and not only so but it is probable that the lord gregorio seeing such an envoy to his hand might put a bolt into it and itself into the pot without interrogatories delivered or answers made so messenger and message would alike be boiled another way occurs to me which arises out of this consideration we stand each bather of us in a lake of air a lake rather an illimitable ocean of it spread over land and sea in which the very mountaintops do blink should not then the pulsing of our thought as it rings outward from us be discernible in the ripples about the lord gregorios ears obviously it should but the reading of such ripples would be a nice matter and again we lack means and again the time to instruct his lordship once more ah you dream your subtleties and my letter gets cold said bianca maria pouting you are now just as you sit watchfully when you should be painting my picture it is then that i am painting my hardest princess saint anne he returned but leave with me your letter it shall go in a mans bosom tomorrow morning high affairs of state are not settled in a week nor dukes so apt at billing as a pair of girls duke ludovic would not declare himself to every adventurer duke amilcare was too patently adventurous to disclose all his hand then came grifone with a game of his own blind each of one eye they set to dealing their cards for beggarmyneighbour now ludovic feared one man in all italy and so did amilcare that was the one man in all italy whom grifone respected on whom he thought he could honestly rely thought he to himself can their serenities be leagued against this man in my service can they not by our risen lord he fancied that they might to this end he proposed to his master very shortly the assassination of borgia by means of the lovely molly let her at a private banquet inveigle him to drink a cup suggest this to the duke of bari he said i think your lordship will not be disappointed substantial pledges must be exacted of course he must tread in deep enough to leave a footmark or two visible twixt milan and nona amilcare thought well of this advice and followed it ludovic incredulous at first and breathless took a fortnight to ponder he consulted cardinal ascanio consulted his astrologers took the test of the opening virgil his eye lighted upon the portentous words tantae molis erat romanam condere gentem who would have twittered after those he sought his guest and told him roundly that if the thing went well he would send an envoy to the court at nona and support the new duchy with moral force amilcare did not believe him naturally nor did he greatly care for moral forces he stipulated for an envoy at once an invitation for himself and his wife to bianca marias wedding and for a loan of twenty thousand ducats in specie ludovic boggled horribly at this but they accorded at last the envoy was to go then and there the invitation should be sent when the borgia had agreed to visit nona and the money when he was within a days ride of that city reduced to cipherwriting this treaty was placed below the visible host on the high altar of sant eustorgio the allies received the communion and after another weeks festivities the duke and duchess of nona went home at parting the two girls clung together we shall never meet again child cried the chosen empress i am sure of it molly kissed her are we not to come to your marriage dear bianca my marriage cried the other you will as likely see me there as that shadow of a name which will be my bridegroom you will see my simulacrum a plastered effigy of me i shall be stiff with golddust and diamonds a doll marrying a dolls bedgown why should i be there if his everaugust majesty is represented by a puff of silly breath pray never look for bianca maria in the queen of the romans the queen of the romans is a doll windy ruler of the name of a people bianca maria sforza daughter of thieves has been your friend as you will see she has provided for your third husband an honest man now kiss me for the last time and by heaven go quickly or i shall keep you here for my souls health the fierce little hungry creature threw her arms round mollys neck and kissed her like a lover molly was melted into tears oh bianca you bewilder you terrify me what is this of husbands and your soul ah my soul cried she do you think so highly of it as to suppose it will survive this marriage or so lightly as not to care my soul poor child is in the case with your lovely body it is the tied bird of all these fowlers alas alas but i cannot understand molly wailed but the other caught her the closer that you do not understand carina is your salvation it proves you immortal now go no kiss me kiss me they were parted at last and though they did meet again they kissed no more viii private treaty to a most elaborately penned invitation the borgia responded by half a dozen words scrawled by his secretary he would be in the march at such and such a time and would spend such and such a day in nona he had heard from amilcare he replied to molly the insult was glaring even to her is this tolerable my lord said the meek beauty incensed at last amilcare shrugged it may not have to be borne very long said he for my part i am accustomed to reckon a gift by its use to me not by the sacking round about it he was now beyond his wifes depth she neither followed nor tried to follow him in these days she saw but little of her lord and could have wished it less he who in action was as cheerful a soul as you could wish to serve was harassed by the long expectances of diplomacy and in the routine work of governing most grim the nonesi had come to hate him a good deal but to fear him more expenses were incalculable the taxes grew there were riots savage snaps of speech in the council did harm imprisonments followed then some unaccountable sudden deaths high and low alike none knew where the blow might fall but all flinched at it in these distresses molly served him well for she at least was universally loved if the duke had a man stabbed the duchess took such sweet consolation to the widow that none could murmur long to watch her warm tears flow was in itself a solace to feel her arms to win her kissing mouth quickened those doubtful poor souls furtively also grifone was on her side a neat phrase here and there made her position plain to the most infidel in the city it is true that while he helped her there he tortured her otherwhere inexpressibly he hardly ever left her now and her heart bled to see him go in fear of her she prayed night and day that he might have strength to shake off this biting cruel love it never entered her head that she could console him by perfidy to a perfidious husband it had entered grifones head a hundred times but he always put it out he could afford to wait for what after all he only valued as a concession to vulgar opinion in thought she had been his for a year and in the mind he lived most deliciously it was no doubt his full intent to make her his in all the grossness of the fact but not until he had got rid of amilcare or induced amilcare to get rid of himself this was what the stiffnecked condottiere was now doing as fast as his best enemies could have wished his people hated him so bitterly that he would certainly have worn mailhad not molly been his mail they spared him because they loved her and believed that he still had her heart amilcar uxoris gratia dux was now the fact grifone could have destroyed belief and him together by a lift of the eyebrow but he wanted more than that so waited on the little fellow was really extraordinary luxurious as he was to the root and effeminate hating as he did cold water cold food the cold shoulder one and all of these shuddering things he had schooled himself to bear without a blink he grew even to take a stern pleasure in the bitterness they cost him as he turned them to his uses and reckoned up his balance at the bank amilcare snarled at him cut his words out of his mouth struck him kicked him once like a yarddog grifone added it all to his store but as the day for duke cesares visit drew near molly began to be much again in her husbands thoughtshow far she would go in this maturer time she had charmed the man once before at foligno she had charmed everybody but then she had been charmed herself subsequently she had charmed bentivoglio not so happily but that she endangered her own spell that was the present trouble for hitherto her charm had lain precisely in herself in the little everyday acts which were her own nature bentivoglio had reasonably wanted more so would borgia want very much more could molly be brought not to surrender all he wanted but to make him want amilcare growing tense between his difficulties felt that explanations must be given and received felt also that they must come from himselfin fact grifone had declined themand felt that he was not strong in such work direction he could give but not explanation however he must try on a vivid morning of early summer when the lemontrees in the cortile looked as if they had been cut out of metal and the planes and very poplars were unwinking in the thick blue air amilcare came into his wifes room she had not expected him he found her lying dishevelled and unbusked with all her glossy hair tumbled loose very much a maiden still notwithstanding her year and a half of troublous marriage she jumped up directly she saw him and blushful covered her neck amilcare finding her and the act adorable together took her in his arms and kissed her then he led her back by the hand to the windowcushions and made her sit upon his knee he began to play with her hair what a silken mesh my molly what a snare for a man in this lovely cloud how fragrant of roses ah most beautiful wife you could lead all italy by a strand of this miraculous hair she was pleased with his praises touched and grateful she kissed him for them so they grew more friendly than they had been ever since the bentivoglio had shocked her modesty and faith in him at once amilcare rattled on lovetalk comes easily to the italian tongue whose very vocables are caresses gradually he drew in and in to the borgia centre of all his spinning thought there is a lover of yours for instance he said comically aghast and molly laughed why amilcare you make all the world to be my lover all the world to look at me through your eyes believe it they see me truer than you do i am a very simple person amilcare began to count upon his fingers one hand meeting the other round mollys caught waist the borgia the count of cavalcalupo oreste colonna negroponte three bishops at sesto bianca maria cardinal ascanio sforza ordelaffi benti she stopped him there with a hand on his mouth pah the horrible man amilcare gaily struggled for vent andvoglio he concluded the word you may not relish the trophy my wife but him you undoubtedly charmed and now don cesare is coming him also it will be as needful as easy to please molly turned in her husbands arms to consider him something in his tone rather than the words he had used struck bodefully upon her amilcare was kissing her hair and would not give over she cast down her eyes unsatisfied i hope i may always please my lords friends she said in a low voice amilcare settled himself yet more luxuriously in his cushions and looked at the ceiling you must charm him my soul he said intensely you must charm him i am in his hands in his way he has sought my ruin and i believe still seeks it twice he has tried to poison me once to have me stabbed if he tries again he will succeed nothing can turn don cesare from his path but a woman therefore you must charm him ravish his eyes you know very well how to do that molly stared grew red began to stammer but how can i oh amilcare what do you ask of me then he looked at her severely but without malice she noticed for the first time the coldsteel hue in his eyes the complete absence of friendlinessa tinge which his men knew very well and other mens men even better i ask of you my molly that the man be put at his ease he said deliberately happy in ordering at last more that his direction be turned he must be made highhearted full of glorious hope not counting cost keen in pursuit he must blow off the cobwebs of his doubt rather these must shred from him as he flies in chase i cannot afford his distrust i can do nothing without you light of heaven am i asking too much or do you suppose that my safety with the borgia is not yours also he shrugged his intolerable indignation and threw back his head thus he avoided to look at his wife she still sat upon his knee but like an alien bolt upright reasoning out her misery with wide tearless eyes and a hand to press her bosom down shocks were no more for hershe had learned too much but these things seemed like hard fingers on a familiar wound which opened the old sore and set it aching the part he now put to her had only to be named to be shown for horrible was yet too horrible to be named yet had to be named you ask of me to charm your enemy she said in a still fascinated voice as if she were forced by a spell to speak obscenity to beguile your enemyto make himmake himseek me him the man who tried to murder you charm him charm him lead him to pursue she could hardly drag the words out of her but lord what a fool she was at least amilcare thought so the plainest duty the easiest this childish womans game he jumped up quivering with nerves on edge and the sympathy between the pair lacked even touch molly found her feet stood brooding before him all her hair about her lowered face to see her thus a mute a block maddened amilcare he clenched his fists yes madamhis words bit the airyou shall charm this enemy of mine if you please this assassin this ravener of other mens goods you shall charm him in the way you best knowyou and your nation bentivoglio i excused you he was not worth your pains borgia i shall not excuse you i showed you to him with this only view i asked him here i speak to you now with this only view you are adorable in every part if you choose to be italy has no woman like you so winning so much the sumptuous child such tall buds shoot only in the north to it then charm him as you charmed me teach himsanto dioteach him to die for a smile at least afford him the smile or the provocation of it the rest shall be my affair soul of christ am i to miss this astounding opportunity never in the world i bid you by all you hold sacred to do your duty am i plain enough he was she had grown as grey as a cloth could say nothing only motion with her dry lips but she bent her head to him and stretched out her hands in token of obedience to law good said amilcare my wife understands me and he went out then and there to his council his conviction of her submissiveness and of other things about her to modify it may be gauged by the fact that he never saw her again except ceremonially until a certain moment after the dinner with borgia grifone saw her all the more for that what he saw satisfied him that she was in terrible trouble she slunk about to his view as if beaten down by shame he had seen young girls in that strait very often when the first step had been taken the first flush faded from the venture the first afterknowledge come they always went as though they were watched more than that he discerned that she was nearly broken for want of a counsellor he caught her long gaze fixed upon him sometimes she seemed to be peering through him spoke to herself he thought as she sat vacantly upon her throne or at table among the quick wits with all her spying ladies to fence her in if any one addressed the word to her she flushed suddenly and began to catch after her breath he could see how shortly that breath came and how it seemed to hurt her if she answered at all it was stupidly and beside the purpose then she would look conscious of her dulness grow uncomfortably red be at the point to cry all this while it could not but gratify him made him a little sorry too one night at a very brilliant assembly given by the notorious donna smeralda buonaccorso he saw her standing forlorn on the terrace like a lonely rock in the seathe most beautiful woman in nona and the most splendidly attired absolutely alone in all that chattering grimacing crowd the duchess of nona this consideration alone moved him to real pityfor to be great and unfortunate has a freakish way of touching your heartit moved him quietly towards her to whisper in her ear madonnaand heaven how she started madonna what you need now is the courage of your race but courage i well know comes only by confidence and confidence is what i can give you trust for trust will you hear me but she looked piteously at him as if she had been found out and put her hands to her ears i dare not hear you i dare not how can you speak to me when i have never askednever thought ah leave me grifone i have not heard you yet ask me notbut go it was she that went that hurried from him stumbling in her haste like a hunted thing he could see no more of her that night so with a shrug turned to his quiet amusement there were women there pleasant enough it was true that he wanted but one woman superlatively but it was eminently grifones maxim that failing that which you need you should take that which you can get the last stage in the education of molly amilcare found must positively be left to the secretary on the night before duke cesares arrival when every other preparation had been made grifone came into his masters room late he said nothing nor got any greeting but he placed a little phial on the table and waited amilcare looked at it did not touch it it was a very small phial half full of a clear liquid you prepared it yourself grifone grifone nodded pleasantly then i may rest assured you may my lord i will ask you to make all arrangements grifone when the time comes you will take the cup to madonna duchessa with a hint of so much as may be necessary to provide against mischances will this be done punctually and surely excellence the secretary retired with his bottle amilcare sat on with a tight smile which neither waxed nor waned but seemed frozen on his face he may thus have sat for two or three hours his eyes fixed on a point at the tables edge that point whatever it was a speck of dust may be seemed to grow and grow till it was monstrous and a burden intolerable to endure amilcare with an effort stretched out his hand and cuffed at it he knocked a book off the table by this means then started then swore at himself twice after this he spoke smiling all the while is it now indeed he asked raising one eyebrow is it now indeed then he got up stretched himself noisily and lay down as he was on the sofa to sleep in a moment molly lay with a young maid of hers that night and never had a wink ix the last bidding that golden duke of valentinois had a pompous reception from his august ally at nona amilcare riding like castor at one with his horse went out at the head of his court to meet him the centaurs lined the way with a hedge of steel hat in hand the duke of nona rode back with his guest to the garlanded gates there a fluttered choir all virgins and all white strewed flowers from that point to the piazza grande one song came leaping on the heels of another on the steps of the duomo were the clergy in brocade a mitred bishop half smothered under his cope in their midst the two dukes dismounted and hand in hand entered the church the organ pealed the choir burst out with the chant ecce rex tuus venit and then seeing cesare had once been a cardinal ecce sacerdos magnus the smoke of incense went rolling to the roof te deum spired between the rifts an archbishop intoned the mass of the holy ghost cesare in white satin goldenheaded redgold in the beard cloaked and collared with the golden fleece knelt in the middle of the dome beside him the hawkfaced amilcare splendid in silver armour knelt alsobut stiffly whereas the borgia graceful in all that he did drooped easily forward on his priedieu like the archangel gabriel who brought the great tidings to madonna maria amilcare at that rate was like michael his more trenchant colleague that bird of god the bishop who knew perfectly well why the duke had come to nona and why nonas duke wanted him there preached a sermon which the saving italian virtue of urbanity prevented from being either monstrous or ridiculous before the altar the two lords kissed each other one of them had tried and the other was about to try murder as a political expedient but that was no reason why good manners should not prevail decent ceremony was always a virtue of the race half an hour before dinner grifone who had not been to church stood before his mistress who had not been suffered to go he had a flagon in his hands of silver gilt like the calyx of a great flower whose stem was sheathed in the clustered wings of angels whose base was their feet he held it in both hands as if it were a chalice molly beaten out and white looked at it dully but did not seem to see it madonna mia said the youth this is the lovingcup which i am to hand to you after dinner and which you are to hand to duke cesare he hardly heard her answer but judged by the shaping of her lips that it was well grifone duke cesare will ask you to sip of it first madonna his looks were piercing yet she was too far gone to be disturbed by such as those she even smiled faintly at his emphasis well grifone she asked again in that same dry whisper how shall that be harm to him if i do it grifone blew out his lips harm per dio none at all but common prudence on his part no harm to him lady but to you obeying him destruction death molly stared her breath came hollow from her mouth death grifone she faltered and then pored over his face again he nodded his words into her death madonnina the girl tottered to her feethad to balance like a ropedancer to keep upon them but thenbut theno saviour she threw her arms up he thought she would fall so put one of his round her waist he felt her heart knocking like a drum pressed her closer drew her in and kissed her with a coaxing word or two she tried to collect herselfalas her wits were scattered wide her head drooped to his shoulder after that there began the most pitiful business she was pleading with him in a whining wheedling silly voice which would have broken down an englishman grifone himself was pricked it was like a child frightened into slyness coaxing its mother dear grifone dear grifone you will not hand me the cup oh please please please grifone kissed her why what can i do he said my lord has ordered it so dear one she took no notice of his familiarities indeed the tone they lent his voice may have soothed the poor affectionate wretch but she only wrung her hands at his news no no no tis impossible no no he could never do it i can repeat his words said the inexorable grifone he said then she sprang away from him as if he had whipped her and crouched in a corner at bay she began to rave seemingly in a high delirium pointed at him wagged her arm at him mowing the air never repeat them never repeat them i shall die if you do grifone set down his cup ran forward and embraced her my lovely lady my adorable molly he murmured in a passion of admiration for her transformed unearthly beauty she noticed nothing of him or his doings lay lax in his arms she stared gulping down horror she looked like some shocked addolorata come upon the body of her dead son and so perhaps since all good women mother their lovers or lords she was face to face with her dead tears came to blot out her misery she could not stay their fall they anointed also the burning cheeks of young grifone and drove him outside himself with love he kissed her softly again with reverence and whispered courage sweet lady i shall be with you i have it all in hand the end for you and me shall be happiness undreamed of yet the duke comes in a quarter of an hour then he left her alone the affair will go by clockwork he assured himself neither fast nor slow but by clockwork he had an ingenious mind and loved mechanics x with all faults at the coming out from church the two dukes mentally at least separated their paths coincided but not their thoughts nor their behaviour by common consent as it appeared amilcare at once resumed the obsequious cesare the overbearing part amilcare talked profusively smirked grimaced pranced by the others side writhed his hands in copious explanation of nothing at all cesare shrugged the amount of disdain an italian can throw into a pair of dull eyes or an irritable shoulder the amount of it another will take without swallowing can still be studied whenever a young lieutenant of the line sits down to breakfast in a tavern and the waiter slaves for his penny fee yet depend upon it the cringer has balanced to a nicety the sweets and sours of bootblacking against the buona mano the rest is pure commerce so now the deliberate insolence of the flushed borgia towards his host was a thing to be dumb at yet passavente redoubled his volubility going up the steps of the palazzo bagnacavallo the guest plumply told his entertainer to bring out the woman and go to the devil with his cackling amilcare laughed all over his face at the best joke in the world and bowed to the earth thus humoured they went in to dinner molly in fold over fold of silk gauze which let every lovely limb be seen as glorified in a rosy mist met them in the anteroom and thenceforth the borgia had eyes for nothing but the beauty of her the moment he saw her he drew as once before a sharp breath she greeted him in her fashion he was moved to a fit of trembling from that time forth amilcare was as though he were not the roman waited for no invitation and disregarded those he got would his grace be pleased to dine his grace went on pouring out his talk to the wonderful rosecoloured lady amilcare patient to excess watched presently cesare said madama shall we go to dinner and to dinner they went amilcare rubbing his hands behind them they found the table prepareda very low one divans to sit upon none but grifone pale and respectful in the little painted chamber all this had been carefully provided the dukes suite dined in another wing of the palace the choir of minstrels who held the passage between them had mail under their cassocks and twoedged swords made for thrusting they were fifty strong every pageinwaiting in the hall and long cool passages was a centaur armed to the teeth don cesare it seems had walked into a steel trap at last do you wonder that amilcare could afford a supple back but as the delicate meats succeeded each othereach duly tasted by grifone before a morsel went to platethere was one in the surge of her terrors struck dumb with what was rather wonder the magnificent cesare went his road over the feelings of his host the host bowed and waved his hands why should he not never one word of answer never a gleam of attention did he win from the roman why should he care his wife was doing her duty his enemy was webbed what else could matter the italian shrug goes deeper than the shoulders sometimes it strokes the heart of a man the very indignities heaped upon the adventurer made his revenge the sweeter nursling but molly the tall english girl burning in her shameful robe saw it vastly otherwise that a man could bend so low that she should ever have loved a man with such a stooping back to think of that made for the moment every other degradation light her part as yet was one of sufferance to look handsome languid with the excess of her burden of beauty to smile slowly to keep her eyes on her lap pure passivity all this under which the miserable soul could torture in secret as she often had a backache it was easy to wilt among her cushions as she was always mute before flattery to smile was as simple as to frown and meant no more as she was ashamed of herself and her husband she could hardly hope to lift her honest eyes or temper her furious blushing it would be untrue to say that the borgias eager undercurrent of lovelanguage stirred her not at all even to her the mans fame made his homage a tribute something it was beyond doubt to be courted by the greatest prince in italy and he had not touched her yet amilcare whose desperate grinning made his jaws ache noticed so much as he watched her fidgeting in his place his nails were for ever at his teeth when the fruit should come in he was to slip out and grifone to crown the work meanwhile the flagrant unconcern for his whereabouts shown by the victim might have stung a blind worm to bite or excused any treachery amilcare had no rage at all and felt the need of no excuse all his anxiety was that cesare should enmesh himself deep enough and then the thought of what should happen then set his head singing a song as mad as judiths the still grifone stood behind his mistress and saw cesares golden head sink near and yet nearer to her shoulder he watched his arm over the back of her seat and how his other hand crept towards the ladys idle pair the room held those four and them not long in his time amilcare muttered some excuse and tiptoed out cesare was saying ah give me lovelove onlyelse i must die molly answered nothing with her lips but in her bosom prayed ceaselessly for pity love me pledge me with your lips let me drink of you o my soul sighed the duke ecco madonna said grifone and handed her the cup the chalice of love cried cesare straining towards the white girl drink to me my heart and i will drink from thee molly still held the cup though the liquor curved brimming at the lip her eyes were sightless her head shaking with palsy drink drink my soul yes my lord yes yes i must drink very deep she said and raised the cup pshutt said grifone she turned like a caught beast wild and blanched with horror she rose suddenly swaying on her feet entangled one of them in her long robe and stumbled forward to stay herself by the table she looked like some spurred bacchante lurching over the board with the great flagon anod in her hand cesare made to catch her in his arms and reached for the cup but then she screamed with all her might and threw the accursed thing crash upon the pavement treachery treachery molly shrieked and again treachery o god he has made me a devil she threw her head up herself tumbled back upon the cushions knew nothing of grifones go go go my lord the house is quick with murder and when she opened her eyes at last saw amilcare standing grim and grey before her who can say what shall best reveal a man whether love or hate or fear or how to know which of these three passions stripped her this amilcare naked naked he was now and she found that she had never known him the colour of his face was that of old white wax his mouth seemed stretched to cracking point neither turned up at the corners nor down but a bleak slit jagged across his face he fastened her with his hard eyes which seemed smaller than usual and had a scared look as if he was positively disconcerted at what he read as they glimmered over his wife in one of his hands never still he had a long knife very lean in the blade ah what do you want of me more amilcare it was molly spoke first in a whisper he croaked his reply i am going to kill you oh oh you are going to kill me my lord you have sold me to my enemy he is your lover no no i have no lover amilcare i have never had a lover liar he thundered if he had not been your lover you would not have spared his life there can be no other reason i am not a fool to grifone that was just what he appeared to her some ray of her own souls honest logic showed at the last amilcare she cried out on her knees amilcare listen i pray you i have done you no wrong i implore you not to hurt me i have done you honour it was because i loved you that i saved his life i speak the truth my lord i speak the truth i have never thought you to speak otherwise but i have been wrong it appears the excuse is monstrous i am going to kill you the miserable girl turned him a pinched face she searched for any shred of what she had known in him but all the deadly mask of him she saw told her nothing she began to be witless again to wring her hands to whimper and whine amilcare looked fixedly at her every muscle in his face rigid as stone so as he ruminated some whisp of his racing thought caught light from his inner rage flared bloodbright before him and convulsing him drove him to his work gross trull he sprang at her with his knife in the air molly shrieked for mercy and before he could be on her grifone whipped out his dagger and stabbed his master under the stabbing arm amilcare jerked in midcareer constricted and turned half but the blow had gone too deep and too true he fell horribly and molly knew no more xi from an amateurs cabinet grifone received his swooning lady into his arms and held her there to his great content triumphing in her beauty and successful capture truly the adventure had gone by clockwork he might say he thought that there was not one step in it but had been schemed to an eighth of an inch and when you have to bring temperamental differences into account the chances of italian politics the influence of climate the panic alarms of a ridden moband still succeed why then you may lawfully be happy happy he was but molly was tall and he a lightweight moreover he wanted to wipe his blade and be off he judged it prudent therefore to bring her to herself again and so did by sousing her liberally with cold water molly as soon as she could see was aware of him kneeling by her side and of his arms about her before she had done gasping he began to kiss her my heart of hearts my lovely soul my lady moll mine altogether by the act of my arm were some of his fiery words there were others yet more explicit which left no doubt of his passion nor any ray of doubt of his intentions grifone took everything for granted as he had from the beginning my charmer he said i have saved you from ignominious death but i have saved myself also from a death by no means agreeable to me it was impossible that our love could have held us much longer at a distance from each other impossible that we could have still suffered a third person to usurp our privileges if that stabbed stabber under the table had not misunderstood you so grotesquelythe grosswitted hoghe would have lived and i died of jealousy a far from pleasant death you will allow worse in that it would have involved your own for i should have had to kill you too my dearest joy so much would have been owing to my selfrespect things you see could not have turned out more fortunately the fellow trapped himself we may be happywe will be wildly happyyou shall see it may be doubted whether molly heard anything of this exposition she may well have missed one or two steps in a carefully reasoned argument hers was that state of absorbent lassitude when the words and acts put to you sink into the floating mass of your weakness the late shocking grief hovers felt about you a buzz of talk a rain of caresses hold the spectre off and so are serviceablebut no more the cold cheek the claycold lips the long lax limbs of the poor doll were at his service she saw nothing through her dim eyes made no motion with her lips sobbed rather than breathed endured tearlessly rather than lived awake her misery misery is not the word she had been sent down to hell and had come back dumb to earth neither knowing why such torment was hers nor thinking how to fly a second questioning had she been capable of a wish a prayer or of begging a favour who can doubt what it would have been death oh death grifones face was so near to hers that not to kiss her would have been an affectation but when he began to make plans he released her sat up and spoke as though he were discussing theory there is very much to do my love said he but i think i see my way clear it is instant flight to begin with for one of the household may be here any moment or don cesare return such an one would have but to open the window and cry treason ho to secure our being torn to piecesnot for any love the nonesi bear that carrion but because not one of them could resist the chance of kicking his benefactors it is reasonable after all instant flight my dear if you please but whither you will ask luckily i can take you to a pretty safe place of which i have the key and custodes goodwill in my pocket you know the rocca del capitan vecchio outside the latin gate we go there for our terrestrial paradise shawl your lovely head therefore stoop your glorious shoulders and obey me exactly he got up as he made an end of speech drew her gently to her feet and showed her how to muffle herself in the hood of a mans cloak he bound the rest of the garment about her waist with his belt pinned up her skirt and petticoat as high as her knees and gave her his own stockings and shoes then he helped himself to his dead masters pair to his sword and velvet gown and now he said we may start by the privy garden he led the way it was a golden afternoon of late summer the shadows were lengthening as the air grew tired and cool all the place was full of that vast peace in which a day of strenuous heat sinks to rest the faint breeze in the myrtles was like a sleepers sigh majoresque cadunt altis de montibus umbrae murmured grifone to himself as he slipped among the cypresses over the grass molly followed him with faltering knees nearly spent as always she was at the mercy of a clear head never masterless when a man was near her morally nervously she seemed to be dead so she followed her new lord as meekly as she had followed her oldthat one to nona across the seas this one by gloomy pent ways through the stalesmelling streets of the city to the rocca del capitan vecchio meekly enough she went yet not so far nor so meekly but that she gave grifone a genuine surprise it seems that the air the exercise precautions whatnot had cried back her escaped wits certain it is that once in the stormbitten old fortress she thanked her leader and rescuer with a tremulous sweetness all her own and thenby heaven and earthurged him gently to go back lest her honour should be breathed upon her honour grifone the romancer turned sick with amazement he was dumbfounded could not believe his ears nor yet his eyes that there before him should stand that drooping flagged pitiful beauty always at his discretion now wholly at his mercy within ninefoot walls and talk to him with wet eyes and pleading lips of the cardinal virtues as soon as he could collect himself he put this before her in a whirl of words santo dio timidity prejudice after what had passed in what possible way or by what possible quibble of a priest could anything stay them now from the harvest of a sown lovetwo years sowing by the redeemer two years torture and nowa solid square fortress on a naked rock deemed impregnable by anything but black treachery let him make assurance incredibly secure say the word and he would go and silence the old custode for ever it was done in a momentwhat more could he do so he prayed but molly was a rock at last she ignored everything but the fact that she could never survive the night if he stayed in the fortresstower such she assured him was the fixed habit of her extraordinary race she made no pretence of mourning her dead husband indeed her horror of him set her shuddering at his mere name nor did she affect to deny that she loved grifone it made no difference she was luminously mild used her hands like a madonna in a picture was more lovely and winning in the motions of her little head the wistful deeps and darks of her eyes the pathetic curve of her mouth than any madonna short of leonardos grifone threw up his arms such a pass confounded him he had no tools to pick this sort of lock oh but the thing was impossible two years longing the husband deadwhy they might marry even if she would perhaps that was what she needed if so he would risk his life in the city again to find a priest but think of it formalities at this hour molly smiled and blushed she was sorry for her friend and would have consoled him if she could but the thing was so obvious did not grifone see grifone did not see he tore his hair he threatened prayed raved commanded coaxed swore by god and the devil clung to her kneesuseless dear friend she said and stroked his hot hair you have served me well never serve me now so ill she beat him from that moment when love was dead he began to hate her she was safe from what she feared everything he might have waived but that a clean blow at his own conceit the end was near their colloquy so frenzied on his part so staid and generous at once on hers was barely over before the hum of many voices crept upon them a slow murmurous advance out of which as the hordes drew near one or two sharp criesseek seek death to the traitorthrew up like the hastier wavecrests in a racing tide again they heard and now more clearly evviva madonna la madonna di nona and then more ominous than all a cry for cesare borgia chiesa chiesa at this last grifone who had been biting his fingers shrewdly wrung a nail apart till the blood came his was the desperate caught face of a stoat in a trap what is this crying without said molly in a hush pest i must find out said grifone he climbed to a high window and looked down into the moonlight the nonesi in force cesare borgia and the troops hist he is going to speak to them they are holding him up he strained to listenand it seems that he heard citizens said the borgia in fact i pledge you my sacred word that the duchess shall be delivered to you whole and in honour she shall be in the palace within an hour the secretary who has her there who stabbed his master and as i learn from milan hatched all the plot must be left to me madonna maria saved my life at the peril of her own she has no more devoted servant than i am trust me to prove it chiesa chiesa madonna heed the duke cried the mob and then let the duke go up and win us our lady that he shall never do said grifone and came down from the window molly seeing the cunning in his eyes backed to the wall time does not serve and pity forbids that i should dwell upon this misery what she may have wailed what he withstood who loved her once i have no care to set down at large he strangled her with cruel vivacious hands and then since time had pressed and all his passion not been pent in one wicked place fell to kissing the flouted clay getting up from this tribute he was faced by cesare borgia and his men by cesare who used to such stratagems as this of late had had the whole story out of ludovic at milan and forestalled nona by buying up the troop of centaurs before ever he entered the city thus had amilcare been sold by his own purchase and thus grifone griped in his own springe cesare found him i say and grifone knew in the first crossing of their eyes that his hour had come he bore it without a wink and lucky he might think it that for cesare also the time was short he was sooner dead than he dared to hope and died cursing the name of borgia but that was a seasoned name the populace is on fire highness reported a breathed captain it clamours for the duchess of nona we can hardly hold them much longer strong as we are we must show her though i perceive that her excellency has fainted she is dead man said cesare shortly wiping his pair of daggers it is a pity highness ma he shrugged the end to his period cesare looked at the girl and shrugged in his turn luckily it is dark we must play them that trick they played on borgo san domino she must be put in a litter and at the palace see to it that the lights are behind her before ever you set her up in the window do what you can for us ercole they worked their best to compose that pitiful dead she had suffered much and showed it her wide eyes were horrible and there was little time for more than to order her dress and neckjewels and to smooth out her brown hair hm said cesare you have made little of it but at a distance it may serve our turn until the troops arrive is the litter below good avanti the church bells rang all night and all night the piazza grande was alive a flickering field of torches and passing and repassing throngs evviva madonna hail duchess of nona were the cries they gave and above at an arched window haloed by candlelight the staring lady of the land stiffened and relaxed played out the last functions of her generous body in return for the peoples acclamation bianca maria queen of the romans by virtue of proxy and the sacrament spurred into the city of nona next noon at the head of a plumed escort there at the fatal window she saw the whole truth in a flash o lasso her third husband was her last i see she said and bit her lip to sting the tears back majesty said cesare hat in hand at her stirrup it is not quite so grifone was not quick enough for the other fellow messer death is actually her second husband now i have something for which to thank our lord god said bianca maria let her be decently buried but not here it was however explained that for reasons of policy the duchess of nona must share tombs with the duke serviceable in death as in life there where she was marketed lies her fragrant dust fragrant now i hope since all the passion is out i almost despair of winning your applause for poor molly lovel yet will add this finally in her justification women are most loved when they are lovely most lovely when they are meek this is not to say that they will be worthily loved or loyally there are two sides to a bargain yet this one thing more they are neither meek nor lovely unless they love and since molly lovel on my showing was both in a superlative degree it follows that she must have loved much she was ill repaid while she lived let now that measure be meted her which was accorded another molly whose surname was magdalene messer cino and the live coal i it is not generally known that the learned aristotle once spent the night in a basket dangled midway betwixt attic and basement of a castle nor that having suffered himself to be saddled for the business he went on allfours ambling round the terracewalk with a lady on his back a lady who it is said plied the whip with more heartiness than humanity but there seems no doubt of the fact the name of the lady she was countess of cyprus the time of the escapade which was upon the sages return from india in the train of the triumphant alexanderthese and many other particulars are at hand the story does not lack of detail though it is noteworthy that petrarch in his trionfo damore decently veils the victim in a periphrasis quell el gran grecothere is the great grecian says he and leaves you to choose between the stagyrite philip of macedon and theseus the painters however have had no mercy upon him i remember him in a pageant at siena in a straw hat with his mouth full of grass the lady rides him in the mannish way in pictures he is always doting humbled to the dust or cradled in his basket when he is not showing his paces on the lawn by all accounts it was a bad case of greensickness as such late cases are you are to understand that he refused all nourishment took delight in no manner of books could not be stayed by the nicest problems of physical sciencesuch as whether the beaver does indeed catch fish with his tail the truth concerning the eyesight of the lynxes of boeotia or what gave the partridge such a reputation for heedless gallantry but it would be unprofitable to inquire into all this aristotle was not the first enamoured sage in history nor was he the last and where he bowed his laborious front it was to be hoped that messer cino of pistoja might do the like it is of him that i am to speak the story is of selvaggia vergiolesi the beautiful romp and of messer guittoncino de sigibuldi that most eminent jurist familiarly known as cino da pistoja in the affectionate phrasing of his native town lovemaking was the mode in his day which was also dantes but master cino had been all for the civil law the digest the pandects the institutes of gaius and what not had given him a bent back before his time so that he walked among the pistolese beauties with his eyes on the ground and his hands knotted behind his decent robe love might have made him fatter yet he throve upon his arid food he sat in an important chair in his university he had lectured at bologna hive of sucking archdeacons at siena at perugia should he prosper he looked to florence for his next jump as little as he could contrive was he for pope or emperor black or white farinata or cerchi banishment came that road his friend dante was footsore with exile halfway over apennine by this time cino knew that for him also the treading was very delicate constitutionally he was ghibelline with his friend dante and such politics went well in pistoja for the moment but who could tell the next turn of the wheel might bring the pope round pistoja might go black as indeed she did in more senses than one and pray where would be his assessorship of civil causes where his solemn chair where his title to doffing of caps and a chief seat at feasts cino meditating these things over his morning sop and wine rubbed his chin sore and determined to take a wife his family was respectable but ghibelline his means were happy his abilities known to others as well as to himself good he would marry a sober guelphish virgin and establish a position to face both the windy quarters it was when his negotiations to this end had reached maturity when the contract for his espousals with the honourable lady monna margherita degli ughi had actually been signed that messer cino of pistoja was late for his class got cold feet and turned poet ii it was a strange hour when love leaped the heart of cino that staid jurisconsult to send him reeling up the sunny side of the piazza heedless of his friends or his enemies to his dying day he could not have told you how it came upon him being a man of slow utterance and of a mind necessarily bent towards the concrete all he could confess to himself throughout the terrible business was that there had been a cataclysm he remembered the coldness of his feet cold feet in mid aprilsomething like a cataclysm as he turned it over and over in his mind a lady recurred with the persistence of a refrain in a ballad and words quite unaccustomed words tripped over his tongue to meet her what a lovely vision she had madeuna donzella non con uman volto a gentle lady not of human look well what next ah something about amor che ha la mia virtu tolto love that has reft me of my manly will then should come amore and of course cuore and disio and anch io this was very new it was also very strange what a fascination he found in his phrenetic exercises rhyme now he had called it often enough a jingle of endings it were more true to say that it was a jingle of mendings for it certainly soothed him he was making a goddess in his own image poetrysanta cecilia he was a poet like his friend dante like that supercilious young tombwalker guido cavalcanti a poet he undoubtedly became and if his feet were cold his heart was on fire what happened was this so far as i am informed at the north angle of the church of san giovanni fuori civitas there is a narrow lane so dark that at very noon no sunlight comes in but upon blue bars of dust slantwise overhead this lay upon cinos daily beat from his lodgings to the podesta and here it was that he met selvaggia vergiolesi she was one of three young girls walking hand in hand up the alley on their way from early mass the tallest where all were tall and as it seemed to him when he dreamed of it astonishingly beautiful though they were very young they were ladies of rank their heads were high and crowned their gowns of figured brocade they had chains round their necks and each a jewel on her forehead by chains also swung their little massbooks in silver covers cino knew them well enough by sight their names were selvaggia di filippo vergiolesi guglielmotta aspramonte nicoletta della torre so at least he had always believed but now but now a beam of gold dust shot down upon the central head this was aglaia fairest of the three graces and the other two were euphrosyne and thaleia her handmaids thus it struck cino heart and head at this sublime moment of his drabcoloured life selvaggias hair was brown goldshot of its own virtue in and out of it was threaded a fine gold chain behind it was of course plaited in a long twist plaited and bound up in cloth of gold till it looked as hard as a bulls tail her dress was all of formal brocade green and white to her feet it was cut square at the neck and from that square her throat dazzlingly white shot up as stiff as a stalk which should find in her face its delicate flower she was not very rosy save about the lips her eyes were grey inclined to be green the lashes black as for her shape sumptuous as her dress was stiff and straight and severe i ask you to believe that she had grace to fill it with life to move at ease in it to press it into soft and rounded lines her linked companions also were beauties of their daythat sleek and sleepy nicoletta that ruddy guglielmotta but they seemed to cower in their rigid clothes and they were as nothing to cino the lane was so narrow that only three could pass abreast it was abreast these three were coming as cino saw on a sudden his heart began to knock at his ribs that was when the light fell aslant upon the maid he could no more have taken his eyes off selvaggia than he could have climbed up the dusty wall to avoid her lo here is one stronger than i at the next moment the three young rogues were about him their knitted hands a fencebut the eyes of selvaggia terrible twinfires he thought such as men light in the desert to scare the beasts away while they sleep or as he afterwards improved it for his need like the flaming sword of the archangel which declared and yet forbade eden to adam and his wife selvaggia in truth though she had fourteen years behind her was a romp when no one was looking there were three brothers at home but no mother she was half a boy for all her straight gown to embarrass this demure professor to presume upon her sex while discarding it was a great joke after a tediously droned mass at san jacopo nicoletta would have made room even the hardier guglielmotta drew back but the wicked selvaggia pinched their fingers so that they could not escape all this time messer cino had his eyes rooted in selvaggias reading her as if she were a portent she endured very well what she took to be the vacancy of confusion in a shy recluse well messer cino what will you do said she bubbling with mischief oh madonna can you ask he replied and clasped his hands but you see that i do ask i would stop here all the day if i might said messer cino with a look by no means vacant whereupon she let him through that minute and ran away blushing more than once or twice she encountered him there but she never tried to pen him back again little monna selvaggia learned that you cannot always put out the fire which you have kindled the fire set blazing by those lit green swords of hers was in the heart of an assessor of civil causes a brazier with only too good a draught for love in lovelearned tuscany was then a roaring wind it came rhythmically and set the glowing mass beating like the sestett of a sonnet one lived in numbers in those days numbers always came you sonnetteered upon the battlefield in the pulpit on the bench at the bar throughout the moil of his days work at the podesta those clinging long words in themselves inspiration disio piacere vaghezza gentilezza diletto affetto beautiful twins that go ever embraced wailed in poor cinos ears and insensibly shaped themselves coherent he thought they were like mirrors so placed that each gave a look of selvaggia before the end of the day he had the whole of her in a sonnet which if it were as good as it was comfortable should needs he thought be excellent the thrill which marked achievement sent the blood to his head this time he gloried in cold feet he wrote his sonnet out fair upon vellum in a hand no scribe at the papal court could have bettered rolled it tied it with green and white silk her colours colours of the hawthorn hedge and went out into the streets at the fallingin of the day to deliver it the palazzo vergiolesi lay over by the church of san francesco al prato just where the via san prospero debouches into that green place like all tuscan palaces it was more fortress than house a dark square box of masonry with a machicollated lid and separate from it but appurtenant had a most grim tower with a slit or two halfway up for all its windows here under the great escutcheon of the vergiolesi cino delivered his missive the porter took it with a bow so gracious that the poet was bold to ask whether the lady selvaggia was actually within yes surely messere said the man and moreover in the kitchen with the cookmaids for there is a cakemaking on hand and she is never far away from that business cino was ravished by this instance of divine humiliation so might apollo have bowed in the house of admetus so israel have kept sheep for rachels sake he walked away in most exalted mood his feet no longer cold this was a great day for him when he could see a new heaven and a new earth now i too have been in arcady he thought to himself with tears in his eyes i will send a copy of my sonnet to dante alighieri by a sure hand he should be at bologna by this and he did madonna selvaggia her sleeves rolled up a great bib all about her pretty person and her mouth in a fine mess of sugar and crumbs received her tribute sitting on the long kitchentable it should have touched it might have tickled but it simply confused her the maids peeped over her shoulder as she read in ecstasy that madonna should have a lover and a poet of her own selvaggia filched another handful of sugar and crumbs and twiddled her sonnet while she wondered what on earth she should do with it her fine brows met each other over the puzzle so clearly case for a confidence gianbattista her youngest brother was her bosom friend but he was away she knew riding to pisa with their father next to him ranked nicoletta she would be at mass tomorrowthat would do meantime the cook produced a most triumphal cake hot and hot and the transports of poor messer cino were forgotten dantes reply to his copy was so characteristic that i must anticipate a little to speak of it he confined himself almost entirely to technicalities strongly objecting to the sestett with its three rhymes in the middle upon which cino had prided himself in no small degree the only thing he seemed to care for was the tenth line a dolce morte sotto dolce inganno which you may render if you like to a sweet death under so sweet deceit but he said there were too many os in it as to the subject of your poem he wrote in a postscript love is a thing of so terrible a nature that not lightly is it to be entered since it cannot be lightly left and seeing the latter affair is much out of a mans power he should be wary with the former wherein at present he would appear to have some discretion though not very much this was chilly comfort but by the time it reached him cino was beyond the assault of chills equally interesting should it be to record the conversation of monna selvaggia with her discreet friend nicoletta yet i cannot record everything nicoletta had a lover of her own a most proper poet who had got far beyond the mere accidence of the science where cino was fumbling now you might say that he was at theory nicoletta moreover was sixteen years old a marriageable age an age indeed at which not to have a lover would have been a disgrace she had had sonnets and canzoni addressed to her since she was twelve but then she had two elder sisters and only one brothera monk this made a vast difference the upshot was that when cino met the two ladies at the charmed spot of yesterdays encounter he uncovered before them and stood with folded hands as if at his prayers consequently he missed the very pretty air of consciousness with which selvaggia passed him by the heightened colour of her the lowered eyes and restless fingers also he missed nicolettas demure shot askance demure but critical as became an expert a sonnet and a bunch of red anemones went to the palazzo vergiolesi that evening thenceforth it rained sonnets till poor little selvaggia ran near losing her five wits it rained sonnets i say until the cancellieri brought out the black guelphs in a swarm then it rained blood and the vergiolesi fled one cloudy night to pitecchio their stronghold in the apennine for messer cino it behoved him also to advise seriously about his position to sonnetteer is very well but a lover to say nothing of a jurisconsult must live he cannot have his throat cut if there is a way out there was a very simple way out which he took he went down to lucca in the plain and married his margherita degli ughi with her guelph connections he felt himself safer he bestowed his wife in the keeping of her people for the time bought himself a horse and rode up to pitecchio among the green maize the oliveyards and sprouting vines to claim asylum from filippo and to see once more the beautiful young selvaggia footnote so the pistolesi described at once their government and the seat of it iii there is hardly a sonnet there are certainly neither ballate canzoni nor capitoli which do not contain some reference to monna selvaggias fine eyes and always to the same tune they scorch him they beacon him they flash out upon him in the dark so that he falls prone as saul who got up with a new name and an honourable addition they are lodestones swords lamps torches fires fixed and ambulatory stars the sun the moon candles they hold lurking a thief to prey upon the vitals of cino they are traitors cruel lances they kill him by stabbing day after day you can picture the highspirited young lady from his bookher noble bearing her proud head her unflinching regard again the sparks in her greygreen eyes and so on he plays upon her forte nome her dreadful name of selvaggia so she comes to be ferezza itself tanto e altiera he says so haughtily she goes that love sets him shaking but kind or cruel it is all one to the enamoured master cino for even if she un pochettin sorride light him a little smile it melts him as sun melts snow in any case therefore he must go like dantes cranes trailing his woes it appears that she had very little mercy upon him for all that in one place he records that she was of all sweet sport and solace amorous in many more than one he complains of her bringing him to death and derision of her being in a royal rage with her poet at last he cries out for pity to become incarnate and vest his lady in her own robe it may be that he loved his misery he is always on the point of dying but like the swan he was careful to set it to music first selvaggia in fact laughed at him he turned once to call her a jew for that egged on as she was by her brother and her own vivacious habit she had no nicoletta at pitecchio no mother anywhere and a scheming father too busy to be anything but shrugging towards poets she accepted his rhymes she would probably have been scared if they ceased his services his lowered looks his bent knee and then she tripped away with an arm round gianbattistas neck to laugh at all these praiseworthy attentions as for cino selvaggia was become his religion and his rhyming her reasonable service his goddess may have been as thirsty as the scythian artemis may be that she asked blood and stripes of her devotees all this may well be for by the lord did she not have them ridolfo and ugolino vergiolesi the two elder brothers of selvaggia had stayed behind in pistoja to share the fighting in the streets they had plenty of it given and received ridolfo had his head cut open ugolino went near to losing his sword arm but in spite of these heroic sufferances the detested cancellieri became masters of the city and the chequerboard flag floated over the podesta pistoja was now no place for a ghibelline so the two young men rode up to the hillfortress battered but in high spirits selvaggia flew down the cypresswalk to meet them they were brought in like wounded heroes that was a bad days work for messer cino the amorist apollo and the muses limped in rags and mars was the only god worth thinking about except on sundays ridolfo with his broken headpiece was a bluff youth broadshouldered squarejawed a great eater grimly silent for the most part ugolino had a trenchant humour of the italian sort what this may be is best exampled by our harlequinades in which very much of boccaccios bent still survives you must have a man drubbed if you want to laugh and do your rogueries with a pleasant grin if you are inclined to heroism ridolfo reading selvaggias sheaf of rhymes that night was for running master cino through the body jurist or no jurist but ugolino saw his way to a jest of the most excellent quality and prevailed he was much struck by the poets preoccupation with his sisters eyes candles are they he chuckled torches fires suns moons and stars you seem to have scorched this rhymester vaggia he has frequently told me so indeed said selvaggia it reminds me of messer san giovanni vangelista ugolino continued who was made to sing rarely by the touching of a hot cinder selvaggia snatched the scrolls out of her brothers hand nay nay but wait she cried with a gulp of laughter i have done that to messer cino or can if i choose she turned over the delicate penwork in a hurry here she said eagerly read this ugolino scampered through a couple of quatrains theres nothing out of common here said he go on go on said the girl and nudged him to attend ugolino read the sestett his book is but the vesture of her spirit so too thy poet that feels the living coal flame on his lips and leap to song shall know to whom the glory whose the unending merit nor faltering shall his utterance be nor slow the mute confession of his inmost soul reading he became absorbed in this fantastic but not unhandsome piece even selvaggia pondered it with wide eyes and lips half parted it was certainly very wonderful that a man could say such things she thought were they true could they be true of any one in the worldeven of beatrice portinari that wonderful dead lady she had never she remembered shown this particular sonnet to nicoletta what would nicoletta have said pooh what nonsense it was what arrant nonsense in a man who could carry a sword if he chose and kill his enemies or better still with his head outwit themthat he should turn to pens and ink and to fogging a poor girl so selvaggia not so ugolino he got up and whispered to the scowling ridolfo ridolfo nodded and the pair of them went off presently together oblique looks on cino were the immediate outcome he knew the young men disliked him but cared little for that so long as they left him free to his devotions a brisk little passage a rally of words with a bite in some of them should have warned him but no the stage he had reached was out of range of the longest shots said ugolino at supper messer giurisconsulto will you have a red pepper thank you messere replied cino it is over hot for my tongue the huge ridolfo threw his head back to laugh does a burnt man dread the fire or is he only to be fired one way why man alive my sister has set a flaming coal to your lips and i am told you burst out singing instead of singeing cino coloured at this lunge yet his respect for the lady of his mind was such that he could not evade it you take the language of metaphor messere said he rather stiffly to serve your occasions you are of course within your rights however i will beg leave to be excused the red pepper of messer ugolino you prefer coals cried ugolino starting up good you shall have them that was all but the malign smile upon the dark youths face gave a ring to the words and an omen late that night cino was in his chamber writing a ballata his little oillamp was by his side the words flowed freely from his pen tears hot and honest were in his eyes as he felt rather than thought his exquisite griefs despised and rejected of men was heand why for the love of a beautiful lady eh mother of god but that was worth the pain she had barely lifted her eyes upon him all that day and while her brothers gibed had been at no concern to keep straight her scornful lip patience he was learning his craft the words flowed like blood from a vein love struck me in the side and from the wound my soul took wing and flew to heaven and all my pride fell and i knew there was no balm could stay that wound so wide at this moment came a rapping at his door he went to open it dreaming no harm there stood ridolfo and ugolino with swords in their right hands in his left ugolino carried a brazier gentlemen said cino what is the meaning of this will you break in upon the repose of your fathers guest and do you come armed against an unarmed man the pair of them however came into the room and ridolfo locked the door behind him look you cino said he our fathers guests are not our guests for our way is to choose our own there is a vast difference between us and it lies in this that you and the like of you are wordmongers phrasers heartstrokers whereas we master cino are in scripture language doers of the word rounding our phrases with iron and putting in fullstops with the point when they are needed and we do not stroke girls hearts cino but as often as not break mens heads cino for all his dismay could not forbear a glance at the speakers own damaged pate and after all messer ridolfo in that you do but as you are done by and who will blame you harkee master giurista broke in ugolino we have come to prove some of these fine words of yours it will be well for you to answer questions instead of bandying them now did you or did you not report that my sister selvaggia touched your lips with a coal and set you off singing cino with folded arms bent his head in assent i have said it messere good now such singing though it is not to her taste might be very much to ours in fact we have come to hear it and that you might be robbed of all excuse we have brought the key with us brother pray blow up the brazier ridolfo with his great cheeks like bladders blew the coals to a white heat now then he said grinning to ugolino now then the concert may begin cino who by this time had seen what was in the wind saw also what his course must be whatever happened he could not allow a poet to be made ridiculous it was ridiculous to struggle with two armed men and unseemly but suffering was never ridiculous patience therefore he anticipated the burly ridolfo who having done his bellowswork was now about to pin his victim from behind pray do not give yourself the pain to hold me messere said he i am not the man to deny you your amusement do what you will i shall not budge from here he stood where he was with his arms crossed and he kept his word the red cinder hissed upon his lips he shut his eyes he ground his teeth together the sweat beaded his forehead and glistened in his hair once he reeled over and would have fallen if ridolfo had not been there to catch him but he did not sing the tune they had expected and presently they let him alone so much for italian humour which you will see does not lack flavour it was only the insensate obtuseness of the gull which prevented ugolino dying of laughter ridolfo was annoyed give me cold iron to play with another time he growled i am sick of your monkeytricks this hurt ugolino a good deal for it made him feel a fool will it be believed that the infatuate master cino spent the rest of the night in a rapture of poetry it was not voiced poetry could never have been written down rather it was a torrent of feeling upon which he floated out to heaven in which he bathed it thrilled through every fibre of his body till he felt the wings of his soul fluttering madly to be free this was the very ecstasy of love to suffer the extreme torment for the beloved ah he was smitten deep enough at last if poetry were to be won through bloody sweat the pains of the rack the crawling anguish of the fire was not poetry his own yes indeed what dante had gained through exile and the death of monna beatrice was his for another price the price of his own blood he forgot the physical agony of his scorched mouth forgot the insult forgot everything but this ineffable achievement this desperate essay this triumph this anointing cino cino martyr for love hail cino crowned with thy pain he could have held up his bleeding heart and worshipped it surely this was the greatest hour of his life before he left pitecchio and that was before the dawn came upon it he wrote this letter to his mistress to his unending lady the image of all lovely delight the lady selvaggia cino the poet martyr for love wisheth health and honour with kissing of feet madonna if sin it be to lift over high the eyes i have sinned very grievously and if to have great joy be assurance of forgiveness then am i twice absolved such bliss as i have had in the contemplation of your excellence cometh not to many men yet that which hath befallen me this night concerning which your honourable brothers shall inform you if you ask themthis indeed is to be blessed of love so high so rarely that it were hard to believe myself the recipient but for certain bodily testimony which i doubt not i shall carry about me to my last hour i leave this house within a little while and go to the hermitage of santa marcella pistoiese there to pray almighty god to make me worthy of my dignities and to contemplate the divine image of you wherewith my heart is sealed so fare you wellthe most abject of your slaves cino his reason for giving the name of his new refuge was an honourable one and would appeal to a duellist his flight though necessary should be robbed of all appearance of flight if they wanted him they could find him other results it hadresults which he could never have anticipated and which to have foreseen would have made him choose any other form of disgrace but this was out of the question nothing known to cino or his philosophy could have told him the future of his conduct he placed his letter in an infallible place and left pitecchio just as the western sky was throbbing with warm light for the present i leave him on his way iv the third act of the comedy should open on selvaggia in her bed reading the letter beautiful as she may have looked flushed and loosehaired at that time it is better to leave her alone with her puzzle and choose rather the hour of her enlightenment ridolfo and ugolino were booted and spurred their hooded hawks were on their wrists when she got speech of them they were not very willing witnesses in a cause which now seemed to tell against themselves selvaggias cheeks burned as with poor cinos live coal when she could piece together all the shameful truth tears brimmed at her eyes and these too were scalding hot selvaggia you must understand was a very good girl her only sin being none of her accomplishment she was a child who looked like a young woman certainly she could not help that though all the practice of her race were against her she had never sought love never felt to need it nor cared to harbour it when it came love knocked at her heart asking an entry her heart was not an inn she thought let the wayfarer go on but the knocking had continued till her ears had grown to be soothed by the gentle sound and now it had stopped for ever and pitiful mother for what good reason oh the thing was horrible shameful unutterable she was crying with rage but as that spent itself a great warm flood of genuine sorrow tided over her floated her away she cried as though her heart was breaking and now she cried for pity and at last she cried for very love a pale ethereal cino finger on lip rose before her a halo burned about his head he seemed a saint he should be hers ugolino and ridolfo helpless and ashamed before her outburst went out bickering to their sport and selvaggia wild as her name untaught with none to tutor her dared her utmostdared poor girl beyond her strength late in the afternoon of that day cino in the oratory of his hermitage getting what comfort he could out of an angular madonna frescoed there heard a light step brush the threshold the sun already far gone in the west cast on the white wall a shadow whose sight set his head spinning he turned hastily round there at the door stood selvaggia in a crimson cloak for the rest a picture of the tragic muse so woebegone so white so ringed with dark she was cino on his feet muttered a prayer to himself he covered his scarred mouth but not before the girl had caught sight of it she set to wringing her hands and began a low wailing cry ah terribleah terrible that i should have done it to one who was always so gentle with me and so patient oh cinoand she held out her hands towards himoh cino will you not forgive me will you not i only did it it was through me that they knew what you had said shameful girl that i am she covered her face and stood sobbing before him but confronted with this toppled madonna cino was speechless wholly unprepared by jurisprudence or the less exact science of love for such a pass as he knew himself he could have written eloquently and done justice to the piercing theme but love as he and his fellows understood it had no spoken language i do not see however that selvaggia is to be blamed for being ignorant of this yet he had to say something since there stood the weeping girl all abandoned to her trouble i beseech you madonna he was beginning when she suddenly bared her face her woe and her beauty to his astonished eyes looking passionately at him in a way which even he could not misinterpret cino she said brokenly i am a wilful girl but not wicked ah no not hardhearted i think i did not understand you i heard but would not hear it was wantonness not evil in me cino you have never wearied of telling me your devotion is it too late to be thankful now i am come to tell you what i should have said long before that i am grateful proud of such love that i receive it if still i may thatthather voice fell to a thrilled whisperthat i love you cino ah but she had no more courage she hid her blushes in her hands and felt that now she should by rights sink into the earth judge you who know the theory of the matter if this were terrible hearing for messer cino terrible it was unprecedented hearing it was a thing which so far as he knew had never happened to a lover before that love should go smooth the lady smile the lady love the lady woo monstrous the lady was never kind where was anguish where martyrdom where poetry and sore eyes yet stay was not such a thing in itself a torment to be cut off your martyrdom cino gasped for breath you love me madonna he said you love me selvaggia nodded her head in her hands she felt that she was blushing all over her body cino at this new stab struck his forehead a resounding smack this is terrible indeed he cried out in his distress whereupon selvaggia forgot to be ashamed any more she was so taken by surprise what do you mean cino she began to falter i dont understand you cino plunged into the icy pool of explanation and splashed there at large i mean i meanhe waved his hands in the airit is most difficult to explain we must apprehend love arightif we can he is a grim and dreadful lord it appears working out the salvation of the souls of poets and other men by great sufferings there is no other way as the books teach us such love is always towards ladies the suffering is from them the love for them they deal the darts and receive the more devotion it is not to be otherwisecould not bethere can be no poetry without pain and how can there be pain if the lady loves the poet ah no it is impossible anciently very long ago in the times of troy maybe it was different i know not what to say i had never expected never looked nor even askedah madonna he suddenly cried and found himself upon his knees what am i to say to you for this speech of yours selvaggia white enough now froze hard do you mean she said slowly in words that fell one by one like cuts from a deliberate whip do you mean that you do not love me messer cino after all you are a light to my eyes and a lantern to my feet cino murmured but she did not seem to hear do you mean she went on that you are not prepared to beto be mymy betrothed it was done now let the heavens fall she could not ask the man to marry her but it came to the same thing she had practically committed that unpardonable sin she had approached love to wedlock a mystery to a bargain the rapt converse of souls in heaven to a wrangle over the heeltaps in a tavern parlour she was a heretic whom any court of love must excommunicate the thing was so serious that it brought cino to his feet severe formal an assessor of civil causes he spread out his hands as if to wave aside words he should never have heard he had found his tongue for he was now contemplating the abstract be very sure most sacred lady said he that no bodily torment could drive me to such sacrilege as your noble humility leads you to contemplate no indeed wretchedly unworthy as i am to live in the light of your eyes i am not yet fallen so far there are yet seeds of grace within meof your planting madonna of your planting she paid no heed to his compliments her eyes were fixed on he hurried so far indeed as those worldly concerns go whereof you hint i am provided for my wife is at lucca in her fathers housebut of such things it is not fitting we should speak rather we should reason together of the high philosophy of love which but selvaggia was gone before he could invite her on such a lofty flight the wife at lucca sent her fleeting down the mossy slopes like a hare it was too dark for men to see her face when she tiptoed into pitecchio and slipped up to her chamber safe at last there she shivered and drowsed the night away but waking or sleeping she did not cease her dreary moan cino after a night of consternation could endure the hermitage no more the problem he was free to confess beat him next day therefore he took horse and rode over the mountains to bologna intent upon finding dante there but dante had gone to verona with half of his inferno in his saddlebag thither cino pursued and there found him in the church of st helen disputing with the doctors upon the question of the land and the water what passed between the great poet and the less i cannot certainly report nor is it material i think that the tinge of philosophy set here and there in cinos verses to say nothing of a couplet or two which give more than a hint of the vita nova may safely be ascribed to that time i know at least that he did not cease to love his beautiful and wild selvaggia so far as he understood that delicate state of the soul which she perverse child had so signally misapprehended the truth may well be that he was tolerably happy at verona able to contemplate at his ease the divine image of his lady without any interference from the disturbing original he was it is said meditating an ambitious work the history of the roman polity from numa to justinian an epic in five and twenty books wherein selvaggia would have played a fine part that of the genius of natural law the scheme might have ripened but for one small circumstance this was the death of selvaggia that healthy laughing girl genius of nature or not paid the penalty of her incurable childishness by catching a malaria whereof she died as it is said in a high delirium of some eight hours so it seems that she was really unteachable for first she had spoiled cinos martyrdom and next by the same token robbed the world of an epic in twentyfive books cino heard of it some time afterwards and in due season was shown her tomb at monte della sambuca high on the apennine a grey stone solitary in a grey waste of shale there he pondered the science of which while she was so strangely ignorant he had now become an adept there or thereabouts he composed the most beautiful of all his rhymes the canzone which may stand for an elegy of the lady selvaggia ay me alas the beautiful bright hair ay me indeed and thus he ends ay me sharp death till what i ask is done and my whole life is ended utterly answermust i weep on even thus and never cease to moan ay me he might well ask it should be accorded him that he was worthy of the occasion the poem is very fine but i think the good man did well enough after this i know that if he was sad he was most melodiously sad he throve he became a professor his wife bore him five children his native city has done him what honour she could ousted his surname in favour of her own set up a pompous monument in the cathedral church where little selvaggia heard her dull mass and dubbed him once and for all lamoroso messer cino da pistoja that should suffice him as for the young selvaggia i suppose her bones are dust of the apennine footnote the translation is rossettis the judgment of borso unde proverbii loco etiamnunc usurpatur praeteriisse borsii temporaeste chronicle i the adventurers it is happily as unnecessary as

nuns ferrara is the place of all the world for you i look forward to your speedy establishment in a city where a girl may be like a flagstaff and yet not thought amiss bellaroba looked humbly at herself in the glass though she could see that she was pretty it was not to be denied that she was thin ah no she did not take after her mother here she sighed to remember that her bosom friend olimpia castaneve took after hers only too well and was to accompany her fortunehunting in ferrara for precisely opposite reasons was this fair she wondered she bellaroba was to go because she was of a piece with the ferrarese olimpia because she could furnish a provoking contrast she was an affectionate docile creature this shrinking bellaroba absurdly young absurdly your servant but tears smarted in her eyes as she stood adorned for sacrificein her tight crimson dress lace at her neck and wrists a jewel on her forehead a chain in her hair and a cold block of lead dragging at her heart she had never denied any one anything and certainly not her mother her tears glistened as she blinked her lip was shaky she was kissed a goodbye none the less and went down the steps to join olimpia huddled in the gondola goodbye my child cried madam fragiletta from the doorway be wise remember what i have told you never see a priest the wrong side of the grille and obey monna nanna in everything i shall have a mass for you at san zan tomorrow and another on your birthday which i shall never forget the morning was misty and sharp madam fragiletta was very much undressed and loved her bed she waved her hand gallantly to bellaroba who still stood up wistful in the gondola she did not wait for it to shoot the bridge or round the square corner of the rio but turned shrugging to the house there was no reasonable probability that these two would ever meet again short outlooks govern la fragilettas trade and providence it seems has little to do with it olimpia castaneve the muffled brooder in the poop was cold cross and still bellaroba snivelled but she was scornful under her cloak and no word passed between the pair until they were in the great bluntnosed barge heading against a crisping tide for chioggia then as the sun shot through the mist and revealed the lagoon one broad sheet of silver and blue the shawls were opened limbs went luxuriously at the stretch you could see and hear chatter the couple of adventurers if you cared bellaroba you have seen alreadyvery gentle very simple very unformed without and within she had pretty ways coaxing and appealing ways when she asked a question it was with lifted eyebrows and a head on one side she would take your hand without art and let you hold it without afterthought it was the easiest thing in the world to kiss her for she suffered it gladly and quite innocently it came as naturally as to a cat to rub his cheek on your chair or swinging foot yet the girl was as modest as a clare if you had presumed on your licence to make love to her it would not have been her scorn for she had none but her distress that would have set you back in your place god knows what la fragiletta might have taught her it is certain she was all unlettered in love up to that hour bellaroba was not only modest by instinct but that better thing innocent by preoccupation in all this she was a dead contrast to her handsome friend olimpia castaneve who was really a beauty of the true venetian mould as sleek and sumptuous as a cat as splendidly coloured as a sunburnt nectarine crowned with a mass of redgold hair as stupid as she was sly and as rich as she was spendthrift the lovely olimpia had been sent adventuring to the bees of ferrara not as lacking honey for venice but as being too great a treasure for her mothers house her mother was la farfallaa swollen butterfly in these daysand frankly said that she could not afford such a daughter olimpia had no instructions in fact needed none she went cheerfully out to what monna nanna and the blessed virgin should prepare for her without kisses which she garnered against the lean years and without reserves she neither condemned her mother nor approved perhaps she had not the wit assuredly she lacked the energy she was remarkably handsome in her hot venetian way richly coloured browneyed crimsonlipped bosomed like a goddess and shaped like a caryatid she half closed her eyes half opened her lips smiled and drowsed and waited you would have thought her melting with love she was ciphering a price but being slow at figures she hid herself spiderwise in a golden mesh olimpia was nearly always complaisant had no reticences no conscience few brains she was luxury itself fond of the fire fond of her bed fond of her dinner admittedly selfabsorbed she was accustomed to say that she knew far too much about love to fall into it it was a reflection as serious as she could make it but love is very apt to take such sayings amiss olimpia out of love might make men miserable in it what might she not do i am about to tell you at chioggia they were to await a shipload of merchants and packmules expected from ancona but the wind proved counter when their barge had weathered malamocco and that which disserved them befriended the northering freight they found the train of beasts awaiting them saddled and loaded restless to be off chioggia to ferrara by the road they would go is a handsome fifty miles in that company as they neared they observed a calmeyed youth with a delicate girlish face and wonderful shock of light gold hair all about it he stood alone on the mole one knee bent a hand to his hip and soberly surveyed the group on the barge he made a charming little picture thereseemed indeed posed for some such thing he was charmingly pretty himself but for all that he had a tragic touch upon him a droop of the lip or the eyelid perhaps one could hardly say yet never miss it even olimpia noticed the shadow across him as they touchedlook look bellaroba she whispered and nudged her friendthat boy did you ever see such a lovely child bellaroba drew a long breath i think he is as lovely as an angel she replied her eyes fascinated and her saying was equally true he was such a demure boyangel brighthaired long and shapely in the limb as the painters and carvers loved to set in madonnas court careful about her throne or below the dais fiddling or strumming lutes to charm away her listlessness moreover angioletto was the name he went by though he had been christened dominick and he came from borgo san sepolcrofar cry from windy chioggiaa place among the brown tuscan hills just where they melt into umbria and he was by trade a minstrel and going to ferrara of so much with many bows he informed the two girls being questioned by olimpia but he looked at bellaroba as he spoke and she listened the harder and looked the longer of the two everything about him seemed to her altogether gracious from the silky floss of his gold hair to his proper legs sheathed in scarlet to the thighs he was as soft and daintily coloured as a girl had long curved lashes to his grey eyes a pathetic droop to his lip the bloom as of a peach on his cheeks but you could never mistake him for a girl his eyes had a critical blink he looked to have the discretion of a man a fop he might be he had a wiry mind a fop in fact he was he had a little scarlet cap on his head scarlet stockings peaked scarlet shoes for the rest he was in green cloth with a blue leather belt about his waist he had fine lace ruffles at his wrists a fine line of white at his throat and in his ears if you could have seen them gold rings just the pampered young minion of any tuscan court a precocious wrappage of wit good manners and sensibility he looked what he spoke the exquisite florentine to these broadvowelled venetian lasses did not smile but seemed never out of temper and was certainly not timid selfpossessed reticent he was but not timid that was proved when the cavalcade was on the point to start angioletto stepped forward and took bellaroba by the hand little lady says he to his blushing captive i have a mule for the road which i am assured is a steady pacer will you be my pillion oh yes messere said bellaroba in a twitter and dropped him a curtsy of her best excellent he cried gaily i can see that we are to be friends so she was led away he helped her on to the mule in no time showed her how she must hold him round the middle how closely and how constantly he explained how little there was to fear for all that such a manner of going was as venturesome to her as a steamer would have seemed to ulysses that great captain it was then that olimpia watching all this proved angioletto not timid for she saw him conclude his precepts to her friend by kissing her cheek in the easiest manner hm thought the wise olimpia i pray that bellaroba may be careful she herself accepted the services and part of the horse of a lean ravennese a captain of lancestwo yards of sinew and brown leatherwho told her that his name was mosca and his heart bleeding at her feet olimpia smiled beautifully upon him but was careful took a share of the courser but gave in return nothing more than a hand on its masters belt he wanted much more and showed it olimpia far from coy hinted an exchange she needed her bearings did this apparent hero know ferrara the mosca snorted threw back his head at the word ferrara cried he did he know it saints and angels who could know it better ferrara he went on to shout appealing to gods and men the gayest court in all italythe cleanest air the most laughing women thepest it is a place of holy days and feastsall music loving and delight but you will see my dear i will see that you see olimpia must know more exactly than this and so she told the mosca he could deny her nothing so as they rode between the grey swamps of the lagoon he poured out his understanding in his own fashion his oaths made her gasp but the facts atoned for that by the bones of god but he served a great lord of that cityguarino guarini by name whose blade was the longest the oftenest out and the cleanest cutter as himself was the lightest heart and most trenchant carver of men in borsos fief the good captain carried his loyalty to the edge of his simplicity and left it there for olimpia to handle by the cheeks of the virgin my dear i know what i know my young master has an eye which whether it say come or go needs not say it twice he is as fine and limber as a leopard on the king of englands shield of a nature so frank and loving that i suppose there is hardly a lady in ferrara could not testify to itunless she were bound to the service of his magnificence the duke why yourself might make a shift to be my little friend and never repent it mind youno no i may be battered my dear but i am seasoned i have great experience you would not repent and shall not by the face on the handkerchief but happen you see my master happen he wear his brocade of white and goldit is all peacocks eyes my seraphic heart in gold and blue upon snowy whitehappen again he look come at youwhy off you trot as a hound to the platter and i speed you thither with open heart thus walks his world guarino guarini my noble master olimpia had a colour and flew it now most becomingly in her cheeks it was a wholesome healthy happy colour born of her growing excitement the captain highly approved of it she thus earned more information guarino guarini it appeared though not of the reigning family was very near the throne he had married one of the deste ladies madama lionella legitimised daughter of duke borso and was now ignoring the fact to his own and her entire satisfaction upon the countesss score captain mosca had not very much to say a greathearted lady amorous generous a great lover he allowed a pretty taste for music and singing she has is a friend of poets and such like the antechamber is full of them and there they areon promotion you understand but though she has a wonderful free spirit she is no beauty you must know her mouth is too big and her eyes are too small it is a kissing mouth as we say my dear and a speaking eyeand there you have madama lionella who loves minstrels tell me said olimpia here who is that pretty gentleman with my friend is he not a minstrel the captain turned in his saddle and when he had observed snorted his disdain that sprout my deary said he some such dapper little chamberfellow ill warrant you a lapdog a ladys toy with a piping voice and an eye for mischief yes hell be for climbing by madama lionellas backstair he has the make of itjust the doll she loves to dandle which was all the captain had to say for angioletto little as it was it was more than angioletto had to say for mosca he was indeed serenely indifferent to the lean brown man from the moment of their setting out he and bellaroba had wagged tongues in concert and before they had made a dozen miles each knew the others story to the roots angiolettos was no great matter the capuchins at borgo had taught him his rudiments his voice had taken him into the choir his manners into the sacristy he had been boybishop twice had become a favourite of the wardens learnt latin smelt at greek scribbled verses then one corpus christi he got his chance there was to be a pageanttriumph he called ita triumph of love and a triumph of chastity wherein by the good offices of his friend the warden he was chosen for the part of love it was to be assumed that he pleased for chastity who was a great lady of the place took him into her service and there he stayed until as he explained she married again she had been a widow it seems when she took part in the triumphs bellaroba was much interested was the lady kind to you angioletto oh very kind but you had to go you say yes it was judged better but i dont quite see if she was kind i wonder why you judged it better to go or why she did it did not rest wholly with us said angioletto bellaroba did not pursue the subject but after a short pause and are you now from her house she asked angioletto shook his head that was a very long time ago said he two years at least i am eighteen you must know when i left the marchioness she gave me a handsome present it sufficed to take me to perugiato the university there it afforded me two years study in the liberal arts and my outfit for this present venture into the bargain and do you know what you will do at ferrara angioletto yes quite well what will you do i will marry you bellaroba the boy replied as he turned suddenly put his arms about her and took a long kiss bellaroba in a bath of love made him free of her lips for a while the mule had to do his pacing alone oh angioletto angioletto whispered the girl with a hidden face i have never been happy like this before you will never be unhappy again dearest for i shall be with you for the time there was no more talk since the broken murmurs of their joy and wonder cannot be so described the billing of two doves on an elm was not more artless than their converse on the mules back the girl brought prose in again as became a daughter of venice what had led angioletto to ferrara the blessed virgin he promptly replied and she sighed a happy acquiescence in so pious a retort but what else for answer angioletto drew a silkbound letter from his breast this epistle he said promises me employment and fame almost as certainly as you promise me bliss it is from a cardinal of my acquaintance to a noble lady of ferrara by name lionella daughter of duke borso himself and wife to one messer guarino guarini a very great lord the lady is patroness of all poets and minstrels consider our fortunes made my joy they must be made since you believe it angioletto said bellaroba with faith i have never seen any one like you so beautiful and so wise at once the compliment provoked kisses angioletto embraced her again again conversation became ejaculatory and again the mule tripped over the reins he learned before the day was out to allow for this new hindrance to his way he tripped no more the lovers continued their rapt intercourse all that mayday journey through the ricefields until at rovigo half hidden in a mist of green they halted for the night ii arms and the mannikin the hubbub of the innyard where shouting merchants wrestled for porters and donkeys brayed them down the narrowed eyes of olimpia the sardonic grin of the gaunt mosca brought our lovers back into the real world they faced their foes together with insensible meeting and holding of young hands angioletto did his best not to feel a detected schoolboy and did succeed in meeting the captains terrific looks bellaroba made no attempt at heroism her blush was a thing to be seen bellaroba come with me my child said olimpia severely but angioletto kept her hand captain mosca fiddled at his swordhilt would you like spitted lark for supper madonna he asked with meaning olimpia burst into a shrill laugh and angioletto who had the pluck of a little gamecock turned to his partner in guilt and you madonnetta he said sweetly what do you say to boars head larded bellaroba giggled in spite of herselffor she was terribly frightenedbut again olimpia the grand indifferent pealed her delight the captain glared round about him over a tossing sea of bales and asses ears getting small joy of that he scowled portentously at the little minstrel and took a stride forward look you sprigling said he you have to do with a man of deeds a man by saint hercules of steel angioletto was fired cheek and eye he never faltered i wish i had to do with a man of sense he said if you do not drop that ladys hand my lad growled the mosca what then sir then the captain roared by the antechambers of paradise she shall cling to carrion bellaroba with a little cry fell to her knees olimpia bit her finger angioletto shrugged you have better lungs than manners captain he said quietly these ladies of ours are fatigued with travel and tired of fasting moreover i apprehend a bale of carpets on my back at every moment we will so please you sup if you and the lady whom you escort will do me the honour of sharing my table we can arrange other matters at our leisure i have always understood that encounters before ladies are makebelieve but your experience should inform you how far that is true by leave signor capitano whereupon he lifts up the praying bellaroba kisses her forehead and hands her into the inn as bold as a viscount one or two tongues were in one or two cheeks one hand at least clapped him on the shoulder for a little assassina compliment the honours were his to that present olimpia followed after him very much impressed with the thought that the sooner she could exchange mosca for moscas master the better for her in the rear of the procession stalked that gaping hero swearing rapidly under his breath to keep himself in some sort of countenance angiolettos assurance and with it his luck held out the evening not otherwise could he have cleared himself of the mess he fairly froze mosca by the coolness of his assumptions i will fight you as soon as you choose and with your own weapons after supper said he but it is only fair to warn you that you will be killed how so by the king of glory cried the captain the wagging finger of fate sir replied angioletto readily and the conjunctions of the stars my horoscope was taken at foligno with the utmost exactitude mars himself for reasons of his own seems to have presided over my begetting more than that though i have not the least desire to take your lifeshould not indeed know what to do with itit will be impossible for me to avoid it i am really very sorry your case is just on a parallel with that of the younger altopasso who on this very day a year ago insisted upon fighting with me it is true that i do not pretend to love or even to approve of you captain i consider that your legs have outgrown your brains but for all that i should be sorry to think that for want of a little ordinary politeness or for shanks out of due measure an honest man had lost his life however i fear the affair has gone too far the captain grew purple and green by turns the room of full tables was all agog he let out an oath which i omit the affair has not gone so far as this blade shall go turkeypoult he thundered make yourself quite easy on that point my good sir said angioletto cracking a walnut your sword shall fly the length of the room i have a pass that is irresistible you cannot fight planets captain i have never tried yet by our lord the captain admitted but no one has dared to doubt my valour and planet or no planet ill run you through angioletto smiled at another walnut i find the conceit admirable said he yet you will perish so sure as this city is rovigo and a titular fief of my mistresss master a straw for your mistress little egg cried the suffocating captain i will give it to countess lionella as your dying gift signor capitano the name smacked him in the face he shook his head like a worried bull or as a dog shakes water from his pelt olimpia too was interested and for the first time with face fixed between her hands she leaned both elbows on the table watching is the countess lionella your mistress she asked angioletto made her a bow the company applauded a popular name olimpia turned a glance upon her captain which said as plainly as she could have spoken finish him for your masters sake but it had no meaning for the champion who possibly knew more about his master than he had been minded to declare angioletto tapped the ground with his toe come master captain he said before your blood cools have no fear bantam said a jolly dominican in his ear that toads blood was never hot it certainly looked like it the captain scratched his head look ye now youngster he said at last i serve his worship count guarino guarini who is the husband of madama lionella and lucky for you that service is otherwise by the truly splintered cross it had gone hard with you this night oh brava brava cheered the diningroom and then hooted the captain to his bench angioletto put up his little hanger with a curt nod in his enemys direction for the countesss sake i spare you to the count captain mosca though what precisely your value may be to his excellency i do not at present understand thereupon he turned to his poor bellaroba took her in his arms before them all kissed her eyes dry of tears and ended by drawing a rueful smile from her lips the diningroom found him admirable throughout but olimpia got up yawning come child it is time for bed she declared i suppose even this entertainment must have a term there was no gainsaying it the lovers were torn apart by the moral force of olimpias attendance but not until it was demonstrated that though goodnight is a word of two syllables it needs four lips and is therefore capable of infinite extension well my child i hope you are satisfied with this little days work said olimpia half undressed for answer bellaroba upon her friends neck dissolved in a flood of happy tears iii how they came to ferrara that was a fair sight which greeted the travellers at the close of the next daythe towers of ferrara rising stately out of a green thicket the lovers trilled their happiness to each other surely nothing but pleasure and a smooth life could come out of so treeful a place in our venice you must know said bellaroba we set great store by green boughs having so few of them we think that harshness and clamour may hunt the canals but that birds can sing in gardens of a world really joyful what a cloud of green treeslook look how near the sky comes to them oh my angioletto we are going to be so happy and the young girl laid her hot cheek on her lovers shoulder he though her premises were undeniable had his doubts her words set him wondering what was to be the end of this lighthearted adventure my dear said he if trees get in a mans way of villainy or incommode his pleasures he will cut them down depend upon it well silly boy she cried and gave him a peck of a kiss and does not that prove what i say that there are no villainies in ferrara for see the trees are as thick as a forest she made him laugh again before many paces his ringing tones caught the ears of captain mosca and set that great man scowling if i dont get a crumb down that yapping gullet call me not mosca he grumbled speak a little louder signor capitano said his pillion your pardon madonna olimpia he answered but i believe i was breathing a prayer on account of the little loveboy yonder olimpia laughed i love him as much as you do i dare swear said she but he may be very useful remember that i am but a poor gentlewoman with my fortune to make give me the making of it my angel cried the captain crushing his heart with his fist you shall have the most crowded cortile in ferrara may i give you a humble bit of advice certainly you may it will be this then that you hold off from monna nanna and keep yourself very much to yourself between us we can arrange a pretty future i know monna nanna better than becomes me believe me the acquaintance would become you still less but with such talents as i haveand they are all yoursi can arrange for you a most proper dwellingplace which shall cost little and bring much in but we cannot live there alone captain hey i am beforehand i parry with the head my duchess cried the delighted mosca i have thought of all that there is an old lady of my friendship in the city by name donna matura she is something decayed in estate o these days has fewer crusts than teeth poor soul but has mingled with the highest she will be all that you could wish and you more than she could hope for think of it lady think of it i will said olimpia who had already done so there is no doubt that she and the mosca understood each other they were now riding up the long limetree avenue which leads to the seagate of ferrara soon they entered ferrara itself that city of warm red brick of broad eaves of laughter and as it were a fairytale bowered in rustling green the streets ran wide between garden walls and the massy fronts of great square houses they were full of a traffic which seemed that of a prosperous people bent upon pleasure happy ladies rode by with hawks or leashed dogs or crowns of flowers cavaliers in white and yellow ribboned slashed curled and feathered went in and out of the throng to keep an assignation or to break one the priests joked with the women the very urchins coaxed for kisses every street corner had its lovers tryst never a garden walk without its loitering pair never a lady came out of a church door but there stood a devout adorer to beg a touch of holy water from her fingertip how happy this people is cried bellaroba flushed and sparkling to her little lord everybody loves everybody else my dear we have nothing to do with their loves we are going to be married replied angioletto looking straight before him yes angioletto said she as meek as a mouse olimpia who was not thinking of marriage was highly entertained there was a press of grooms and led horses richly caparisoned outside the open doors of a new and very spacious palace round about them crowded people of a meaner sort and beggars not a few but a lane was kept to the gateway by soldiers in red and yellow who bore upon their breasts a quartered coat of eagles and lilies hist said mosca pulling up his horse this is the fine new palace of the duke which he calls his schifanoia he is evidently expected in from his hawking the greatest falconer you ever knew my life i do assure you that may very well be said olimpia for i have never known one at all you shall know this one before i die and another who is my most noble master cried mosca or i am your kenneldog for nothing let us wait a little and see this hawking duke of yours olimpia said with a gentle pressure of her arms about the captains middle blood of blood sighed the mosca i am as wax in the candle of you my soul olimpia pulled down her hood her patience was rewarded in no long time by the sound of an approaching cavalcade presently she saw the nodding plumes of riders and their beasts at the end of the street knights squires and ladies rode with their reigning prince he himself with two young men magnificently dressed came in advance of the troop and at a great pace olimpia judged her time well at the moment duke borso drew rein to turn into his gates she threw back her hood and looked him full in the face as if to dower him with all the splendour of her beauty the sly humorous face of the old fox twitched as his eyes caught the girls he looked a prude with a touch of freakishness in him his pursed mouth seemed always to be strangling a smile the issue of the strife always in doubt now for instance though olimpia said to herself that she was satisfied she could never have denied that he disapproved of her while nobody could have maintained it borso had shot upon her a piercing glance the minute in which he had turned his horse mosca had had the benefit of another then he had acknowledged in military fashion the waving caps and kerchiefs at the gates and had passed into the courtyard oh you may be satisfied my soul said the mosca borso will never forget us now it is not his way but look look another pair of eyes was at work belonging to a very handsome ruddy youth who had been at the dukes left hand olimpia needed no nudge from the captain to tell her who this noble rider might be guarino guarini for a florin and so it was yes said mosca that is my most intrepid master the flaxen lad in silver brocade who was on the other side is teofilo calcagnini of whom i know little more than that he is duke borsos shadow you shall hardly see them apart the other my charmer the other is our man leave me to deal with him come now to the inn tomorrow you shall have your hired house and the next day company for it more to your taste than lean old mosca i shall never forget you my captain said the really grateful olimpia and said truer than she knew come she added we should seek out bellaroba and her little sweetheart there must be an end of that pretty gentleman my friend by the majesty of king solomon there shall be an end mosca swore and pricked his horse angioletto and his ladylove had been better exercised than to think of dukes they had thought of religion they passed by the schifanoia at a sober walk regardless of the crowd my heart angioletto said there is here what i suppose to be the most famous shrine in romagna i mean that of the madonna degli greci a pompous image from byzantium which proceeded undoubtedly from the bottega of saint luke if that signore had been as indifferent a painter as he was great saint which is surely impossible we should do well to visit his madonna her holiness is past dispute there are very few miracles which she could not perform if she chose as well as burning a candle apiece before her face we could lay our prayers and new love at her feet beyond question she will hear and bring us good luck what do you think i think as you think angioletto said bellaroba and held him closer let us go then i know the way very well so they went to the tune which the young lad sang under his breath and before long came to a piazza not very broad but flagged all over and set about with stately brick buildings having on the left the stone front of a great church tier upon tier of arches interlaced the door of it was guarded by two stone lions and above the porch was the figure of a buxom lady with a smile half saucy half benevolent to whom angioletto doffed his cap they call her donna ferrara he explained this is the duomo let us go in they dismounted a lame boy held the mule they entered the church it was very large very dark and nearly empty angioletto put his arm round bellarobas waist and they began to pace the aisle in confidential talk where are you going to live in this place bellaroba he asked her i dont know olimpia knows there was a monna nanna we were to live with i think but olimpia will decide i must do as she wishes but why she is older than i amtwo years besides i always have and my mother commanded it your last appears to me the only reason worth a thought do you not want to know what i think of it bellaroba he bent his head towards her her answer the flutter of a quick little kiss pleased him well i will tell you said he i think we should be married at oncethis very minute i do indeed oh said bellaroba blushing beautifully i can see that you are pleased at this my dear angioletto said looking at her they were head for head level these children but what would olimpia say bellaroba paused for strength to tell the painful truth she would say fiddlesticks angioletto angioletto frowned ah what is to be done he asked bellaroba looked down plucked at her skirt saw angiolettos hand peeping round her waist it seemed difficult to say and yet what she did say was very simple we have not asked olimpia you know no angioletto answered we have had no time yet but we will of course oh of course said she who kept her eyes hidden and spoke very low oh of course but well dearest could we notwould it not be wiserof course you know best angiolettomight we not ask herafterwards angioletto kissed her you are as wise as you are lovely my little wife come let us find the madonna degli greci and he led her away by the hand they found her in the north transept in a little fenced chapel all starry with tapers and gleaming gold and silver hearts as it was the eve of pentecost she was uncovered they could see her dark outline with its wrought metal ring about the head halfway down was another metal ring bambinos head should be in there both the handfasted pilgrims fell to their knees bellaroba crossed herself and then hid her face with her left hand angioletto with his right after a silence about the space of two hail marys the youth looked resolutely up at madonna and began to speak to her holy and most glorious virgin mother of god said he we thy children have sought thee first in this famous city of ferrara because we are sure that thou wilt love us even more than we love each other and wilt be glad to share our secret we are going to marry each other at this moment madonna and thou shalt be the priest there can be none better since thou hadst in thy womb for many months the great priest of all christians our sublime redeemer now behold madonna how i wed this my wife bellaroba with this ring which was given me by a very great lady and he took a ring from his breast i wed my wife placing it upon her finger in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost i do not endow her with my worldly goods for thou knowest i have none i do not worship her with my body at this moment but in the meantime i worship her unfeignedly with my mind just as i worship thee with my soul it appears therefore that i have wedded her enough it is useless most sacred lady to ask her whether she will honour and obey me because of course she will seeing that she loves me with all her good heart such as we arevery young quite poor but much thy servantsthou knowest whether thou canst be happy in this mating i believe that thou canst now therefore since she is mine she shall say with me three aves and a paternoster likewise the credo or so much of it as she can remember and o madonna trust me to cherish her and do thou intercede for us per christum dominum nostrumamen bellaroba my wife look at me he said and the girl looked up wondering he took her happy face between his hands and kissed her two eyes her forehead and her mouth then they said the appointed prayers and rose to their feet to return nor did they forget the candles but purchased them at the door of an old lady who had a basketful to sell coming out of the church into the sun again they encountered the scrutiny of olimpia captain mosca slapping his booted leg was holding the horse where have you two children been said olimpia mischief in a corner eh you have missed the sight of duke borso and a gilded company we have been saying our prayers to madonna of the greeks said bellaroba meekly there are red flames in your cheeks child and a ring on your finger did you find those in the church madonna gave them to me olimpia so so so do you begin by robbing a shrine pray ah madama olimpia said angioletto we have only taken from the shrine what is our due not the least of the minstrels parts was that of speaking as though he had something weighty in reserve olimpia though by nature dull was also sly she had a suspicion about angioletto now but a quickshifting glance from one to the other of the pair before her revealed nothing but serenity in the boy and little but soft happiness in the girl she opened her lips to speak snapped them to again and turned to the captain and affairs more urgent than the lovemaking of babies it was the hour of supper the question was of a lodging captain mosca knew an innthe golden swordwhere decent entertainment could be had for the night as no one could deny what nobody knew anything about it was decided they sought and found the golden sword and put up with it and in it the supper party was at least merry for angioletto led it he sang he joked made love spent money was wise unwise heedless heedful he charmed a grin at last into the very captains long face that warrior indeed went so far as to drink his health in wine of verona he and his olimpiaunhesitatingly his in the gaiety of the momentdrank it out of the same glass love and ferrara cried captain mosca with a foot on the table love in ferrara said angioletto and stroked bellarobas hair so everything was very friendly and full of hope at a late hour and for excellent reasons olimpia kissed bellaroba goodnight was herself kissed by angioletto and withdrew captain mosca prayed vehemently for further and better acquaintance with his friend the divine poet and his pretty mistress so went bellarobas marriage supper iv why come ye nat to courte le donne e i cavalier gli affanni e gli agi che ne invogliava araore e cortesia the little housediscreet affair of eaves modest as drooped eyelids of latticed windows of wistaria before and a bower of willows behindwas found and furnished out of the girls store and the captains credit donna matura a brown old woman hideous toothless and inclined to swooning was installed as duenna she was indeed owner of the house and furniture for which olimpia paid and the captain promised to pay but that did not appear until much later there was a great charm not without a certain deal of luxury in the place of course there was a gardena bright green nest of flowering trees and shrubs in the middle was a grassplat in that again a bronze fountain which had the form of three naked boys back to back and an inscription to the effect that it had been set up by a certain galeotto moro in the days of marquess lionel in honour of saints peter and paul and of the virgin deipara upon some special occasion of family thanksgiving the weeping willowsthemselves fountains of greensprayed over a stone seat the place bore signs of an honourable past it was falling now gently to a comely decay but it answered every purpose all promised well so much captain mosca was given to understand yet it was hinted that his promises were not complete my life and soul cried he on his knees in the garden the little affair is a matter of three minutes it proved to be a matter of more than three months and was then accomplished in another way and with other results than had been looked for thus it was when angioletto had been assured of the nesting of his mate he dressed himself pointdevice and went to court to deliver his credentials he found the lady upon whom so much depended at the schifanoia madama lionella deste wife of the count guarino guarini was a freshcoloured lusty young woman of three and twenty not at all in love with her husband but very much in love with love the captain of lances had said truly when he shrugged her off as no beauty largelimbed she was the shape of a boy with a long mouth and small eyes fulllipped big in foot and hand yet she was a very merry soul frank if not free in her speech and gesture and though liable to bursts of angry temper for the most part as innocent of malice as a tiger cub if you remember her an este you will forgive her much excuse her everything and rather like her angioletto who found her sitting on the grass among her ladies advanced with great ceremony and many bows madama did not get up no one did so angioletto had to step gingerly into a ring of roguish women to deliver his letter lionella scampered through it reddening with pleasure she beckoned him with smiles to sit beside her we are making rosegarlands to adorn our pretty heads she said laughing come and sit by me angioletto and sing to us who knows but what if you are good we shall not crown you with one of them it was a great merit of angiolettos that he always took things and men especially women as he found them such as they were he could be for the time he was by no means waxen elastic rather down he plumped accordingly crosslegged by his new mistress and warbled a canzone to the viola which enchanted the lady more more more she cried clapping her hands oh boy i could have you a prince for less than that what a throstlepipe you have it was as he afterwards found out of her habit to be for ever at extremes but just now not knowing how to take her he sang on all the better for her praise and he had her next wriggling in an ecstasy over a trifle he made up on the spur of the momenta snatch wherein roses and a girls face bellarobas be sure took turns to be dominant at the end of this pretty piece the countess lionella fairly took his own face between her hands crumpled his lips into a bud and kissed them full angioletto coloured though no one else did it was evidently quite harmless and afterwards he was ashamed of his shame as it was a diversion of a different order broke in upon the next song which so soon as he had picked up his nerve he adventured one of the maids of honour looked quickly over her shoulder and hist madama the duke she said with wide eyes and a blush the song ceased the whole company lionella included scrambled to their feet duke borso his portly body swaying like a carriage on springs his hands behind him and attended by a tall young man very splendid and very blonde came across the grass towards them angioletto could not decide whether to think him rogue or prude his puckered face twitched his eyes twitched his pursedup lips worked together it was again as if he were struggling with a laugh he wore his tall square cap well off his forehead and looked what he really wasa strong man tired but not yet tired out of kindness the benevolence seemed inborn seemed fighting through every seam of the pompous face madonna his generous motions work him into creases as if he were volcanic soil thought angioletto watching him narrowly as he came he decided that this was a master to be loved if not admired respected but not feared i should get the worst of a bout with him thought he but i had rather it were with him than with apollo that title was just as the reflection shrewd teofilo calcagnini would have made a terrible tutor to master phaeton duke borso bowed shortly to the standing maids and favoured angioletto with a keen eye before he set a hand on his daughters shoulder she looked a pleased welcome as he began to stroke her hair ah they love the man thought angioletto good why chick said duke borso you are like a cage of singingbirds scared by the cat your grace shall judge whether we are too scared to sing replied his laughing daughter come she added turning to angioletto tune your viol and pipe to it again my little poet the duke made a wry mouth hey i have no ear for music my dear said he angioletto was ready for him if your magnificence will permit he said i will take care not to offend his honourable ear i will say my piece with no more music than will serve to tie word to word may it be so magnificence have i liberty madam he bowed smiling from one to the other of the great people he was a very courtly and charming little person this tuscan youth above all he had a ready address so bright and strong and yet so deferential did he look pleading his cause among them lionella could have kissed him again for nothing more than his dexterity ah you shall do whatever you like angioletto she cried borsos eyes twinkled and he primmed his lips i do not go so far as madama master angioletto but i shall be pleased to hear what you are pleased to give me he fell into an attitude of profound attention angioletto having bowed once more began it so happened that lorenzo de medici that monster of genius had not long printed his caccia col falcone angioletto had it by heart against his need using it now he could never have made a better choiceas indeed he guessed it was as good as a play to watch borsos wary eyes at the commencement of this piece and to see them drop their fence as the declamation went on lorenzo begins with a pretty description of the dawn on tuscan hilltops era gia rosso tutto loriente e le cime de monti parien doro etc borso neither approving nor disapproving kept his head disposed for more at quando fui desto da certi rumori di buon sonagli ed allettar di cani he began to blink with the quick direction to the huntsman deh vanne innanzi presto capellaio he stifled a smile but the calling of the hounds by their names broke down his guard angioletto shrilled them out in a high boyish voice chiama tamburo pezuolo e martello la foglia la castagna e la guerrina fagiano fagianin rocca e capello e friza e biondo bamboccio e rossina ghiotto la torta viola e pestello e serchio e fuse el mio buontempo vecchio zambraco buratel scaccio e pennecchio every muscle of the keen old hunter was now quivering his eyes were bright his smile open and that of a child to the last word of the poemand it has lengthhe followed without breath the checks the false casts the bickering of the huntsmen the petty incidents of a breezy morning in the marshes nodding at every point missing nothing cracking his fingers cheering under his breath with delight undisguised and interest unalloyed the moment it was ended he seemed prime for a burst of heedless comment but he stopped shut his lips with a snap and became the inscrutable ruler of a fief of the empire once more but angioletto knew that he had pleased him for all that he walked off as he had come without word or sign he had pleased every one homing to his nest in the borgo he caught his little bellaroba in his arms with a rapture none the less because it had been earned at a stretch it was long before he could find time and breath to lead her into the garden and have the story out olimpia coming down to look for them in the dusk found that a seat for two would easily hold one more it should be added of angioletto that he suppressed the incident of the countess lionellas salute at supper there were evidences that whatever had been angiolettos fate all had not gone so well with the captain of lances not that appetite failed him indeed he ate the more for his taciturnity yet not repletion made him sigh for he sighed consumedly before he began and rather less when he had finished as though the kindlier juices of our nature had got to work to disperse the melancholic angioletto rallied him upon his gloom but to no purpose the meal was a silent one almost the only conversation was that of the minstrels foot with bellarobas under the table the truth was that of conversation the captain had had enough before suppera very short colloquy with his olimpia in it he was brought to confess that he had seen his patron that morning well had been olimpias commentarya shot which raked the captain fore and aft well he desperately admitted there was nothing actually arranged patienza his most noble master had been greatly harassed with affairsthe dukes approaching visit to rome the precise forms which must be observed the punctilios the hundred niceties of etiquette ah patienza urged the sweating mosca patience she saw was the only wear but per bacco he should learn it too she was in a high rage the captain was given to know that ferrara was a great city with more houses in it than one in fine he was shown the door supper first was an extreme and contemptuous condescension of olimpias urged by the thought that a fed mosca might be a more desperate mosca while a lean one would be desperate only for a meal a true relation of what passed in the palazzo guarini may serve to show how just she had been the count had received news of his henchmans attendance with a nod had kept him waiting two hours in the cortile then remembered him and bid him upstairs well dog said the young lord from his dressingtable and why the devil are you so late to report yourself ah excellence believe me began to stutter the captain that is exactly what i will not do my man who was that wench at your back yesterday the captain rubbed his hands excellence a wench indeed a golden venetianglorious doveeyed honeytongued and very much your lordships servant i do assure you you are so completely and at such length a fool mosca said count guarini with a yawn and strive so desperately to be rascal in spite of it that i am almost sorry for you tie me these points my good fellow get me my sword and go to the devil with your golden venetian that believe me had been all therefore captain mosca as he slunk out into the dark after supper in obedience to his inexorable olimpia felt that he must be more ingenious than he had supposed at the same time it is only fair to say that when he had spoken so hopefully of his affair to the lady on the pillion he had believed every word of his own story a man puts on spectacles to suit his complexion the captains was sanguine v fortune with the double blade similemente agli splendor mondani ordino general ministra e duca che permutasse a tempo li ben vani di gente in gente e duno in altro sangueinf vii angioletto had cause to believe in that star of his for it never wavered in the course it held borsos court found him much to its taste the men however tall of looks however terrible bent their height and unbent their scowls to him he was the pet of all the women the very fool saturnine as he was with a bite in every jest had no gibe to put him to the blush withal he made money or moneys worth as fast as friends a gold chain with a peregrine in enamel and jewels came to him by the hands of the chamberlain nothing was said but he knew it was from the duke countess lionella could not reward him enoughnow a jewel now a gold cup at one time a purse at another a crystal phial filled with jordan water and so it went the star waxing ever he could have maintained the discreet house by porta angeli out of his earnings and he did but you have to pay for your luck somehow and it very soon happened that he could not maintain himself in it he was only too popular the count guarino wanted him at the palazzo guarini the countess insisted that he should remain in bond at the schifanoia the august couple wrangled publicly over his little body what madam cried the count is it not enough that you absent yourself from my house must you keep my friends out of it also he was accredited to me my lord said the lady to me therefore he shall come good madam returned guarini i admire your taste as a man but deplore it as a husband i think the little poet will do better with me stuff cried the countess i might be his mother said the count madam i need not deny it yet it is very evident that you are not his mother he spoke with some heat lionella was mightily amused jealousy my lord she arched her fine brows i dont know the word madam he answered her touched on a raw jealousy appeared to him as the most vulgar of the vices prove that to me the countess pursued him guarini made her a bow perfectly contessa said he you shall have your poet and he shall be my friend wherein the count showed that to be a gentleman it may sometimes be necessary to appear a fool the matter was thus settled and angioletto ravished from his nest his last night at homea casa as he loved to call itneed not be dwelt upon bittersweet it was yet his courage made it more sweet than bitter bellaroba was tearful clung to him kissed and murmured incoherently because of sobbing he loved her more than ever for that but as became a prudent husband thought to say a word in season my dear he said in her ear as he held her close you are very young to be a wife and too young to be properly left alone with such companions as your olimpia whom i distrust and monna matura whom i abhor but what can i do i must make our fortunes and pray to god that your beauty do not mar them follow my advice my injunctions even and it will not keep much at home go not abroad unattended or uncovered your hooded head makes you surpassingly beautiful you need not fear to be a figure of fun at the same time it shields most of your sacred person from profane eyes the great shield of all however is to have business before you when you are from house go briskly about thiswhether it be market mass or mischiefand no one will look at you twice at home it should be the same there may be visitors if monna olimpia can contrive it there will be a good many you may judge of their quality by her anxiety to receive them be guarded then my dear and go by contraries they will not find the pattern of the carpet so interesting as you should do give them prose for their poetry vinegar for their sweet wine bitter herbs when they look to you for cane of sugar keep your honeycomb for him who is trying to earn it think where i am going my bellaroba to what temptations blessed lord to what askings to what suggestion of wanton dealing remember that in all this i shall have your honour to keep as you have mine say a great many prayers my little heart for the welfare of my soul and of yours lock your door at night let monna matura go with you to mass and confession andandoh my wife my little wife but i love not the leaving of you and so these poor children cried on each others breasts and so fell to the unspoken tongue of loves elect next morning he went early leaving her kissed in bed he saw her once again spent a most blissful two hours in her company before the countess lionella took it into her head to shelter from the summer heats in a villa she had above monselice thither angioletto was forced to go in her train he found it intolerable went with a heart of lead for so cheerful a soul he was what he looked parched and wan this lasted a week then came a paper scrawled with brown ink marks which after much study he took to imply my love angileto i love you more every day i cry a good deal for lack of you i kiss you two hundred times and will be good and happy your dutiful belaroba this revived him amazingly he went singing about the gardens which hung upon the side of the grey hill and composed a pastoral comedy to be acted by the countesss ladies in the temple grove lionella very openly and without afterthought made love to him he was a charming little lad it is true but quite apart from that he was the only male creature above servant rank in the household i describe him so because i cannot bring myself to call him a man but he was quite man enough for the ladys intent it is a surprising instance of the tact there was innate in the youth that he checked every undue liberty on the part of his mistress without endangering her selfrespect or his own high favour perhaps he allowed matters to go a little too far his were times of artless art and of franchiseimmoral yet mainly innocent children call each other pet names hold hands kiss and no one is hurt so it was in ferrara when borso ruled it praeteriere borsii tempora true enough there were those who saw that tuneful time in the shaping we alas look down on the splintered shards but we know that if assyrian balm was ever for the worlds chaffer it was in the days of borso the good duke angioletto loved his bellaroba with all his heart no debonair lionella could decoy him to be untrue but he was debonair himself of high courage and mettlesome and he may have gone a little too far he was now become her confidant secretary bosom friend whence came the shock of crisis one morning lionella called for him in a hurry he found her an amused frown on her broad brows pacing the terrace walk holding an open letter in her hand the moment he came in sight the countess ran towards him drew his arm in hers and began to speak very fast my dear boy she said i am in a fix you shall advise me how to act the more willingly i hope as you are in a sense the contriver of all the mischief you know the count my husband well enough to agree with me that he is a man of gallantry he has proved it for it is plain that he would never have left me to my great content to go my own gait unless it had been worth his while i do him perfect justice i believe he has never thwarted me nor frowned nor raised an eyebrow at an act or motion of mine never but once and that was when i proposed to take you into my service dont blush angioletto it is quite true he then raised not his eyebrowsat least i think notbut some little objections i said that i was old enough to be your motherno no that also is true my dear he answered no doubt but it is very evident that you are not his mother that again may be true i suppose however the affair ended in great goodhumour on both sides and here you are as you see but now the count sends me this letter in which he sayslet me seeah your ladyship will remember my not ungenerous conduct in the matter of the little poet angioletto on whose account you had certain benevolent dispositions to gratifyneatly turned is it not i have now to propose to you turn for turn a like favour to myself which is that you shall take into your service a young gentlewoman of venice who is but newly come to ferrarawhat is the matter angioletto you put me out where was i oh yesshe is respectably bred very modest very diligent very pious moderately handsomemy dear boy if you want to sit down by all means say so we will sit together herethe name she goes by with those who know her is bellarobabellaroba indeed welli am very sure that you will have no reason to regret my excellent choice on your behalf and it is the more timely because i learn from fazio that one of your women has fallen sick of the smallpoxand so on the count is occasionally sublime i like particularly the list of the young ladys qualifications and the reference to his own kindness to myself now what am i to say i see you are puzzled well i will give you time what angioletto himself was to say is more to the purpose i think it much to his credit that his first ascertainable emotion after the buffet of assault was one of wildest exultation at the prospect it shows that he had never for a moment distrusted the meek little partner of his fortunes whisps of such doubt did afterwards float across his pretty morning picture but he put them away at once next came worldly wisdom true tuscan that he was his instinct was to decline perilous rapture if waiting might bring it on easy terms for a long time he weighed instant joy against policy finally as he was more italian than tuscan and more boy than either he decided to jump the danger the vision of bellaroba shy in the rosegarden of himself crowning her soft hair bending over her kissing her upturned face of the countess behind one thicket looking for him and the count behind another looking for bellarobait was too much to resist madama he said it is hardly for me to advise in such delicate matters i should not by right dare say what i am about to say upon your invitation yet if i were his nobility count guarino guarini not the least of my pleasant moments would be that in which i could say i have a noble lady to wife for she honours me as i have honoured her that was a very dextrous remark vastly pleasing to the countess she kissed the speaker then and there wrote her letter hothead talked about it all that day and worked herself into such a fever of curiosity that she cut short her villeggiatura by six weeks so as the sooner to see the girl who could inspire her with such admirable ideas of her own magnanimity she even grew quite enthusiastic upon her husbands account almost sentimental about him this much the wily angioletto who did not study character for nothing had allowed for in his calculations it is by no means certain that the countess was as wise as her guide the facts which induced the letter were these guarini had chanced upon an early mass at san cristoforo and bellaroba kneeling at her prayers she all unconscious of any presence but her own and her saviours was looking up to the mother who had made him so dimeyed and smiling rather tenderly her lips framed petitions for the coming home of angioletto she had hooded her head as he commanded and it became her as he had foreseen with her added cares of wifely duty this gave a sober look to her untameable childish bloom she was almost a businesslike beauty now to guarino the pathetic appealed more nearly to him she seemed a pretty nun a woodbird caged he never took his eyes off hershe caught him in a soft mood and ravished him a little saint in bud he swore a wholesome domestic little household goddess meek and very pure who would carry home her beauties unaware and oil the tousled heads of half a dozen brothers and sisters homeliness is neither italian word nor virtue but just as it describes bellaroba so an inkling of its charm thrilled the young lord who saw her could one cage such a gossamer thing fate had done it why not he at least he could not lose sight of her he tracked her to the house under the wall saw the door scrupulously shut upon her wandered up and down the street for half an hour returned a laggard to his palaceand yet had her full in vision she possessed him until masstime following the same things happened guarino was hit hard he took certain steps and got information which tallied with his better instincts it guided also his subsequent efforts for obviously the more direct remedies would not meet his case therefore he wrote to the countess as you have seen her reply delighted him and the rest was very easy borso signed the order of appointment boggling only at her name buonaroba i know said he what am i to think of bellaroba guarino your grace shall be pleased to think that his daughter has chosen her for her own person said the count hum said borso and signed the parchment then came another scrawl for my love angilotto in which the miraculous news was told olimpia took it very ill she wrote but the signor capitano talked her happierat least he stayed a long time i hope you will think it all for the best i am very good and kiss you many times your belarobba olimpia had indeed been very cross as captain mosca would have testified she had not at any rate talked him any happier that he would have upheld with an oath the experienced man knew the whip of sleet on his bare skin but this was worse than any winter campaign it left him dumb and without the little ease which shivering gives you it had not been a question so much of talking as of keeping his feet olimpia when the news came had raged like a shrieking wind about the narrow house my dearest life soul of my soul was all the captain had to fend the blast it was no time for endearmentsolimpia raved herself still tears floods of them followed whereat the captain melted also and wept he did foolishly demoniac gusts of laughing caught and flung him to the rafters chill rages froze him where he fell he lost his little store of wit sagged like a broken sunflower and was finally pelted from the door by a storm of venetian curses in which all his ancestors himself and any descendants he might dare to have were heavily involved bellaroba trembling in her bed heard him go with a sinking heart olimpia will come and murder me now she said to herself but olimpia slept long where she fell and next morning decided to garner her rage vi ends and means amor che a null amato amar perdona bellaroba who pleased the countess for the same reasons no doubt did not please the count it is possible to be too demure and very little good to have domestic charm if you shut the door upon the amateur lionella had never had so much of her lords society as during the month that followed her return to ferrara she did not complain of this on the contrary the more the maid held off and the man pursued the more lionella was entertained angioletto invited to share her sport proved dull she confessed to more than one of her women including bellaroba that if she had not been very much in love with the poet she would have thought him a fool you see that she made no secret of her weakness the fact is she did not consider it a weakness whereby you have this remarkable position of affairs at the schifanoia that bellaroba was invited to be a student of her husbands amours and he of hers considering the state of their secret hearts this might have led to matter of tragic concern if they had loved less it would have done so as it was they were quite indifferent their hours were a series of breathless escapadesromance at fever heat stolen meetings before dawn among the dewy rosebushes chance touchings chance kisses embraces half tasted and looks often crossedof such were their days at the schifanoia meantime a coiled ladder watched out the sun from a myrtle thicket of which and its works came their happy nights then as she lay in his arms the maid of honour vanished in the child who was so lovely because she so loved she could prattle in the soft venetian brogue of boundless faith in her little lord of her simple admiration of him and all he did of her wonder and delight to be loved she could tell him of what she could do and of how much she could never do to please him and pay him honour and angioletto would nod gravely at each point that she made and kiss her now and then very softly to show her that he was perfectly satisfied so soon as the first swallow twittered in the eaves or the first pale line of light trembled at the casement he had to fly but he waited in the rosery till she came tiptoe out and then the days alarms and the days delight began eh it was a royal month a honeymoon indeed but it could not lastbarely saw its round of eight and twenty days lionella was a lady born as it were in the purple command sat lightly on her she had never been disobeyed she now grew querulous exacting suspicious moody sometimes petulant sometimes beseeching it gave angioletto the deuces own time now and then but he might yet have weathered the rocksfor his tact was only equalled by his good temperif the countess had not precipitated matters there came a day and an hour of a day when she spoke to him she had spoken before her ambitions had always been verbalbut now they were literal all the ts were crossed that was a moment for angioletto to take with quick breath he took it so instead of hinting at his duty or hers he blundered out the fact that he did not love her dog cried the countess do you dare to tell me that madama i do indeed he answered sadly for he saw his house about his ears lionella checked herself she bit her lip put her hands ostentatiously behind her back you had better leave the house master angioletto said she drily before i go further and see to it he bowed himself out then he sought his poor bellaroba found her in the garden drew her aside without trouble of a pretext and told her the whole story my lovely dear he said i am a broken man there has been a terrible scene with madama in which she got so much the worst of it that i was very triumphantly ruined you behold me decked with the ashes of my scorched prosperity what is to be done with you for i must go oh angioletto cried bellaroba trembling and catching at his breast wont youcant youruin me too then we shall be happy again he pressed her to his heart dearest dear he said half laughing half sobbing you are quite ruined enough stay as you are i will see you every night what by the mass are you not my wife of course i am angioletto but nobody thinks sonot even any priest eh he cried but that is all the better only you and i and madonna the virgin of the greeks know it she never blabs secrets and you dare not and i cant so you see it is well arranged she loved him most of all in this gay humour and provoked him to new flights but you wild boy how can you see me when you are ruined she asked all her roses in flower at the fun of the thing how can you be in the schifanoia if you are thrust out of it angioletto with a mysterious air kissed her for answer leave that to me my dear he said never have another of the maids to sleep with you and lock your chamber door now i must go because i am kicked out goodbye my bride i shall see you long before another dawn she let him go at last and turned to her duties with less sighing than you would have supposed and no tears at all her belief in the wisdom audacity and decision of her angioletto was absolute she had never known him to fail yet if she chanced to think of the towering count guarini plying her with flowers and sweatmeats she shivered to remember her citadel naked of all defences this made her feel homesick for her lovers arms like a sensible girl therefore she thought of the count as little as possible still less of another sinister apparition that of the obsequious captain mosca craning his lean neck round the corners of her vision grinning from ear to ear free of the schifanoia whose dust he was yet careful to keep upon his shoes for the sake of her it harboured angioletto walked briskly down the street shaping his course for the borgo he had been rounding a plan even while he was announcing to bellaroba that he had it cut and dried and now he was to execute it true it was a little extravagant depended too much perhaps upon other peoples estimations of him tallying with his own but you will have found out by this time that the youth was a realist ideas stood for things with him and as he said if he could not make them stand so to his auditory he was no poet this was a heresy he could not allow even supposititiously the idea was excellent the thing therefore no less therefore he concluded that he should not fail of his plan beyond the porta angeli in borsos day was to be found a huddle of tenementsfungusgrowth upon the city wallsinglestoried singleroomed affairs mostly the lodging of artificers in the lesser crafts among them all there was but one of two floors a substantial redbrick little house with a most grandiloquent chimneystack and very rightly it was so for it belonged to the court chimneysweep on this eventful noon sor beppo the sweep was sitting on his doorstep in the sun eating an onion one of many which reposed in a vinegar bath on his knees he was quite black save where a threedays beard lent a gleam of snow to chaps and chin being toothless he was an indifferent performer upon the onion but his hearing was as keen as his eyesight he caught angiolettos vivacious heeltaps upon the flags and peered from burly brows at the smart little gentleman cloaked feathered and gaudy who looked as suitable to his dusty surroundings as a red poppy to a rubbish heap angioletto stopping before him took off his scarlet cap with a flourish well young stabbing blade said beppo and who may you be sir replied the youth i am a poet beppo rubbed his shooting chin with a noise like the scraping of nutmegs well said he ill not deny that its a trade and a lawful trade but for my part i sweep noblemens chimneys and am proud of it shake hands poet they shook hands with great cordiality on the poets part sit down poet said beppo angioletto sat on the doorstep beside him without a word will you have an onion my friend the old fellow went on to ask thank you sor beppo but i have already dined let me rather talk to you while you finish your meal it is not so much a meal as a relish said the sweep but talk awaywell never quarrel over terms i hope not angioletto took him up because i have done with poetising and have a mind to try your trade beppo his mouth full of onion paused in his bite to gape at this dapper page who all scarlet and white as he was talked after such a fashion howll that be now he said youve never come all this way to crack a joke ah never in the world my friend cried angioletto i am in earnest you may be as earnest as a friar in the pulpit and yet pretty bad at chimneywork young master what do you know of it pray nothing at all replied angioletto as if that helped him look at that now cried the triumphant sor beppo pardon me master beppo said the youth you cannot look at it yet but you very soon shall have you a chimney to hand ah i might have that the old man agreed with a chuckle which ended as a snort there might be a chimney in my house thats not been swept for thirty year having little time and less inclination to sweep em for nothing but glory but happen there were such a piece of work what then angioletto pointed into the house is that the chimney beppo beppo nodded that might be the chimney in question my gentleman with a by your leave sor beppo angioletto stepped delicately into the room he threw down cloak and cap unstrapped girdle and hanger stripped off his doublet and stood up in shirt and breeches beppo watched him all agape too breathless to chew before he could interfere by the saints but hes in he cried with arms thrown up eh master come you back come you back what do you want a muffled voice came from the chimney beppo sawed the air dont you play the fool up there my boy dont you do it thats as foul as the grave that chimney is ill have ye on my soul as long as i live and i can ill afford it for ive a queasy conscience in my black shell he seemed to be treading on pins he was answered we will talk of your conscience and its shell when i come back take off my shoes will you a neat leg was pushed into the fireplace then another beppo did the office meek as an acolyte then he sighed for the legs drew up the chimney and vanished in dust there goes a lad of spirit to his gloomy end murmured brokenly the sweep as he looked at the little red shoes in his hand i would not have had that come to pass for twenty gold ducats but lord whod a thought it of a court spark that he should be as good as his word not i used to courts as a man may be he fell to scratching his head hey hey he cried as there was a prodigious scuffling up the chimney now he strangles now he strangles a shower of soot came down beppo flacked about the room then two heavy objects fell beppo crept up mary virgin hes killing birds he said in an awed whisper and picked up two owls with wagging heads the recesses of the chimney were still very lively eh there he is again said the old sweep what now down came a rat squeaking for its life then three in succession very silent because their necks were wrung this is better than a cat any day of the seven said sor beppo what a diamond of a poet he should be crowned with laureltwigs if i were duke borso in all his glory being but beppo the sweep he shall be free of my mystery the moment hes free of my chimneystack he could await angiolettos coming now with equal mind the lad had approved himself i leave you to judge of the welcome he got when breathless scratched and sable as the night he showed his white teeth at the door beppo in fact fell weeping on his neck by this simple device angioletto was enabled to keep his word and bellaroba to find him black but comely vii the captains treadings while angioletto and his bellaroba dwelt in a paradise none the less glorious for being as sooty as the darkness which veiled it the estate of captain mosca that hungry swordsman was most unhappy divorced from bed and board cast off by his mistress and not yet adopted by his master the poor man felt dimly about for supports conscious that his treadings had wellnigh slipped at such a time the gentle eyes of bellarobanobodys enemycourted him like a beam of firelight on a rainscoured street with a smiling invitation to share the peace within doors he hung uneasily about the gateways in these days coldelbowed by the lackeys ignored by the higher sort unseen by the quality he burnished the lintels with his shoulderblades chewed many straws counted the flagstones knew the hours by the signals of his stomach then if by hazard bellaroba should come dancing by with a good morning signor capitano a come sta or prettier still a bright sta bene what wonder if the man of rage humbled himself before the little maid of honour what wonder again if she out of the overflowings of her happiness should give him an alms no wonder at all but pity there should be for the captain played an unworthy part i suppose his standard was not very high i know he was hungry i know that nothing degrades a man so low as degradationsince what he believes himself that he is but i find it hard to excuse him for draining bellaroba of her little secrets judas that he was he took her sop and then sold her for thirty pieces of silver the draining of a well so limpid was the easiest thing in the world she was too absurdly happy too triumphant altogether in the successful craft of her brilliant little lord to be continent she dealt in semitransparent mystery with her manipulator from the moment he had won her compassion her secret was none from the first or it was like the secret which a child will tell you all the louder for being said in your ear my dear little friend said the smirking captain when he had it what you tell me there is as wine in my blood i declare it sets me singing tunes ah but he is wonderful my angioletto said she and her eyes grew larger for the thought of him for a stripling of his inches he beats any cock that ever fought a main mosca declared blood of blood but he does what and if he did square up to medo i bear a grudge never upon my body you will notyou would notah tell olimpia of this signor capitano she hazarded the captain stroked one eye with the back of his finger he looked pityingly upon her with the other ah my dear soul he said sighing could you think it of old mosca bellaroba hastened to disclaim no no no i did not think it signor capitano but for a minute i had a little fear olimpia never loved angioletto at all and i dont think she loves me very muchnow to be plain with you my lamb said the mosca she has no such vasty love for me i have not set foot within her door since a certain day you may remember the girl shivered if i remember it ah madonna delle grazie she had a devil that day she had seven im sure of it cried the captain so i leave you to judge how much of your story she may worm out of me he so beamed upon her kissed her hands with such a lofty stoop that she felt ashamed of herself and begged his pardon this brought the captain to his knees by the god who made the jews he swore i leave not this raw flagstone till you have unsaid those words in the end after a prodigious fuss he drifted away down the corridor and left her to go about her business but he drifted not very far he felt himself full of affairs which were as meat and drink to his spirit starved by neglect it was so great a thing to have a pretext for approaching count guarini that young lord had a way like a keenedged knife you might weave a whole vestment about your errand fold upon fold of ingenious surmise argument pro argument con guarino guarini would dart eyes upon youslash he had rent your fabric and discovered you naked underneath a liar ready for the whip nor to do him justice did he ever fail to apply it truth was indeed the only key to guarinos chamber truth and timely truth was what the captain felt he had at last with it he braved the supercilious doorkeeper with it he forced the fellow to lift his intolerable eyelids by the powers of darkness my friend he said it will be a bad days work for you if you deny me this time so he won his admission and faced his master now mosca your lie said the count with his coldsteel delivery mosca did not stumble master he said i can do you service do it then whipped in the count i can tell your excellence why he succeeds no better with la bellaroba ah the count was suspicious but interested the little lady has a lover body of a dog body of angioletto excellence angioletto that spaniel how many more laps will he cradle in cut his tongue out my good fellow and then come to me again excellence may i speak i suppose so speak the captain waited no further invitation but told the whole story from the beginning guarino thought upon it for a moment he will come tonight he asked certain excellence then we have him you have done well moscait was time my friend for you are an expensive hack to keep at grass now listen take bellaroba awaycommand of the contessa of course take her to the little house in the borgo make all fast and return here in time for the steeplejack when you have him in the trap run him through the body raise the devils uproar and denounce him to the patrol do you understand me perfectly excellence take my purse from the table and off with you then captain mosca bowed to the ground and backed out viii first midnight conversation the borgo of borsos day was as you might say a sucker of the city of the po a flowery crop of villas and gardens about the citys root there was the discreet house which captain mosca had once chosen for his olimpia there also was that which guarino guarini maintained for his or any bellaroba it is probable that there were many such houses in the borgo it was a very pleasant place heavy scented with lilac and hawthorn in the spring drowsy all the summer through with rustling leaves and the murmur of innumerable bees the place was quiet there was no traffic no hint of the city bustle on the other hand there was the notoriety which must always attach to any act done where no others are doing time daytime especially hangs heavy in the borgo one machinates in the face of many green shutters which are not necessarily dead because they are shut this reasoning does not attack the sagacity of count guarini for the only circumstance which could give it force was entirely unknown to him he did not know that the borgo held bellarobas friend olimpia or that it sheltered under the same roof olimpia the captains enemy he knew nothing of bellarobas friends and cared nothing for the captains enemies but as a matter of history the proceedings of mosca upon that eventful day were of the greatest possible interest to signorina castaneve donna matura trust her had not failed to report his first appearance storklike in the borgo no subsequent voyage of his into those parts and he made many was lost upon olimpia captain mosca honest man made a preposterous accomplice his rusty cloak the white of his observant eye the craning of his neck the very angle of his swordcocked up for frolic like a wrens tailspoke the profuse conspirator he spent money liberally seemed to have plenty more had his finger to his nose with every other word he brought a troop of underlings a bevy of young women under his orders turned the little shuttered house out of doorsat every window carpets curtains hangings of all sorts fluttered as if for a triumphal procession flowers came in stacks hm said olimpia theres a woman in this a couple of asses brought skins of wine that will be wash for the lean hog himself she added from that time forth she never left her shutter to make herself the more sure she gave orders to donna matura to close all the shutters alike captain mosca on one of his returns to the borgo looked up at the blind green eyes of his former haven and chuckling rubbed his hands this artless outlet to his feelings was interpreted for what it was worth behind the shutter by six of the evening mosca seeing olimpias house still keep a dead face threw off the last remnant of his cares and bade himself be merry my handsome friend is either asleep or on a journey it appears said he to himself that on the whole is well i cannot think she would be pleased at the advent of little bellaroba riding pillion to me still less would the honour about to be paid the young lady afford her any gratification least of all would her observations on the subject tend to clear the air no no everything is for the best it seems and the world still a tolerable place now for my little woodbird he paid and dismissed his workpeople then rode off himself to fetch bellaroba and olimpia from her shutter watched him go there was no trouble on the childs score the countess was away a feigned message from her was enough had she been at home and in a good humour she would have accorded a real one no doubt so the deceit was quite harmless bellaroba demurred a little that she could not in person warn angioletto but the captain begged her to have no fears time pressed it was evident the countesss service was urgent yet the captain swore by all that he held sacredto be sure no great things but bellaroba could not know thatto deliver her message to the lad with his own hand for said he and confirmed it with an oath if i dont see him this very night it will be a pity words which were afterwards thought to have been prophetic by the curious in such matters so bellaroba entrusted him with her scrawl to my love angilotto and the captain chewed and swallowed it when she was not looking then he lifted her to his horse and rode with her into the greensheltered borgo just as it was settling into twilight and olimpia from her shutter saw them come i spare you the picture of her fury it was not seemly for all it was very white and still the sight of a handsome girl shuddering in a cold stare under the grip of an evil spirit can never be pleasant and where the experienced donna matura shrank from what she saw and heard it becomes not me to tread donna matura was of her country that cheerful laughing midland of the po and neither felt the venetian throb of pleasure nor conceived the excesses of venetian pain extremes touch on the lagoon donna matura saw her goldhaired mistress white and drawn saw her witless shaking saw her tear and rend herself heard her jerked words of loathing blasphemy and obscene defianceand fairly fled the house for as she said if words of man or woman could bring the rafters about our ears or open a pit to send us lightly whither we all must go who have heard them those words which madam olimpia spat about her must surely do it so much she confessed to afterwards but no more for she stayed nothing more olimpia may have leaned twisting against her wall for about an hour mouthing insane babble from her blued lips it was at least quite dark when she came to herself lit the lamp wiped the cold beads from her forehead smoothed and bound her hair she was not herself nor looked to be so she had a face completely colourless lips like grey mould and burning black eyes but her hand was steady she hardly winked her breath which came through her nose was even though it whistled rather sharply whatever she was aboutand she seemed to be acting a partshe did with extraordinary care down to the changing of her crimson dress for a dark green one the former had been loose and clinging made of velvet the dark green was of cloth fitted her close and as she ascertained by a few gestures gave free play to her arms she knocked off her heeled venetian shoes whose clatter was familiar to the house and bound on flatsoled sandals instead over her head she had a black lace scarf on her hands leather gauntlets lastly she took from a press a long doubleedged knife felt its temper and stuck it inside her stocking under the garter she made a final hasty sweep of the room with her unquiet eyes as she went out of it the door of the house she knocked upon was opened by a page who asked her business mosca captain mosca is my business said she in a whisper the signor capitano is occupied madonna replied the boy i know it i know it she answered but my business is the ladys business also i must see them bothand at once let me pass the page vowed and swore by all the company of heaven that those were her actual words he was put to the torture and cried in the most heartrending manner but he held to it so long as he could hold to anything that the visitor had said her business was the other ladys business what a further application of the question might have brought we cannot tell since he fainted before it could be tried the boy gasparo appeared to take no further interest in the elucidation of the truth reported the judges and we recommend that he be chastised for contumacy he was at any rate no witness of the scene which followed olimpias entry there was that about her a subdued haste a deliberation a kind of intensity got by rote which fascinated the youngster and left him staring in the hall olimpia walked across it alone went straight to a door at the bottom on the righthand side turned the handle and entered there was a table spread with supper there was captain mosca seated at it eating a peach from his wineglass there was bellaroba flushed and marred with tears leaning against the further wall she gave a little gasp of fear when she saw what the doorway framed after that she followed olimpia about the room with the same incurable fascination which the pageboy had felt olimpia shut the door as softly as she had opened it and as softly shot the bolt then it seemed that mosca felt her presence for he turned saw and jumped up with a cry mingled of fear and rage it was found out afterwards that he was unarmed this will explain his alarm disastrous honesty his sword was upstairs in the bed there followed a most curious scene the captain stood up by the table and dogged olimpia with his narrow eyes when she advanced he backed when she stopped he stopped in this manner eyeing each other without a blink they made the round of the table bellaroba cowered by the wall pursued and pursuer brushed against her in turn she shivered and moaned a little at every touch but they were too intent upon their game to know that she was there in the second round mosca who was again close to her reached out his hand for a knife from the table quick as thought olimpia was at him reached across and drove her knife through his hand into the wood mosca howled but his fear by now was such that he must be free to run as before though he maimed himself he tore his hand away and left olimpia holding a fixed blade she wrenched it out and made a pounce the miserable mosca turned to bellaroba he laid what he had left of hands upon her shoulders he pulled her from the wall he set her before him and hugged her close to his breast thus he made her back a shield against the long knife and with her he fenced and held off his enemy for minutes more olimpia horribly busy scorched the girls neck with her breathbut she never made to hurt her then came the end olimpia made a lunge at his right side the captain hugged bellaroba there at the next moment the long knife was below his left arm buried to the hilt and defender and defence rolled heavily to the floor olimpia walked to the table and helped herself to the captains val pulicella the watch whom the page had roused after moscas first cry broke in by the window disentangled bellaroba bound the hands of both prisoners behind their backs and marched them and the boy off to the castle count guarini coming in an hour later found his murdered lieutenant for his only guest ix second midnight conversation in that same night of mine and countermine duke borso who had broken up the circle early by reason of his toothache went wandering the long corridors of the schifanoia under the sting of his scourge he found his spacious pleasurehouse valueless against that particular annoy but as always he was the more whimsical for his affliction nothing works your genuine man of humour so nearly as himself the sight of his own image puffed and blinking in nightcap bedgown and slippers when he came upon it in a long mirror set him chuckling he paused before the absurd epitome to apostrophise wagged a finger at it and got wag for wag we might be two drolls in a pantomime said he to his double your arm gossip he crooked an elbow it seems he continued that we are both sufferers my poor fellow magnificence goes drooping a swollen estate does not forbid a jowl of the same proportions and give me leave to tell you brother that we have each of us been better dressed in our day fie what a pair of quills below your gown and what a sorry diadem to stand for two duchies and a marquisate of uncertain age duke and my brother if we were to be spied upon by any of our court just now what sort of a reverence should we get think you eh you rogue as much as we deserve i will tell you good borso my own poor opinion of these things a duke who cannot be dukely in his shirt a pope who is but an afflicted biped between the blankets is no duke at all is a pope by toleration there should be some such test at every crowning of our sort souse a bishop in his bath before you let him warm his chair cry fire on the stairs of the vatican and watch your pontiffelect scudding over the piazza in his sark before the conclave sing veni creator judge of your emperor with a swollen nose blacken your dukes in the eye if they remain dukes and emperors you may safely obey them they are men borso they are men yes you spindleshanked rascal you may well wince do you ponder how you would stand assay so do i ponder it brother and doubt horribly he clapped his hand to his face steady now steady here comes another bout ah madonna of the estebut this is a shrewd twinge fare you well brother fatchops i must walk this devil out of me he waved a hand to his brother of the lookingglass and slippered away groaning and sniggering to himself so he walked and was philosophical till two of the morning at that hour he was ready to drop with fatigue but his pains had left him i will sleep by the grace of heaven he said he plumped down in the embrasure of a door prepared to follow his humour the door yielded and he with it who am i to outrage a ladys chamber he muttered half asleep to be sure she seems to invite me let us look at this complaisant sleeper he went into the room a glimmering lamp burned before a shrine enough to show him to a decent fourpost bed empty by the great god pan cried borso my luck holds courage i am not a duke for nothing then he shut and bolted the door slipped into the bed and was asleep in three minutes it was twenty minutes after two at the stroke of three with a scarcely perceptible rustling angioletto slid down the chimney and stepped into the room he carefully brushed himself with a brush which hung by the hearth the chimney was by now thoroughly clean however he next washed his face and hands undressed and crept softly to the bed very quietly he inserted himself between the sheets very softly kissed the shoulder of the sleeper very soon he was as sound as his bedfellow the duke awoke as his habit was with the first light and saw the curly head on the pillow beside him he whistled softly to himself now by the tears of the virgin said he how did this lady come in it would be as well to know it since plainly i must go out he sat up in bed clasped his knees and frowned a little it is clean against the traditions of my house he ruminated but i think i will go and the sooner the better suiting action to word he had one foot on the floor when angioletto with a long sigh opened his eyes turned over and saw him the devil said duke borso madonna was his second venture when he had recognised the impropriety of his first madonna i am this moment about to retire angioletto whose eyes had attained their fullest stretch of wonder opened his mouthbut not to speak he gaped at the lord of the land madonna borso began once more then the other found his voice alas my lord duke it is madonna i thought to find where is my wife that was borsos cue to stare your wife he cried your wife heaven above us man why the devil should your wife be in my bed angioletto with the deepest respect always suffered a smile to play askew about his lips alas magnificence he said if i dared i would ask him why the devil he should be in my wifes bed it was the youths way to preface his audacities by the assurance that he dared not utter them but the retort pleased borso his eyes began to twinkle look ye young gentleman said he suppressing his wish to chuckle if this is your wifes bed i am sorry for you for i give you my word she has not been in it tonight but i confess i should like to know why your wife has a bed in my house angioletto nodded gravely i should be the last person to deny your graces right to all information bellaroba is my dear wifes name her country is venice her duties are to be about madama lionellas person my own duties are to be about hers so far as i may fair and softly my friend said the duke not so fast if you please do you know that maids of honour may not marry without permission and in any case may not be visited by their husbands during their service magnificence she was not married without permission or rather she was married before permission was needed eh how may that be now said borso tucking in his chin did she come here as signora qualcosa she came here as bellaroba magnificence no one knows of our marriage but your grace and the holy virgin then you are not married but should be that is your meaningeh ah by heaven magnificence cried angioletto we are the most married couple in the world hm was all borso had to say to that and who made her of madamas court it was your grace oh of course of course man but why the deuce did i do it it was at the request of count guarino guarini magnificence eh eh now i recollect ah to be sure that must be a very agreeable reflection for you at this moment my friend he said with a sly look angioletto took the equivoque with dignity i have perfect confidence in my wife my lord duke borso shrugged well it is your affairnot mine he said then he changed his tone i think however we will come back to what is my affair as well as yours be so good as to tell me how you came here i came down the chimney said angioletto calmly i am by calling a chimneysweep upon my word borso said this is a fine story i am piecing together how long have you been of that trade pray angioletto received this shot with firmness even dignity i was formerly a poet attached to the court magnificence but when madama turned me away it became necessary that i should see my young wife so i became a chimneysweep for the purpose the dukes mouth twitched too much for his own dignity he pulled the bedclothes up to his nose therefore before he asked why did madama turn you away sir angioletto for the first time was confused he hung his head i hope your grace will not insist upon an answer he replied in a troubled voice borso looked keenly at him for a time no i think i will not said he are you the lad who sang me the caccia col falcone the same my lord duke i thought so now sir to come back to this performance of yours which i suppose is not the first by any meanseh it appears to be the last my lord said angioletto ruefully i think it is the last replied the duke for i hope you understand that i can have you clapped into gaol for it pardon magnificencehe can do more he can have me hanged for it i dont agree with you said borso if my name were ferdinand of arragon or sforza or della rovere yes but being borso deste no your grace puts me to shame said angioletto with feeling i am to take it then you shall take it as you please my friend borso rejoined with his chin once more upon his clasped knees for my part i propose to take you and keep you under lock and key for a seasonas at present advised angioletto bowed as well as one may who is sitting up in a very soft bed his voice was quite meek i shall in all duty obey your graces directions and will leave behind me but one small request which i am persuaded borso deste will not refuse his prisoner and what is that my good friend it is the care for the person and honour of my wife my lord duke answered angioletto this set borso rubbing his nose he thought before he spoke again as for your wifes person my man said he it will be as safe in my dominions as all persons whatever their ages or conditions her honour is another affair that is neither for me nor my laws but for herself and perhaps you will let me add that if tonight is a sample of her course of living you are putting upon me a rather onerous charge my lord my lord cried angioletto here i will answer for my wifes honour with my last drop of blood it is her person i cannot answer for if i am in prison i have told you that i will answer for her person master poet i would much rather leave her honour to you and your drops of blood so you may go to the castle with a clear mind to the castle moreover you shall undoubtedly go if it is only to teach you that the possession of a wife is no passport to other mens chimneys first however i will ask you to do me a small service which is to go to my bedchamber and send me my gentlemen my dresser and my clothes i am you perceive entirely at your mercy you will follow these persons back to me here and will then give yourself up as i shall direct angioletto out of bed by this time knelt to the dukes hand i am your graces servant said he he hastily dressed himself and went about the business he was bidden on madam the virgin said borso with a halflaugh that is a fine young man if he had not made so free with my chimneys i would advance him advanced he shall be he cried out after a while zounds has not guarino made free with his wife eh but i fear it he shook his nightcap at the thought a couple of days reflection in a half light will do the lad no harm hell dream of his wife or compose me some songs bellaroba he called her i remember the jadea demure rosycheeked little cat for ever twiddling her fingers or her apronends those sleek ones are the worst poor boy ill advance him he shall be librarian go secretary to rome or florence ill have him about my own person by the sons of heaven but hes as good as gold ah i hear him the dukes gentlemen bowed themselves into the room followed by the dresser good morning my friends said borso but where is my messenger magnificence he is at the door said the usher bring him in foppa bring him in cried the duke we know each other by now angioletto was introduced master angioletto the twinkling old tyrant said get you downstairs to the captain of the archers say to him as follows captain my lord the duke begs you to conduct me surely to the castle and keep me prisoner there during his graces pleasure will you oblige me so far i shall obey you exactly my lord duke said angioletto making a reverence he went at once and gave himself up in some quarter of an hours time he was lodged in the castle in a cell upon the level of the moat next door to him on either side though he knew nothing of it were two women who had been brought in with a pageboy over night upon a charge of murder their case indeed was one of the first matters which engaged the attention of duke borso after mass x ordeal by rope the prison chills made olimpia shiver the prison silences made her afraid the wavering moan of the pageboy who had been tumbled on to a straw bed after his first bout of the question drove home the reality of her situation and made her sick olimpia was one of your snug pretty women she loved to be warmed coaxed petted liked her bed her fire liked sweetmeats and to see people about her go smiling mostly too she had had her way in these matters for she was a beautiful creature smooth and handsome as a persian cat jealousy on this account was a new experience she had never suffered it before did not realise it now besides it was over she had killed her faithless lover but the dark the cold the silence the calm enmity of the dim wallsthese were but an intensification of familiar discomforts she had always been afraid of the dark often cold often quelled by quiet made sullen by indifference she hated all this and felt it all in spite of the glory of the captains killing it seemed more awful now more unendurable than ever becauseshe knew there was no good disguising itbecause it stood for something else ah ah she was in danger so sure as she thought of this olimpias heart stood still and then suddenly throbbed as if it must break it surged up into her throat her tongue clove to her palate she felt the bristling of her flesh could hear her heart quite loud making double knocks at her side the pageboy moaned to himself through it all a rat hidden somewhere bore him company by scratching most diligently at the brickwork she could not hear anything of bellarobathe only familiar thing in this vast black horror the panic gained upon her till her head swam in it she could not die ah never never never by christ on his throne the sickening futility of that final word never in the face of the dead certainty announced by the inexorable walls served to make the wretchs case the more desperate panic chalkwhite staring panicfear swallowed her up the next few hours flew by as minutes while she was cowering and gibbering in a corner before the inevitable you either resign or rave yourself madthere is no middle course bellaroba took the first sitting in her cell with her cheek pressed against the wall which though she knew it not penned also her angioletto she never opened her eyes nor cried nor moaned but where she settled herself at her entry there she was found when they came to hale her to the judgment she gave no trouble made no sign but she let down her hair to cover her bare neck and if she blushed it was that folks should see her bloodsmirched evening finery by the light of day she was a very decent girl always and this seemed to her horrible even in a pit of horrors olimpia clinging to life was driven upon the second course it took two halberdiers to hold her up borso had before him the deposition of the pageboy and the report of the watch from the words of the first he suspected that both women were concerneduntil he had heard the second this was to the effect that the captains head had been cut off no no said borso to himself i am heartily sorry for my young friend the chimneysweeping poet but i cant think him a fool he would never have married a woman who could cut off a mans head yet stay it may be that she floored the captain and that the other rounded off the job with that gratuitous touch shethat otherwas eating walnuts when the watch came i gather she could have cut a dead mans head off never doubt it well let us see let us see then it was that he gave the order bring the two women before me he did justice ever in the open a broad green field outside one of the gates served him for court two gibbets and an open pit stood for the terror of the law he himself on a gilt chair under a canopy for the majesty of it the day was bright breezy and whiteclouded the poplars twinkled innumerably the long este gonfalon flacked and strained in the wind spectators with soldiery to hedge them kept a wide square about the plain from their side the figures in the midstthe red gold and white about the pavilion the steel of the soldiers the drooping women between themwere about as real as a handful of marionettes it seemed impossible such puppets could decide issues of life and death but the red hangman and his machines were grim touches for a puppetshow olimpia castaneve was brought forward first she was more composed by nowthe air the sun the cheerful colours of the court had warmed her she stood alone facing borso he at first glance remembered every shred of her but he betrayed nothing there was no one more blankly cool in this world than borso on the judgmentseat what is your name mistress magnificence i am well known in ferrara your name thundered the duke by the face of the sky olimpia castaneve did you cut off the head of the captain of lances who was called il mosca olimpia was looking very handsome and knew it magnificence she said my hand is on my heart it was what the devil has that got to do with it asked borso looking about him for a reason serenity if my heart were guilty it would burn my hand if my hand were red it would soil my heart pouf said borso and puckered his face stand back castaneve now for the little one how are you called baggage bellaroba shivered a very little and looked solemn bellaroba my lord very pretty but i must have more there is no more my lord i am wife of angioletto well well i know master angioletto and he me well have him here i think hi you said he turning to an officer of his guards go and fetch the chimneysweep ten minutes passed then angioletto came up between a detachment of men unbound he was not observed to falter throughout his course over the broad field but his eyes were fever bright and colour noticeably high bellaroba did not look up at him her eyelids fluttered but she kept her head hung and as for her blushes they were curtained by her long hair he on the contrary directly he had bent his knee to the duke turned to where she stood and in face of the whole city put his arms about her and found a way to kiss her cheek the broad ring of onlookers wavered the twitches played like summer lightning over borsos face come here angioletto he said angioletto drew near the throne you see now my friend the duke continued in a low voice what may happen to ones wife if she keeps not her bed o nights a certain captain mosca has been stabbed more than that his head was attacked when he had ceased to take any interest in it and cut off i ask no words from you no comments no adjurations for you are a prejudiced party your wife and this other woman between them have done the captains business mine is to find out how stand aside now and listen angioletto started opened his mouth to speakbut the duke put up his hand young man said he sternly i am duke of ferrara and you are my prisoner be good enough to remember that angioletto hung his head borso turned again to bellaroba but kept the other in his eye now missy what had you to do with captain moscas headpiece nothing my lord what he roared did you not cut it off no my lord why not girl he was your enemy i suppose i think he was my lord think do you not know it what did he want of you he wanted to make me bad my lord ah so you stabbed him eh no my lord come now come now girl look at your frock she did look and was silent well borso continued after a sharp glance at angioletto did your husband cut it off no my lord he wasnt therebut wellbut what he would have killed him my lord oh the devil he would why because he loves me my lord hm well miss bellaroba wheres your hand she held it out here sir what a little one well put it on your heart now how does it feel it jumps my lord does it burn you child no my lord its quite cold stand down bellaroba castaneve come forward his face just now was a sight to be seencrumpled infinitely prim crowfooted like an ivied wall but extraordinarily wise with that tempered resolve which says i know evil and i know good and dare be just to either he was thinking profoundly every one could see it best of the company before him angioletto the little tuscan read his thought his own was unless i fear justice i need not fear borso dante saw the death of his lady to be just courage then mistress castaneve said duke borso you declare yourself innocent excellency i do i do ah mother of god the panic was creeping up olimpias legs to loosen the joints of her knees the judge turned half mistress bellaroba you also declare yourself innocent yes my lord she said diavolo muttered angioletto he is not my lord he is magnificence i must scold her for this afterwards the position of affairs is this said the duke aloud one of these prisoners is guilty of the deed and the guilty one is the liar now i will not put an innocent person to death if i can avoid it and i will not put these women to the question because i should wring a confession of guilt from each and be no more certain than i was before i may have my own opinion and may have proved it on various grounds that again i do not care to obtrude i do not see that i can better the precedent set me by a very wise man and patriarch king solomon of zion let the women judge each other my judgment is that the innocent of these two shall hang the guilty the bystanders were silent till one man shivered the shiver swept lightly through the company like a wind in the reeds and ran wider and wider till it stirred the farthest edge of the field all eyes were upon the prisoners borsos blinked from below his shaggy brows young teofilo calcagninis were misty angiolettos hard and bright bellaroba had been motionless throughout except when her lips moved to speak she was motionless now but olimpia was panting the unearthly quiet was only broken by that short sound for ten minutes bellaroba then said the duke what say you you declare that you are innocent will you hang the guilty and go free for the first time she looked up but not at her judge it was at angioletto she looked angioletto at her no my lord i cannot said bellaroba in the hush the wind shivered the reeds again then fainted down castaneve said the dry voice what say you you declare that you are innocent will you hang the guilty and go free the drowning olimpia threw up her hands to clutch at this plank in the seaswirl free o god the word turned her magnificence i must i must i must she wailed and fell a heap to the ground bellaroba covered her eyes teofilo calcagnini shook the tears from his borso sat on immovably working his jaws it is at this point that the conduct of angioletto touches the sublimea position never accorded by posterity to his verse it proves him nevertheless the greater artist to this extent that he was equally the slave of the idea though working in more intractable stuff himself namely his own little heart throbbing in his own young body therefore he deserves well of posterity which finds his verses thin said angioletto yes bellaroba is my adorable wife loved beyond all women deserving beyond all price yet if she killed the captain she is guilty of death and the sentence is just whoever perform it and if being guiltless she is hanged by the guilty the action will glorify her for it is the price she pays for clean hands then in the midst of that waiting assembly he called the girl to him by her name took her face in both his hands and kissed it very tenderly smiling all the time through his quick tears my dear little heart said he your husband is proud of you all that you have done is admirable in this black business in a very short time i shall see you again though it is a higher flight than the schifanoia chimney it is quicker done trust me bellaroba you know i have never failed you yet he could say no more but took her in his arms and held her there speechless as he was with inspiration she seeming to burn in the fire that consumed him lay quite still neither sobbing any more nor shivering so they clung together for a little then angioletto lifted up his face from her cheek and put her gently away from him let justice be done excellency he called out in his shrill boys voice we have said our say to each other borso spoke justice shall be done the innocent has condemned the guilty let that woman be hanged we have learned the value of clean hands this day mistress bellaroba you have a man in ten thousand angioletto my friend you have what you deserve a woman in ten million it is not fair that the worth of you two should be known only to me and the blessed virgin you shall tell it now to a priest come along and let me have the whole story with my breakfast thus duke borso did judgment for his good town of ferrara in times very remote from our own the ferrarese used to say that it needs a sound lawyer to know how to break the laws the end

romance it will be completed in a second volume which will tell of the final fading of the legend with which the story opens e f b colin book one chapter i neither superstition nor spiritual aspiration signified anything particular to the staniers and for many generations now they had been accustomed to regard their rather sinister family legend with cynical complacency age had stolen the strength from it as from some longcellared wine and in the victorian era they would to take their collective voice have denied that either drunk or sober they believed it but it was vaguely pleasant to have so antique a guarantee that they would be so sumptuously looked after in this world while as for the next the legend dated from the time of elizabeth and was closely connected with the rise of the family into the preeminent splendour which it had enjoyed ever since the queen in one of her regal journeys through her realm during which she slept in so incredible a number of beds visited the affiliated cinque port of rye and after taking dinner with the mayor was riding down one of the steep cobbled ways when her horse stumbled and came down on its knees she would certainly have had a cruel fall if a young man had not sprung forward from the crowd and caught her before her graces head was dashed against the stones he set her on her feet swiftly releasing the virgins bosom from his rough embrace and kneeling kissed the hem of her skirt the queen bade him rise and as she looked at him made some elizabethan ejaculation of appreciative amazementa zounds or a gadzooks or something there stood colin stanier in the full blossom of his twenty summers ruddy as david and blueeyed as the sea his cap had fallen off and he must needs toss back his head to free his face from the tumble of his yellow hair his athletic effort to save her grace had given him a moments quickened breath and his parted lips showed the double circle of his white teeth but most of all did his eyes capture the fancy of his sovereign they looked at her so she thought with the due appreciation of her majesty but in their humility there was mingled something both gay and bold and she loved that any man young or old high or humble should look at her thus she spoke a word of thanks and bade him wait on her next day at the manor of brede where she was to lie that night then motioning her courtiers aside with a testy gesture she asked him a question or two while a fresh horse was being caparisoned and brought for her and allowed none other but colin to help her to mount it was thought to be significant that at supper that night the virgin sighed and made her famous remark to my lord of essex that she wished sometimes that she was a milkmaid colin staniers father was a man of some small substance owning a little juicy land that was fine grazing for cattle and the boy worked on the farm he had some strange magical power over the beasts a savage dog would slaver and fawn on him a vicious horse sheathed its violence at his touch and in especial at this season of lambingtime he wrought wonders of midwifery on the ewes and of nursing on the lambs this authoritative deftness sprang from no kindly love of animals cleverness and contempt with a dash of pity was all he worked with and this evening after the queen had passed on it was reluctantly enough that he went down to the lowlying fields where his fathers sheep were in pregnancy the old man himself as colin ascertained had taken the excuse of her graces visit to get more than usually intoxicated and the boy guessed that he himself would be alone half the night with his lantern and his ministries among the ewes so indeed it proved and the moon had sunk an hour after midnight when he entered the shed in the lambingfield to take his bite of supper and get a few hours sleep he crunched his crusty bread and bacon in his strong teeth he had a draught of beer and wrapping himself in his cloak lay down he believed on the evidence of his memoirs that he then went to sleep up to this point the story is likely enough a pedant might unsniffingly accept it but then there occurred or is said to have occurred the event which forms the basis of the stanier legend and it will certainly be rejected in spite of a certain scrap of parchment still extant and of the three centuries of sequel by all sensible and twentiethcentury minds for according to the legend colin woke and found himself no longer alone in the shed there was standing by him a finelydressed fellow who smiled on him it was still as dark as the pit outsideno faintest ray of approaching dawn yet streaked the eastern sky yet for all that colin could see his inexplicable visitor quite plainly the stranger briefly introduced himself as his satanic majesty and according to his usual pleasant custom offered the boy all that he could wish for in lifehealth and beauty and indeed these were his already and wealth honour and affluence which at present were sadly lackingon the sole condition that at his death his soul was to belong to his benefactor the bargainthis was the unusual feature in the stanier legendwas to hold good for all his direct descendants who unless they definitely renounced the contract on their own behalf would be partakers in these benefits and debtors in the other small matter for his part colin had no sort of hesitation in accepting so tempting an offer and satan thereupon produced for his perusal he was able to read a slip of parchment on which the conditions were firmly and plainly stated a scratch with his knife on the forearm supplied the ink for the signature and satan provided him with a pen he was bidden to keep the document as a guarantee of the good faith of his bargainer the red cloak flashed for a moment in front of his eyes dazzling him and he staggered and fell back on the heap of straw from which he had just risen the darkness was thick and impenetrable round him but at the moment a distant flash of lightning blinked in through the open door showing him that the shed was empty again outside save for the drowsy answer of the thunder all was quiet but in his hand certainly was a slip of parchment the same so runs the legend is reproduced in the magnificent holbein of the young man which hangs now above the mantelpiece in the hall of stanier colin stanier first earl of yardley looking hardly older than he did on this momentous night stands there in garter robes with this little document in his hand the original parchment so the loquacious housekeeper points out to the visitors who today go over the house on the afternoons when it is open to the public is let into the frame of the same portrait certainly there is such a piece of parchment there just below the title of the picture but the ink has so faded that it is impossible to decipher more than a word or two of it the word diabolus must be more conjectured than seen and the ingenious profess to decipher the words quodcunque divitiarum pulchritud so that it would seem that colin the shepherdboy if he signed it must have perused and understood latin this in itself is so excessively improbable that the whole business may be discredited from first to last but there is no doubt whatever that colin stanier did some time sign a latin document for his name in ink now brown is perfectly legible which has perished in the corroding years whether he understood it or not and there seems no doubt about the date in the bottom lefthand corner the constructive reader will by this time have got ready his interpretation about the whole cockandbull story and a very sensible one it is the legend is surely what mythologists call tiological there washe can see itan old strip of parchment signed by colin stanier and this in view of the incredible prosperity of the family coupled with the almost incredible history of their dark deeds would be quite sufficient to give rise to the legend in medival times apparently such satanic bargains were if not common at any rate not unknown and the legend was no doubt invented in order to account for these phenomena instead of being responsible for them of legendary significance too must be the story of philip stanier third earl who is said to have renounced his part in the bargain and thereupon fell from one misfortune into another was branded with an incurable and disfiguring disease and met his death on the dagger of an injured woman ronald stanier a nephew of the above was another such recusant he married a shrew lost a fortune in the south sea bubble and had a singularly inglorious career but such instances as these in all the long history there are no more of them until credence in the legend faded altogether even if we could rely on their authenticity would only seem to prove that those who renounced the devil and all his works necessarily met with misfortune in this life which is happily not the case and thus they tend to disprove rather than confirm the whole affair finally when we come to more modern times and examine the records of the stanier family from let us say the advent of the hanoverian dynasty though their splendour and distinction is ever a crescent not a waning moon there can be no reason to assign a diabolical origin to such prosperity there were black sheep among them of course but when will you not find in records so public as theirs dark shadows thrown by the searchlight of history bargains with the powers of hell in any case belong to the romantic dusk of the middle ages and cannot find any serious place in modern chronicles but to quit these quagmires of superstition for the warranted and scarcely less fascinating solidity of fact colin stanier next day obediently craved audience with the queen at the manor of brede by a stroke of intuition which does much to account for his prosperous fortune he did not make himself endimanch but with his shepherds crook in his hand and a newborn lamb in his bosom he presented himself at the house where the queen lodged he would have been contemptuously turned back with buffets by the halberdiers and yeomen who guarded the entrance but the mention of his name sufficed to admit him with a reluctant alacrity he wore but the breeches and jerkin in which he pursued his work among the beasts his shapely legs were bare from knee to ankle and as he entered the porch he kicked off the shoes in which he had walked from rye his crook he insisted on retaining and the lamb which obedient to the spell that he exercised over young living things lay quiet in his arms some fussy controller of the queens household would have ejected him and chanced the consequences but said colin very quietly it is by her majestys orders that i present myself and whether you buffet me or not prithee tell the queens grace that i am here there was something surprising in the dignity of the boy and in the sweettoned clearcut speech so unlike the utterance of the mumbling rustic and the controller bidding him wait where he was shuffled upstairs and came back with extraordinary expedition the queens grace awaits you mr stanier said colin mr stanier but your crook your lamb let us do her majestys bidding said colin he was ushered into the long hall of brede manor and the controller having thrown the door open slipped away with an alertness that suggested that his presence was desirable there no more and left the boy barefooted clasping his lamb with a rushstrewn floor to traverse there was a table down the centre of it littered with papers and hemmed in with chairs that suggested that their occupants had hurriedly vacated them at the end was seated a small bent figure conspicuous for her ruff and her red hair and her rope of pearls and her eyes bright and sharp as a birds colin sadly pricked on the soles of his feet by the rushes advanced across that immeasurable distance looking downwards on his lamb when he had traversed the half of it he raised his eyes for a moment and saw that the queen still quite motionless was steadily regarding him again he bent his eyes on his lamb and when he had come close to that formidable figure he fell on his knees a lamb madam he said which is the firstfruits of the spring my crook which i lay at your graces feet and myself who am not worthy to lie there again colin raised his eyes and the wretch put into them all the gaiety and boldness which he gave to the wenches on the farm then he dropped them again and with his whole stake on the table waited gambler as he was for the arbitrament look at me colin stanier said the queen colin looked there was the tiny wrinkled face the high eyebrows the thinlipped mouth disclosing the discoloured teeth madam he said well what next said elizabeth impatiently my body and soul madam said colin and once more he put into his eyes and his eager mouth that semblance of desire which had made mistress moffat the wife of the mayor box his ears with a blow that was more of a caress the queen felt precisely the same as mistress moffat and drew her hand down over his smooth chin and it is your wish to be my shepherdboy colin she asked you desire to be my page i am sick with desire said colin i appoint you she said i greet and salute you colin stanier she bent towards him and neither saint nor devil could have inspired colin better at that moment he kissed her after all he had been offered the greeting fairly and squarely on her withered cheek and then without pause kissed the hem of her embroidered gown he had done right just absolutely right you bold dog said the queen stand up colin stood up with his arms close by his side as if at attention in all his shapeliness and beauty and the queen clapped her hands the side door opened disclosing halberdiers and through the door by which colin had entered came the controller colin stanier is my page she said and of my household summon my lords again we have not finished with our spanish business the lambi will eat that lamb and none other at the feast of easter within the week colin was established in attendance on the queen and the daring felicity which had marked his first dealings with her never failed nor faltered his radiant youth the gaiety of his boyish spirits the unfailing tact of his flattery his roguish innocence the fine innate breeding of the yeomanstock which is the best blood in england wove a spell that seemed to defy the usual fickleness of her favouritism certainly he had wisdom as far beyond his years as it was beyond his upbringing and wisdom coming like pure water from the curves of that beautiful young mouth made him frankly irresistible to the fiery and shrewd old woman from being her page he was speedily advanced to the post of confidential secretary and queer it was to see the boy seated by her side at some state council while she rated and stormed at her lords for giving her some diplomatic advice which her flamelike spirit deemed spiritless then in midtirade she would stop tweak her secretary by his rosy ear and say eh colin am i not in the right of it very often she was not and then colin would so deftly insinuate further considerations prefacing them by as your grace and majesty so wisely has told us when her grace and majesty had told them precisely the opposite that elizabeth would begin to imagine that she had thought of these prudent things herself the court in general followed the example of their royal mistress and had not colins nature below its gaiety and laughter been made of some very stern stuff he must surely have degenerated into a spoilt vain child before ever he came to his full manhood men and women alike were victims of that sunny charm to be with him made the heart sing and none could grudge that a boy on whom god had showered every grace of mind and body should find the mere tawdry decorations of riches and honour his natural heritage then too there was this to consider the queens fickle and violent temper might topple down one whom she had visited but yesterday with her highest favours and none but colin could induce her to restore the light she had withdrawn if you wanted a boon granted or even a vengeance taken there was no such sure road to its accomplishment as to secure colins advocacy no path that led so straight to failure as to set the boy against you for such services it was but reasonable that some token of gratitude should be conferred on him by the suppliant some graceful acknowledgment which in our harsh modern way we should now term commission and colins commissions thus honestly earned soon amounted to a very pretty figure whether he augmented them or not by less laudable methods by threats or what we call by that ugly word blackmail is a different matter and need not be gone into yet surrounded as he was by all that might have been expected to turn a boys head colin remained singularly wellbalanced and whatever tales might be told about his virtue the most censorious could find no fault with his prudence the queen created him at the age of twentyfive knight of the garter and earl of yardley a title which his descendants hold to this day and presented him with the manor of yardley in buckinghamshire and the monastic lands of tillingham on the hills above the romney marsh he incorporated the fine dwellinghouse of the evicted abbot into the great and glorious mansion of stanier the monks quarters he demolished altogether and the abbey church became the parish church of tillingham for worship and the chapel and buryingplace of the staniers for pride but though the queen told him once and again that it was time her colin took a wife he protested that while her light was shed on him not venus herself could kindle desire in his heart this was the only instance in which he disobeyed glorianas wishes but gloriana willingly pardoned his obduracy and rewarded it with substantial benefits on her death which occurred when he was thirty he made a very suitable match with the heiress of sir john reeves who brought him in addition to a magnificent dowry the considerable acreage which today is part of the london estate of the staniers he retired from courtlife and divided the year between stanier and london busy with the embellishment of his houses into which he poured those treasures of art which now glorify them he was too as the glades and terraces of stanier testify a gardener on a notable scale and his passion in this direction led him to evict his father from the farm where colins own boyhood was passed which lay on the level land below the hill in order to make there the long ornamental water which is one of the most agreeable features of the place his father by this time was an old man of uncouth and intemperate habits and it could not perhaps be expected that the young earl should cherish his declining years with any very personal tenderness but he established him in a decent dwelling gave him an adequate maintenance with a permission to draw on the brewery for unlimited beer and made only the one stipulation that his father should never attempt to gain access to him the old man put so liberal an interpretation on his beerrights that he did not enjoy them very long this taint of hardness in colins character was no new feature he had left the home of his boyhood without regret or any subsequent affection of remembrance he had made his pleasurable life at court a profitable affair whereas others had spent their salaries and fortunes in maintaining their suitable magnificence and like the great marlborough a few generations later he had allowed infatuated women to pay pretty handsomely for the privilege of adoring him and the inhumanities such as his eviction of his father with which his married life was garlanded was no more than the reasonable development of earlier tendencies always a great stickler for the majesty of the law he caused certain sheepstealers on the edge of his property to be hanged for their misdeeds and why should not the lord of tillingham have bought their little properties from their widows at a more than reasonable price though his own infidelities were notorious the settlements of his marriage were secure enough and when he had already begotten two sons of the hapless daughter of sir john reeves he invoked the aid of the law to enable him to put her away and renew his vow of love and honour to the heiress of my lord middlesex she proved to be a barren crone and perhaps had no opportunity of proving her fruitfulness but she was so infatuated with him that by the settlements she gave him unconditionally the broughton property which so conveniently adjoined his own to go back again for a moment to that obscure matter of the stanier legend it appears that on the day on which each of his sons came of age their father made them acquainted with the agreement he had made on behalf of himself and the heirs of his body and shewed them the signed parchment they had so he pointed out to them the free choice of dissociating themselves from that bargain and of taking the chance of material prosperity here and of salvation hereafter he enjoined on them also the duty of transmitting the legend to their children in the manner and at the time that it had been made known to themselves neither ronald the elder nor his brother philip felt the least qualm about the future but they both had a very considerable appreciation of the present and on each occasion the parchment was restored to its strong box with no loss of validity as regards the next generation ronald soon afterwards made one of those prudent marriages for which for generations the staniers have been famous philip on the other hand who presently made for himself at the court a position hardly less brilliant than his fathers had been found celibacy with its accompanying consolations good enough for him this is too polite an age to speak of his infamies and his amazing debauches but his father was never tired of hearing about them and used to hang on the boys tales when he got leave of absence from the court to spend a week at home ronald was but a prude in comparison with the other two protesting at philips more atrocious experiences his notion so he drunkenly tried to explain himself for his grandfathers pleasures made strong appeal to him was that there were things that no gentleman would do whatever backing he had and with a curious superstitious timidity he similarly refused to play dice on the communion table in the old monastic chapel for full forty years after the death of the queen colin knight of the garter and first earl of yardley revelled at the banquet of life all that material prosperity could offer was his his princely purchases his extravagances his sumptuous hospitalities were powerless to check the everswelling roll of his revenues he enjoyed a perfect bodily health and up to the day of his death his force was unabated his eye undimmed and the gold in his hair untouched by a single thread of silver as the years went on his attachment to this stately house of stanier grew to a passion and however little credence we may give to the legend it is certain that his descendants inherit from colin stanier that devotion to the place where they were born no stanier so it is said is ever completely happy away from the great house that crowns the hill above the romney marsh it is to them a shrine a mecca a golden jerusalem the home of their hearts and all the fairest of foreign lands the most sunny seas the most sumptuous palaces are but wildernesses or hovels in comparison with their home to such an extent was this true of colin first earl that for the last ten years of his life he scarcely left the place for a night but though his bodily health remained ever serene and youthful and youths excesses continued into old age left him unwrinkled of skin and vigorous in desire there grew on him during the last year of his life a malady neither of body nor of mind but of the very spirit and essence of his being the compact that he believed himself to have made had been fully and honestly observed by the other high contracting party and as the time drew near that his own share in the bargain must be exacted from him his spirit we must suppose conscious that the imprint of the divine was so shortly to be surcharged with the stamp and superscription of hell was filled with some remorseful terror that in itself was a foretaste of damnation he ate he drank he slept he rioted he brought to stanier yet more treasures of exquisite artitalian pictures bronzes of greek workmanship spanish lace torn perhaps from the edges of altarcloths intaglios persian pottery and ming porcelain from china his passion for beauty which had all his life been a torch to him did not fail him nor yet the wit and rapierplay of tongue nor yet the scandalous chronicles of philip but in the midst of beauty or debauchery there would come to his mind with such withering of the spirit as befel belshazzar when the writing was traced on the wall the knowledge of his approaching doom as if to attempt to turn it aside or soften the inexorable fate he gave himself to deeds of belated pity and charitableness he endowed an almshouse in rye he erected a fine tomb over his fathers grave he attended daily service in the church which he had desecrated with his dicethrowings and all the time his spirit told him that it was too late he had made his bed and must lie on it for he turned to the god whom he had renounced neither in love nor in sincerity nor in fear of him but in terror of his true master but when he tried to pray his mind could invoke no holy images but was decked with pageants of debauchery and if he formed his lips to pious words there dropped from them a stream of obscenities and blasphemy at any moment the terror would lay its hand on his spirit affecting neither body nor mind but addressing itself solely to the immortal and deathless part of him it was in vain that he attempted to assure himself too that in the ordering of the world neither god nor devil has a share for even the atheism in which he had lived deserted him as the hour of his death drew near the day of his seventieth birthday arrived the house was full of guests and in honour of the occasion there was a feast for the tenants of the estate in the great hall while his own friends making a company of some fifty sat at the high table on the dais all day distant thunder had muttered obscurely among the hills and by the time that the lights were lit in the hall and the drinking deep a heavy pall had overspread the sky lord yardley was in fine spirits that night for years he had had a presentiment that he would do no more than reach the exact span appointed for the life of men and would die on his seventieth birthday and here was the day as good as over and if that presentiment proved to be unfulfilled he felt that he would face with a stouter scepticism the other terror he had just risen from his place to reply to the toast of the evening and stood tall and comely the figure of a man still in the prime of life facing his friends and dependents then even while he opened his lips to speak the smile was struck from his face and instead of speech there issued from his mouth one wild cry of terror no no he screamed and with his arm pushed out in front of him as if to defend himself against some invisible presence he fell forward across the table at that moment the hall leaped into blinding light and an appalling riot of thunder answered some said that he had been struck and indeed on his forehead there was a small black mark as of burning but those nearest felt no shock and were confident that the stroke which had fallen on him preceded the flash and the thunder he had crashed forward after that cry and that gesture of terror before even the lightning descended and ronald reigned in his stead by the patent of nobility granted to colin stanier by elizabeth the estates and title descended not through heirs male only but through the female line if an earl of yardley died leaving only female issue the girl became countess of yardley in her own right to the exclusion of sons begotten by her fathers or grandfathers younger brother it was perhaps characteristic of the queen to frame the charter thusshe had done so of her own invention and devisingfor thus she gratified her own sense of the capability of her sex and also felt some phantom of posthumous delight in securing as far as she could that the honours that she had showered on her favourite should descend in direct line but for many generations her foresight and precaution seemed needless since each holder of the title bore sons only and the line was straight as a larch from father to son by some strange arbitrament of fate it so happened that younger sons following the unchaste example of philip died in legal celibacy or if they married were childless or became so in that generation or the next thus the family is unique in having to this day no collateral branches and in this the fancifully disposed may be prone to see a certain diabolical observance of the original bond no dowries for daughters had to be provided and such portions as were made for younger sons soon rolled back again into the sea of family affluence the purchase of land formed the main outlet for the flood of everincreasing revenue and as surely as lord yardley entered upon his new acreages mineral wealth would be discovered on the freshlyacquired property as was the case in the cornish farms where the stanier lode of tin was found or if when at a later date as in a mere freak he purchased barren fields fit only for grazing by the sea it was not long before the prince regent found that the sussex coast enjoyed a bracing and salubrious air and lo all the grazinglands of lord stanier became building sites whatever they touched turned to gold and that to no anmic hands incapable of enjoying the lusts and splendours of life honours fell on them thick as autumn leaves each holder of the title in turn has won the garter and never has the garter been bestowed on them without solid merit to carry it three have been prime ministers further three ambassadors to foreign countries on difficult and delicate businesses in the napoleonic wars there was a great general but all these records are public property less known perhaps is the fact that no lord yardley has ever yet died in his bed or received the religious consolation that would fit him to go forth undismayed on his last dark solitary journey and though each in turn with the sad exception of philip third earl and his nephew the recusant ronald has lived to the comfortable age of seventy swift death sometimes with violence has been the manner of his exit colin fourth earl committed suicide under circumstances which made it creditable that he should do so otherwise strange seizures accompanied it would appear by some inexplicable terror has been the manner of the demise and what in this brief history of their annals can be said of the legend except that from being a terrible truth to colin first earl it has faded even as has faded the ink which records that mythical bargaining it is more than a hundred years ago now that the lord yardley of the day caused the parchment to be inserted in the frame of his infamous ancestor where it can be seen now every thursday afternoon from three to five when stanier is open without fee to decentlyclad visitors and the very fact that lord yardley temp george iii should have displayed it as a curiosity is the measure of the incredulity with which those most closely concerned regarded it a man would not put up for all the world to see the warrant that he should burn eternally in the fires of hell if he viewed it with the slightest tremor of misgiving it was blasphemous even to suppose that worldly prosperity as said the excellent parson at stanier who always dined at the house on sunday evening and slept it off on monday morning was anything other than the mark of divine favour and many texts from the psalmist could be produced in support of his view thus fortified by port and professional advice lord yardley decreed the insertion of the document into the frame that held the picture of that ancestor of his whose signature it bore and gave a remarkably generous subscription to the organfund faded as was the writing then it has faded into greater indecipherability since and with it any remnant of faith in its validity yet hardly less curious to the psychologist is the strange nature of these staniers decked as they are with the embellishment of distinction of breeding and beauty they have always seemed to their contemporaries to be lacking in some quality hard to define but easy to appreciate or in their case to miss a tale of trouble will very likely win from them some solid alleviation but their generosity you would find gave always the impression of being made not out of love or out of sympathy but out of contempt their charmand god knows how many have fallen victims to ithas been and is that of some cold brilliance that attracts even as the beam of a lighthouse attracts the migrating birds who dash themselves to pieces against the glass that shields it it can scarcely be said to be the fault of the light that the silly feathered things broke themselves against its transparent impenetrable armour it hardly invited it only shone on business which did not concern the birds so there was no definite design of attraction or cruelty in its beams only of brilliance and indifference that is the habit of light such too are the habits of birds the light even might be supposed by sentimentalists faintly to regret the shattered wing and the brightness of the drowned plumage but so it is popularly supposed it is quite easy though not very prudent to arouse unfavourable emotion in a stanier you have but to vex him or run counter to his wish and you will very soon find yourself on the target of a remorseless and vindictive hate no ray of pity so it is said softens the hardness of that frosty intensity no contrition when once it has been aroused will thaw it forgiveness is a word quite foreign to their vocabulary and its nearest equivalent is a contemptuous indifference gratitude in the same way figures as an obsolete term in the language of their emotions they neither feel it nor expect it it has no currency whatever you may be privileged to do for a stanier he takes as a mite in the endowment which the world has always since the days of our elizabethan colin poured into their treasuries while if he has done you a good turn he has done so as he would chuck a picked bone to a hungry dog the proper course for the dog is to snatch it up and retire into its corner to mumble it it would be strange then if being without ruth or love a stanier could bestow or aspire to friendship with man or woman and indeed such an anomaly has never occurred but then it must be remembered that staniers as far as we can find out from old letters and diaries and mere historical documents never wanted friendship nor indeed comprehended it their beauty and their charm made easy for them the creation of such relationships as they desired the assuaging of such thirst as was theirs after which the sucked rind could be thrown away and though through all their generations they have practised those superb hospitalities which find so apt a setting at stanier it is rather as gods snuffing up the incense of their worshippers than as entertaining their friends that they fill the great house with all who are noblest by birth or distinction george iv for instance when prince regent stayed there it may be remembered for nearly a fortnight having been asked for three days during which time the entire house of lords with their wives spent in noble sections two nights at stanier as well as many much younger and sprightlier little personages just as famous in the proper quarter the entire opera from drury lane diverted their evening one night baccarat or its equivalent beguiled another on yet another the prince could not be found not so fortunate perhaps save in being the mistresses of all this splendour and invariably the mothers of handsome sons have been the successive wives in this illustrious line for with whatever natural gaiety with whatever high and independent spirit these ladies married the sons of the house they seemed always to have undergone some gloomy and mysterious transformation it was as if they were ground in a mill and ground exceeding small and as if the resulting powder of grain was mixed and kneaded and baked into the stanier loaf especially was this the case with her who married the young lord stanier of the day long before she succeeded to her full honours she had been crushed into the iron mould designed for the countesses of yardley in public dignity and stateliness and fine manner would distinguish her but below these desirable insignia of her station her character and individuality seemed to have been reduced to pulp to have been frozen to death to have been pounded and brayed in some soulshattering mortar perhaps when first as a bride she entered through the glass doors which were only opened when the eldest son brought home his wife or when there was welcomed at stanier some reigning monarch her heart would be all afire with love and virgin longing for him with whom she passed through those fatal portals but before the honeymoon was over this process that tamed and stifled and paralysed would have begun its deadly work for the eldest son and his wife there was reserved a floor in one of the wings of the house they had no other establishment in the country and here when not in london the family dwelt in patriarchal fashion when no guests were present the heirapparent and his wife breakfasted and lunched in the privacy of their wing if so they chose they had their own horses their own household of servants but every evening when the warning bell for dinner sounded the majordomo came to the door of their apartments and preceded them down to the great gallery where with any other sons and daughtersinlaw they awaited the entrance of lord yardley and his wife then came the stately and almost speechless dinner served on gold plate and after that a rubber of whist decorous and damning until lady yardley retired on the stroke of ten and the sons joined their father in the billiardroom such evenings were rare for usually throughout the shooting season there were guests in the house but from them we can conjecture some sketch of the paralysing process this was the conduct of a family evening in the mere superficial adventure of dining and passing a sociable evening and from it we can estimate something of the effect of parallel processes applied to the thoughts and the mind and the aspirations and the desires of a young wife no stanier wanted love or gave it what he wanted when he took his mate was that in obedience and subjection she should give him as she always did a legitimate and healthy heir she was not a stanier and though she wore the family pearls like a halter she was only there on sufferance and of necessity and though her blood would beat with the true ichor in the arteries of the next generation she was in herself no more than the sucked orangerind the staniers were too proud to reckon an alliance with any family on the face of the earth as anything but an honour for the family concerned even when as happened at the close of the eighteenth century a princess of the hohenzollern line was married to the heir she was ground in the mill like any other in her case she shared to the full in the brutal arrogance of her own family and had imagined that it was she who by this alliance had conferred not accepted an honour she had supposed that her husband and his relations would give her the deference due to royalty and it took her some little time to learn her lesson which she appears to have mastered a hundred years later the emperor william ii of germany had a reminder of it which caused him considerable surprise on one of his visits to england he deigned to pass a weekend at stanier and though received as a reigning monarch with opening of the glass doors he found that his condescension in remembering that he was connected with the family was not received with the rapture of humility which he had expected he had asked to be treated by the members of the family as cousin willie and they did so with a nonchalance that was truly amazing such in brief was the rise of the staniers and such the outline of their splendour chapter ii by the middle of the nineteenth century the fading of the actual deed signed by colin stanier had scarcely kept pace with the fading of the faith in it this had become the mildest of effete superstitions about that epoch also the continuity of stanier tradition was broken for there was born in the direct line not only two sons but a daughter hester who a couple of centuries ago would probably have been regarded as a changeling and met an early fate as such she was as lovely as the dawn and had to the full with every feminine grace added a double portion of the stanier charm but in her disposition no faintest trace of traditional inheritance could be found instead of their inhuman arrogance their icy selfsufficiency she was endowed with a gaiety and a rollicking guttersnipe enjoyment of existence which laughed to scorn the dignity of birth being of the inferior sex her father decreed that she should be brought up in the image of the tradition which ground so small the women who had married into the family she must become like her own mother aloof and calm and infinitely conscious of her position but neither precept nor example had the smallest effect on her for dignity she had boisterousness for calm buoyant irrepressible spirits and for selfcontrol a marked tendency to allure and kindle the susceptibilities of the other sex were he peer or ploughboy alone too of her race she had no spark of that passionate affection for her home that was one of the most salient characteristics of the others she gave an instance of this defect when at the age of fifteen she ran away from stanier halfway through august while the family were in residence after the season in london being unable to stand the thought of that deadly and awful stateliness which would last without break till january when the assembling of the houses of parliament would take them all back to the metropolis which she loved with extraordinary fervour part of the way she went in a train part of the way she rode and eventually arrived back at the huge house in st jamess square now empty and sheeted and persuaded the caretaker who had been her nurse and adored her with unique devotion to take her in and send no news to stanier of her arrival darling cooper she said with her arms round the old womans neck and her delicious face bestowing kisses on her unless you promise to say nothing about my coming here i shall leave the house and get really lost they say a healthy girl can always get a living eh my dear said cooper much shocked what are you saying hesters look of seraphic ignorance that she had said anything unusual reassured cooper what am i saying asked hester im just saying what i shall do i shall buy a monkey and a barrelorgan and dress like a gipsy and tell fortunes but i wont go back to that awful stanier but its your papas house said cooper young ladies have to live with their families till they are married this one wont said hester and i believe its true cooper that we own it through the power of the devil its a dreadful place theres a blight on it grandmamma was turned to stone there and mamma has been turned to stone and theyre trying to turn me to stone poor cooper was in a fair quandary she knew that hester was perfectly capable of rushing out of the house unless she gave her the desired promise and then with what face would she encounter lord yardley how stammer forth the miserable confession that hester had been here not less impossible to contemplate was the housing of this entrancing imp and keeping to herself the secret of hesters whereabouts even more impossible was the third count of giving hester the promise and then breaking it by sending a clandestine communication to her mother for that would imply the loss of hesters trust in her and she could not face the idea of those eyes turned reproachfully on her as on some treacherous foe she hesitated and the artful hester noted her advantage darling cooper you wouldnt like me to be turned to stone she said i know i should make a lovely statue but its better to be alive eh my dear be a good girl and go back to stanier pleaded cooper think of your mamma and the anxiety shes in about you hester made a face its silly to say that she said mamma anxious indeed mamma couldnt be anxious shes dead inside cooper felt she could not argue the point with any conviction for she was entirely of hesters opinion and ive had no tea cooper said the girl and i am so hungry bless the child but ill get you your tea said cooper and then youll be a good girl and let me send off a telegram what hesters future plans really were she had not yet determined to herself she was still acting under the original impulse which had made her run away come what might she had found the idea of stanier utterly impossible that morning the only thing that mattered was to get away but as cooper bustled about with the preparations of the tea she began to consider what she really expected she was quite undismayed at what she had done and was on that score willing to confront any stone faces that might begorgon her but her imagination could not picture what she was going to do would she live here perdue for the next six months till the family of stone brought their pharaohpresence into london again she could not imagine that was it to come then to the threatened barrelorgan and the monkey and the telling of fortunes glib and ready as had been her speech on that subject it lacked reality when seriously contemplated in the mirror of the future but if she was not proposing to live here with cooper or to run away definitelya prospect for which at the age of fifteen she felt herself now that it grimly stared her in the face wholly unripethere was nothing to be done but today or tomorrow or on one of the conceivable tomorrows to go back again and yet her whole nature revolted against that she was sitting in the windowseat of the big hall as this dismal debate went on in her head but all the parties to that conference were agreed on one thingnamely that cooper should not telegraph to her mother and that come what might cooper should not be imagined to be an accomplice just then she heard a step on the threshold outside and simultaneously the welcome jingle of a teatray from the opposite direction hester tiptoed towards the latter of these sounds and found cooper laden with good things on a tray advancing up the corridor go back to your room cooper she whispered there is some one at the door i will see who it is eh now let me open the door said cooper visibly apprehensive no go away whispered hester and remained there during imperative peals of the bell till cooper had vanished she tried by peeping sideways out of the hall window to arrive at the identity of this impatient visitor but could see nothing of him then with cold courage she went to the frontdoor and opened it she expected something badher mother perhaps or her brothers tutor or the groom of the chambersbut she had conjectured nothing so bad as this for on the doorstep stood her father that formidable figure was not often encountered by her in london she practically never saw him at all in the country she saw him but once a day when with the rest of the family she waited in the drawingroom before dinner for his entrance with her mother then they all stood up and paired off to go in to dinner in some remote manner hester felt that she had no existence for him but that he at close quarters had a terrible existence for her generally he took no notice whatever of her but today she realised that she existed for him in so lively a manner that he had come up from stanier to get into touch with her such courage as she had completely oozed out of her she had become just a stone out of the family quarry so youre here he said shutting the door behind him yes said hester and do you realise what youve done he asked ive run away said she i dont mean that said he thats soon remedied but youve made me spend half the day travelling in order to find you now youre going to suffer for it stand up here in front of me as he spoke he drew off his fine white gloves and put the big sapphire ring that he wore into his pocket at that hester guessed his purpose i shant she said he gave her so illomened and ugly a glance that her heart quailed you will do as i tell you he said hester felt her pulses beating small and quick fear perhaps accounted for that but more dominant than fear in her mind was the sense of her hatred of her father he was like a devil one of those contorted waterspouts on the church at home she found herself obeying him now i am going to punish you he said for being such a nuisance to me by illluck you are my daughter and as you dont know how a daughter of mine ought to behave i am going to show you what happens when she behaves as you have done your mother has often told me that you are a wilful and vulgar child disobedient to your governesses and in a word common but now you have forced your commonness upon my notice and im going to make you sorry for having done so hold your head up he drew back his arm and with his open hand smacked her across her cheek with his left hand he planted a similar and stinging blow four times those white thin fingers of his blazoned themselves on her face and then he paused well why dont you cry he said because i dont choose to said hester put your head up again said he she stood there firm as a rock for half a dozen more of those bitter blows and then into his black heart there came a conviction bitterer than any punishment he had inflicted on her that he was beaten in sheer rage at this he took her by her shoulders and shook her violently and then came the end for she simply collapsed on the floor still untamed her bodily force might fail but she flew no flag of surrender she came to herself again with the sense of cooper near her she turned weary eyes this way and that but saw nothing of her father oh cooper has that devil gone she asked eh my lady said cooper who are you talking of theres no one here but his lordship hester raised herself on her elbow and saw that awful figure standing by the great chimneypiece the first thought that came into her mind was for cooper i wish to tell you that ever since i entered the house cooper has been saying that she must telegraph to you that i was here she said he nodded thats all right then cooper he said hester watched her father take the sapphire ring from his waistcoat pocket he put this on and then his gloves her ladyship will stay here tonight cooper he said and you will take her to the station tomorrow morning and bring her down to stanier he did not so much as glance at hester and next moment the front door had closed behind him hester arrived back at stanier next day after this abortive expedition and it was clear at once that orders had been issued that no word was to be said to her on the subject of what she had done she had midday dinner with her governess rode afterwards with her brothers and as usual stood up when her father entered the drawingroom in the evening the awful life had closed like a trap upon her again rather more tightly than before for she was subject to a closer supervision but though the apparent victory was with her father she knew and was somehow aware that he knew it too that her spirit had not yielded one inch to him and that he for all his grim autocracy was conscious as regards her of imperfect mastery if he had broken her will so she acutely argued she would not now have been watched her doings would not as they certainly were have been reported to him by the governess that was meat and drink to her but from being a mere grim presence in the background he had leaped into reality and with the whole force of her nature she hated him the substance of the stanier legend faint though the faith in it had become was of course well known to her and every morning looking like some young sexless angel newly come to earth she added to her very tepid prayers the fervent and heartfelt petition that the devil would not long delay in exacting his part of the bargain two years passed and hester became aware that there were schemes on foot for marrying her off with the utmost possible speed the idea of marriage in the abstract was wholly to her mind since then she would be quit of the terrible life at stanier but in the concrete she was not so content with her selected deliverer this was the mild and highborn marquis of blakeney a man precisely twice her age of plain serious mind and irreproachable morals he adored her in a rapt and tonguetied manner and no doubt hester had encouraged him with those little smiles and glances which she found it impossible not to bestow on any male denizen of this earth without any distinct ulterior views but when it became evident by his own express declaration made with the permission of her father that he entertained such views hester wondered whether it would be really possible to kiss that seallike whiskered face with any semblance of wifely enthusiasm had there been any indication that her pious petition with regard to the speedy ratification of the stanier legend as regards her father would be granted she would probably have recommended the mild marquis to take his vows to other shrines but her father seemed to be suffering no inconvenience from her prayers and she accepted the rapt and tonguetied devotion instantly all the bonds of discipline and suppression were relaxed even in her fathers eyes her engagement made her something of a personage and hester hated him more than ever and then the vengeance of winged vindictive love more imperious than her father overtook and punished her breaking her spirit which he had never done at a dance given at blakeney castle to celebrate the engagement she saw young ralph brayton penniless and debonair with no sealface and no marquisate and the glance of each pierced through the heart of the other he was the son of the family solicitor of lord blakeney and even while his father was drawing out the schedule of munificent settlements for the bridetobe the bride gave him something more munificent yet and settled it her heart upon him for all perpetuity she did her best to disown if not to stifle what had come upon her and had her marriage but been fixed for a month earlier than the day appointed she would probably have married her affianced bridegroom and let love hang itself in its own silken noose and chance its being quite strangled as it was even while her room at stanier was silky and shimmering with the appurtenances of a bride she slipped out one night as the moon set and joined her lover at the park gates by dawn they had come to london and before evening she was safe in the holding of her husbands arms on the news reaching lord yardley he had a stroke from which he did not recover for many years though he soon regained sufficient power of babbling speech to make it abundantly clear that he would never see hester again as she was equally determined never to see him their wills were in complete harmony that brutal punishment she had received from those thin white hands two years before followed by the bondage of her life at home had rendered her perfectly callous as regards him had he been sorry for it she might have shrugged her pretty shoulders and forgotten it for that cold pale slab of womanhood her mother she felt nothing whatever this outrageous marriage of hesters followed by her fathers stroke were contrary to all tradition as regards the legend for these calamities indeed looked as if one of the high contracting parties was not fulfilling his share of the bargain and the behaviour of philip lord stanier the stricken mans eldest son added weight to the presumption that the luck of the staniers to put it at that was on the wanefading fading like the ink of the original bond instead of marrying at the age of twenty or twentyone as his father and forefathers had done he remained obstinately celibate and ludicrously decorous in appearance he was dark heavy of feature jowled even in his youth by a fleshiness of neck and built on massive lines in place of the slenderness of his race though somehow in spite of these aberrations from the type he yet presented an example or rather a parody of the type but when you came to mind and that which lies behind body and mind alike that impenetrable essence of individuality then the professors in heredity would indeed have held up bewildered hands of surrender he was studious and hesitating his mental processes went with a tread as deliberate as his foot and in place of that swift eagerness of the stanier mind which so to speak threw a lasso over the mental quarry with one swing of a lithe arm and entangled it poor philip crept on hands and knees towards it and advanced ever so imperceptibly nearer in the matter of mode of life the difference between him and the type was most marked of all hitherto the eldest son had married early and wisely for the sole object of the perpetuation of the breed and having arrived at that pursued the ways of youth in copious indiscretions which his wife already tamed and paralysed had no will to resent philip on the other hand living in the gloom of the house beneath the stroke and the shadow that had fallen on his father seemed to have missed his youth altogether life held for him no bubbling draught that frothed on his lips and was forgotten he abstained from all the fruits of vigour and exuberance one family characteristic alone was histhe passionate love of his home so that he preferred even in these conditions to live here than find freedom elsewhere there he dreamed and studied and neither love nor passion nor intrigue came near him he cared little for his mother his father he hated and feared and yet some germ of romance perhaps lay dormant but potential in his soul for more and more he read of italy and of the swift flowering of love in the south it seemed as if the hellish bargain made three hundred years ago had indeed become obsolete for the weeks and months added themselves together into a swiftly mounting total of years while a nightmare of eclipsed existence brooded over the great house at stanier since the stroke that had fallen on him after hesters runaway match lord yardley would have no guests in the house and with the constancy of the original colin would never leave the place himself grinning and snarling in his bathchair he would be drawn up and down its long galleries by the hour together with his battered and petrified spouse walking by his side at first unable to speak with any coherence but as the years went on attaining to a grim ejaculatory utterance that left no doubt as to his meaning sometimes it was his whim to enter the library and if philip was there he would give vent to dreadful and stuttering observations as he clenched and unclenched the nerveless hands that seemed starving to throttle his sons throat then tired with this outpouring of emotion he would doze in his chair and wake from his doze into a paroxysm of tremulous speechlessness at dinnertime he would have the riband of the garter pinned across his knitted coat and be wheeled with his wife walking whitely by his side into the gallery where the unmarried philip and his newlymarried brother and his wife stood up at his entrance and without recognition he would pass jibbering at the head of that small and dismal procession into the diningroom he grew ever thinner and more wasted in body but such was some consuming fire within him that he needed the sustenance of some growing and gigantic youth he was unable to feed himself and his attendant standing by him put into that open chasm of a mouth still lined with milkwhite teeth his monstrous portions a couple of bites was sufficient to prepare for the gulp and again his mouth was ready to receive then when the solid entertainment was over and the women gone there remained the business of wine and sound trencherman though he was his capacity over this was even more remarkable he took his port by the tumblerful the first of which he would drink like one thirsty for water and this in some awful manner momentarily restored his powers of speech like the first drops before a storm single words began dripping from his lips as this restoration of speech took place his eye brightening with malevolence fixed itself on philip and night after night he would gather force for the same lunatic tirade you sitting there he would say you philip you arent a stanier why dont you get a bitch to your kennel and rear a mongrel or two you heavyfaced lout you cant breed you cant drink you can do nought but grow bleareyed over a pack of printed rubbish there was hester she married some sort of sweeper and barren she is at that i take blame to myself there if only i had smacked her face a dozen times instead of once id have tamed her she would have come to heel and the third of you ronald there with your soapyfaced slut of a wife youd be more in your place behind a drapers counter than here at stanier and they tell me that theres no news yet that youre going to give an heir to the place heir good god ronald had less patience than his brother he would have drunk pretty stiffly by now and he would bang the table and make the glasses jingle now you keep a civil tongue in your head father he said and ill do the same for you a pretty figure you cut with your garter and your costermonger talk its your own nest youre fouling and youve fouled it well there was never yet a stanier till you who took to a bathchair and a bib and a man to feed him when he couldnt find the way to his own mouth here steady ronald philip would say im steadier than that palsystricken jelly there said ronald if he leaves me alone i leave him alone it isnt i who begin but if you or he think im going to sit here and listen to his guttertalk youre in error he left his seat with a final reversal of the decanter and banged out of the room then as likely as not the old man would begin to whimper though apparently he did all he could to make residence at stanier impossible for his sons he seemed above all to fear that he would succeed in doing so your brother gets so easily angered with me he would say im sure i said nothing to him that a loving father shouldnt go after him phil and ask him to come back and drink a friendly glass with his poor father i think you had better let him be sir said philip he didnt relish what you said of his wife and his childlessness well i meant nothing i meant nothing maynt a father have a bit of chaff over his wine with his sons as for his wife im sure shes a very decent woman and if it was that which offended him theres that diamond collar my lady wears bid her take it off and give it to janet as a present from me then we shall be all comfortable again i should leave it alone for tonight said philip you can give it her tomorrow wont you come and have your rubber of whist his eye would brighten again at that for in his day he had been a great player and if he went to the cards straight from his wine which for a little made order in the muddle and confusion of his brain he would play a hand or two with the skill that had been an instinct with him his tortoiseshell kitten must first be brought him for that was his mascotte which reposed on his lap and for the kitten there was a saucerful of chopped fish to keep it quiet it used to drag fragments from the dish on to the riband of the garter and eat from there he could not hold the cards himself and they were arranged in a stand in front of him and his attendant pulled out the one to which he pointed a quivering finger if the cards were not in his favour he would chuck the kitten off his knee drown it the devils in it he would mumble then before long the gleam of lucidity rent in his clouds by the wine would close up again and he would play with lamentable lunatic cunning revoking and winking at his valet and laughing with pleasure as the tricks were gathered at the end he would calculate his winnings and insist on their being paid they were returned to the loser when his valet had abstracted them from his pocket any attempt to move him from stanier had to be abandoned for it brought on such violent agitation that his life was endangered if it were persisted in and even if it had been possible to certify him as insane neither philip nor his brother nor his wife would have consented to his removal to a private asylum for some impregnable barrier of family pride stood in the way nor perhaps would it have been easy to obtain the necessary certificate he had shown no sign of homicidal or suicidal mania and it would have been hard to have found any definite delusion from which he suffered he was just a very terrible old man partly paralytic who got drunk and lucid together of an evening he certainly hated philip but philips habits and philips celibacy were the causes of that he cheated at cards but the sane have been known to do likewise indeed it seemed as if after their long and glorious noon in which as by some joshuastroke the sun had stayed his course in the zenith that the fortunes of the staniers were dipping swiftly into the cold of an eternal night in mockery of that decline their wealth mounting to more prodigious heights resembled some pharaohs pyramid into which so soon a handful of dust would be laid in the last decade of the nineteenth century the long leases of the acres which a hundred years ago had been let for building land at brighton were tumbling in and in place of groundrents the houses came into their possession while with true stanier luck this coincided with a revival of brighton as a wateringplace fresh lodes were discovered in their cornish properties and the wave of gold rose ever higher bearing on it those who seemed likely to be the last of the name philip now a little over forty years old was still unmarried ronald ten years his junior was childless and lady hester brayton now a widow had neither son nor daughter to carry on the family already it looked as if the vultures were coming closer across the golden sands of the desert on which these survivors were barrenly gathered for an acute and farseeing solicitor had unearthed a family of labourers living in a cottage in the marsh between broomhill and appledore who undoubtedly bore the name of stanier and he had secured from the father who could just write his name a dulyattested document to the effect that if jacob spurway succeeded in establishing him in the family possessions and honours he would pay him the sum of a hundred thousand pounds in ten annual instalments that being made secure it was worth while secretly to hunt through old wills and leases and he had certainly discovered that colin stanier t elizabeth had a younger brother ronald who inhabited a farm not far from appledore and had issue that issue could for the most part be traced or at any rate firmly inferred right down to the present then came a most gratifying search through the chronicles and pedigrees of the line now in possession and explore as he might john spurway could find no collateral line still in existence straight down from father to son as we have seen ran the generations till the day of lady hester brayton no daughter had been born to an earl of yardley and the line of such other sons as the lords of stanier begot had utterly died out the chance of establishing this illiterate boor seemed to mr jacob spurway a very promising one and he not only devoted to it his time and his undoubted abilities but even made a few clandestine and judicious purchases there arrived for instance one night at the stanier cottage a wholly genuine elizabethan chair in extremely bad condition which was modestly placed in the kitchen behind the door a tigerware jug found its way to the high chimneypiece and got speedily covered with dust and a muchtarnished elizabethan sealtop spoon made a curious addition to the britannia metal equipage for the drinking of tea but if this drab and barren decay of the direct line of colin stanier roused the interest of mr spurway it appeared in the year to interest others not less ingenious and to adopt the obsolete terms of the legend it really looked as if satan remembered the bond to which he was party and bestirred himself to make amends for his forgetfulness and firstwith a pang of selfreproachhe turned his attention to this poor bathchaired paralytic now so rapidly approaching his seventieth year then there was philip to consider and ronald lady hester he felt less selfreproachful about for unhampered by children and consoled for the loss of her husband by the very charming attentions of others she was in london queen of the smart bohemia which was the only court at all to her mind and was far more amusing than the garden parties at buckingham palace to which so pleasant was bohemia she was no longer invited so then just about the time that mr spurway was sending elizabethan relics to the cottage in the romney marsh there came over lord yardley a strange and rather embarrassing amelioration of his stricken state from a medical point of view he became inexplicably better though from another point of view it could be as confidently stated that he became irretrievably worse his clouded faculties were pierced by the sun of lucidity again the jerks and quivers of his limbs and his speech gave way to a more orderly rhythm and his doctor congratulated himself on the eventual success of a treatment that for twenty years had produced no effect whatever strictly speaking that treatment could be more accurately described as the absence of treatment sir thomas logan had said all along that the utmost that doctors could do was to assist nature in effecting a cure a bathchair and the indulgence of anything the patient felt inclined to do was the sum of the curative process now at last it bore professionally speaking the most gratifying fruit coherence visited his speech irrespective of the tumblers of port indeed these tumblers of port produced a normal incoherence his powerless hands began to grasp the cards again and before long he was able to perambulate the galleries through which his bathchair had so long wheeled him on his own feet with the aid of a couple of sticks every week that passed saw some new feat of convalescence and the strangeness of the physical and mental recovery touched the fringes of the miraculous but while sir thomas logan in his constant visits to stanier during this amazing recovery never failed to find some fresh and surprising testimonial to his skill he had to put away from himself with something of an effort certain qualms that insisted on presenting themselves to him it seemed even while his patients physical and mental faculties improved in a steady and ascending ratio of progress that some spiritual deterioration balanced or more than balanced this recovery hard and cruel lord yardley had been before the stroke had fallen on himwithout compassion without human affectionnow in the renewal of his vital forces these qualities blazed into a conflagration and it was against philip above all others that their heat and fury were directed while his father was helpless philip had staunchly remained with him sharing with his mother and with ronald and his wife the daily burden of companionship but now there was something intolerable in his fathers lucid and concentrated hatred of him daily now lord yardley would come into the library where philip was at his books in order to glut his passion with proximity he would take a chair near philips and under pretence of reading would look at him in silence with lips that trembled and twitching fingers once or twice goaded by philips steady ignoring of his presence he broke out into speeches of hideous abuse the more terrible because it was no longer the drunken raving of a paralytic but the considered utterance of a clear and hellish brain acting on the great doctors advice philip without saying a word to his father made arrangements for leaving stanier he talked the matter over with that marble mother of his and they settled that he would be wise to leave england for the time being if his father as might so easily happen got news of him in london or in some place easily accessible the awful law of attraction which his hatred made between them might lead to new developments the more prudent thing was that he should efface himself altogether italy to one of philips temperament appeared an obvious asylum but beyond that his whereabouts was to be left vague so that his mother without fear of detection in falsehood could say that she did not know where he was she would write him news of stanier to some forwarding agency in rome with which he would be in communication and he would transmit news of himself through the same channel one morning before the house was astir philip came down into the great hall terrible as these last years had been rising to this climax which had driven him out it was with a bleeding of the heart that he left the home that was knitted into his very being and beat in his arteries he would not allow himself to wonder how long it might be before his return it did not seem possible that in his fathers lifetime he should tread these floors again and in the astounding rejuvenation that there had come over lord yardley who could say how long this miracle of restored vitality might work its wonders as he moved towards the door a ray of early sunlight struck sideways on to the portrait of colin stanier waking it to another day of its imperishable youth it illumined too the legendary parchment let into the frame by some curious effect of light the writing seemed to philip for one startled moment to be legible and distinct chapter iii one morning within a month of his departure from stanier philip was coming slowly up from his bathing and basking on the beach pleasantly fatigued agreeably hungry and stupefied with content he had swum and floated in the warm crystal of the sea diving from deepwater rocks into the liquid caves where the sunlight made a shifting net of luminous scribbles over the jewelled pebbles he had lain with halfshut eyes watching the quivering of the hot air over the white bank of shingle with the sun warm on his drying shoulders and penetrating it seemed into the marrow of his bones and illuminating the very hearth and shrine of his spirit the hours had passed but too quickly and now he was making his leisurely way through vineyards and olivefarms back to the road where a little jingling equipage would be waiting to take him up to his villa on the hill above the town of capri on one side of the path was a sunflecked wall where in the pools of brightness lizards lay as immobile as the stones themselves the edges of these pools of light bordered by continents of bluish shadow wavered with the slight stirring of the olive trees above them through the interlacement of these boughs he caught glimpses of the unstained sky and the cliffs that rose to the island heights on the other side the olive groves declined towards the edge of the cliff and through their branches the sea doubly tinged with the skys blueness was not less tranquil than the ether presently still climbing upwards he emerged from the olive groves while the vineyards in plots and terraces followed the outline of the hill mingled with them were orchards of lemon trees bearing the globes of the young green fruit together with flower and leaf and flower and fruit alike reeked of an inimitable fragrance there were pomegranates bearing crimson flowers thick and waxlike against the wall of an ingle house that bordered the narrow path a riot of morningglory was new there every day with fresh unfoldings of blown blue trumpets out of the open door came an inspiriting smell of frying and on the edge of the weatherstained balcony were rusty petroleum tins in which carnations bloomed a space of level plateau with grass already bleached yellow by this spell of hot weather crowned the hill and again he descended between lizardtenanted walls through vineyards and lemon groves his rickety little carriage was waiting the horse with a smart pheasants feather erect on its head the driver with a carnation stuck behind his ear the harness for the sake of security was supplemented with string the whip cracked the horse tossed its pheasants feather and jingled its bells and followed by a cloud of dust philip creaked away up the angled road musing and utterly content he could scarcely believe as the little equipage ambled up the hill that the individual known by his name and wearing his clothes who had lived darkly like a weevil in that joylessness of stately gloom was the same as this sunsteeped sprawler in the creaking carriage he had come out of a nightmare of tunnel into the wholesome and blessed day and was steeped in the colour of the sun it was but a few weeks ago that without anticipation of anything but relief from an intolerable situation he had stolen out of stanier but swift ons of evolution had passed over him since then there was not more difference between the darkness of those english winter days that had brooded in the halls and galleries of stanier and this caressing sun that pervaded sea and sky than there was between his acceptance of life then and his embrace of life now now it was enough to be alive the very conditions of existence spelled content and at the close of every day he would have welcomed a backward shift of the hours so that he might have that identical day again instead of welcoming the close of each day in the assurance of that identical day not coming again there would be others but from the total sum one unit had been subtracted it had perished it had dropped into the well of years philip had no need to ask himself what constituted the horror of those closed years for it was part of his consciousness which called for no catechism that it was his fathers existence just the fact of him distilled the poison thick as dew on a summer night which made them thus he had to the full the stanier passion for the home itself but as long as his father lived the horror of the man so pervaded the place so overrode all other sentiments with regard to it that he could not think of the one apart from the other for hatred acid and corrosive grew like some deadly mildew on the great galleries and the high halls it was no mere passive thing an absence of love or affection but a positive and prosperous growth a henbane or a deadly nightshade sprouted and flowered and flourished there dwelling on it even for the toss of his horses head as they clattered off the dusty road on to the paved way outside the town philip felt his hands grow damp he had come straight through to rome and plunged himself as in a cooling bath in the beauty and magnificence of the antique city he had wandered through galleries had sat in the incensefragrant dusk of churches had spent long hours treading the vestiges of the past content for the time to feel the spell of healing which the mere severing himself from stanier had set at work but soon through that spell there sounded a subtler incantation coming not from the haunts of men nor the achievements of the past but from the lovely heart of the lovely land itself which had called forth these manifestations he had drifted down to naples and across the bay to the enchanted island hanging like a cloud on the horizon where the sea and sky melted into each other as yet he wanted neither man nor woman the exquisite physical conditions of the southern summer were in themselves the restoration he needed with a truce from all human entanglements potent indeed was their efficacy they ran through his heart like wine rejuvenating and narcotic together and today he could scarcely credit that a fortnight of eventless existence had flowed over him in one timeless moment of magic of animal unreflecting happiness curious good fortune in elementary material ways had attended him on the very day of his arrival as he strolled out from his hotel in the dusk up the moonstruck hill above the town he had paused beneath the white garden wall of a villa abutting on the path and even as in imagination he pictured the serenity and aloofness of it his eye caught a placard easily legible in the moonlight that it was to let and with that came the certainty that he was to be the lessee next morning he made inquiry and inspection of its cool whitewashed rooms tiled floored and vaulted below it lay its terraced garden smothered with neglected rosetrees and from the house along a short paved walk there ran a vinewreathed pergola and a great stone pine stood sentinel a capable contadina with her daughter were easily found who would look after him and within twentyfour hours he had transferred himself from the germaninfested hotel soon in answer to further inquiries he learned that at the end of his tenure a purchase might be effected and the negotiations had begun today for the first time he found english news awaiting him and the perusal of it was like the sudden and vivid recollection of a nightmare lord yardley so his mother wrote was getting more capable every day he had even gone out riding he had asked no questions as to where philip had gone or when he would return but he had given orders that his name should not be mentioned and once when she had inadvertently done so there had been a great explosion of anger otherwise life went on as usual sir thomas had paid a visit yesterday and was very much gratified by his examination of his patient and said he need not come again unless any unfavourable change occurred for another month his father sat long after dinner and the games of whist were often prolonged till midnight philip skimmed through the frozen sheets his mother was glad he was well and that seabathing suited him it was very hot was it notbut he always liked the heat the hay had been got in which was lucky because the barometer had gone down he crumpled them up with a little shudder as at a sudden draught of chilled air there was another from his sister hester so youve run away like me so the iceberg tells me she wrote i only wonder that you didnt do it long ago this is just to congratulate you she says too that father is ever so much better which i think is a pity why should he be allowed to get better mother says it is like a miracle and if it is im sure i know who worked it really phil i am delighted that you have awoke to the fact that there is a world outside staniergood lord if stanier was all the world what a hell it would be you used never to be happy away from the place i remember but i gather from what mother says that it became absolutely impossible for you to stop there theres a blight on it phil sometimes i almost feel that i believe in the legend for though its twenty years since i made my skip if ever i have a nightmare it is that i dream that i am back there and that my father is pursuing me over those slippery floors in the dusk but i shall come back there if youll allow me when hes dead its he who makes the horror once again philip felt a shiver of gooseflesh and sending his sisters letter to join the other in the empty grate strolled out into the hot stillness of the summer afternoon and he hailed the sun like one awakening from such a nightmare as hester had spoken of all his life he had been sluggish in the emotions looking at life in the mirror of other mens minds getting book knowledge of it only in a cloistered airlessness not experiencing it for himselfa reader of travels and not a voyager but now with his escape from stanier had come a quickening of his pulses and that awakening which had brought home to him the horror of his father had brought to him also a passionate sense of the loveliness of the world regret for the wasted years of drowsy torpor was there also here was he already on the meridian of life with so small a store of remembered raptures laid up as in a granary for his old age when his arm would be too feeble to ply the sickle in the ripe cornfields a man when he could no longer reap must live on what he had gathered without that he would face hungry and empty years when the fire within began to burn low and he could no longer replenish it it was ill for him if the house of his heart could not warm itself with the glow that experience had already given him he must gather the grapes of life and tread them in his winepress squeezing out the uttermost drop so that the ferment and sunshine of his vintage would be safe in cellar for the comforting of the days when in his vineyard the leaves were rotting under wintry skies too many days had passed for him unharvested that evening after his dinner he strolled down in the warm dusk to the piazza the day had been a festa in honour of some local saint and there was a show of fireworks on the hill above the town and in consequence the piazza and the terrace by the funicular railway which commanded a good view of the display was crowded with the young folk of the island rockets aspired and bursting in bouquets of feathered fiery spray dimmed the stars and illumined the upturned faces of handsome boys and swiftripening girlhood eager and smiling mouths started out of the darkness as the rockets broke into flower eager and young and ready for love and laughter fading again and vanishing as the illumination expired it was this garden of young faces that occupied philip more than the fireworks these shifting groups that formed and reformed smiling and talking to each other in the intervals of darkness the bubbling ferment of intimate companionship frothed round him and suddenly he seemed to himself to be incapsulated an insoluble fragment floating or sinking in this heady liquor of life there came upon him sharp and unexpected as a blow dealt from behind a sense of complete loneliness every one else had his companion here was a group of chattering boys there of laughing girls here the sexes were mingled elder men and women had a quieter comradeship they had passed through the fermenting stage it might be but the wine of companionship with who knew what memories were in solution there was theirs still all these rapturous days he had been alone and had not noticed it now his solitariness crystallised into loneliness with a final sheaf of rockets the display came to an end and the crowd began to disperse homewards the withdrawal took the acuteness from philips ache for he had no longer in front of his eyes the example of what he missed his hunger was not whetted by the spectacle of food the steps of the last loiterers died away and soon he was left alone looking out over the vineclad slope of the steep hill down to the marina warm buffets of air wandered up from the land that had lain all day in its bath of sunlight rippling round him like the edge of some spent wave but already the dew moistening the drought of day was instilling into the air some nameless fragrance of damp earth and herbs refreshed beyond lay the bay conjectured rather than seen and twenty miles away a thin necklet of light showed where naples lay stretched and smouldering along the margin of the sea if a wish could have transported philip there he would have left the empty terrace to see with what errands and adventures the city teemed even as the brain teems with thoughts and imaginings into the impersonal seduction of the summer night some human element of longing had entered born of the upturned faces of boys and girls watching the rockets and sinking back brighteyed and eager into the cover of darkness even as the sword slips into its sheath again youth in the matter of years was already past for him but in his heart until now youth had not yet been born no individual face among them all had flown a signal for him but collectively they beckoned it was among such that he would find the lights of his hearts harbour shining across the barren water and kindling desire in his eyes it was not intellectual companionship that he sought nor the unity and absorption of love for philip was true stanier and had no use for love but he craved for youth for beauty for the southern gaiety and friendliness for the upleap and the assuagement of individual desire till middleage he had lived without the instincts of youth his tree was barren of the golden fruits of youths delight now sudden as his change of life his belated springtime flooded him it was in naples that he found her in the studio of an acquaintance he had made when he was there first and before midsummer rosina viagi was established in the villa she was half english by birth and in her gold hair heavy as the metal and her blue eyes she shewed her mothers origin but her temperament was of the southfierce and merry easily moved to laughter and as easily to squalls of anger that passed as swiftly as an april shower and melted into sunlight again she so enthralled his senses that he scarcely noticed for those first months the garish commonness of her mind it scarcely mattered he scarcely heeded what she said so long as it was those full lips which formed the silly syllables she was greedy and he knew it in the matter of money but his generosity quite contented her and he had got just what he had desired one who entirely satisfied his passion and left his mind altogether unseduced then with the fulfillment of desire came the leanness that follows a swift inevitable nemesis on the heels of the accomplishment of an unworthy purpose he had dreamed of the gleam of romance in those readings of his at stanier and awoke to find but a smouldering wick and before the summer was dead he knew he was to become a father in the autumn the island emptied of its visitors and rosina could no longer spend her evenings at the caf or on the piazza with her countrywomen casting envious glances at her toilettes and the men boldly staring at her beauty she was genuinely fond of philip but her native gaiety demanded the distraction of crowds and she yawned in the long evenings when the squalls battered at the shutters and the panes streamed with the fretful rain but are we going to stop here all the winter she asked one evening as she gathered up the piquet cards it gets very melancholy you go for your great walks but i hate walking you sit there over your book but i hate reading philip laughed am i to clap my hands at the rain he said and say stop at once rosina wearies for the sun she perched herself on the arm of his chair a favourite attitude for her supplications no my dear she said all your money will not do that besides even if the rain obeyed you and the sun shone there would still be nobody to look at me but you can do something and whats that just a little apartment in naples she said it is so gay in naples even if the sirocco blows or if the tramontana bellows there are the theatres there are crowds there is movement i cannot be active but there i can see others being active there are fresh faces in the street there is gaiety oh i hate towns said philip she got up and began to speak more rapidly you think only of yourself she said i mope here i am miserable i feel like one of the snails on the wall crawling crawling and going into a dusty crevice that is not my nature i hate snails except when they are cooked and then i gobble them up and wipe my mouth and think no more of them you can read your book in a town just as well as here and you can take a walk in a town ah do philip suddenly and unexpectedly philip found himself picturing his days here alone without rosina he did not consciously evoke the image it presented itself to him from outside himself the island had certainly cast its spell over him just to be here to awake to the sense of its lotusland tranquillity and to go to sleep knowing that a fresh eventless day would welcome him made him content he could imagine himself now alone in this plain vaulted room with the storm swirling through the stonepine outside and the smell of burning wood on the hearth without desiring rosinas presence well it might be done he said we could have a little nook in naples if you liked i dont say that i should always be there rosinas eyes sparkled no no that would be selfish of me she said you would come over here for a week when you wished as you are so fond of your melancholy island she stopped and her italian suspiciousness came to the surface you are not thinking of leaving me she asked of course i am not he said impatiently you imagine absurdities i have heard of such absurdities are you sure yes you silly baby said he she recovered her smiles i trust you she said yes where were we you will come over here when you want your island and you will be there when you want me oh philip do you promise me her delicious gaiety invaded her again and she sat herself on the floor between his knees oh you are kind to me she said i hope your father will live for ever and then you will never leave me there is no one so kind as you we will have a flat will we not i know just such an one that looks on to the castello dovo and all day the carriages go by and we will go by too and look up at our home and wonder who are the happy folk who live there and every one who sees me will envy me for having a man who loves me and we will go to the restaurants where there are lights and glitter and the band plays and i will be happier than the day is long let us go over tomorrow i will tell maria to pack it was just this impetuous prattling childishness which had enthralled him at first and even while he told himself now how charming it was he knew that he found it a weariness and an unreality the same rosina ten minutes before would be in a gale of temper then some ten minutes after under a cloud of suspicious surmise his own acceptance of her proposal that they would be together at times at times separate was in reality a vast relief to him yet chequering that relief was that curious male jealousy that the woman whom he had chosen to share his nights and days should contemplate his absences with his own equanimity while he reserved to himself the right of not being utterly devoted to her he claimed her devotion to him it had come to that it was not that his heart beat to another tune his eyes did not look elsewhere simply the swiftlyconsumed flame of passion was now consciously dying down and while he took no responsibility for his own cooling he resented her share in it he treated her in fact as staniers had for many generations treated their wives but she had an independence which none of those unfortunate females had enjoyed he had already made a handsome provision for her and he was quite prepared to take a full financial responsibility for his fatherhood yet while he recognised how little she was to him he resented the clear fact of how little he was to her he got up you shall have it all your own way darling he said well go across to naples tomorrow well find a flatthe one you know ofand you shall see the crowds and the lights again ah you are adorable said she i love you too much philip he established her to her hearts content and through the winter divided the weeks between naples and the island she had no hold on his heart and on his mind none but at any rate he desired no one else but her and as the months went by there grew in him a tenderness which had not formed part of the original bond often her vanity her childish love of ostentation a certain querulousness also which had lately exhibited itself made him long for the quiet solitude across the bay sometimes she would be loth to let him go sometimes in answer to her petition he would put off his departure and then before the evening was over she would have magnified some infinitesimal point of dispute into a serious disagreement have watered it with her tears sobbed out that he was cruel to her that she wished he had gone instead of remaining to make himself a tyrant he shared her sentiments on that topic and would catch the early boat next morning and yet even as with a sigh of relief he settled himself into his chair that night by the open fireplace and congratulated himself on this recapture of tranquillity he would miss something she was not there to interrupt him to scold him to rage at him but she had other moods as well when she beguiled and enchanted him that was no deepseated spell nor had it ever been its ingredients were but her physical grace and the charm of her spontaneous gaiety perhaps next morning he would get a long scrawled letter from her saying that he had been a brute to leave her that she had not been out all day but had sat and cried and at that he would count himself lucky in his solitude and even while he felt as dry as sand towards her there would come seething up through its aridity this moist hidden spring of tenderness he had made just such an escape from her whims and wilfulness one day towards the end of february but before the evening was half over he had tired of this solitude that he had sought his book did not interest him and he felt too restless to go to bed restlessness at any rate might be walked off and he set out to tramp and tranquillise himself the moon was near to its full the night warm and windless and the air alert with the coming of the spring over the garden beds hung the veiled fragrance of wallflowers and freezias and their scent in some subtle way suggested her presence had she been there she would in the mood in which he had left her have jangled and irritated him but if a wish would have brought her he would have wished it he let himself out of the garden gate and mounted the steep path away from the town thinking by brisk movement to dull and fatigue himself and to get rid of the thought of her but like a wraith noiseless and invisible she glided along by him and he could not shake her off she did not scold him or nag at him she was gay and seductive with the lure of the springtime tingling about her and beckoning him soon he found himself actively engaged in some sort of symbolic struggle to elude her and taking a rough and steeper path thought that he would outpace her here the way lay over an uncultivated upland and as he pounded along he drank in the intoxicating ferment of the vernal night the earth was dewdrenched and the scent of the aromatic plants of the hillside served but as a whet to his restless thoughts and still hurry as he might he could not escape from her and from a certain decision that she seemed to be forcing on him finally regardless of the dew and exhausted with the climb he sat down and began to think it out they had been together now for eight months and though she often wearied and annoyed him he could not imagine going back to the solitary life which when first he came to capri had been so full of enchantment they had rubbed and jarred against each other but never had either of them loose though the tie had been considered leaving each other they had been absolutely faithful and were indeed married in all but the testimony of a written contract it had been understood from the first that on his fathers death philip would take up the reins of his government at home leaving her in all material matters independent and well off and in all probability her dowry cancelling her history would enable her to make a favourable marriage but though that had been settled between them philip found now as he sat with her wraith still silent still invisible but insistently present that not till this moment had he substantially pictured himself without her or seen himself looking out for another woman to be mother of his children he could see himself going on quarrelling with rosina and wanting her again but the realisation of his wanting any one else was beyond him on the other hand his father in this miraculous recovery of his powers might live for years and who knew whether long before his death both he and rosina might not welcome it as a deliverance from each other but not less impossible also than the picturing of himself without rosina was the imagining of her installed as mistress at stanier try as he might he could not make visible to himself so unrealisable a contingency rosina at stanier rosina yet so soon she would be the mother of his child the moon had sunk and he must grope his way down the hillside which he had mounted so nimbly in the hope of escape from the presence that hovered by him all night it was with him waiting patiently but inexorably for the answer he was bound to give he could not drive it away he could not elude it there arrived for him next morning an iced budget from his mother all went on as usual with that refrigerator there had been a gale and four elm trees had been blown down easter was early this year she hoped for the sake of the holidaymakers that the weather would be fine it was odd to hear of the warm suns and the sitting out in the evening was he not tired of his solitary life philip skimmed his way rapidly through these frigidities and then suddenly found himself attending i have kept my great news to the end his mother wrote and it makes us all your father especially very happy we hope before march is over that ronald will have an heir janet is keeping very well and your father positively dotes on her now the effect on him is most marked he certainly feels more kindly to you now that this has come for the other day he mentioned your name and wondered where you were it was not having a grandchild that was responsible for a great deal of his bitterness towards you for you are the eldest philip swept the letter off the table and sat with chin supported in the palms of his hands staring out of the open window through which came the subtle scent of the wallflower as a traveller traces his journey so spreading the situation out like a map before him he saw how his road ran direct and uncurving last night for all his groping and searching he could find no such road marked there was but a track and it was interrupted by precipitous unnegotiable places by marshes and quagmires through which no wayfarer could find a path but with the illumination of this letter it was as if an army of roadmakers had been busy on it over the quagmire there was a buttressed causeway through the precipitous cliffs a cutting had been blasted there was yet time he would marry rosina out of hand and his offspring not his brothers should be heir of stanier the marriage making their union valid and legitimatising the child that should soon be born took place on the first of march at the english consulate and a week later came the news that a daughter had been born to his sisterinlaw on the tenth of the same month rosina gave birth to twins both boys there was no need for any riband to distinguish them for never had two more dissimilar pilgrims come forth for their unconjecturable journey the elder was dark like philip and unlike the most of his fathers family the other blueeyed like his mother had a head thickdowered with bright pale gold never since the days of colin stanier founder of the race and bargainer in the legend had gold and blue been seen together in a stanier and colin said philip to himself he shall be during that month the shuttle of fate flew swiftly backwards and forwards in the loom of the future thirtysix years had passed since ronald the latest born of his race had come into life ten years more had passed over philips head before within a week of his brother and within a fortnight of his marriage he saw the perpetuation of his blood and the shuttle so long motionless for the staniers did not pause there in its swift and sudden weavings at stanier that evening ronald and his father sat long over their wine the disappointment at ronalds first child being a girl was utterly eclipsed in lord yardleys mind by the arrival of an heir at all and he had eaten heavily in boisterous spirits and drunk as in the days when wine by the tumblerful was needed to rouse him into coherent speech but now no attendant was needed to hold his glass to his lips he was as free of movement as a normal man well have another bottle yet ronnie he said therell be no whist tonight for your mother will have gone upstairs to see after janet ring the bell will you the fresh bottle was brought and he poured himself out a glassful and passed it to his son by god i havent been so happy for years as ive been this last week he said youve made a beginning now my boy youll have a son next and to think of philip mouldering away all this time hes fortysix now hell not get in your way a useless fellow philip sitting like a crow all day in the library like some old barren bird i should like to have seen his face when he got the news but ill write him tomorrow myself and say that if he cares to come home ill treat him civilly poor old phil said ronald do write to him father i daresay he would like to come back he has been gone a year come may lord yardley helped himself again his hand was quite steady but his face was violently flushed every night now since the birth of ronalds baby he had drunk deeply and but for this heightened colour more vivid tonight than usual the wine seemed scarcely to produce any effect on him all day now for a week he had lived in this jovial and excited mood talking of little else than the event which had so enraptured him and janets but thirty yet he went on forgetting again about philip and she comes of a fruitful stock the armitages arent like us they run to quantity not that i find fault with the quality but a boy ronald a servant had come in with a telegram which he presented to lord yardley who threw it over to ronald just open it for me he said see if it requires any answer ronald drew a candle nearer him he was conscious of having drunk a good deal and the light seemed dim and veiled he fumbled over the envelope and drawing out the sheet unfolded it he stared at it with mouth fallen open its a joke he said in a loud unsteady voice its some silly joke lets have it then said his father whos the joker its from philip said he he says that hes married and that his wife has had twins todayboys lord yardley rose to his feet the flush on his face turning to purple then without a word he fell forward across the table crashing down among the glasses and decanters a fortnight after the birth of the twins rosina who till then had been doing well developed disquieting symptoms with high temperature her illness declared itself as scarlet fever and on the th of april she died surely in those spring weeks there had been busy superintendence over the fortunes of the staniers philip till lately outcast from his home and vagrant bachelor had succeeded to the great property and the honours and titles of his house two lusty sons were his and there was no rosina to vex him with her petulance and common ways all tenderness that he had had for her was diverted into the persons of his sons and in particular of colin in england in this month of april the beloved home awaited the coming of its master with welcome and rejoicing book two chapter i colin stanier had gone straight from the tenniscourt to the bathingplace in the lake below the terraced garden his cousin violet only daughter of his uncle ronald had said that she would equip herself and follow him and the boy had swum and dived and dived and swum waiting for her until the dressingbell booming from the turret had made him reluctantly quit the water he was just half dry and not at all dressed when she came wretched luck she said oh colin do put something on in time said colin you neednt look im not looking but it was wretched luck mother colin wrapped a long bathtowel round himself foraged for cigarettes and matches in his coat pocket and sat down by her mother he asked oh yes mother was querulous and so she wanted some one to be querulous to couldnt she be querulous to herself asked colin no of course not you must have a partner or a dummy if youre being querulous i wasnt more than a dummy and so when she had finished the rest of it she was querulous about that she said i was unsympathetic dummies usually are said colin cigarette no thanks this one was because she wanted to come and bathe did you dive off the top step of course not no audience said colin whats the use of doing anything terrifying unless you impress somebody i would have if you had come down i should have been thrilled oh by the way raymond has just telephoned from town to say that hell be here by dinnertime hes motoring down colin considered this raymonds the only person older than myself whom i envy he said hes half an hour older than me oh i think i envy aunt hester but then i adore aunt hester i only hate raymond just because hes half an hour older than you asked the girl isnt that enough he gets everything just because of that unlucky halfhour hell get you too if youre not careful colin got up and gathered his clothes together hell have stanier he observed isnt that enough to make me detest him besides hes a boor happily father detests him too i think father must have been like raymond at his age thats the only comfort father will do the best he can for me and then theres aunt hesters money but what i want is stanier come on arent you going to dress asked violet certainly not as soon as i get to the house i shall have to undress and dress again not shoes asked she not when the dew is falling oh wet grass is lovely to the feet well skirt the terrace and go round by the lawn and why is it that you envy aunt hester asked the girl cant help it shes so old and wicked and young violet laughed thats a very odd reason for envying anybody she said whats there to envy why the fact that shes done it all said colin frowning she has done all she pleased all her life and shes just as young as ever if i wasnt her nephew she would put me under her arm just as she did her husband a thousand years ago and marry me tomorrow and then you would marry raymond andand there we would all be we would play whist together my dear those ghastly days before we were born grandfather with his garter over his worsted jacket and a kitten on his knee and grandmamma and aunt janet and your father and mine they lived here for years like that how wonderful and awful theyre just as wonderful now said violet and not quite so awful grandfather isnt here now and he must have been the ghastliest besides theres aunt hester here to tone them up and you and i if it comes to that not to mention raymond i love seeing my father try to behave nicely to raymond dead failure colin tucked his towel round him it kept slipping first from one shoulder then the other i believe raymond is falling in love with you he said hell propose to you before long your mother will back him up so will uncle ronald they would love to see you mistress here and youd like it yourself ohlike it said she she paused a moment colin you know what i feel about stanier she said i dont think anybody knows as well as you youve got the passion for it wouldnt you give anything for it to be yours look at it theres nothing like it in the world they had come up the smoothshaven grass slope from the lake and stood at the entrance through the long yewhedge that bordered the line of terraces there were no ghastly monstrosities in its clipped bastion no semblance of peacocks and spread tails to crown it it flowed downwards a steep uniform embattlement of stiff green towards the lake enclosing the straight terraces and the deep borders of flowerbeds the topmost of these terraces was paved and straight from it rose the long twostoried faade of mellow brick balustraded with the motto nisi dominus dificavit in tall letters of lead and from floor to roof it was the building of that colin stanier whose very image and incarnation stood and looked at it now so honest and secure had been the workmanship that in the three centuries which had elapsed since first it nobly rose to crown the hill above rye scarcely a stone of its facings had been repaired or a mouldering brick withdrawn it possessed even in the material of its fashioning some inexplicable immortality even as did the fortunes of its owners its mellowing had but marked their enrichment and stability their stability rivalled that of the steadfast house the sun in these long days of june had not yet quite set and the red level rays made the bricks to glow and gave a semblance as of internal fire to the attested guarantee of the motto whoever had builded he had builded well and the labour of the bricklayers was not lost a couple of years ago colin still at eton had concocted a mad freak with violet there had been a fancydress ball in the house at which he had been got up to represent his ancestral namesake as shewn in the famous holbein there the first colin appeared as a young man of twentyfive but the painter had given him the smooth beauty of boyhood and his descendant in those rich embroidered clothes might have passed for the very original and model for the portrait this then had been their mad freak violet appearing originally in the costume of old colins bride had slipped away to her room when the ball was at its height and changed clothes with her cousin she had tucked up her hair under his broadbrimmed jewelled hat he had bewigged himself and easily laced his slimness into her stiff brocaded gown and so indistinguishable were they that the boys colins friends and contemporaries had been almost embarrassingly admiring of him while her friends had found her not less forward a slip by colin in the matter of hoarse laughter at an encircling arm and an attempt at a kiss had betrayed him into forgetting his brilliant falsetto and giving the whole thing away not less like to each other now than then they stood at the entrance of the terraces he had gained perhaps a couple of inches on her in height but the piled gold of her hair and his bare feet equalised that no growth of manhood sheathed the smoothness of his cheeks they looked like replicas of one type still almost sexless in the glow of mere youth theirs was the full dower of their race health and prosperity glee and beauty and the entire absence of any moral standard faun and nymph they stood there together she in the thin blouse and white skirt of her tennisclothes he in the mere towel of his bathing he had but thrown it on anyhow without thought except to cover himself and yet the folds of it fell from his low square shoulders with a plastic perfection a hand buried in it held it round his waist tightly outlining the springing of his thighs from his body with her too even the full tennisskirt broad at the hem for purposes of activity could not conceal the exquisite grace of her figure above the blouse revealed the modelling of her arms and the scarcely perceptible swell of her breasts highbred and delicate were they in the inimitable grace of their youth what need had such physical perfection for any dower of the spirit she filled her eyes with the glow of the sunlit front and then turned to him colin its a crime she said that you arent in raymonds place i dont like raymond and yet if youre right and he means to propose to me i dont feel sure that i shall refuse him it wont be him i refuse if i do it will be stanier lord i know that said colin if i was the elder youd marry me tomorrow of course i should and cut out aunt hester and the funny thing darling is that were neither of us in love with the other we like each other enormously but we dont dote if you married aunt hester i shouldnt break my heart nor would you if i married raymond not a bit but i should think him a devilish lucky fellow she laughed so should i she said in fact i think him devilish lucky already colin if i do refuse him it will be because of you oh chuck it violet said he she nodded towards the great stately house its a big chuck she said from the far side of the house there came the sound of motorwheels on the gravel and after a moment or two the garden door at the centre of the terrace opened and raymond came out he was not more than an inch or so shorter than his brother but his broad heavy shortlegged build made him appear short and squat his eyebrows were thick and black and already a strong growth of hair fringed his upper lip while colin might have passed for a boy of eighteen still the other would have been taken for a young man of not less than twentyfive he stood there for a minute looking straight out over the terrace and the marsh below then turning his eyes he saw the others in the dusky entrance through the yewhedge and his face lit up he came towards them ive only just come he said had a puncture how are you violet all right but how late you are were all late in fact we must go and dress raymond looked up and down colins bathtowel and his face darkened again but he made a call on his cordiality hullo colin he said been bathing jolly in the water i should think very jolly said colin how long are you down for he had not meant any particular provocation in the question though he was perfectly careless as to whether raymond found it there or not he did and his face flushed well to be quite candid he said im down here for as long as i please with your permission of course how jolly said colin in a perfectly smooth voice which he knew exasperated his brother come on vi its time to dress oh theres twenty minutes yet said raymond come for a few minutes stroll vi colin paused for her answer slightly smiling and looking just above raymonds head the two always quarrelled whenever they met though perhaps quarrel is both too strong and too superficial a word to connote the smouldering enmity which existed between them and which the presence of the other was sufficient to wreathe with little flapping flames envy as black as hell and as deep as the sea existed between them and there was no breath too light to blow it into incandescence raymond envied colin for absolutely all that colin was for his skin and his slimness his eyes and his hair and to a degree unutterably greater for the winning smile the light ingratiating manner that he himself so miserably lacked even for a certain brusque heedlessness on colins part which was interpreted in his case into the mere unselfconsciousness of youth in the desire to please others raymond held himself to be at least the equal of his brother yet where his efforts earned for him but a tepid respect colin would weave an enchantment if raymond made some humorous contribution to the conversation glazed eyes and perfunctory comment would be all his wages whereas if colin eager and careless had made precisely the same offering he would have been awarded attention and laughter colin on the other hand envied his brother not for anything he was but for everything he had theirs was no superficial antagonism the graces of address and person are no subjects for light envy nor yet the sceptred fist of regal possessions that fist was raymonds all would be his even violet perhaps stanier certainly would be at this moment the antagonism flowered over violets reply would she go for a stroll with raymond or wouldnt she colin cared not a blade of grass which she actually did it was her choice that would feed his hatred of his brother or make him chuckle over his discomfiture for an infinitesimal moment he diverted his gaze from just over raymonds head to where a tiny angle away her eyes were level with his he shook his head ever so slightly some drop of water perhaps had lodged itself from his diving in his ear oh we shall all be late said she and uncle philip hates our being late only twenty minutes did you say i must rush hair you know she scudded off along the paved terrace without one glance behind her want a stroll raymond said colin i havent got to undress only to dress i neednt go for five minutes yet raymond had seen the headshake and colins subsequent application of the palm of a hand to his ear was a transparent device colin he made sure meant him to see that just as certainly as he meant violet to do so the success of it enraged him and not less the knowledge that it was meant to enrage him colins hand so skilfully so carelessly laid these traps which silkenly gripped him he could only snarl when he was caught and even to snarl was to give himself away oh thanks very much he said determined not to snarl but after all vis right father hates us being late how is he i havent seen him yet ever so cheerful said colin does he know you are coming by the way not unless vi has told him i telephoned to her pleasant surprise said colin well if you dont want to stroll i think ill go in vis delighted that youve come once again raymonds eye lit up is she he asked didnt you think so said colin standing first on one foot and then on the other as he slipped on his tennis shoes to walk across the paving of the terrace there had been no break since the days of colins grandfather in the solemnity of the ceremonial that preceded dinner now as then the guests if there were any or if not the rest of the family were still magnificently warned of the approach of the great hour and assembling in the long gallery which adjoined the diningroom waited for the advent of lord yardley that piece of ritual was like the canon of the mass invariable and significant it crystallised the centuries of the past into the present dinner was the function of the day dull it might be but central and canonical and the centre of it all was the entrance of the head of the family he would not appear till all were ready his presence made completion and the staniers moved forward by order so when the majordomo had respectfully enfolded the flock in the long gallery he took his stand by the door into the diningroom that was the signal to lord yardleys valet who waited by the door at the other end of the gallery which led into his masters rooms he threw that open and from it punctual as the cuckoo in the clock out came lord yardley and every one stood up but in the present reign there had been a slight alteration in the minor ritual of the assembling for colin was almost invariably late and the edict had gone forth while he was but yet fifteen and newly promoted to a seat at dinner that master colin was not to be waited for the majordomo must regard his jewelled flock as complete without him he with a sorry father took his vacant place when he was ready and his fathers grim face would soften into a smile raymonds unpunctuality was a different matter and he had amended this weakness tonight there were no guests and when the majordomo took his stand at the diningroom door to fling it open on the remote entry of lord yardley from the far end of the gallery all the family but colin were assembled lord yardleys mother now over eighty white and watchful and bloodless had been as usual the first to arrive and leaning on her stick had gone to her chair by the fireplace in which upright and silent she waited during these canonical moments she always came to dinner though not appearing at other meals for she breakfasted and lunched in her own rooms where all day except for a drive in the morning she remained invisible now she held up her white hand to shield her face from the fire for whatever the heat of the evening there was a smouldering log there for incense ronald stanier sat opposite her heavy and baggyeyed breathing sherry into the evening paper his wife the querulous janet was giving half an ear to raymonds account of his puncture and inwardly marvelling at lady hesters toilet undeterred by the weight of her sixty years she had an earlyvictorian frock of pink satin high in the waist and of ample skirt on her undulated wig of pale golden hair the colour and lustre of which had not suffered any change of dimness since the day when she ran away with her handsome young husband she wore a wreath of artificial flowers a collar of pearls encircled her throat which was still smooth and soft the dark eyebrows highly arched gave her an expression of whimsical amusement and bore out the twinkle in her blue eyes and the little upward curve at the corner of her mouth she was quite conscious of her sisterinlaws censorious gaze poor janet had always looked like a moulting hen by her stood violet who had but this moment hurried in and whose entrance was the signal for lord yardleys valet to open the door she had heard colin splashing in his bath as she came along the passage though he had just bathed then with a simultaneous uprising everybody stood old lady yardley leaned on her stick ronald put down the evening paper and raymond broke off the interesting history of his punctured wheel philip yardley went straight to his mothers chair and gave her his arm in the dusk raymond standing between him and the window was but a silhouette against the luminous sky his father did not yet know that he had arrived and mistook him for his brother colin what do you mean by being in time for dinner he said most irregular its i father said raymond oh raymond is it said lord yardley i didnt know you were here glad to see you the words were sufficiently cordial but the tone was very unlike that in which he had supposed himself to be addressing colin that was not lost on raymond for envy the most elementary of all human passions is also highly sensitive you came from cambridge asked his father when they had sat down in the same tone of studious politeness the terms over i suppose yes a week ago said raymond as he spoke he made some awkward movement in the unfolding of his napkin and upset a glass which crashed on to the floor lord yardley found himself thinking clumsy brute of course colins been here a week now he said and raymond did not miss that then philip yardley considering that he had given his son an adequate welcome said no more these family dinners were not especially in colins absence and in raymonds presence very talkative affairs old lady yardley seldom spoke at all but sat watching first one face and then another as if with secret conjectures ronald stanier paid little attention to anything except to his plate and his glass and it was usually left to violet and lady hester to carry on such conversation as there was but even they required the stimulus of colin and tonight the subdued blink of spoons on silvergilt soupplates reigned uninterrupted these had just ceased when colin appeared like a lamp brought into a dusky room sorry father he said im late you know wheres my place oh between aunt hester and violet ripping urgent private affairs colin asked his father yes terribly urgent and private bath the whole table revived a little as when the gardener waters a drooping bed of flowers but you had only just bathed said violet thats just why i wanted a bath nothing makes you so messy and sticky as a bathe and there were bits of grass between my toes and a small fragment of worm and how did they get there dear asked aunt hester violently interested because i walked up in bare feet over the grass aunt hester said colin its good for the nerves come and do it after dinner lord yardley supposed that colin had not previously seen his brother and that seeing him now did not care to notice his presence so with the same chill desire to be fair in all ways to raymond he said raymond has come colin yes father weve already embraced said he golly i dont call that soup its muck hullo granny dear i havent seen you all day good morning lady yardleys face relaxed there came on her lips some wraith of a smile colins grace and charm of trivial prattle was the only ray that had power at all to thaw the ancient frost that had so long congealed her ever since her husbands death twenty years ago she had lived some half of the year here and now she seldom stirred from stanier waiting for the end her life had really ceased within a few years of her marriage she had become then the dignified layfigure emotionless and impersonal typical of the wives of staniers and that was all that her children knew of her for them the frost had never thawed nor had she even for a moment lost its cold composure even when on the night that the news of raymonds and colins birth had come to stanier there came with it the summons that caused her husband to crash among the glasses on the table nothing and nobody except colin had ever given brightness to her orbit where like some dead moon she revolved in the cold interstellar space but at the boys salutation across the table she smiled my dear what an odd time to say good morning she said have you had a nice day colin oh ripping grandmamma said he enjoyed every minute of it thats good its a great waste of time not to enjoy her glance shifted from him to lady hester hester dear what a strange gown she said its aunt hesters goaway gown after her marriage began colin she colin said his father sharply youre letting your tongue run away with you very unusually lady yardley turned to philip you mustnt speak to colin like that dear philip she said he doesnt know about those things and i like to hear colin talk very well mother said philip colin didnt have a mother to teach him what to say and what not to say continued lady yardley you must not be harsh to colin the stimulus was exhausted and she froze into herself again colin had been perfectly well aware during this that raymond was present and that nothing of it was lost on him it would be too much to say that he had performed what he and violet called the grandmamma trick solely to rouse raymonds jealousy but to know that raymond glowered and envied was like a round of applause to him it was from no sympathy or liking for his grandmother that he thawed her thus and brought her back from her remoteness he did it for the gratification of his own power in which raymond above all was deficient like some antique bird she had perched for a moment on colins finger now she had gone back into her cage again colin chose that night to take on an air of offended dignity at his fathers rebuke and subsided into silence he knew that every one would feel his withdrawal and now even uncle ronald who with hardly less aloofness than his mother for he was buried in his glass and platter and was remote from everything except his vivid concern with food and drink tried to entice the boy out of his shell colin was pleased at this it was all salutary for raymond so youve been bathing colin he said yes uncle ronald said he pleasant in the water asked uncle ronald quite said colin aunt hester made the next attempt they were all trying to please and mollify him about that walking in the grass in bare feet she said i should catch cold at my age and what would my maid think i dont know at all aunt hester said colin very sweetly raymond cleared his throat colin was being sulky and unpleasant and he the eldest would make things agreeable again no wonder colin subsided after that very illchosen remark about aunt hester theres a wonderful stride been made in this wireless telegraphy father he said there were messages transmitted to newfoundland yesterday so i saw in the paper a good joke about it in punch a fellow said theyll be inventing noiseless thunder next there was a dead silence and then colin laughed loudly awfully good raymond he said very funny strawberries aunt hester that had hit the mark leaning forward to pull the dish towards him he saw the flush on raymonds face really as far as newfoundland said lord yardley by now the majordomo was standing by the diningroom door again and philip rose his mother got up and stood immobile and expressionless till the other women had passed out in front of her then as she went out she said exactly what she had said for the last sixty years you will like a game of whist then soon generally when the women had gone the others moved up towards the host tonight philip took up his glass and placed himself next colin the decanters were brought round and placed opposite him and he pushed them towards raymond help yourself raymond he said then he turned round in his armchair to the other boy still vexed with me colin he said quietly of course not father he said sorry i sulked but you did shut me up with such a bang well open yourself at the same place said philip rather aunt hesters dress wasnt it isnt she too divine if she ever dies which god forbid you ought to have her stuffed and dressed just like that and put in a glass case in the hall to shew how young it is possible to be when youre old but seriously do get a portrait done of her to hang here theres nothing of her in the gallery any other orders asked philip i dont think so at present oh by the way are you going to italy this year yes i think i shall go out there before long for a few weeks as usual why i thought that perhaps you would take me ive got four months vacation you see now that im at cambridge and ive never been to italy yet philip paused he was always alone in italy that was part of the spell youd get dreadfully bored colin he said i shall be at the villa in capri theres nothing to do except swim colin divined in his fathers mind some reluctance other than that which he expressed he dropped his eyes for a moment then raised them again to his fathers face merry and untroubled you dont want me to come with you father he said quite all right but why not have told me so philip looked at the boy with that expression in his face that no one else ever saw there the tenderness for another the hearts need of another which had shot into fitful flame twenty years ago had never quite been extinguished it had always smouldered there for colin ill think it over he said and turned round in his chair you were telling me something about wireless raymond he said as far as newfoundland that is very wonderful a few years ago scientists would have laughed at such an idea as at a fairytale or a superstition but the superstitions of one generation become the science of the next raymond by this time was in a state of thorough illtemper he had witnessed all the evening colins easy triumphs he had seen how colin when annoyed as he had been at his fathers rebuke went into his shell and instantly every one tried to tempt him out again just now in that lowvoiced conversation between his brother and his father he had heard his father say still vexed with me in a sort of suppliance he determined to try a manuvre that answered so well i should have said just the opposite he remarked refilling his glass i should have thought that the science and beliefs of one generation became the superstitions of the next our legend for instance that was soberly believed once philip yardley did not respond quite satisfactorily ah he said getting up well shall we be going raymond had just poured himself out a glass of port and very unfortunately he remembered a precisely similar occasion on which his father just when colin had done the same proposed an adjournment he repeated the exact words colin had used then oh you might wait till ive finished my port he said that did not produce the right effect on the previous occasion his father had said sorry old boy and had sat down again youd better follow us then said philip but dont drink any more raymond youve had as much as is good for you raymonds face blazed to be spoken to like that especially in front of his uncle and brother was intolerable he got up and pushed his replenished glass away spilling half of it instantly colin saw his opportunity and knowing fairly well what would happen he put his hand within raymonds arm in brotherly remonstrance oh i say raymond he said raymond shook him off leave me alone cant you he said angrily then he turned to his father i didnt mean to spill the wine father he said it was an accident accidents are liable to happen when one loses ones temper said philip ring the bell please there were two tables for cards laid out in the drawingroom and raymond coming in only a few seconds after the others found that without waiting for him the bridgetable had already been made up with lady hester violet his father and colin they had not given him a chance to play there and now for the next hour he was condemned to play whist with his grandmother and his uncle and aunt a dreary pastime at ten old lady yardley went dumbly to bed and there was the choice between sitting here until the bridge was over or of following uncle ronald into the smokingroom but that he found he could not do his jealousy of colin both as regards his father and as regards violet constrained him as with cords to stop and watch them and contrast their merriment with his own ensconced and sombre broodings and then there was violet herself colins conjecture had been perfectly right for in the fashion of staniers he must be considered as in the process of falling in love with her the desire for possession rather than devotion was the main ingredient in the bubbling vat and that was very sensibly present she made a ferment in his blood and though he would not have sacrificed anything which he really valued such as his prospective lordship of stanier for her sake he could not suffer the idea that she should not be his he knew too how potent in her was the stanier passion for the home and that he counted as his chief asset for he had no illusion that violet was in love with him nor was she so he thought in love with colin the two were much more like a couple of chums than lovers so he sat and watched them round the edge of the newspaper which had beguiled uncle ronalds impatience for dinner the corner where he sat was screened from the players by a large vase of flowers on the table near them and raymond felt that he enjoyed though without original intention the skulking pleasures of the eavesdropper colin as usual was to the fore just now he was dummy to his partner aunt hester who having added a pair of tortoiseshell spectacles to complete her earlyvictorian costume was feeling a shade uneasy she had just done what she most emphatically ought not to have done and was afraid that both her adversaries had perceived it colin had perceived it too otherwise the suit of clubs was deficient violet had already alluded to this oh aunt hester cried colin whats the use of pretending youve not revoked dont cling on to that last club play it and have done with it if you dont youll revoke again aunt hester still felt cunning she thought she might be able to bundle it up in the last trick but i aint got a club colin she said reverting to midvictorian speech darling aunt hester you mean havent said colin aint means arent and it isnt grammar even then though you are my aunt aint lord yardley leaning forward pulled colins hair it looked so golden and attractive it reminded him colin are you dummy or aint you he asked certainly father cant you see aunt hesters playing the hand i shouldnt call it playing myself i should call it playing at playing club please aunt hester well if youre dummy hold your tongue said lord yardley dummy isnt allowed to speak and oh those are the old rules said colin the new rules make it incumbent on dummy to talk all the time hurrah theres aunt hesters club arent it one revoke and a penalty of three tricks doubled said his father brute said colin and no honours at all oh yes fourteen to us above well played aunt hester wasnt it a pity your deal vi colin having cut the cards happened to look up at the big vase of flowers which stood close to the table as he did so there was a trivial glimmer as of some paper just stirred behind it he had vaguely thought that uncle ronald and raymond had both gone to the smokingroom but there was certainly some one there and which of the two it was he had really no idea every one else adversaries and partner was behaving as if there was no one else in the room so why not he raymonds got the hump this evening he said cheerfully he won at whistlord what a gamebecause i saw aunt janet pay him halfacrown with an extraordinarily acid expression and ask for change so as hes won at cards he will be blighted in love i expect hes had a knock from the young thing at the tobacconists in kings parade i think she likes me best father but itll be the same daughterinlaw she breathes through her nose and is marvellously genteel otherwise shes just like violet pass said violet hurrah i knew it would make you pessimistic to be called like a tobacconists philip yardley laid down his cards and actually laughed colin you low vulgar brute he said dont talk so much colin imitated raymonds voice and manner to perfection i should have said just the opposite he remarked i should have thought you wanted me to talk more and make trumps violet caught on oh you got him exactly colin she said what did he say that about go on colin said his father we shall never finish colin examined his hand three notrumps he said not one nor two but three glorious trinity there was no counterchallenge and as lord yardley considered his lead colin looked up through the vase of flowers once more there was some one there still and he got up to fetch a match from a sidetable that gave him a clearer view of what lay beyond hullo raymond he said thought youd gone to the smokingroom no just looking at the paper said raymond im going now oh but well have another rubber said colin cut in no thanks said raymond colin waited till the door had closed behind him lor he said just shut that door colin said lord yardley lady hester was thrilled about the tobacconists young thing it really would be rather a good joke if one of the boys following his fathers example married a baggage of that sort and she determined to pursue the subject with colin on some future occasion she loved such loose natural talk as he treated her to he told her all his escapades he was just such a scamp as colin the first must have been and with just such gifts and utter absence of moral sense was he endowed indeed the old legend so it seemed to her lived again in colin though couched in more modern terms it was the medival style to say that for the price of the soul satan was willing to dower his beneficiary with all material bounty and graces more modernly you said that this boy was an incorrigible young adonis who feared neither god nor devil true the lordship of stanier was not yet colins but something might happen to that grim graceless raymond how the two hated each other and how different were the exhibitions of their antagonism raymond hated with a glowering bilious secrecy that watched and brooded colin with a gay contempt a geniality almost but if the shrewd old lady hester had been asked to wager which of the two was the most dangerous to the other she would without hesitation have put her money on colin the second rubber was short but as hilarious as the first and on its conclusion lady hester hurried to bed saying that she would be a fright in the morning if she lost any more sleep violet followed her philip withdrew to his own room and colin sauntered along to the smokingroom in quest of whisky his uncle ronald was still there rapidly approaching the comatose mood of midnight which it would have been inequitable to call intoxication and silly to call sobriety raymond sprawled in a chair by the window hullo uncle ronald still up said colin youll get scolded uncle ronald lifted a sluggish eyelid hey he said oh colin is it whats the time my boy halfpast twelve said colin adding on another halfhour he wanted to get rid of his uncle and see how he stood with his brother no doubt they would have a row gobbless me said ronald i shall turn in just a spot more whisky good night boys as soon as he had gone raymond got out of his chair and placed himself where he could get his heels on the edge of the low fenderkerb he hated talking up to colin and this gave him a couple of inches i want to ask you something he said ask away said colin did you know i was in the room when you imitated me just now hadnt given a thought to it said colin its equally offensive whether you mimic me before my face or behind my back said raymond it was damned rude shall i come to you for lessons in manners asked colin what do you charge colin spoke with all the lightness of goodhumoured banter well aware that if raymond replied at all he would make some sledgehammer rejoinder he would swing a cudgel against the rapier that pricked him yet never land a blow except on the air or maybe his own foot its beastly insolence on your part said raymond and thats very polite said colin you may mimic me how and where and when you choose if its like i shall laugh if it isnt well i shall still laugh i havent got your sense of humour said raymond clearly nor violets she thought i had got you to a t you probably heard what she said from your sequestered corner behind your newspaper raymond advanced a step look here colin do you mean to imply that i was listening colin laughed and i want to ask you a question he said didnt you know that we all thought you had gone away raymond disregarded this then theres another thing what do you mean by telling father about the girl at the tobacconists you know it was nothing at all rather said colin i said so you seem to forget that i told him that i was the favourite thats the part you didnt like raymond flushed its all very well for you to say that he said but you know perfectly well that my father doesnt treat us alike things which are quite harmless in his eyes when you do them appear very different to him when im the culprit i had had a knock from a tobacconists girl had i youre a cad to have told him that quite apart from its being a lie colin laughed with irritating naturalness is this the first lesson in manners he said im beginning to see the hang of it you call the other fellow a cad and a liar about my fathers not treating us alike thats his affair but i should never dream of calling you a liar for saying that were not alike why should he treat us alike youve got a foul temper you see that doesnt add to your popularity with anybody he spoke in the same voice in which he might have told raymond that he had a speck of dust on the coat and yawned rather elaborately take care you dont rouse it said raymond why not it rather amuses me to see you in a rage oh it does does it said raymond with his voice quivering i assure you of it im having a most amusing evening thanks to you and this chat has been the pleasantest part of it pity that its so late raymond as usual had throughout the worst of these exchanges and was quite aware of it he had been illbred and abusive through his loss of temper while colin insolent though his speech and his manner had been had kept within the bounds of civil retort in his sneers and contempt in all probability he would give an account of it all to violet tomorrow and there was no need for him to embroider a strictly correct version of what had passed was quite disagreeable enough this raymond wanted to avoid in view of his desire that violet should look on him as favourably as possible whether he meant to propose to her during his visit here he hardly knew himself but certainly he wanted to be in her good books this and this alone prompted him now he hated colin all the more because he had been absolutely unable to ruffle him or pierce the fine armour of his composure but as regards violet and perhaps his father he feared him im afraid ive lost my temper colin he said and i owe you an apology for all ive said you had annoyed me by mimicking me and by telling father about that girl at cambridge colin felt that he had pulled the wings off a fly that had annoyed him by its buzzing the legs might as well follow certainly you owe me an apology he said but considering everything i dont quite know whether you are proposing to pay it raymond turned on him fiercely ah thats you all over he said oh were being quite natural said colin so much better he paused a moment now i dont want to be offensive just now he said so lets sit down and try to tolerate each other for a minute there raymond longed to be at his throat to feel his short strong fingers throttling the life out of that smooth white neck but some careless superior vitality in colin made him sit down lets face it raymond he said we loathe each other like poison and it is nonsense to pretend we dont unfortunately you are the eldest so in the end you will score however much i annoy you but put yourself in my place imagine yourself the younger with your foul temper you would probably try to kill me of course by accident but im not intending to kill you i am very reasonable you must be reasonable too but just put yourself in my place raymond shifted in the chair in which colin with a mere gesture of a finger had made him sit cant we possibly get on better together colin he said after all as you say i come into everything on my fathers death i have stanier i have the millions where you have the thousands i can be very useful to you you adore the place and i can let you come here as often and as long as you like and i can also prevent your setting foot in it if youll try to be decent to me i promise you that you shant regret it colin put his head on one side and looked at his brother with an air of pondering wonder oh that cock wont fight he said you know as well as i do that when you are master here i would sooner go to hell than come here and you would sooner go to hell than let me come perhaps ive got a dull imagination but its no use my trying to imagine that do be sensible if you could do anything to injure me at this moment when you are proposing a truce you know that you would do it but you cant you cant hurt me in any way whatever but what you do know is that i can hurt you in all sorts of ways i can poison my fathers mind about youits pretty sick already i can poison violets mind and thats none too healthy you see they both like me most tremendously and they dont very much like you its just the same at cambridge ive got fifty friends you havent got one i dare say its not your fault anyhow well call it your misfortune but you want me to do something for you in return for nothing you can do for me or perhaps nothing that you will do for me raymond frowned when he was thinking he usually frowned when colin was thinking he usually smiled if in the future there is anything i can do for you colin he said i will do it i want to be friends with you good lord isnt that reasonable were brothers colin leaned forward in his chair he was aware of the prodigious nature of what he was meaning to say give me stanier raymond he said with what father is leaving me and with what aunt hester is leaving me i can easily afford to keep it up i dont ask you for any money i just want stanier of course it neednt actually be mine but i want to live here while you live somewhere else theres the derbyshire house for instance ive got stanier in my blood if on fathers death youll do that theres nothing i wont do for you he paused i can do a good deal you know he said and i can refrain from doing a good deal the proposal was so preposterous that raymond fairly laughed instantly colin got up that sounds pleasant he said good night raymond i wouldnt have any more whisky if i were you father seemed to think youd had enough drink before the end of dinner chapter ii breakfast at stanier was a shade less stately than dinner the table was invariably laid for the complete tale of its possible consumers and a vicarious urn bubbled at the end of the board with an empty teapot in front of it in case of old lady yardley coming down to breakfast and dispensing tea she had not come down for over twenty years but the urn still awaited her ministrations on the arrival of tidings that she was having breakfast in her room the urn was taken away and if news filtered through the butler to the footman that some one else was breakfasting upstairs a place at the table was removed hot dishes above spiritlamps stood in a row on the sideboard and there remained till somebody had come down or till from the removal of knives and forks it was clear that nobody was coming but when lady hester was in the house these dishes were always sure of a partaker for after her cold bath she breakfasted downstairs as she considered her bedroom a place to sleep and dress in not to eat in the urn would have been removed by this time for lady yardleys maid would have taken her tray upstairs and for lady hester and for any one else who appeared there was brought in a separate equipage of tea or coffee hot and fresh and deposited in front of the occupied chair this morning she was the first to arrive dressed in a white coat and blouse and a jaunty little straw hat turned up at the back and decorated with pheasants feathers provision of fish and bacon was brought her and an ironed copy of a daily paper there were still four places left at the table unremoved and she promised herself a chatty breakfast raymond was the next comer but he did not much conduce to chattiness he looked heavyeyed and sulky only grunted in response to her salutation and immured himself behind the daily mail lady hester made one further attempt at sociability and asked him if he had slept well but as he had nothing to add to his no not very she considered herself free from any further obligation then there came a very welcome addition to his grievous company for colin entered through the door that opened on to the terrace flannel trousers coat and shirt open at the neck was all his costume and there was a bathing towel over his shoulder morning aunt hester he said morning raymond he paused in order to make quite sure that raymond made no response and sat down next his aunt been bathing he said hottest morning that ever was why didnt you come too aunt hester youd look like a waternymph i say what a nice hat whom are you going to reduce to despair hullo three letters how many of them are loveletters asked aunt hester archly all of course said colin theres one from cambridge thatll be the young woman in the tobacconists shop whom you told us about began aunt hester sh said colin nodding towards raymond sore subject raymond pushing back his chair could not control himself from casting one furious glance at colin and went out well thats one badtempered young man gone said lady hester severely she could understand people being thieves and liars but to fail in pleasantness and geniality was frankly unintelligible to her why does he behave like that my dear she continued he hadnt a word to chuck at me like a bone to a dog when i wished him good morning what makes him like that he aint got a bellyache has he colin as he swam in the sunshine this morning had devoted some amount of smiling reflection as to his policy with regard to raymond raymond had rejected his amazing proposal with a derisive laugh he did not think that an alliance with his brother was worth that price and he must take the consequences of his refusal violet entered at this moment that was convenient for she too could hear about the quarrel last night at one telling oh we had a row last night he said it was pitched a little higher than usual and i suppose raymonds suffering from aftereffects he was perfectly furious with me for having mimicked him and wasnt the least soothed by my saying he might mimic me as often as he pleased then i was told i was a cad and a liar for that nonsense i talked about the tobacconists after i had stood as much as i could manage i left him to his whisky and i dont imagine therell be much left of it oh i say violet did you shut the door when you came in i believe its open ill do it colin got up went to the door which was indeed ajar and looked out into the long gallery raymond it so happened was sitting in the nearest windowseat lighting his pipe colin nodded to him just shutting the door he said and drew back into the diningroom rattling and pushing the door to make sure that the latch had gone home he felt sure that what he had just said to raymond that very innocent piece of information would go home too he was just outside said colin softly returning to the breakfasttable wasnt it lucky i thought of shutting the door go on what else asked violet nothing more of course it was very awkward his having overheard what we all said at our bridge that had riled him it was best to be sure that there wouldnt be a repetition of it this morning but if people will sit behind a newspaper and a vase of flowers its difficult to be aware of their presence people ought to betray their presence in the usual manner by coughing or sneezing i shall have a thorough search of the room first before i say anything about anybody if i want to say you are an old darling aunt hester i shall look behind the coalscuttle first colin whatever his private sentiments were had an infinite lightness of touch in the expression of them he had declared not to violet alone but to raymond himself that he frankly detested him and yet there was a grace about the manner of the presentment that rendered his hatred if not laudable at any rate venial and his account of the quarrel last night was touched with the same graceful brush without overstepping the confines of truth he left the impression that he had been reasonable and gentle raymond headstrong and abusive this too was part of his policy when others were present he would make himself winningly agreeable to raymond and shew a control and an indulgence highly creditable in view of his brothers brusque ways and take no provocation at his hands that would accentuate the partisanship of the others which already was his and would deprive raymond of any lingering grain of sympathy when he and raymond were alone he would exercise none of this selfrestraint he would goad and sting him with a thousand biting darts the three strolled out presently into the gallery lady hester and violet passed raymond without speech but colin sauntered up to him coming out to play tennis presently he asked colins careful closing of the diningroom door had not been lost on his brother raymond had interpreted it just as colin wished him to and he was boiling with rage no im not said he colin turned to where violet was standing just shrugged his shoulders with a lift of the eyebrows and went on towards her without spoken comment tennis soon vi he asked well have to play a single right that will be jolly said violet in half an hour colin nodded and passed on to lady hester come out aunt hester and lets sit in the shade somewhere till vis ready its lovely outside i must have me sunshade said she or i shall spoil me complexion thatll never do said colin none of your young men will fall in love with you if you do that ill get it for you which will you have the blue one with pink ribands or the pink one with blue ribands neither you wretch said aunt hester the yaller one they found an encampment of basketchairs under the elms beyond the terrace and colin went straight to the business on which he wanted certain information this too was an outcome of his meditations in the swimmingpool i asked father to take me out to italy this summer he said and it was quite clear that he had some objection to it have you any idea what it was my dear its no use asking me said aunt hester your fathers never spoken to me about anything of the sort and he aint the sort of man to ask questions of but for all these years he has gone off alone for a month every summer perhaps he only just wants to get rid of us all for a while colin extended himself on the grass shading his eyes against the glare with his hand his ultimate goal was still too far off to be distinguished even in general outline far less in any detailed aspect he was but exploring not knowing what he should find not really knowing what he looked for perhaps thats it he said in any case it doesnt matter much but i did wonder why father seemed not to welcome the idea of my going with him he usually likes to have me with him hes devoted to italy isnt he and yet he never talks about it colin spoke with lazy indifference knowing very well that the surest way of getting information was to avoid any appearance of anxiety to obtain it and above all not to press for it suggestions had to be made subconsciously to the subject never a word said lady hester and never has to my knowledge since he brought you and raymond back twenty years ago were you here then asked colin yes and that was the first time i saw stanier since i was seventeen your grandfather never spoke to me after my marriage and for that matter i wouldnt have spoken to him he was an old brute my dear was your grandfather and raymondll be as like him as two peas not as two peas darling said colin as one pea to another pea oh bother your grammar said lady hester speech is given us to show what we mean you know what i mean well enough but as soon as your grandfather died philip made me welcome here and has made me welcome ever since yes my dear the first i saw of you you were laughing and you aint stopped since did you know my mother asked colin quietly he was getting on to his subject again though lady hester was not aware of it no never set eyes on her nobody of the family knew she existed until you were born and less than a month after that she was dead your father had left home one may or june it must have been for he couldnt stand your grandfather any more than i could and not a word did any one but your grandmother hear of him and that only to say it was a fine day and he was well till there came that telegram to say that he was married and had a pair of twins your grandfather was at dinner sitting over his wine with your uncle ronaldhe used to drink enough to make two men tipsy every night of his lifeand up he got when your uncle read the telegram to him and crash he went among the decanters and that was the end of him then your mother died and back came your father with you and raymond within a twelvemonth of the time hed gone away and not a word about that twelvemonth ever passes his lips colin let a suitable pause speak for the mildness of his interest in all this he must have been married then very soon after he went to italy he said must have my dear said lady hester it was exactly then that colin began to see a faint outline shrouded though it was by the mists of twenty years that might prove to be the object of his exploration very likely it was only a mirage some atmospheric phantom but he intended to keep his eye on it and if possible get nearer to it a certain nuance of haste and promptitude with which lady hester had agreed to his comment perhaps brought it in sight he sat up clasping his knees with his hands and appeared to slide off into generalities how exceedingly little we all know of each other he said what do i know of my father for instance hardly anything and i know even less of my mother just her name rosina viagi and i shouldnt know that if it wasnt for the picture of her in the gallery who are the viagis aunt hester anybody dont know at all my dear said she i know as little about them as you quite respectable folk i daresay though what does it matter if they werent not an atom queen elizabeth wished she was a milkmaid didnt she lord shed have upset the milkpails and stampeded the cows observed lady hester better for her to be a queen why heres your father this was rather an unusual appearance for lord yardley did not generally shew himself till lunchtime colin instantly jumped up hurrah father he said come and talk cigarette chair lord yardley shook his head no dear boy he said i sent for you and heard you were out so i came to look for you have five minutes stroll with me colin took his fathers arm rather he said tell vi that ill be back in a few minutes if she comes out will you aunt hester philip stopped another time will do colin he said if youve made any arrangement with violet only vague tennis they walked off up the shady alley of grass to where at the end an opening cut in the trees gave a wide view over the plain the ground in front fell sharply away in slopes of steep turf dotted with hawthorns a little past the fulness of their flowering a couple of miles away the red roofs of rye smouldered in the blaze of the day outlined against the tidal water of the joined rivers that went seawards in expanse of dykecontained estuary on each side of it stretched the green levels of the marsh with winchelsea floating there a greener island on the green of that grassy ocean and along its margin to the south the sea like a silver wire was extended between sky and land to the right for foreground lay the yewencompassed terraces built and planted by colin the first the lowest of which fringed the broad water of the lake and along them burned the glory of the june flowerbeds behind framed in the trees between which they had passed the southeast front of the house rose red and yellow between the lines of green the two stood silent awhile ah colin said his father were at one about stanier it beats in your blood as it does in mine i wish to god that when i was dead he broke off i want to talk to you about two things he said raymonds one of them but well take the other first about italy ill take you with me if you want to come i was reluctant but i am reluctant no longer apart from my inclination which as i tell you is for it now not against it youve got a certain right to come you and i will live in the villa where i lived with your mother ive left it you by the way my romance my marriage with her and our life together was so short and was so utterly cut off from everybody else that as you know ive always kept it like that severed from all of you but youre her son my dear and in some ways you are so like her that its only right you should share my memories and my ghosts theyre twentyone years old now and theyve faded but they are there theres only one thing i want of you that is not to ask me any questions about her certain things ill tell you but anything i dont tell you he broke off for a moment anything i dont tell you is my private affair he said i understand father said colin youll probably see your uncle salvatore continued philip so be prepared for a shock he usually comes over when he hears i am at the villa but never mind that he takes himself off when hes got his tip so thats settled if you get bored you can go away that is good of you father said the boy now about the second point said philip and thats raymond hes a sulky dark fellow that brother of yours colin colin laughed oh put all the responsibility on me he said well whats to be done with him he was in the long gallery just now as i came out and i spoke to him and was civil but there he lounged didnt even take his feet off the windowseat and wouldnt give me more than a grunted yes or no so i told him what i thought of his manners oh did you how good for him well i didnt see why he should sulk at me said philip after all its my house for the present and if he is to quarter himself there without either invitation or warning the least he can do is to treat me like his host i try to treat him like a guest and like a son for that matter dont i yes dear father said colin you always try what do you mean you impertinent boy colin laughed again well you dont always succeed you know you cover up your dislike of him dislike rather you hate him you know philip pondered over this god forgive me i believe i do he said but anyhow i try not to and thats the most i can do and i will be treated civilly in my own house how long is he going to stop do you know i asked him that yesterday said colin he said that with my permissionsarcastic you knowhe was going to stop as long as he pleased philip frowned oh did he he said perhaps my permission will have something to do with it oh do tell him to pack off said colin it was so ripping here before he came i had a row with him last night by the way what about oh he chose to swear at me for mimicking him that is how it began but raymond will quarrel over anything hes not particular about the pretext then there was what i said about the tobacconists wench they had passed through the boxhedge on to the terrace just below the windows of the long gallery colin raised his eyes for one halfsecond as they came opposite the windowseat which raymond had been occupying and saw the top of his black head just above the sill he raised his voice a little poor old raymond he said weve got to make the best of him father i suppose he cant help being so beastly disagreeable he seems to think hes got a monopoly of it said philip but ill show him i can be disagreeable too and if he cant mend his ways ill just send him packing oh it would be ripping without him said colin he might come back after you and i have gone to italy in pursuance of his general policy colin made the most persevering attempts at lunch to render himself agreeable to his brother for the impression he wished to give was that he was all amiability and thereby throw into blackest shadow against his own sunlight raymonds churlishness a single glance at that glowering face was sufficient to convince colin that he had amply overheard the words which had passed between his father and himself below the open window of the gallery and that he writhed under these courtesies which were so clearly of the routine of making the best of him all the rest of them would see how manfully colin persevered and this geniality was a goad to raymonds fury he simply could not bring himself to answer with any appearance of goodfellowship what have you been at all morning raymond colin asked him as he entered i looked for you everywhere been indoors said raymond colin just shook his head and gave a little sigh of despair then began again determined not to be beaten he saw his father watching and listening and raymond knew that lord yardley was applauding colins resolve to make the best of him you ought to have come down to the tenniscourt and taken on vi and me together he said we shouldnt have had a chance against you but wed have done our best father you must come and look at raymond the next time he plays hes become a tremendous crack raymond knew perfectly well that either colin or violet could beat him singlehanded yet how answer this treacherous graciousness oh dont talk such rot colin he said he looked up angrily just in time to see colin and his father exchange a glance well what shall we do this afternoon said colin doggedly pleasant shall we go and play golf it would be awfully nice of you if youd drive me down in your car you know perfectly well that i loathe golf said raymond sorry said colin colin laughed and without the smallest touch of illhumour gave it up and turned to violet well have our game in that case shall we vi he asked father may we have a car to take us down by all means said philip hester and i will come down with you go for a drive and pick you up again youd like that hester oh but that will leave raymond alone began colin raymond broke in thats just what i want you to do with me he snapped colin got up ill just go and see granny for a minute he said i told her i would look in on her after lunch philip had listened to colins advances and raymonds rebuffs with a growing resentment at his elder sons behaviour and as the others went out he beckoned him to stop behind look here raymond he said when the door had closed i had to speak to you after breakfast for your rudeness to me and all lunchtime youve been as disagreeable as you knew how to be to your brother and if you think im going to stand these sulks and illtemper youll very speedily find yourself mistaken colin did all that a goodnatured boy could to give you a chance of making yourself decently agreeable and every time he tried you snapped and growled at him do you wish me to answer you or not sir asked raymond certainly i have every desire to be scrupulously fair to you said philip i will hear anything you wish to say then father i wish to say that youre not fair to me if im late for dinner do you chaff me in the way you do colin last night you asked him with a chuckle urgent private affairs that was all the rebuke he got if he says he hasnt finished his wine you sit down again and say sorry if i havent you tell me ive had enough already colins your favourite and you show it every minute of the day you dislike me you know there was quite enough truth in this to make the hearing of it disagreeable to his father i didnt ask you to discuss my conduct but to consider your own he said but you shall have it your own way my conduct to you is the result of yours to me and yours to everybody else look at yourself and colin dispassionately and tell me whether i could be as fond of you as of him i acknowledge im not are you fond of me if it comes to that but im polite to you until you annoy me beyond endurance as you are continually doing if colin had behaved at lunch as youve behaved i should have thought he was ill and im only sulky said raymond youre proving it every moment said his father thats quite a good instance raymond paused biting his lip you judge colins behaviour to me father he said by what you see of it you think hes like that to me when were alone hes not hes fiendish to me dont you understand that when youre there or anybody else is there he acts a part to make you think that hes ever so amiable and how do you behave to him when youre alone together asked philip if i take your word about colin i must take colins about you youve done that already i expect said raymond his father got up i see i havent made myself clear he said try to grasp that thats the sort of remark i dont intend to stand from you for a moment if i have any further complaint to make of you you leave the house youve got to be civil and decently behaved otherwise you go i do not choose to have my general enjoyment of life or colins or your uncles or your aunts spoiled by your impertinences and snarlings youll have to go away you can go to st jamess square if you like but i wont have you here unless you make a definite effort to be a pleasanter companion as i told colin this morning you seem to think that being disagreeable is a monopoly of your own but youll find that i can be disagreeable too and far more effectively than lies in your power philip was quite aware that he was speaking with extreme harshness with greater harshness in fact than he really intended but the sight of that heavy brooding face the knowledge that this was his elder son who would reign at stanier when he was dead to the exclusion of colin made his tongue bitter beyond control well thats all ive got to say to you he said i wont have you insolent and uncivil to me or any one in this house im master here for the present and rightly or wrongly i shall do as i choose and i wont have you quarrelling with colin you tell me that when im not here and when youre alone with him hes fiendish to you that was the word you used now dont repeat that because i dont believe it youre jealous of colin thats why you say things like that you want to injure him in my eyes but you only injure yourself at that moment there came into philips mind some memory now more than twenty years old of himself in raymonds position stung by the lash of his fathers vituperations reduced to the dumb impotence of hatred though he felt quite justified in all he had said to the boy he knew that his dislike of him had plumed and barbed his arrows and he experienced some sort of reluctant sympathy with him ive spoken strongly he said because i felt strongly but ive done if youve got anything more to say to me say it no said raymond very good i shant refer to it all again and its up to you to do better in the future put a check on yourself believe me that if you do you will have a better time with me and every one else think it over raymond be a sensible fellow the departure of the others gave raymond abundance of leisure for solitary reflection and his fathers remarks plenty of material for the same stinging as those hotminted sentences had been he felt no resentment towards the orator from his own point of viewa perfectly reasonable onehis father was justified in what he said what he did not know and what he refused to know was the truth about colin who neglected no opportunity which quickness of speech and an unrivalled instinct gave him as to what rankled and festered of planting his darts when they were alone together raymond accepted colins hatred of him just as he accepted his own of colin as part of the established order of things but what made him rage was this new policy of his brothers to win sympathy for himself and odium for him by public politeness and affectionate consideration no one observing that as his father had done could doubt who was the aggressor in their quarrelsthe genial sweettempered boy or he the morose and surly and yet far more often than not it was colin who intentionally and carefully exasperated him it amused colin as he had said to see his brother in a rage and he was ingenious at providing himself with causes of entertainment and what above all prompted his fathers slating of him just now again it was colin it was his championship of his favourite which had given the sting to his tongue here too raymond acquitted his father of any motive beyond the inevitable one nobody could possibly help liking colin better than himself and it was the recognition of that which made his mind brush aside all thought of his father and attach itself with claws and teeth to the root of all this trouble he was slow in his mental processes whereas colin was quick and colin could land a hundred stinging darts could wave a hundred maddening flags at him before he himself got in a charge that went home that image of the arena entirely filled his thought colin the light applauded matador himself the savage dangerous animal but one dayand raymond clenched his hands till the nails bit the skin as he pictured itthat light lissome figure with its smiling face and its graceful air would sidestep and wheel a moment too late and it would lie stretched on the sand while he gored and kneaded it into a hash of carrion ah he said to himself thatll be good thatll be good the intensity and vividness of the image surprised him he came to himself sitting on the terrace with the hum of bees drowsy in the flowerbeds as if from some doze and dream he had not arrived at it from any consecutive interpretation of his hate for colin it had not been evolved out of his mind but had been flashed on to it as by some vision outside his own control but there it was and now his business lay in realising it he saw at once that he must be in no hurry whether that goring and kneading of colin was to be some act of physical violence or the denouement of a plot which should lead to some disgraceful exposure raymond knew he must plan nothing rashly must test the strength of every bolt and rivet in his construction above all he must appear and continue to appear to have taken his fathers strictures to heart and for the sake to put it at its lowest of being allowed to stay on at stanier to observe the general amenities of sociability and in particular to force himself into cordial responses to colins public attentions temporarily that would look bitterly like a victory for colin with his father to back him it would seem as if colin had reduced his brother to decent behaviour but that could not be helped he must for many weeks yet cultivate an assiduous civility and appear to have seen the error of his sulky ways in order to lull suspicion fast asleep at present colin was always watchful for hostile manuvres it would be a work of time and patience before he would credit that raymond had plucked his hostility from him then there was violet not only had his intemperate churlishness damaged him with his father but not less with her that had to be repaired for though to know that stanier was to her even as to colin an enchantment an obsession she might find that the involved condition of marrying him in order to become its mistress was one that she could not face she did not love him she did not even like him but he divined that her obsession about stanier coupled with the aloofness and independence that characterised her might make her accept a companionship that was not positively distasteful to her it was not the stanier habit to love love did not form part of the beauty with which nature had dowered them the men of the family sought a healthy mate for the women of the family so few had there ever been no rule could be deduced but violet so far as he could tell followed the men in this and for witness to her inability to love in the sense of poets and romanticists was her attitude to colin had he been the younger raymond would have laughed at himself for entertaining any notion of successful rivalry colin with the lordship of stanier would have been no more vulnerable than was the moon to a yokel with a pocketpistol but he felt very sure that love as a relentless and compelling factor in this matter had no part in her strong liking for colin neither her feeling for him nor his for her was ever so slightly dipped in any infinite quality it was ponderable and he himself had in his pocket for weight in the other scale her passion for stanier colin strolled gracefully into the smokingroom that evening when the whist and bridge were over marvelling at the changed raymond who had been so courteous at dinner and so obligingly ready to play whist at poor grannys table he himself had kept up that policy of solicitous attention to his brother which had made raymond grind his teeth at lunch that day but the effect this evening was precisely the opposite raymond had replied with it must be supposed the utmost cordiality of which he was capable it was a grim heavy demeanour at the best but such as it was no doubt however raymond was saving up for such time as they should be alone the full power of his antagonism and colin pausing outside the smokingroom considered whether he should not go to bed at once and deprive his brother of the relief of unloading himself but the desire to bait him was too strong and he turned the doorhandle and entered so you got a wigging after lunch today he remarked it seems to have brought you to heel a bit but you can let go now raymond you havent amused me all evening with your tantrums raymond looked up from his illustrated paper he knew as precisely what seeing red meant as did the bull in the arena he had to wait a moment till that cleared hullo colin he said have you come for a drink incidentally my real object was to see you and to have one of our jolly chats did father pitch it in pretty hot i stuck up for you this morning when we talked you over raymond was off his guard forgetting that certain knowledge he possessed was derived from overhearing yes you said you must make the best of me he began colin was on to that like a flash now how on earth could you have known that he asked father didnt tell you i know i said that just as i was passing under the window in the gallery where you were sitting after breakfast my word raymond youve a perfect genius for eavesdropping it was only last night that you hid behind the flowervase and heard me mimic you and if i hadnt shut the door of the diningroom this morning youd have listened to what aunt hester and violet and i were saying and then you overhear my conversation with father youre a perfect wonder raymond got up his eyes blazing take care colin he said dont go too far colin laughed ah thats better he said now youre more yourself i thought i should get at you soon raymond felt his mouth go dry but below the violence of his anger there was something that made itself heard youll spoil your chance if you break out it said keep steady he drained his glass and turned to his brother sorry colin he said but im not going to amuse you tonight oh i dont know about that said colin ive hardly begun yet your manner at dinner now and your amiability it was not really a success no naturalness about it it sat on you worse than your sulkiest moods you reminded me of some cad in dressclothes trying to catch the note of the ordinary wellbred man better be natural ill go on sticking up for you ill persuade father not to pack you off ive a good deal of influence with him i shall say youre injuring yourself by not behaving like a sulky boor besides you cant do it if your geniality at dinner was an attempt to mimic me i must tell you that nobody could guess who it was meant for vi was very funny about it really what did she say asked raymond oh naturally i cant give her away said colin but perhaps youll hear her say it again if youre conveniently placed you know quite well vi didnt say anything about it said raymond at a venture naturally you know best and talking of vi are you going to propose to her i wouldnt if i were you take my hint and save yourself being laughed at most friendly of you said raymond but there are some things that are my business and not an affectionate brothers asked colin you dont know how i feel for you it makes me wince when i see you blundering and making the most terrible gaffes its odd that i should have had a brother like you and that you should be a stanier at all colin threw a leg over the arm of his chair it was most astonishing that not only in public but now when there was no reason that raymond should keep up a semblance of control that he should be so impervious to the shafts that in ordinary stung him so intolerably youre so awkward raymond he said however much you try you cant charm anybody or make any one like you youve neither manners nor looks nor breeding youve got the curse of the legend without its benefits youre a coward too youd like nothing better than to slit my throat and yet youre so afraid of me that you darent even throw that glass of whisky and soda in my face for a moment it looked as if raymond was about to do precisely that the suggestion was almost irresistible but he loosed his hand on it again that would only give you the opportunity to go to my father and tell him he said you would say i had lost my temper with you i dont intend to give you any such opportunity even as he spoke he marvelled at his own selfcontrol but the plain fact was that the temptation to lose it had no force with him tonight for the sake of his ultimate revenge whatever that might be that goring and kneading of colin it was no less than necessary that he should seem to have put away from him all his hostility colin and the rest of themviolet above allmust grow to be convinced in the change that had come over him he rose better give it up colin he said youre not going to rile me youve had a good try at it for i never knew you so studiedly insolent but its no use good night during the fortnight which intervened before the departure of lord yardley and colin to italy raymond never once faltered in the task he had set himself there was no act of patience too costly for the due attainment of it no steadfastness of selfcontrol in the face of colins gibes that was not worth the reward which it would ultimately bring he avoided as far as possible being alone with his brother but that in the mere trivial round of the day happened often enough to give colin the opportunity of planting a dart or two but now they seemed to have lost all penetrative force so far from goading him into some illaimed response they were but drops of showers on something waterproof colin was disposed at first to attribute this incredible meekness to the effect of his fathers strictures raymond had been given to understand without any possible mistake that unless he mended his ways he would have to leave stanier and that no doubt accounted for his assumption of public amiability but his imperviousness in private to any provocation was puzzling he neither answered colins challenges nor conducted any offensive of his own at the most a gleam or a flush told that some jibe had gone home but no angry blundering reply would give opportunity for another for some reason raymond banked up his smouldering fires not letting them blaze his impotence to make his brother wince and rage profoundly irritated colin he had scarcely known before how deeprooted was his pleasure in so doing how integral a part of his consciousness was his hatred of him which now seemed to have been deprived of its daily bread not less irritating was the effect that raymonds changed behaviour produced on his father and on violet his fathers civilities to him began to lose the edge of their chilliness a certain cordiality warmed them if the boy was really taking himself in hand lord yardley must in common duty and justice encourage and welcome his efforts and the day before the departure for italy he made an opportunity for acknowledging this once more after lunch he nodded to raymond to stay behind the others i want to tell you raymond he said that im very much pleased with you youve been making a strong effort with yourself and youre winning all down the line and how goes it with you and colin in private raymond took rapid counsel with himself very well indeed sir he said weve had no rows at all thats good now what are your plans while colin and i are away your uncle ronald and violet are going to stop on here i think your aunts going up to london you can establish yourself at st jamess square if you like or remain here ill stop here if i may said raymond i dont care about london philip smiled very good he said youll have to take care of violet and keep her amused raymond answered with a smile ill do my best father he said well all good wishes said his father let me know how all goes colin had seen throughout this fortnight raymonds improvement of his position with regard to lord yardley and he had felt himself jealously powerless to stop it once he had tried with some sunnilytold tale of raymonds illtemper to put the brake on it but his father had stopped him before he was half through with it raymonds doing very well he said i dont want to hear anything against him a further light was shed for colin that evening he and violet when the rubber of whist was over and lady yardley had gone upstairs strolled out into the hot dusk of the terrace with linked arms but with no more stir of emotion in their hearts than two schoolboy friends whose intimacy was to be severed by a month of holiday would have experienced the shadow cast by the long yew hedge from the moon near to its setting had enveloped them in its clear darkness the starlight glimmered on the lake below and in the elms beyond the nightingales chanted listen at them look at it all said colin impatiently starlight and shadow and nightingales and you and me as cool as cucumbers you look frightfully attractive too tonight vi why on earth dont i fall madly in love with you oh my dear dont said violet you might make me fall in love with you but i suppose i neednt be afraid you cant fall in love with anybody colin and i daresay i cant either but i shall try and what do you mean by that asked colin its pretty obvious she said raymond do you mean asked colin of course whats come over him theres something attractive about him after all hes got charm who would have thought it though colin had just now truthfully declared that he was in no way in love with his cousin he felt a pang of jealousy just as authentic as that which the notion of raymonds possession of stanier caused in him but you cant violet he said that boor im not so sure that he is a boor hes keeping the boor in a box anyhow and has turned the key on him hes quite changed you cant deny it colin slipped his arm out of violets raymonds cleverer than i thought he said all this fortnight it has puzzled me to know what hes been at but now i see hes been improving his position with father and with you he has certainly done that said violet so if he asks you you intend to marry him asked colin i think so i shall hate you if you do said he why how can it matter to you if you were in love with me it would be different or if i were in love with you oh weve talked it all over before theres nothing new they had passed through the cut entrance in the yew hedge into the moonlight and violet turning looked at her companion colins face was brilliantly illuminated by some optical illusion that came and went in a flash he looked at that moment as if his face was lit from within so strangely it shone against the dark serge of the hedge for background there was an unearthly beauty about it that somehow appalled her he seemed like some incarnation ageless and youthful of the fortunes of the house but the impression was infinitesimal in duration and she laughed colin you looked so wonderful just now she said you looked like all the staniers rolled into one somehow this annoyed him raymond included i suppose he asked but youre wrong there is something new hitherto youve only considered raymond as a necessary adjunct to being mistress here now youre considering him as a man you can imagine loving hasnt he got enough already good god how i hate him he had hardly spoken when there emerged from the entrance in the hedge through which they had just passed raymond himself colin white with fury turned on him hullo at it again he said youve overheard something nice this time raymonds mouth twitched but he gave no other sign father has just sent me out to tell you that he wants to speak to you before you go to bed he said and turning went straight back to the house violet waited till the sound of his step had vanished colin youre a brute she said youre fiendish i know that said colin who ever supposed i was an angel and its acting like a fool to treat raymond like that she went on can you afford to make him hate you he laughed ive afforded it as long as i can remember he said it amuses me well it doesnt amuse me to see you behave like a fiend said violet and do you know that you lost your temper ive never seen you do that yet colin licked his lips his mouth felt dry that was an odd thing he observed now i know what i make raymond feel like when we chat together but its amazing that raymond should have done the same to me i must go in to father they moved back into the shadow of the hedge and colin stopped i say vi give me a kiss he said she drew back a moment wondering why she did so but my dear why she asked were cousins he said why shouldnt you i should awfully like to kiss you she had got over her momentary surprise which was no doubt what made her hesitate there was no conceivable reason though they did not kiss each other why they should not and if i wont she said i shall think it unkind of you she came close to him oh colin im not unkind she said and kissed him he stood with his hands on her shoulders not letting her go though making no attempt to kiss her again that was delicious of you he said suddenly and quite unexpectedly to herself violet found her heart beating soft and fast and she was glad of the darkness for she knew that a heightened colour had sprung to her face was colin too she wondered affected in any such way his light laugh the release of her shoulders from his cool hands answered her good lord to think that perhaps raymond will be kissing you next he said how maddening chapter iii from the first some call of his italian blood had made itself audible to colin even as their train emerged out of the drip and roaring darkness of the mont cenis tunnel there had been a whisper in his ears that this was the land of his birth to which he had come and that whisper had grown into fullvoiced welcome when at the hot close of day he and his father had strolled out after dinner along the seafront of naples though he had never been here yet sight scent and sound alike told him that he was not so much experiencing what was new as recognising what though dormant had always been part of him bred into the very fibre and instinct of him it was not that he hailed or loved this lure of the south it would be more apt to say that he nodded to it as to an old acquaintancetaken for granted rather than embraced this claiming and appropriation by colin of his native place unfroze in his father the reticence that he had always observed with regard to that year he had spent in italy into which had entered birth and death and all that his life held of romance that till now had been incapsulated within him or at the most like the ichor in some ductless gland was performing some mysterious function in his psychology now this claim of colins on the south his easy stepping into possession by right of his parentage unsealed in philip the silence he had so long preserved colin as he regarded his surroundings with friendly and familiar eyes was visibly part of his old romance the boys mother lived again in that sunny hair those eyes and the clear olive skin just as surely as did old colin of the holbein portrait but now stanier was far away and the spell of the south as potent as when philip flying from the glooms and jibes of that awful old man his father first came under its enchantment and colin of all that dead time alone was a vital and living part of its manifestation through the medium of memory he stirred his fathers blood philip felt romance bubble in him again as he walked along the familiar ways with the flower that had blossomed from it he felt too that colin silently for he asked no question seemed to claim the right to certain knowledge he seemed to present himself to be ready and indeed it would be singular if having brought him here his father did not speak of that which every year had taken him on his solitary pilgrimage to the south they were to spend the greater part of the next day in naples leaving by the afternoon boat for capri and as they finished their breakfast on a shady veranda philip spoke well weve got all the morning he said to trundle about in the museum is very fine would you like to see it no i should hate it said colin but its a marvellous collection said philip i daresay but to see a museum would make me feel like a tourist at present i dont and its lovely he looked at his father as he spoke and once again this time compellingly philip saw confident expectancy in his eyes colin was certainly waiting for something then will you come with me on a sentimental journey he asked ah father wont i just he said after all you and i are on a sentimental journey there seemed to philip in his devotion to colin something exquisitely delicate about this he had wanted but instinctively had not asked waiting for his rights to be offered him come then he said ill show you where we lived your mother and i ill show you our old haunts such as survive you belong to that life colin colin paused a moment sitting quite still for a span of clear concentrated thought he desired to say precisely the right thing the thing that his father would most value it was not in the smallest degree affection for his father which prompted that it was the wish that the door should be thrown open as wide as possiblethat all the keys should be put into his hand i know i do he said ive known that for years but i had to wait for you to want me to share it it had to be you who took me into it he saw approval gleam in his fathers eyes this was clearly the right tack and you must remember i know nothing whatever about your life with my mother he said youve got to begin at the beginning and and make it long father it was not surprising that colins presence gave to this sentimental journey a glow which it had lacked during all those years when philip made his annual solitary visit here already the mere flight of years and the fact that he had never married again had tinged that longpast time with something of the opalescence which sunlit mist confers on objects which in themselves hardly rise above the level of the mean and the prosaic and what now survived for him in memory was rosinas gaiety her beauty her girlish charm with forgetfulness for her vapid vanity her commonness and the speed with which his senses even had been sated with her but it was an unsubstantial memory of blurred and faroff days girt with regrets and the emptiness of desires dead and unrecoverable now colins presence gave solidity to it all it was as if the sunlit mist had been withdrawn from the dim slopes which it covered and lo the reality was not mean or prosaic but had absorbed the very tints and opalescences which had cloaked it there was colin eager and sympathetic yet checking any question of his own and but thirsty for what his father might give him and in the person of the boy who was the only creature in the world whom philip loved and in whom rosina lived that tawdry romance of his was glorified to tell colin about his mother here in the places where they had lived together was to make a shrine of them the flat which he and rosina had occupied in naples when the autumnal departure of visitors from capri rendered the island so desolating to her urban nature happened to be untenanted and a couple of lire secured their admittance it still held pieces of furniture which had been there twenty years ago and colin moving quietly to and fro his eyes alight with interest in little random memories which his father recalled was like a ray of sunlight shining into a place that had long slept in dust and shadows mother and son reacted on each other in philips mind a new tenderness blossomed for rosina out of his love for colin and he wondered at himself for not having brought them together like this before here were the chairs which they used to pull out on to the veranda when the winter sun was warm here was the venetian lookingglass which rosina could never pass without a glance at her image and now as colin turned towards it there were rosinas eyes and golden hair that flashed back at philip out of the past and made a bridge to the present and there above all was the bedroom with the glitter of sun on the ceiling cast there from the reflecting sea where at the close of a warm windy day of march the first cry of a newborn baby was heard and by that same bedside at the dawn of an april morning philip had seen the flame of rosinas life flicker and waver and expire he regretted her more today than at the hour when she had left him some unconscious magic vested in colin cast that spell for all these recollections colin had the same eager listening face and the grave smile never even in his baiting of raymond had he shewn a subtler ingenuity in adapting his means to his end he used his fathers affection for him to prize open the locks of a hundred caskets and enable him to see what was therein he wanted to know all that his father would tell him about that year which preceded his birth and not asking questions was the surest way of hearing what he wanted already he had found that his aunt hester knew very little about that year or if she knew she had not chosen to tell him certain things his curiosity when he had talked to her under the elms had been but vague and exploratory but it will be remembered it had become slightly more definite when in answer to his comment that his father and mother must have been married very soon after his arrival in italy aunt hester had given a very dry assent now his curiosity was sharply aroused about that point for with all his fathers communicativeness this morning he had as yet said no word whatever that bore on the date of their marriage colin felt by an instinct which defied reason that there was something to be known here the marriage the scene the date of it must have passed through his fathers mind and yet he did not choose in all this sudden breakdown of long reticence to allude to it that was undeniably so a question therefore would certainly be useless for believing as he did that his father had something to conceal he would not arrive at it in that way they were standing now in the window looking over the bay and philip pointed to the heatveiled outline of capri floating lyreshaped on the fusingline of sea and sky we were there all the summer he said in the villa you will see this evening then your mother found it melancholy in the autumn and we came herei used to go backwards and forwards for i couldnt quite tear myself away from the island altogether that struck colin as bearing on his point it was odd wasnt it that a newlymarried couple should do that you would have expected them to live here or there but together then afraid that his father would think he was pondering on that he changed the topic altogether i have loved hearing about it all he said but somehowdont be shocked fatheri cant feel that raymond comes into it one atom weve been realising you and my mother and the squalling thing that i was but i cant feel raymond with us then any more than hes with us now lets keep italy to ourselves father poor old raymond that shifting of the topic was skilfully designed and subtly executed colin confessed to alienation from raymond and yet with a touch of affectionate regret his father was less guarded raymonds got nothing to do with italy he said theres not a single touch of your mother in him weve got this to ourselves colin raymond will have stanier lucky dog said colin there was one item connected with the marriage that he might safely ask and as they went downstairs he put it to his father watching him very narrowly i feel i know all about my mother now he said except just one thing lord yardley turned quickly to him ive told you all i can tell you he said sharply that was precisely what colin had been waiting for there was something more then but the question which he was ready with was harmless enough i only wanted to know where you were married he said thats the one thing you havent told me there was no doubt that this was a relief to his father he had clearly expected something else not the where of the boys question but the when which by now had definitely crystallised in colins mind oh that he said stupid of me not to have told you we were married at the british consulate they passed out into the noonday mind you remember that colin said his father on my death the marriage will have to be proved it will save a search your birth was registered there too and raymonds such was the sum of information that colin took on board with him that afternoon when they embarked on the steamer for capri and though in one sense it took him back a step in another it confirmed the idea that had grown up in his mind he felt certain here was the confirmation that if he had asked his father when the marriage took place he would have been told a date which he would not have believed lord yardley would have said that they had been married very soon after his arrival twentyone years ago he had waited with obvious anxiety for colins one question and he had hailed that question with relief for he had no objection to the boys knowing where the contract was made and the retrograde step was this that whereas he had been ready to think that his fathers marriage was an event subsequent to his own birth and raymonds he was now forced to conclude owing to the fact that his father told and impressed on him to remember that it had been performed at the british consulate that he and raymond were legitimately born in wedlock that seemed for the present to be a culdesac in his researches the warm soft air streamed by and the wind made by the movement of the boat enticed colin out from under the awning into the breezetempered blaze of the sun he went forward and found in the bows a place where he could be alone and study like a map whatever could be charted of his discoveries that willingness of his father to tell him where the marriage had taken place was somehow disconcerting it implied that the ceremony made valid whatever had preceded it he had himself been born in midmarch and he did not attempt to believe that his father had been married in the previous june the month when he had first come to italy but he could not help believing that his father had married before his own birth colin was one of those rather rare people who can sit down and think everybody can sit down and let his mind pleasantly wander over a hundred topics but comparatively few can tether it so to speak so that it grazes on a small circle only this accomplishment colin signally possessed and though now there could be no practical issue to his meditations he set himself to carve out in clear cutting strokes what he would have done in case he had discovered that he and raymond alike were born out of wedlock he imagined that situation to himself he cropped at it he grazed on it the disclosure clearly if the fact had been there would not have come out till his fathers death and he could see himself looking on the face of the dead without the slightest feeling of reproach he knew that his father was leaving him all that could be left away from raymond he was heir also to aunt hesters money but in that case stanier and all that went with the title would not be raymonds at all raymond would be nameless and penniless and colins beautiful mouth twitched and smiled that would have been great fun he said to himself raymond would have been nobody and have had nothing ha raymond would not have had stanier and i should have ceased to hate him i should have made him some small allowance yes stanier would have passed from raymond and it and all that it meant would have gone to violet and at that the whole picture started into life and colour if only now at this moment he was possessed of the knowledge that he and raymond alike were illegitimate with what ardour with what endless subtlety would he have impelled violet to marry him how would he have called upon the legendary benefactor who for so long had prospered and befriended the staniers to lend him all the arts and attractions of the lover with such wiles to aid him he would somehow have forced violet to give up the idea of marrying raymond in order to get stanier and instead renouncing stanier take him and by her renunciation for loves sake find in the end that she had gained bread upon the waters all that she had imagined was lost and he colin in that case would be her husband master of stanier to all intents and purposes willingly would he have accepted eagerly would he have welcomed that he wanted what he would never get unless raymond died except at some such price as that but it was no use thinking about it his fathers insistence on the place where he and rosina were married made it certain that no such fortunate catastrophe could be revealed at his death presently lord yardley joined him as they passed along the headland on which sorrento stands and there were stories of the visit that he and rosina made here during the summer colin listened to these with suppressed irritation what did he care whether they had spent a week at sorrento or not of all that his father had to tell him he had mastered everything that mattered and he began to find in these recollections a rather ridiculous sentimentality he knew of course that he himself was responsible for this it was he rosinas son and his fathers love for him that conjured up these tendernesses he was responsible too in that all the morning he had listened with so apt a sympathy to similar reminiscences but then he hoped that he was about to learn something really worth knowing whereas now he was convinced that there was nothing of that sort to know fond as his father had always been of him he easily detected something new in his voice his gestures the soft eagerness of his eyes it was as if in him his father was falling in love with rosina sunset burned behind capri as their steamer drew near to it and the eastern side lay in clear shadow though the sea flared with the reflected fires of the sky and that too seemed to produce more memories you are so like her colin said his father laying his arm round the boys neck and i can imagine that twentyone years have rolled back and that i am bringing her across to capri for the first time it was just such an evening as this sunset and a crescent moon i had already bought the villa we were going back to it together straight from the consulate asked colin quietly what asked philip from the consulate father he repeated yes yes of course said philip quickly and his voice seemed to ring utterly untrue straight from the consulate ha theres giacomo my boatman he sees us does he remember my mother asked colin surely but dont ask him about her these fellows chatter on for ever and its half lies colin laughed as i shouldnt understand one word of it he said it would make little difference whether it was all lies once again and more markedly than ever as they drove up the angled dusty road set in stone walls and bordered by the sea of vineyards the sense of homecoming seized colin it was not that his father was by him or that he was going to his fathers house the spell worked through the other side of his parentage and he felt himself strangely more akin to the boys who trudging homewards shouted a salutation to their driver to the girls who clustered on the doorsteps busy with their needle than to the grave man who sat beside him and watched with something of a lovers tenderness his smiles and glances and gestures philip read rosina into them all and she who had so soon sated him till he wearied of her woke in him through colin a love that had never before been given her i cannot imagine why i never thought of bringing you out to italy before said philip or why when you asked me to take you i hesitated colin tucked his arm into his fathers he was wonderfully skilful in displaying such little signs of affection which cost him nothing and meant nothing but were so well worth while do i seem to fit into it all father he said i am so glad if i do you more than fit into it my dear said philip youre part of it why on earth did i never see that part of it am i thats exactly what ive been feeling all day im at home here not but what im very much at home at stanier lord yardley clicked his tongue against his teeth i wish to god you were my eldest son he said i would give anything if that were possible i would close my eyes ever so contentedly when my time comes if i knew that you were going to take my place poor old raymond said colin softly hes doing his best father i suppose he is but youre a generous fellow to say that i shant forget it here we are bundle out their carriage had stopped in the piazza and colin getting out felt his lips curl into a smile of peculiar satisfaction that his father should believe him to be a generous fellow was pleasant in itself and the entire falsity of his belief added spice to the morsel he seemed to like it better just because it was untrue colin stepped into the drifting summer existence of visitors to the island with the same aptness as that which had graced his entry to his mothers native land he went down to the bathingbeach after breakfast with a book and a packet of cigarettes and spent a basking amphibious morning sometimes his father accompanied him and after a constitutional swim sat in the shade while colin played the fish in the sea or the salamander on the beach on other mornings lord yardley remained up at the villa which suited colin quite well for this uninterrupted companionship of his father was very tedious but he always managed to leave the impression that he wanted lord yardley to come with him and so much this morning did colin want to be alone that had philip said that he was coming with him he would probably have pleaded a laziness or indisposition for he had that morning received a letter from violet which called for solitary and uninterrupted reflection today however philips brotherinlaw salvatore viagi had announced his advent to pay his fraternal respects and give his hearts welcome so ran his florid phraseand philip remained at the villa to receive these tributes its a nuisance he said for i should have liked a dip but i should have to hurry back to get here before him colin laughed you speak as if he might steal the silver he said perfectly capable of it said his father no i shouldnt have said that but hes perfectly capable of asking for it colin perceived that there was no danger of his fathers coming down to bathe with him surely he can wait till we get back he said come down and bathe father philip shook his head no i cant he said salvatore would think it very odd and rude if i were not here he wouldnt understand he would think i was intentionally unceremonious he sounds rather a bounder observed colin he does said philip drily colin took violets letter down to the beach with him and after a short dip of refreshment from his dusty walk came out cool and shining from the sea to dispose himself on the beach that quivered in the hot sun and ponder over it he read it again twice through stirring it into his brains and his emotions till it seemed to form part of him so raymond had proposed to her and having asked for a weeks delay in her answer she while the matter was still private had to tell colin that as far as she knew her own intentions she was meaning to accept him and yet this letter in which she said that she was going to marry his brother seemed hardly less than a loveletter to himself she appeared to remember that last evening at stanier when under the mooncast shadow of the yews she had given him the kiss he asked for just as vividly as did colin it was vivid to him because he had asked for that with a definite calculated end in view and with the same end in view he had exclaimed how maddening it was to think that raymond would kiss her next no doubt raymond had done so and violet though she said she meant to marry him had perhaps begun to know something more of her own heart that was why the evening was vivid to her exactly as he had intended it should be she had learned that there was a difference between him and raymond which being mistress at stanier might counterbalance but did not cancel the wetness had dried from colins suntanned shoulders and lying down at length on the beach he drew from his pocket violets letter in order to study one passage again which had puzzled him here it was you were perfectly brutal to raymond that evening she wrote and he was admirable in his answer to your rudeness if we are to remain friends you must not behave to him like that you dont like each other but he at any rate now has control over himself and you must copy his example lord me copying raymonds example thought colin to himself in an ecstatic parenthesis i shall always do my best to make peace between you for i am very fond of you but raymonds side will in the future be mine you were nice to me afterwards but dear colin you mustnt ask me to kiss you again raymond wouldnt like it with this perusal all that was puzzling vanished thats not genuine none of thats genuine thought colin she says what shes trying to feel what she thinks she ought to feel and doesnt feel he turned the page i hope my news wont hurt you she went on after all weve settled often enough that we werent in love with each other and so when that night you said it was maddening to think of raymond kissing me next it couldnt make any difference to you as you arent in love with me no the news did not hurt colin so he told himself in the way that violet meant and she was quite right about the reason of that he was not in love with her but it struck him that the news must undeniably hurt violet herself she was trying to wriggle away from it while at the same time she tried to justify herself and that unfortunate or should he call it fortunate kiss she had given him he glanced hastily over the rest there were more allusions to that last evening more scolding and exhortations about his conduct to raymond and as a postscript the request that he should send her just one line to say he wasnt hurt this letter of hers was absolutely private but she had to tell him what was about to happen in a weeks time both she and raymond would write to his father who so raymond thought was not unprepared colin tore off the final halfsheet of violets letter and with his stylograph scribbled his answer on it he had long ago made up his mind what he should say violet my dear he wrote it was delightful of you to tell me and i send you a million congratulations i am so pleased for now you will be mistress of stanier and you seem quite to have fallen in love with raymond i must be very nice to him or hell never let me come to stanier in days to come and you will take his side as you say but how could i be hurt at your news it is simply charming father and i are having a splendid time out here i shall try to persuade him to stop on after this month of course we shall come back before your marriage when is it to be do you think best love from colin the ink in this hot sun dried almost as quickly as he wrote and he had scarcely signed his own name when it wore the appearance not of a tentative sketch but of a finished communication ready for the post and reading it over he found that this was so he could not better it so slipping it back into his pocket he went across the beach again for a longer swim smiling to himself at the ease with which he had divined violets real mind and at the fitness of his reply as he swam he analysed his own purpose in writing exactly like that he had expressed himself with all the cordial geniality of which he was capable he had welcomed violets choice he had endorsed as regards his own part of the situation her proposition that he ought not to be hurt since they were not in love with each other and the eagerness of his endorsement that swift enthusiastic scrawl would quite certainly pique her he had adopted her attitude and knew that she would wish he had another the same in fact which he had expressed when he had said that it was maddening to think that she would be kissing raymond next colin knew well how fond she was of him and his letter would be like this plunge into the clear crystal of the sea which while it cooled you was glowingly invigorating he was quite prepared to find that in a weeks time she and raymond would write to his father saying that they were engaged but not for a moment did he believe that they would ever be married he had but to keep up his cordial indifference till violet found it intolerable to have remonstrated with her to have allowed that her news hurt him was to give violet just what she wanted a loveless marriage faced her while all the time she was not heartwhole and however much she wanted stanier she would be daily more conscious that the conditions on which she got it were a diet of starvation she is rather in love with me thought colin and very likely my letter will drive her into accepting him but if only i can keep cool and pleasant shell never marry him devilish ingenious and then theres raymond colin laughed aloud as he thought of raymond who really lay at the bottom of all these plans even if it had been possible now before violet accepted him to intervene in some way and cause her to refuse instead of to take him he would not have stirred a finger for thus he would baulk himself of the completeness of raymonds discomfiture since raymond would feel the breaking off of his engagement more bitterly than an original refusal let violet accept him first and then throw him over that would be a real counterirritant to the sting of raymonds primogeniture an appreciable counterweight to his future possession of stanier it had been a check in that fraternal feud that raymonds birth and his own were certainly legitimate and that nothing now could stand in the way of his brothers succession but if the check in that direction had not occurred there would never have been any chance of violets marrying him and raymond would have been spared the wounding humiliation which instinctively colin felt sure was to be dealt him raymond was genuinely desirous of her he would feel her loss very shrewdly if only by some diabolical good fortune raymond could lose them both colin saw himself violet by his side smilingly observing raymonds final departure from stanier and hoping that he would have a pleasant journey alas it was time to swim shorewards again for the morning boat from naples which was carrying salvatore viagi had already gone by on its tourist route to the blue grotto and salvatore would have disembarked at the marina he felt curious to see uncle salvatore and was determined to make himself uncommonly pleasant for there might be things which salvatore knew which his father had not told him the date of the marriage for instance though he despaired of any practical use arising from that colin would like to know when it took place he dressed and strolled up through the vineyards through which twentyone years ago his father had gone tasting for the first time the liberty and gaiety of the south and found his little jingling conveyance awaiting him his quiet concentrated hate of raymond sat smiling beside him up the dusty road and he rejoiced in its companionship colin found that salvatore had arrived and his father was waiting lunch for him and so without decoration of himself in the way of brushings or putting on tie or socks he went straight to the salon there was sitting there a very gorgeouslydressed gentleman and his heart fell as he saw him for it would be difficult to cultivate cordial relationships with so exquisite a bounder whatever information might be the reward of his efforts salvatore was clad in illfitting broadcloth florid with braid he wore patent leather shoes a tie of pink billows in which nestled a preposterous emerald cuffs and collar clearly detachable and a gold watchchain from which a large cheap locket depended luxuriant hair suspiciously golden and carefully curled crowned his face fierce moustaches brushed and waxed were trained away to show a mouth full of dazzling teeth and his features were just those of a wax bust representing the acme of masculine beauty that may be seen in the window of a hairdresser with this troubadour was sitting his father stiff and starched and iced colin guessed that this period of waiting had been embarrassing for both seemed highly relieved at his entry and the troubadour bounded to his feet with a tenor cry of welcome collino mio he exclaimed kissing him to colins great surprise on both cheeks ah the joy of the day when i behold my own nephew and you are so like her so like her look on the image of her which i ever carry about with me i do not forget her no no he opened the locket and showed colin a photograph faded into illegibility her eyes her nose her mouth he said i see again the features of my adored rosina this was so much worse than could possibly have been expected that the only thing to be done was to treat it all as some game some monstrous charade this was the stock of which he had come his mother was sister to this marvellous mountebank at that moment colin hated his father how could he have joined himself to any of such a family it was clearer than ever that whatever the history of that year preceding his birth had been it had not begun with marriage his father had been prey to a pretty face then he set himself to play the game dear uncle salvatore he said i cant tell you how ive been looking forward to seeing you i hurried in as you see when i heard you were here without dressing or tidying myself i could not wait and you think i am like my mother but you are a true viagi you are the very image of her and if i place myself beside you my noble brotherinlaw will not i think fail to mark a certain family resemblance he put his hand on colins shoulder as if for a bank holiday photograph and rose on his toes to make himself the taller at that his noble brotherinlaw catching colins merry glance which shouted to him play up father play up seemed to determine to make the best of it too amazing resemblance he said rising two brothers shall we go in to lunch please go on salvatore with the escort of my brother colin said salvatore in tremendous good spirits he had clearly so he thought found a friendly heart in colin who would no doubt in time warm the heart of his brotherinlaw which at present seemed inclined to be chilly it was desirable that a more generous warmth should be diffused there before they came to speak of financial matters philips efforts in answer to colins unspoken bidding to see the humorous side of their visitor were put to a sad strain before that portentous meal was over salvatore was bent on making a fine and dashing impression and adopted for that end a manner compounded of brag and rich adulation your cousins collino my own beloved children he exclaimed never will vittoria and cecilia forgive me if i do not on my return prove to have got your promise to pay them a visit before you quit italy we must persuade your father to spare you for a day you must dine and sleep and ho ho who knows but that when our ladies have gone to bed you and i will not play the bachelor in our gay naples it would i am afraid be useless to urge you my dear philip to be of the party but ah the happiness ah the honour that there would be in the palazzo viagi if lord yardley would make himself of the family but i know i know you come here to enjoy your quiet and blessed memories very good of you salvatore said philip but as you say i come here for quiet i am afraid i shall hardly be able to get across to naples ah il eremito as we say the hermit is it not you speak excellent english uncle salvatore said colin and should i not was not english the language of my adored mother it is vittorias dream to go to england some day perhaps i will take vittoria to see the home of her english ancestors of her grandmother and of yours my colin but the expense dio the expense of travel once it was not so with the viagi they did not need to count their soldi and now there are no soldi to count they were rich once their wealth was colossal and had it not been for nefarious enemies slanderers and swindlers they would be rich still and a line of princes as it is they have nothing left them but their pride and from that whatever their poverty they will never part i the head of the family proclaim that to the world very proper said philip salvatore had hit himself quite a severe blow on the chest as he proclaimed his pride which had set him coughing this was curable by a considerable draught of hock which started him again on the adulatory tack a nectar nectar of the gods he exclaimed there is no such wine to be obtained in my beggarly country but you must be a millionaire to drink it i would die happy drowned in wine like that you must take a bottle or two away with you said philip rising if you will excuse me for ten minutes there are a couple of letters i want to finish for this afternoons post and then perhaps you will spare me a quarter of an hour salvatore for a talk there will be plenty of time before your boat goes dear friend my time is yours said salvatore and the boat may go to naples without me if we have not finished i brought a small toilet bag in case i stopped the night i can no doubt find a room at some modest hotel i dont think that will be necessary said philip leaving him and colin together salvatore poured himself out some more of the nectar when the door had closed he was making sure of taking a bottle at least with him and pointed dramatically to his heart my noble and venerated brotherinlaw has never rallied from the shock of your mothers death he said his heart broke he lives only for the day when he will rejoin her till then it is a solace to him to minister to those who were nearest and dearest to rosina so generous a heart do you think i made a good impression on him today admirable excellent said colin now talk to me about the old days uncle salvatore a glass of brandy did you see my father that year he spent in italy when he married my mother and when i was born salvatore paused in the sipping of his brandy and made a splendid scowl with gesture of fist and rolling eyes quick as a lizard colin saw that he must appear to know facts which hitherto were only conjecture to him if he was to learn the cause of these grimaces i know all of course uncle salvatore he said you can speak to me quite freely and yet you ask if i was there said salvatore should i have permitted it i was but a boy of eighteen and in a bank at rome but had i known boy as i was i should have gone to your father and have said marry my sister out of hand or face the vengeance of salvatore viagi colin held out his hand you would have done well uncle salvatore he said i thank you for my mothers sake this was so deeply affecting to salvatore that he had to take a little more brandy this made him take a kindlier view of his noble brotherinlaw yet i wrong him he said there was no need for salvatore viagi to intervene for his sisters honour she died countess of yardley an alliance honourable to both of our families indeed yes said colin i am proud of my viagi blood the marriage was at the british consulate of course what day of the month was it do you remember salvatore made a negative gesture the exact date escapes me he said but it was spring march it would have been march i think two letters i got from my beloved rosina at that time in one she told of the marriage in the next of the birth of her sons i have those letters still treasured possessions for the next news of my rosina was that her sweet soul had departed my god what lamentations were mine what floods of neverceasing tears colin thought rapidly and intently as he replenished his uncles glass with brandy no definite scheme formed itself in his mind but whatever possibilities future reflection might reveal to him it would clearly be a good thing to get hold of those letters he might conceivably want to destroy them he leaned forward towards salvatore dear uncle salvatore he said i am going to ask a tremendous favour of you i have nothing of my mothers and i never saw her as you know but i am learning to love her and those letters would be so treasured by me you have the memory of her all those delightful days you must have spent together will you give me those letters i hope before long to come across to naples and see you and my cousins and it would good of you if you would give me them then i shall have something of hers a sob sounded in salvatores voice you shall have them my colin he said and in turn perhaps you can do something for me intercede i pray you with your father he is a generous a noble soul but he does not know my needs and i am too proud to speak of them tell him then that you wrung out of me that i am in abject poverty vittoria is growing up and dowerless maidens are not sought after of course i will do all i can said colin warmly i will talk to my father as soon as you have gone and i may say that he listens to me i will send off the letters to you tonight he said and what joy will there be in casa viagi when my girls know that their cousin colin is to visit us when will that happy day be ah i must write to you about that said colin noticing that the palazzo had become a casa leave me your card and now it is time for you to talk to my father i will see if he is ready but not a word of all we have been saying to him trust me my nephew said salvatore gaily chapter iv colin used his good offices with his father to such effect that he succeeded in procuring for salvatore a further substantial cheque in addition to that which he had carried off with the two bottles of wine that afternoon his uncle apparently thought better of his reckless generosity in sending the letters of which colin was desirous quite unconditionally but the receipt of the second cheque was sufficient and the mornings post two days later brought them they were written in illspelled english and contained precisely what his uncle had told him the first dated march gave the information that she had been married that morning to philip lord stanier the second dated march stated that a week ago she had given birth to twins they were quite brief conveyed no other news and had evidently been preserved with care for the purple ink in which they were written was quite unfaded but apart from the fact now definitely known to colin that his father had legalised his life with rosina but ten days before he himself and raymond were born they did not help in any way towards the attainment of the double object which now was putting out firm fibrous roots in his mind as the ideal project namely to prove by some means yet utterly unconjecturable the illegitimacy of raymond and himself and by marrying violet who in that case would succeed to the title and the estates to become master of stanier indeed these letters were but a proof the more of what was no doubt sufficiently attested in the register of the british consulate namely that the marriage had taken place previously to his own birth it seemed a hopeless business even if by some rare and lucky mischance there was any irregularity in the record at the consulate these letters so long as they were in existence constituted if not a proof at any rate a strong presumption in favour of the marriage having taken place on the first of the month and it might be better to destroy them out of hand so that such testimony as they afforded could not by any possibility be produced and yet he hesitated somehow in his subconscious mind perhaps there was a stir and a ferment which bubbled with a suggestion that had not yet reached his consciousness might not something conceivably be done with them it was maddening that just ten days out of all those uneventful hundreds of days which had elapsed since should suffice to wreck any project that he might make and then a bubble of that ferment broke into his conscious mind there was the letter announcing the marriage which had taken place that day dated march there was the letter dated march announcing the birth of himself and raymond a week previously what if by the insertion of a single numeral in front of the of the first date he converted it into march st as far as these two letters went they would in that case show precisely what he desired psychologically too there would be a reasonable interpretation in his father it would be argued there had sprung up after the birth of his sons a tenderness and an affection for the mother of them and he had married her so that she in the future might bear him legitimate offspring already she had borne two lusty and healthy sons the union was vigorous and fruitful colin got up from the long chair in his bedroom where he had taken these letters and began softly pacing up and down the floor lithe and alert and smiling his father was coming down with him to bathe that morning but there was a quarter of an hour yet before he need join him downstairs and a great deal of thinking might be put into a quarter of an hour if you could only concentrate he knew he was very far yet from the attainment of his ambition for that register at the consulate which somehow he must manage to see might contain insuperable obstacles to success there might for instance be other entries between march of that year and march so that even if he could contrive to alter the first date into the second it would throw those other entries if such existed out of their chronological order the marriage contracted on march would precede those that lay in between the two dates in that case he might have to tear out the page in which this entry occurred and that might be quite impossible of accomplishment it would not be wise at any rate to tamper with the date on this first letter of his mothers till he knew how the ground lay at the consulate but given that it proved possible to make some alteration in the register or tear out a page how conclusively would his case be established if in support of that there were produced those letters of his mother salvatore the troubadour colin frowned and bit his lip at the thought of salvatore who would be ready to swear that when he parted with those letters to colin the one that conveyed the news of his sisters marriage was dated march not march there were experts on such subjects too prying meticulous men who made a profession of detecting little things like altered dates and produced evidence about a difference of hand or a difference in the analysis of two inks yet if the register at the consulate was found to endorse the evidence of the letters the same detectiveminded folk would examine the record at the consulate and might arrive at the damnable conclusion that it too had been tampered with and if the letters which bore signs of being tampered with were in colins possession and he was known to have visited the register at the consulate there would be an unwelcome conclusion as to who had committed a forgery penal servitude was not an agreeable substitute for stanier colin focused his clear brain as if it had been a lens on salvatore he had been very decorative and melodramatic on the subject of his sisters honour but there had been much of cheap strutting of tinsel of footlights about that and salvatore so colin reasoned with a melting and a smoothing out of his frown was not all strutting and swagger there was a very real side to that impecunious uncle with his undowered vittoria his concern for his sisters honour was not surely so dominant in him as his desire for coin a suitable cheque would no doubt induce him to recollect that the first of rosinas letters announced the births of the twins the second that of march her marriage salvatore for love of vittoria to put it at that would probably see the sense of allowing his memory of the dates at the head of this letter to be faulty he would not be obliged to perjure himself in any way all he had got to do given that a page had been torn out of the register at the consulate or that the date of the marriage as recorded there was march was to swear that his sisters letters had always been in his possession until he had given them to his attractive nephew yes salvatore would surely not prove an insuperable obstacle he would rate the living himself and vittoria higher than the dead for one moment brief as that in which according to the legend the ancestral colin had considered whether he should close with that strange offer made him in the sheepfold his descendant his living incarnation hesitated when he thought of his father his father had always been devoted to him and such affection as colin was capable of was his but after all philip would necessarily be dead when and if the discovery was made that rosinas letter to her brother gave the date of the marriage as march and when on search being made in the register of the british consulate it was discovered that owing to a page being missing there was no record of the marriage at all or that the date given there corresponded with that of rosinas letter colin had no intention of producing this evidence in his fathers lifetime there might be counterproofs which his father could produce if he could only make some dealing with the register and with the date on the letter he would let the whole matter sleep till his father was dead then nothing could hurt him you cannot hurt the dead even ifcolin gave little thought to thisthe spirit of the dead survived in consciousness of the living would not his fathers spirit gladly make this posthumous sacrifice of his earthly honour and rejoice to see colin his beloved master of stanier so his hesitation was fleeting as breath on a frosty morning it appeared but mistily and dispersed his father out in the garden was calling him and with a cheerful response he picked up his towels and went downstairs for the present there was but one necessary step to be taken he had to get a day in naples before he left and pay a visit to the british consulate it was no use making any further plans beyond that in his ignorance of what he should find there a visit to his uncle and a night spent there might possibly serve as an excuse philip had also heard from his brotherinlaw this morning the communication was not so satisfactory to him as colins post had been ive heard from salvatore he said hes a nauseating fellow colin oh no only a comic father said colin gaily you take him too heavily read that said philip the letter was certainly characteristic and as colin read his smile broadened into a laugh the writer spoke of the deep humiliation it was for a viagi to take gifts from any it had not been so with them once for the family had been the dispensers of a royal bounty indeed two considerations only made it possible for him to do so the first his paternal devotion to his two sweet maids vittoria and cecilia the second his fraternal devotion to his noble and generous relative that sentiment did honour to them both and with happy tears of gratitude he acknowledged the safe receipt of the cheque he wrote with some distraction for his sweet maids kept interrupting him to know if he had sent their most respectful love to their uncle and had reminded their dearest colin that they looked for his advent with prodigious excitement and pleasure they demanded to know when that hour would dawn for them one bottle of the nectar of france would be preserved for that day to drink the health of his friend his relative his noblest of benefactors he signed himself viagi as if the princely honours had been restored oh but priceless said colin havent you got a sense of humour father not where salvatore is concerned as for your going over to dine and sleep i shant let you do you know weve only got a fortnight more here colin i know isnt it awful said colin with a sigh but about my going over for a night i wonder if i hadnt better do that it would be kind you know he would like it philip passed his hand over the boys shoulders colin are you growing wings he said yes and they dont go well with my cloven hoofs in other words i should loathe spending the night there and yet uncle salvatore would like it then i dont want to leave you dont then salvatore thanks to you has got double his usual allowance youve done enough for him yes but that didnt cost me anything said colin it only cost you ive still my debt to pay for the wonderful entertainment he gave me here besides he is actually my uncle im a viagi princely line father dont marry one of the young princesses said his father colin had one moments acute thought before he answered it struck him that his father could hardly have said that if in his very self he had loved his mother but what he had said just came from his very self he laughed ill promise not to however entrancing vittoria is he said ah how divine the sea looks this morning i long to be in it a sudden idea occurred to him do let us stop on another fortnight father he said cant we i cant said he i must get back by the end of the month but he paused a moment and colin knew that he had caught his own idea which his suggestion was designed to prompt theres no reason why you shouldnt have another fortnight here if you want he said colin had fallen behind his father on the narrow path to the bathingplace and gave a huge grin of satisfaction at his own subtlety oh i should love that he said though it wont be half as much fun as if you would stop too and then i can go over to naples with you when you start homewards and make my wings sprout by staying with uncle salvatore nothing could have fallen out more conveniently and colin as for the next two hours he floated in the warm sea and basked on the hot pebbles had a very busy mind in his lazy drifting body his fathers absence would certainly make his investigations easier he could for instance present lord yardleys card at the consulate with his own and get leave to inspect the register with a view to making a copy of it in accordance with his fathers wishes better yet he could spend a few days in naples make the acquaintance of the consul in some casual manner and produce his request on the heels of an agreeable impression he would not in any case be limited to a single visit or tied by the necessity of acting at once he would not have to fire his bribe with regard to the letters like a pistol in salvatores face he would be careful and deliberate not risking a false step owing to the need of taking an immediate one and all the time the suggestion of stopping on here alone had not come from himself at all his father had made it on the way up to the villa again after the mornings bathe they often called at the postoffice in the piazza for letters that had arrived by the midday post today these were handed under the grille to colin and sorting them out between his father and himself he observed that there were two for lord yardley in the handwritings of raymond and violet possibly these were only the dutiful and trivial communications of those at home but possibly violets week of postponement had been shortened two from stanier for you father he said violet and raymond the rest for me his father looked at the envelopes yes raymonds spider scrawl is evident enough he said i never saw such a handwriting except yours his and yours i can never tell apart one wants leisure to decipher you and raymond colin simmered with impatience to see his father put both of these letters into his pocket and simmered even more ebulliently when having put them on the table at lunch his father appeared to forget completely about them and left them there when lunch was over but colin could remind him of that and presently the one from violet lay open his father gave an exclamation of surprise and then was absorbed in it it appeared to be short for presently he had finished and still without a word to colin opened the letter from raymond here exclamations of impatience at the ugly illegible handwriting took the place of surprise and it was ten minutes more before he spoke to colin he meantime had settled with himself in case these letters contained what he guessed for certain that they must contain that since violets previous warning to him was private he would let the news that his father would presently tell him be a big emotional surprise to him this would entail dissimulation but that was no difficulty colin knew himself to be most convincing when his brain not his sincerity dictated his behaviour have violet and raymond written to you today asked his father colin yawned he generally took a siesta after the long morning in the sea and sun and it was already past his usual hour there was a pleasant fiction that he retired to write letters no he said getting up well im off father lots of letters wait a moment violet and raymond send me news which pleases me very much theyre engaged to be married colin stared then laughed id forgotten it was the first of april he said i thought we were in june we are said his father but its no joke colin im quite serious colin looked fixedly at his father for a moment ah he said and getting up walked to the window he stood there with his back to the room twirling the blindstring and seeming to assimilate the news then as if making a strong effort with himself he turned himself again all sunshine by jove raymond will be happy he said howhow perfectly splendid hes head over ears in love with her has been for the last six months lucky dog hes got everything now he could play on his father like some skilled musician making the chord he wanted to sound with never a mistake those words hes got everything now conveyed exactly the impression he intended namely that violet was to him an important part in raymonds possessions that was the right chord it sounded but it was a great surprise to you colin he said yes father said colin the surprise then was that violet has accepted him said lord yardley gently he felt himself to be probing colins mind ever so tenderly while colin looked at him wideeyed like a child who trusts his surgeon yes father he said again it surprised me very much this was magnificent he knew just what was passing in his fathers mind unstinted admiration of himself for having so warmheartedly welcomed the news of raymonds good fortune and unstinted sympathy because his father had guessed a reason why violets engagement was a shock to him this was immensely to the good for when as he felt no doubt would happen violet threw over raymond for himself lord yardley would certainly remember with what magnanimous generosity he had congratulated raymond on his success whether anything came of his project about the register or not he was determined to marry violet for so the thirst of his hatred of his brother would be assuaged but how long and how sweet would the drink be if in the cup was mingled the other also his father came across the room to where he still stood by the window and laid loving hands on his shoulders colin old boy he said are you fond of violetlike that colin nodded without speech i had no idea of it said lord yardley i often watched you and her together and i thought you were only as brother and sister upon my word raymond seems to have got everything colins smile was inimitable it seemed to fight its way to his beautiful mouth ive got you father he said out of sheer exuberance of wickedness the subject was renewed that night when they sat under the vinewreathed pergola where they had dined the sun bowling down the steep cliff away westward had just plunged into the sea and darkness came swiftly over the sky without that longdrawn period of fading english twilight in which day is slowly transformed into night here night leaped from its lair in the east and with a gulp absorbed the flames of sunset and swiftly the stars sprang from the hidingplaces where all day they had lain concealed and burning large and low made a diffused and penetrating greyness of illumination that dripped like glowing rain from the whole heavens dim and veiled though that luminance was compared to the faintest of the lights of day it gave a curious macabre distinctness to everything and colins face in a pool of starshine that filtered between the trailing garlands of the vines wore to his father some strange wraithlike aspect so often had he sat here in such light as this with rosina opposite him and all that he loved in rosina seemed now to have been reincarnated spectrelike in the boy he cared more for than he cared for all the rest of the world all that he had missed in the woman who had satisfied and so soon sated his physical senses flowered in colin with his quick intelligence his sunny affection and his father for all his longing could do nothing to help him in this darkness which had overshadowed the dawn of love for him instead of colin raymond had got all that son of his whom he had never liked even and had always in some naturallyunnatural manner been jealous of in that he would inherit all that his own fingers would one day relax their hold on had it been colin who would grasp the sceptre of the staniers philip would as he had said close his eyes for his last sleep in unenvious content and now raymond had got the desire of his heart as well which too was the desire of colins heart all day since the arrival of those letters colin had been very quiet yet without any bitterness grave and sweet but only a shadow a ghost of himself for gaiety now his face pale in the starlight was ghostlike also and his father divined in it an uncomplaining suffering infinitely pathetic colin i wish i could do anything for you he said with unusual emotion you are such a dear fellow and you bear it all with such wonderful patience wouldnt it do you good now to curse raymond a little colin felt that he must not overdo the angelic rle oh ive been doing so he said but i think i shall stop its no use it wouldnt hurt raymond even if he knew about it and it doesnt help me and its certainly time i stopped sulking have i been very sulky all evening father apologies youve been a brick but about stopping out here alone are you sure you wont mope and be miserable perhaps i might manage to stay out with you an extra week that would not do at all colin hastened to put that out of the question oh but you must do nothing of the kind he said quickly i know youve got to get back i shant mope at all and i think one gets used to things quicker alone theres only just one thing i wonder about have we both been quite blind about violet has she been in love with raymond without our knowing it i at any rate had no idea of it shes in love with him now i suppose did her letter give you that impression philip hesitated violets letter short and unemotional had not given him any such impression but so triumphantly successful had been colins assumption of the unembittered though disappointed lover that he paused positively afraid that colin would regret that violets heart was not so blissfully engaged as his brothers before he answered colin spoke again ah i see he said shes in love with him and you are afraid it will hurt me to know it ripping of you after all shes lucky too isnt she shes got the fellow she loves and shell be mistress of stanier i think she adores stanier almost as much as you and i father colin felt he could not better this as a conclusion he rose and stretched himself there he said that expresses what i feel in my mind it has been cramped all day and now ive stretched it and am not going to have cramp any more what shall we do stroll down to the piazza or sit here and play piquet i vote for the piazza diversion you know colin pleaded sleepiness on their return from the piazza as an excuse for early retirement but the sleepiness was not of the sort that led to sleep and he lay long awake blissfully content and wondering at himself with an intense and conscious interest never before had it so forcibly struck him that deception was a thing that was dear to him through some inherent attraction of its own irrespective of what material advantages it might bring him it was lovely in itself irrespective of the fruit it bore never yet too had it struck him at all that he disliked love and this was a discovery worth thinking over often especially during these last weeks he had known that his fathers love for him bored him as considered as an abstract quality though he welcomed it as a means to an end that end invariably had been not only the material advantages it brought him but the gratification of his own hatred of raymond for so he unerringly observed his own endearing of himself to his father served to displace raymond more and more and todays manuvres were a brilliant counterattack to the improved position raymond had made for himself in those last weeks at stanier but apart from these ends he had no use for any love that was given him nor any desire to give in return to hate and to get he found when he looked into himself was the mainspring which moved thought word and action outside the evening breeze had quite died down but the silent tranquillity of the summer night was broken by the sound of a footfall on the garden terrace below the window which he knew must be that of his father strolling up and down there for a moment that rather vexed him it seemed to disturb his own isolation for he wanted to be entirely encompassed in himself it was inconsiderate of his father to go quarterdecking out there intruding into his own consciousness besides colin had told him that he was sleepy and he should have kept quiet but then the explanation of his ramble up and down occurred to colin there could be no doubt that his father was troubled for him and was made restless by thinking of him and his disappointment that made colin smile not for pleasure in his fathers love but for pleasure in his trouble he was worrying himself over colins aching heart and the boy had a smile for that pleasing thought it had an incense for him he began to wonder idly at first but with growing concentration whether he hated his father he did not wish him ill but but supposing this business of the register was satisfactorily accomplished and supposing he succeeded as he felt no doubt he would in causing violet to throw over raymond and marry himself he did not see that there would be much gained by his fathers continued existence he would be in the way then he would stand between him and his mastership through violet of stanier that both from his passion for the place and from the joyous triumph of ejecting raymond was the true object of his life possession and hatred to get and to hate his father when these preliminary feats had been carried through would be an obstacle to his getting and he supposed that he would hate him then lying cool and naked under his sheet colin suddenly felt himself flush with the exuberance of desire and vitality hate seemed as infinite as love you could not plumb the depths of the former any more than you could scale the heights of the other while acquisition the clutching and the holding stretched as far as renunciation he who lived for himself would not be satisfied until he had grasped all any more than he who lived for others would not be satisfied until he had given all retaining nothing out of selflove with violet as his wife legal owner of stanier and raymond outcast and disinherited it seemed to colin that he would have all he wanted and yet in this flush of desire that combed through him now as the tide combs through the weeds of the sea he realised that desire was infinite and could never be satisfied when once it had become the master passion no one who is not content will ever be content and none so burned with unsatisfied longing as he if he could not love he could hate and if he could not give he could get the steps on the terrace below had long ceased though absorbed in this fever of himself he had not noticed their cessation his activity of thought communicated itself to his body and it was impossible in this galvanic restlessness to lie quiet in bed movement was necessary and wrapping his sheet round him he went to his open window and leaned out the night was starlit and utterly tranquil no whisper of movement sounded from the stonepine that stood in the garden and challenged by its stirring the most imperceptible of breezes yet to his sense the quiet tingled with some internal and tremendous vibration a force was abroad which held it gripped and charged to the uttermost and it was this force whatever it was that thrilled and possessed him the warm tingling current of it bathed and intoxicated him it raced through his veins bracing his muscles and tightening up the nerves and vigour of him and stretching out his arms he let the sheet drop from him so as to drink it in through every thirsting pore of his body like the foaming water in a loch it rose and rose in him until the limit of his capacity was reached and his level was that of the river that poured it into him and at that so it seemed when now he had opened himself out to the utmost to receive it the pressure which had made him restless was relieved and unutterably tired and content he went back to bed and instantly sank into the profound gulfs of healthy and dreamless slumber his father had usually finished breakfast when colin appeared but next morning it was the boy who was in advance hurrah ive beaten you for once father he said when lord yardley appeared the teas half cold shall i get you some more no this will do slept well colin like a top like a pig like a hog like a dog good lord yardley busied himself with breakfast for a while curious things dreams are he said i dreamed about things i hadnt thought of for years you were so vividly mixed up in them too that i nearly came into your room to see if you were all right i was said colin i was wonderfully all right what was the dream oh one of those preposterous hashes i began dreaming about queen elizabeth and old colin she was paying him a visit at stanier and asked to see the parchment on which he signed the bond of the legend he shewed it her but the blood in which he had signed his own name was so faded that she told him he must sign it again if he wanted it to be valid i was present and saw it all but i had the feeling that i was invisible then came the nightmare part he pricked his arm to get the ink and dipped a pen in it and then looking closely at him i saw that it wasnt old colin at all but you and that it wasnt queen elizabeth but violet i told you not to sign and you didnt seem conscious of me and then i shouted at you in some nightmare of fear and awoke hearing some strangled scream of my own i suppose colin had been regarding his father as he spoke with wide eager eyes but at the conclusion he laughed and lit a cigarette well if you had come in you certainly wouldnt have found me signing anything he said but i cut myself shaving this morning i call that a prophetic dream and i must write to vi and raymond this morning so that will be the signing chapter v lord yardleys residence at his villa at capri had as usual leaked into the diplomatic consciousness and the english ambassador at rome an old acquaintance of his had as usual reminded him of a friendly presence in rome which would be delighted to welcome him if the welcome afforded any convenience to leave by the very early boat from capri and thus catch the paris express that evening was a fatiguing performance would he not therefore when the regretted day for his departure came take the more reasonable midday boat dine and spend the night at the embassy and be sent off from there next day in comfort for the morning express from rome entailed only one night in the train instead of two the british consul at naples would see to his seclusion in the transit from naples to rome where he would be met and wafted to the embassy otherwise an early start from capri and a hurried train connection in rome would deprive his excellency of the great pleasure of a renewal of cordiality his excellency it may be remarked liked an invitation to stanier and there was method in his thoughtfulness this proposal arrived a week before lord yardleys departure a heat wave had drowned the country and already he looked with prospective horror on the notion of two nights in the train it entailed a night in paris and if he was to arrive in england for a debate in the house a departure from capri by the midday boat on tuesday instead of the early boat on wednesday it entailed in fact a few hours less of colin colin saw the shining of his star never had anything for his purpose been so excellently opportune the british consul would be at the station to see his father off and so beyond doubt would he himself on a visit to uncle salvatore an acquaintanceship would be made under the most auspicious and authentic circumstances it all fits in divinely father he said i shall come across with you see you off from naples and then do my duty at uncle salvatores probably if there was nothing to take me to naples i should never have gone but now i shall have to go do let me kill two birds with one stone i shall see the last of youone birdwithout having to get up at five in the morning and i shall have made my visit to uncle salvatore inevitabletwo birds say yes and ill write to him at once it was in the belief that this arrangement had been made that lord yardley left naples a week afterwards mr cecil the british consul had come to the station to secure for him the reserved compartment to rome and that being done had lingered on the platform till the train started at the last moment as he and colin stood together there and while the train was already in motion colin sprang on to the footboard for a final goodbye and with a kiss leaped off again there came a sharp curve and the swaying carriages behind hid the platform from his father colin turned to mr cecil salvatore was in the background for the present it was delightful of you to come to see my father off he said he appreciated it immensely colin paused a moment just the pause that a bather takes before he gets up speed for a running header into the sea he left me a small matter to talk to you about he said i wonder if i might refer to it now mr cecil gave a plump polite little bow pray do mr stanier he said my father wants a copy of the register of his marriage he said and he asked me to copy it out for him the marriage was performed at the british consulate and if you would be so good as to let me copy it and witness it for me i should be so grateful may i call on you in the morning about it it will save trouble he thinks on his death if among his papers there is an attested copy a pleasure said mr cecil you are too kind and you will do me one further kindness i am going back to capri tomorrow for another fortnight and it would be so good of you if you would tell me of a decent hotel where i can pass the night i shall not be able i am afraid to catch the early boat with this business of the copying to do for it leaves does it not at nine and the consulate will not be open by then colin was at full speed now his running feet had indeed left the ground and he was in the air but he was already stiffened and taut so to speak for the plunge he had made all preparation and fully anticipated a successful dividing of the waters for he had already made himself quite charming to mr cecil and attributed his lingering on the platform as much to the pleasure of a sociable ten minutes with him as to the honour done to his father but i will not hear of you staying at a hotel said mr cecil if i can persuade you to pass the night at my flat it adjoins the consulate offices and is close to where the capri boat lies indeed if you wish to catch the early boat we can no doubt manage that little business of yours tonight it will take only a few minutes colin suffered himself to be persuaded and they drove back to the consulate office hours were already over and presently mr cecil led the way into the archiveroom where no doubt colins search would be rewarded but there had come in for him a couple of telegrams delivered after the clerks had gone and he went to his desk in the adjoining room to answer these leaving the boy with the volume containing the year of his fathers marriage the month so said colin was not known to him his father had told him but he had forgottena few minutes search however would doubtless remedy that so mr cecil leaving an official form with him on which to copy the entry fussed away into the next room and colin instantly opened the volume the year was and the month as he very well knew was march there it was on march the first and he ran his eye down to the next entry marriages at the naples consulate apparently were not frequent and the next was dated april the fourth colin had already his pen in hand to make the copy and it remained poised there a moment there was nothing more necessary than to insert one figure before the single numeral and the thing would be done it remained after that only to insert a similar three in the letter which his mother had written to salvatore announcing her marriage on this hot evening the ink would dry as soon as it touched the page and yet he paused his brain beginning to bubble with some notion better yet more inspired more magically apt colin gave a little sigh and the smile dawned on his face he wrote in a three making the date of march into march and then once again he paused watching with eager eyes for the ink to dry on the page then taking up a penknife which lay on the table beside him he erased but not quite erased the three he had just written there he left unerased as if a hurried hand had been employed on the erasure the cusp of the figure and a minute segment of a curve both above and below it looking at the entry as he looked at it now when his work was done with but casual carefulness any inspector of it would say that it recorded the marriage of philip lord stanier to rosina viagi on the first of march but had the inspectors attention been brought to bear more minutely on it he must if directed to hold the page sideways to the light have agreed that there had been some erasure made in front of the figure denoting the day of the month for there was visible the scratching of a penknife or some similar instrument then examining it more closely he would certainly see the cusp of a three the segment of the upper curve and a dot of ink in the place where the lower segment would have been these remnants would scarcely have struck his eye at all had not he noticed that there were the signs of an erasure there with them it was impossible for the veriest tyro in conjecture not to guess what the erasure had been the whole thing took but a halfminute and at the expiration of that colin was employed on the transcription of the record of the marriage he knew that he had to curb a certain trembling of his hand to reduce to a more regular and slower movement the taking of his breath which came in pants as if he had been running half a minute ago no notion of what he had already accomplished had entered his head his imagination had not travelled further than the possibility of changing the date which he knew he should find here into one thirty days later out of the void out of the abyss this refinement in forgery had come to him and he already recognised without detailed examination how much more astute how infinitely more cunning was this emended tampering just now he could spare but a side glance at that for he must copy this entry unaware that pen and penknife had been busy there and take it to plump mr cecil for his signature but the sharp crisp tap of conviction in his mind told him that he had done more magnificently well than his conscious brain had ever suggested to him no longer time than was reasonable for this act of copying alone had elapsed before colin laid down his pen and went into the next room well mr stanier have you done your copying asked cecil yes shall i bring it here for your signature said colin mr cecil climbed down from the high stool where he was perched like some fat cheerful little bird no no he said we must be more businesslike than that i must compare your copy with the original entry before i give you my signature colin knew that the skill with which he had effected the alteration which yet left the entry unaltered would now be put to the test but he felt no qualm whatever as to detection the idea had been inspired and he had no doubt that the execution of it was on the same level of felicitous audacity they passed back into the archiveroom together and the consul sat himself before the volume and the copy yes march the first march the first he said comparing the two philip lord stanier philip lord stanier quite correct ha you have left out a full stop after his name mr stanier yes rosina viagi of via emmanuele he wrote underneath his certificate that this was a true and faithful copy of the entry in the consular archives signed his name stamped it with the official seal and date and handed it to colin that will serve your fathers purpose he said and replacing the volume on its shelf locked the wire door of its bookcase if you will be so good as to wait five minutes he said i will just finish answering a telegram that demands my attention and then i shall be at your service for the evening he gave a discreet little chuckle we will dine en garon he said at a restaurant which i find more than tolerable and shall no doubt contrive some pleasant way of passing the evening naples keeps late hours mr stanier and i should not be surprised if you found the first boat to capri inconveniently early we shall see mr cecil appeared to put off the cares and dignity of officialdom with singular completeness when the days work was over and colin found he had an agreeably juvenile companion ready to throw himself with zest into the diversions whatever they might be of the evening he ate with the appetite of a lioncub consumed a very special wine in magnificent quantities and had a perfect battery of smiles and winks for the neapolitans who frequented the restaurant dulce est desipere in loco he remarked gaily and thats about the sum of the latin that remains to me and after all it can be expressed equally well in english by saying all work no play makes jack a dull boy and when we have finished our wine all the amusements of this amusing city are at your disposal there is an admirable cinematograph just across the road there is a musichall a few doors away but if you choose that you must not hold me responsible for what you hear there or if you think it too hot a night for indoor entertainment there is the galleria umberto which is cool and airy but again if you choose that you must not hold me responsible for what you see there children of nature that is what we neapolitans are we did i say well i feel myself one of them when the consulate is shut not when i am on duty mark that mr stanier but my private life is my own and then i shed my english skin in spite of the diversions of the city colin was brisk enough in the morning to catch the early boat and once more as he had done a month ago on his initial visit to the island he sequestered himself from the crowd under the awning and sought solitude in the dipping bows of the little steamer today however there was no chance of his meditations being interrupted by his father with tedious talk of days spent at sorrento no irksome demonstrations of love were there to be responded to but he could without hindrance explore not only his future path but no less estimate the significance of what he had done already once more then the register of his fathers marriage was secure in the keeping of the consulate mr cecil had looked at it compared colins copy which now lay safe in the breastpocket of his coat with the original and had certified it to be correct colin had run no risk by inserting and then erasing a figure which might prove on scrutiny to be a subsequent addition mr cecil himself had been unaware that any change had been wrought on the page but when the register on lord yardleys death should be produced in accordance with the plan that was already ripening and maturing in colins mind a close scrutiny would reveal that it had been tampered with some hand unknown had clearly erased a figure there altering the date from march to march the object of that would be clear enough for it legalised the birth of the twins rosina had borne it was in the interest of any of four people to commit that forgeryof his father of his mother of raymond and of himself rosina was dead now these many years his father when the register was next produced would be dead also and from dead lips could come neither denial nor defence raymond might be left out of the question altogether for never yet had he visited his mothers native city and of those alive when the register was produced suspicion could only possibly attach to himself it would have been in his interest to make that alteration which should establish his legitimacy as well as that of his brother colin as he sat alone in the bows fairly burst out laughing before he proceeded to consider the wonderful sequel he would be suspected would he then how would it come about that it was he who in the nobility of stainless honour would produce his own mothers letter given him by his uncle in which she announced to her brother that she was married at the british consulate on the st of march had he been responsible for that erasure in the consulate register to legitimatise his own birth how conceivably could he not only not conceal but bring forward the very evidence that proved his illegitimacy had he tampered with the consular book he must have destroyed the letter which invalidated his forgery but instead of destroying it he would produce it there was work ahead of him here and intrigue in which salvatore must play a part the work of course was in itself nothing the insertion at the top of one of the two letters he owned of just that one figure which he had inserted and erased again in the register was all the manual and material business a bottle of purple ink and five minutes practice would do that but the intrigue was more difficult salvatore must be induced to acquiesce in the fact that the date of the letter announcing rosinas marriage was subsequent to that announcing the birth of the twins that would require thought and circumspection there must be no false step there and all this was but a preliminary manuvring for the great action whereby though at the cost of his own legitimacy he should topple raymond down from his place and send him away outcast and penniless and himself with violet for wife now legal owner of all the wealth and honours of the family become master of stanier she might for the love of him which he believed was budding in her heart throw raymond over and marry him without cognisance of what he had done for her but he knew from knowledge of himself how overmastering the passion for stanier could be and it might happen that she would choose raymond with all that marriage to him meant and stifle the cry of her love in that case perhaps indeed in any case colin might find it better to make known to her the whole namely that on his fathers death she would find herself in a position to contest the succession and claim everything for her own which of them raymond or himself would she choose to have for husband in these changed circumstances she disliked and proposed to tolerate the one for the sake of the great prize of possession she was devoted to the other who so she would learn had become possessed of the fact on which her ownership was established or should he tell her all reveal his part in it on this point he allowed his decision to remain in abeyance what he should do whether he should tell violet nothing or part or all must depend on circumstances and for the present he would waste no more time over that for the present too he would keep the signed and certified copy of his fathers marriage the point which demanded immediate consideration was that concerning salvatore colin puzzled this out sometimes baffled and frowning sometimes with a clear course lying serene in front of his smiling eyes as the steamer leaving the promontory of the mainland behind approached the island he must see salvatore whom he had quite omitted to see in naples as soon as possible and it would be much better to see him here in the privacy of the villa than seek him thought colin in the publicity of the palazzo viagi surrounded by those siren dames vittoria and cecilia he would write at once a pensive and yet hopeful little epistle to uncle salvatore wondering if he would come across to capri yet once again not for the mere inside of a day only but for a more hospitable period his father had left for england colin was alone and there were matters to be talked over that weighed on his conscience that was a good phrase uncle salvatore would remember what colin had already done in the matter of the reduplicated cheque and it would seem that the generous fellow had a debt of conscience yet unliquidated this conveyed precisely the right impression in a postscript he would hint at the french nectar which still dozing in the cellar he hesitated a moment and then decided not to mention the subject of his mothers letters for it was better that since they were the sole concern of his visit uncle salvatore should have the matter sprung upon him a bottle of purple ink no that would not be necessary yet for the later that you definitely committed yourself to a course of action the better colins letter produced just the effect that he had calculated on salvatore read into the conscienceclause a generous impulse and congratulated himself on the departure of that grim dry brotherinlaw to whom for he had tried that before tears and frayed cuffs made no appeal he had accordingly given that up and for his last visit here made himself nobly resplendent but to colin in the guilelessness of his blueeyed boyhood a tale of pinching and penury might be a suitable revelation and it was a proud but shabby figure which presented itself at the villa a few evenings later without more luggage than could be conveniently conveyed in a paper parcel colin who had been observing the approach from the balcony of his bedroom ran down choking with laughter that must be choked to let his uncle in ah this is nice he said you have no idea how welcome you are it was good of you to take pity on my loneliness what a jolly evening we shall have and vittoria and cecilia how are they a gleam brightened uncle salvatores gloom and he fervently pressed colins hand they are well thank god he said and while that is so what matters anything he appeared with a gesture of his hand to pluck some intruding creature from the region of his heart and throw it into the gardenbeds then he gave a little skip in the air collino mio he said you charm away my sad thoughts whatever happens tomorrow i will be gay tonight i will not drag your brightness down into my gloom and darknesses away with them then colin fathomed the mountebank mind with an undeviating plummet the depth or shallowness of it answered his fairest expectations he found nothing inconsistent in this aspect of salvatore with that which he had last presented here the two in fact tallied with the utmost exactitude as the expression of one mind they both chimed true to the inspiring personality he waited completely confident for the advent of the opportunity that came towards the end of dinner without even having been hilarious salvatore had at least been cheerful and now as suddenly as if a tap had been turned off the flow of his enjoyment ceased he sighed he cleared his throat he supported his head on his hands and stared at the tablecloth to colin these signals were unmistakable youre in trouble uncle salvatore he said softly and now for the first time i am glad that my father has gone back to england if he were here i should not be able to say what i mean to say for after all he is my father and he has always been most generous to me but he is not equally generous to others who have claims on him i have tried to make him see that and as you and i know i have succeeded to some small extent but the extent to which i have succeeded does not satisfy me considering all that i know i am determined to do better for you than i have been able to make him do if i am his son i am equally my mothers son and you are her brother colin paused a moment and sudden as a highland spate inspiration flooded his mind he had not thought out with any precision what he meant to say for that must depend on salvatore who might equally well have adopted the attitude of a proud and flashy independence but he had declared for frayed cuffs and a fit of gloom and colin shaped his course accordingly and i cant forget he said that it was you who put me in possession of certain facts when you sent me those two letters of my mother i learned from them what i had never dreamed of before i never in the wildest nightmare thought that my father had not married your sister till after my birth i should have had to know that sometime on my fathers death it must have come out and you have shown a wonderful delicacy in breaking the fact to me like that i thank you for that uncle salvatore i owe you a deep debt of gratitude which i hope to repay colin listened to his own voice which seemed to make itself articulate without any directing will of his own the summer night was charged with the force of obedience to which his tongue moved against his teeth and his lips formed letters and his throat gave the gutturals literally he did not know what he was going to say till he heard himself saying it the breeze whispered in the stonepine and he spoke the breeze was still now and the stonepine was silent but he had said enough to make it necessary that salvatore should reply presently a bat would flit through the arches of the pergola where they dined or the wind would stir in the pine and then he would speak again there was just that same stir abroad on the night when he had listened from his bedroom to his fathers footfalls on the terrace what do you mean collino said his uncle excitedly i cannot understand what you say my sainted rosina married your father on the first of march for i glanced at the letters again before i sent them to you your birth colin interrupted ah a bat he said i love bats if you hold a handkerchief up does not a bat come to it let us interrupt our conversation for a moment he spread his handkerchief over his head and next moment salvatore leaped to his feet for there beadyeyed and diabolical with hooked wings as of parchment spread out on either side of its furry body one of the great southern bats alighted making a cap for colins golden head only for a moment it stopped there and then flitted off into the dusk again soft furry thing said colin but you hate them do you uncle salvatore it was stupid of me let us talk again he hitched his chair a little closer to the table and looked salvatore straight in the eyes but you have forgotten the dates on those letters you gave me he said my mother was married to my father not on the first of march but on the thirtyfirst the second letter recording raymonds birth and mine was written on the seventeenth again he paused raymond and i were born he said slowly and distinctly before my fathers marriage the letters which you gave me prove it if further proof was wanted you would find it at the consulate where the marriage took place some one has tampered with the register and the date has been made to look as if it recorded the first of march but it does not it records the thirtyfirst of march and the three has been erased but it is still visible i saw it myself for i went across to naples to see my father off and subsequently at the consulate made a copy of the entry i should have proposed myself to stay with you that night uncle salvatore but i had no spirit left in me to see anybody when you sent me those two letters of my mother i hoped against hope perhaps that there was some ghastly mistake i nearly destroyed them indeed in order that from them at any rate there should be no conceivable evidence but when i saw the entry in the book at the consulate with the mark of the erasure visible to any careful scrutiny i knew that it was no use to fight against facts on my fathers death the evidence of the date of his marriage must be produced and it will be clear what happened my mother bore him two boysi was one subsequently he married her hoping i have no doubt to beget from her an heir to the name and the property the wind sighed heavily in the pine and little stirs of it rustled the vineleaves is it at no cost to me said colin that i keep my mothers letter which proves raymond and me to be bastards oh it is an ugly word and if you were me you would know that it is an ugly thing without my mothers letter which you sent me it would be hard indeed to prove indeed any one might copy out the entry at the consulate and fail to see the erasure altogether raymond at my fathers death would succeed and i his twin beloved of him would take an honourable place in the eyes of the world for it is not nothing to be born a stanier colins voice was soft and steadfast but my mothers letter to you makes it impossible for me to have honour in the eyes of the world and to preserve my own he said ah why did you send me those two letters uncle salvatore it was in all innocence and kindness that you sent them and you need not remind me that i asked for them having seen them what could any one with a shred of honour do but to admit the truth of the whole ghastly business the only wish that i have is that my father shall not know that i know all i want is that he when the hour of his death comes should hope that the terrible fraud which has been practised will never be detected but for that letter of my mothers that would undoubtedly have happened the register at the consulate would have been copied at his death by some clerk and the consul would have certificated its accuracy look at me then now and look at yourself in the same light you of unblemished descent and me and raymond salvatore had certainly woke out of his dejection but its impossible he cried beating the table i sent you two letters the first dated march the first announced my sainted rosinas marriage to your father where is it produce it colin was quite prepared for that he put his sunbrowned fingers into his breastpocket and drew out a paper i cant show you the original letters he said because it was clearly my duty to put them into inviolable custody as soon as possible i sent them in fact as soon as i had seen the register at the consulate to my bank with orders that they were to be kept there until i gave further instructions or until the news of my death reached them in that case uncle salvatore i gave instructions that they were to be sent to my father but before i despatched them to the bank i made a copy of them and here that copy is he passed over to his uncle the copy he had made of the letter that afternoon before instead of sending it to the bank he locked the original safely away upstairs it was an accurate copy except that it was dated march salvatore took it and read it it tallied but for the date with his recollection of it but it is impossible he said for years i have known that letter when i gave it you it was dated march the first do you imply that i altered it asked colin not a living eye has seen that letter but mine give me any reason for altering it why should i make myself nameless and illegitimate salvatore looked that in the face the validity of it stared at him unflinchingly but i cant believe it there is some huge mistake said salvatore often have i read that letter of rosinas march the first was the date of her marriage i will swear to that nothing shall shake my belief in that colin shook his head in answer what good will that do he said you gave the letter to me and no hand but mine has ever touched it the letter must be produced some day not for many years i hope and trust but on my fathers death it must come to light how will your recollections stand in the face of that evidence which all can see salvatore glanced round they were alone with the fitful wind in the pine destroy the letter collino he said save your mothers honour and your own colin gave him one glance soft and pitiful ah you must not suggest that to me he said you must not add force to the temptation i can only just resist but where would my honour be if i did that what shred of it would be left me how could i live a lie like that colin leaned forward and put his hand on salvatores arm i have got to accept my illegitimacy he said and if you are sorry for me as i think you are you can shew it best by accepting it too it would be infinitely painful to me when this revelation is made as it will have to be made on my fathers death to have you attempting to save my mothers honour and my own as you put it just now by insisting that this letter bore another date i should never have a moments peace if i thought a scene like that was ahead of me in fact i want to be assured against that and the only way i can think of to make that safe is that when you get back to naples tomorrow you should write me a couple of lines saying how you feel for me in this discovery that is new to me and then i want you to name the discovery which is the date of my mothers marriage i want you to accept that date and give me proof that you accept it colin made a gesture with his hand as if cutting off that topic and instantly spoke again with my cousin vittoria growing up he said you must be put to expenses which it is impossible for you to meet out of the pittance my father gives you he wronged you and your family most terribly and i must repair that wrong when i get that letter of yours uncle salvatore i will send you a cheque for colin gave a glance at his uncle to make sure that there was no faintest sign of dissent there was none and he went on i see you understand me he said so let us go a step further if my brother raymond dies before my father i will make that five hundred pounds an annuity to you and i will destroy both the letter i ask you to write now and the letter of my mothers about which we have been talking you will never be asked to say anything about either of them if on the other hand my father dies first and if i make the marriage which i expect to make i shall have to use your letter and that letter of my mothers you may be asked to swear to the genuineness of the letter which i hope you will write me tomorrow and to the recollection of my mothers letter which will tally with it have another glass of this delicious french wine he had no need to think what he was saying or frame a specious case he spoke quite simply and directly as if by some inspiration as if he was an olian harp hung in the wind which whispered through the stonepine i dont think there is need for any discussion he said though of course if you like to ask me any question i will consider whether i shall answer it but i dont think there is need for any question is there you might tell me i fancy straight off whether you accept or reject my proposal if you reject it perhaps i had better tell you that it is exceedingly unlikely that my father will give you any further assistance financially for as you know i have a good deal of influence with him it would not pay you to refuse would it and as to threatening me with making this conversation of ours public with a view to getting money out of me i know your gentlemanly feelings would revolt against such an idea besides it would be singularly unremunerative for no one would possibly believe you our conversation and my proposal would strike anybody as incredible and you are not perjuring yourself in any way you did send me a letter of my mothers and you will i hope write me another letter tomorrow saying that the story of my mothers marriage is very shocking which is indeed true so shall it be yes or no uncle salvatore salvatore superstitious like most southern italians to the core found himself making the sign of the cross below the table apart from the obvious material advantage of accepting colins offer he felt that some fierce compelling agency was backing colin up that dreadful little incident of the bat had already upset him and now in colins blue gay glance so earnestly fixed on him he divined some manifestation of the evil eye which assuredly it were not wise to provoke into action and as if in turn colin divined his thought he spoke again better say yes uncle salvatore he said my friends lead more enjoyable lives than my enemies but whatever you answer i want your answer now perhaps through some strange trick of light played by the guttering candles it suddenly seemed to salvatore that colins eyes undeviatingly fixed on his face seemed in themselves luminous as if a smouldering light actually burned behind them i accept he said quickly for vittorias sake colin took up his glass i thought i should move your paternal heart dear uncle salvatore he said i drink to our pleasant bargain chapter vi though colin had taken the news of his brothers engagement with so touching and unselfish a gentleness his father in spite of the joy of seeing the boy again looked forward to his arrival at stanier with considerable uneasiness the trouble and the trial for him would be when he saw raymond and violet together though to be sure violet did not seem to him to embody any ideal of maidenly rapture with her affianced she seemed indeed to tolerate rather than adore her lover to permit rather than to provoke and to answer with an effort the innumerable little signals of devotion which raymond displayed for her about the quality of his devotion there could be no question it was clear that in his own fashion and with all his heaviness and awkwardness in expression he was utterly in love with her he had no eyes for any one but her but for her his eyes were doglike in fidelity when she was absent his senses dozed they were just for the present this party of three lady hester had gone back to town after the departure of colin and his father to the south and ronald and his wife had betaken themselves for the month of july to marienbad in order to enable him to continue eating too much for the next eleven months without ill effects every evening old lady yardley appeared for dinner and made the fourth but she was not so much a presence as a shadow in colins absence she hardly ever spoke though each night she monotonously asked when he was expected back then after the rubber of whist mutely conducted she retired again and remained invisible till the approach of the next dinnerhour so long had she been whitely impassive that philip scarcely noticed the mist that was thickening about her mind raymond then was comprehensible enough he was head over ears in love with violet and nothing and nobody but her had any significance for him but doglike though his devotion was it struck his father that there was in the absence of violets response something rather animal about it had she met with more than mere toleration his glances his little secret caresses his thirst for contact even of fingertips or a leaning shoulder there would have been the spark the leap of fire which gives warmth and life to such things but without it there was a certain impalpable grossness raymond did not seem to care that his touch should be responded to it contented him to touch but though he to his fathers mind was comprehensible enough violet puzzled him for she seemed even before her marriage to have adopted the traditional impassivity of stanier brides she had professed in the one interview she had had with him a quiet acceptance of her position and a devotion to raymond of which the expression seemed to be a mute passivity towards the question of the date of her marriage she had no contribution to give lord yardley and raymond must have the settling of that and with the same passivity she accepted a date in the first week of october then the great glass doors would be opened and the bridegrooms wing long shuttered for philips bride had never come here would see the light again she asked no question whatever about colins return his name never presented itself on her lips unless mere conventional usage caused it to be spoken it was as if the boy with whom she had been so intimately a friend had ceased to exist for her but when philip once consciously noted that omission he began to wonder if violet was not comprehensible after all these days in any case after philips return while colin still lingered in italy were worthy of the stateliest and deadliest stanier traditions colin had been expected all one long july afternoon his announcement of his arrival had been ambiguous for he might catch the early train from paris and thus the earlier boat but the connection was uncertain and if he missed it he would not get to dover till six in the evening in that case he would sleep in london and come down to stanier next day philip had read this out at breakfast that morning and for once violet shewed some interest in colin why not send a motor to dover uncle philip she said it can get there in time for the first boat and if he is not on it it can wait for the second he will arrive here then by dinner time raymond looked up from his paper at the sound of her voice vi darling what an absurd plan he said there are a hundred chances to one on colins not finding the motor hell get straight into the train from the boat violet instantly retreated into that strange shell of hers again ah yes she said philips curiosity put forth a horn at this there was some new element here for raymond seemed to resent the idea of special arrangements being made for colin thats not a bad idea of yours violet he said it will save colin going up to london as he spoke he kept a sideways eye on raymond but father think of the crush getting off the boat he said the chances are that colin wont see your chauffeur he spoke with an impatient anger which he could not cloak and which rang out unmistakably in his voice well take the off chance then said his father raymond got up just as you like he said philip paused a moment the relations between himself and raymond had been excellent up till today raymond without charm which was not his fault had been pleasant and agreeable but now this matter of meeting colin had produced a spirit of jealous temper naturally i shall do just as i like he observed ring the bell please raymond the motor will have to start at once though none of the three communicated the news of colins arrival to old lady yardley it somehow got round to her via perhaps some servants gossip about a motor going to dover and most unusually she came downstairs at teatime with inquiries whether colin had arrived it was soon clear that he could not have caught the early boat or he would have been here by now and thus three hours at least must elapse before his arrival could be looked for but in spite of this old lady yardley did not go back to her room again but remained upright and vigilant in her chair on the terrace where they had had tea looking out over the plain where across the gardens and lake appeared glimpses of the road along which the motor must come philip had intended to go for a ride but he too when his servant told him that his horse was round lingered on and shewed no sign of moving neither he nor his mother gave any reason for their remaining so unusually here but somehow the cause of it was common property colin was coming raymond similarly had announced his intention of going to bathe but had not gone instead he fidgeted in his chair smoked took up and dropped the evening paper and made aimless little excursions up and down the terrace his restlessness got on his fathers nerves well go and bathe if you mean to raymond he said or if you like take my horse and go for a ride but for goodness sake dont keep jumping about like that thanks i think i wont ride father he said i shall be having a bathe presently or would you feel inclined for a game of tennis vi i think its rather too hot said she he sat down on the arm of her chair but she gave no welcome to him nor appeared in any way conscious of his proximity in that rather gross fashion of his he gently stroked a tendril of loose hair just behind her ear for a moment she suffered that without moving then she put up her hand with a jerky uncontrolled movement and brushed his away oh please raymond she said in a low voice he had a sullen look for that and shrugging his shoulders got up and went into the house his father gave a sigh of relief the reason for which needed no comment colin will be here for dinner wont he asked old lady yardley yes mother said philip but wont you go and rest before that i think i will sit here said she and wait for colin presently raymond was back again with a copy of some illustrated paper violet and philip alike felt the interruption of his presence they were both thinking of colin and raymond even if he sat quiet was a disturbance a distraction soon he was by violets side again shewing her some picture which he appeared to think might interest her and philip watching the girl felt by some sympathetic vibration how great an effort it was for her to maintain that passivity which all those days had so encompassed her the imminence of colins arrival he could not but conjecture was what troubled her tranquillity and below it there was some stir some subaqueous tumult not yet risen to the surface and only faintly declaring itself in these rising bubbles raymond had placed the paper on her knee and turning the page let his hand rest on her arm bare to the elbow instantly she let it slip to her side and raising her eyes at the moment caught philips gaze the recognition of something never mentioned between them took place and she turned to raymonds paper again quite excellent she said such a good snapshot of aunt hester show it to uncle philip raymond could not refuse to do that and the moment he had stepped over to philips side she got up that passivity was quite out of her reach just now in this tension of waiting soon colin would be here and she would have to face and accept the situation but the waiting for it if only even something could happen to colin which would prevent his arrival why had she suggested that sending of the motor to dover had she not done that he could not have got here till tomorrow morning and she would have had time to harden to crystallise herself to render herself impervious to any touch from outside she was soon to be a stanier bride and there in the tall chair with the ivory cane was the pattern and example for her it was on old lady yardley that she must frame herself quenching any fire of her own and content to smoulder her life away as mistress of the family home which she so adored and of all the countless decorations and riches of her position never had the wonder and glory of the place seemed to her so compelling as when now driven from the terrace by raymonds importunity she walked along its southern front and through the archway in the yewhedge where she and colin had stood on his last night here it dozed in the tranquillity of the july evening yellow and magnificent the empress of human habitations round it for pillow were spread its woodlands on its breast for jewel lay the necklace of deep flowerbeds tranquil and stable through its three centuries it seemed the very symbol and incarnation of the pride of its owners to be its mistress and the mother of its lords yet unborn was a fate for which she would not have exchanged a queens diadem whatever conditions might be attached to it she would accept themas indeed she had already pledged herself to dowith the alacrity with which its founder had in the legend signed his soul away in that bargain which had so faithfully been kept by the contracting parties and it was not as if she disliked raymond she was merely utterly indifferent to him and longing for the time when in the natural course of things he would surely grow indifferent to her how wise and indulgent to his male frailties would she then show herself how studiously and how prudently blind with the blindness of those who refuse to see to any infidelities had there not been in the world a twinbrother of his or even if that must be if she had not stood with him under this sergearch of yews beneath the midsummer moon and given him that cousinly kiss she would not now be feeling that his return or at any rate the waiting for it caused a tension that could scarcely be borne she had made her choice and had no notionso her conscious mind told herof going back on it it was just this experience of seeing colin again for the first time after her choice had been made that set her nerves twanging at raymonds touch could she by a wish or the wave of a wand put off colins advent until she had actually become raymonds wife how passionately would she have wished how eagerly have waved or if by some magic black or white she could have put colin out of her life so that never would she set eyes on him again or hear his voice his banishment from her would at that moment have been accomplished she would not admit that she loved him she doggedly told herself that she did not and her will was undeviatingly set on the marriage which would give her stanier surely she did not love colin they had passed all their lives in the tranquillity of intimate friendship unruffled by the faintest breath of desire and then in spite of her dogged assertion she found that she asked herself incredulously enough whether on that last evening of colins the seed of fire had not sprouted in her she disowned the notion but still it had reached her consciousness and then fiercely she reversed and denied it for she abhorred the possibility it would be better that she should hate colin than love him the evening was stiflingly hot and in the park where her straying feet had led her there was no breath of wind stirring to disperse the heaviness the air seemed thick with fecundity and decay there was the smell of rotting wood of crumbling fungi overripe that mingled with the sharp scent of the bracken and the faint aroma of the oaks and buzzing swarms of flies gave token of their carrion banquets the open ground to the north of the house was no better to her sense of overwrought expectancy it seemed as if some siege and beleaguerment held her she wanted to escape but an impalpable host beset her not of these buzzing flies only and of the impenetrable oppression of the sultry air through which she could make no sortie but internally and spiritually of encompassing foes and hostile lines through which her spirit had no power to break there on the terrace from which as from under some fire she could not face she had lately escaped there would be the physical refreshment of the current of seawind moving up as was its wont towards sunset across the levels of the marsh but there to this same overwrought consciousness would be raymond assiduous and loverlike with odious little touches of his affectionate fingers but so she told herself it was enforced on her to get used to them he had a right to them and it was colin after all who was responsible for her shrinking from them even as she shrank from the evil buzzings of the flies if only she had not kissed colin or if having done that he had felt a tithe of what it had come to signify to her but no hint of heartache no wish that fate had decreed otherwise had troubled him he had asked for a cousinly kiss and in that light geniality of his he had said out of mere politeness and out of hatred for raymond no less light and genial that it was maddening to think that his brother would be the next visitor there she had waited for his reply to her letter announcing that raymond had proposed to her and that she was meaning to accept him with a quivering anxiety which gave way when she received his answer to a sense of revolt which attempted to call itself relief he seemed so far from finding the news maddening to welcome and rejoice in it he congratulated her on achieving her ambition of being mistress of stanier and on having fallen in love with raymond he could not be hurtas she had fearedat her news it was altogether charming she had expressed the charitable hope that he would not be hurt and with claws and teeth her charity had come home to roost it had dreadful habits in its siesta it roosted with fixed talons and sleepless lids it cried to the horses of the night to go slowly and delay the dawn for so it would prolong the pleasures of its refreshment and each day it rose with her strengthened and more vigorous had colin only rebelled at her choice that would have comforted her she would have gathered willpower from his very opposition but with his acquiescing and welcoming she had to bear the burden of her choice alone if he had only cared he would have stormed at her and like the elizabethan flirt she would have answered his upbraidings with a smile as it was the smile was his not hers almost to win his upbraidings she would have sacrificed the goodly heritageall the honour and the secular glory of it perhaps by now for she had wandered far the rest of them might have dispersed her grandmother to the seclusion of her own rooms uncle philip to the library and raymond to the lake and she let herself into the house by the front door and passed into the hall the great holbein above the chimney piece smiled at her with colins indifferent lips the faded parchment was but a blur in the dark frame and she went through into the long gallery which faced the garden front all seemed still outside and after waiting a moment in the entrance she stepped on to the terrace and there they were still her grandmother alert and vigilant philip beside her and raymond dozing in his chair with his illustrated paper fallen from his knee what ailed them all that they waited like this above all what ailed her that she cared whether they waited or not soundless though she hoped her first footfalls on the terrace had been they were sufficient to rouse raymond he sat up his sleepiness all dispersed hullo vi he said where have you been just for a stroll said she why didnt you tell me i would have come with you suddenly old lady yardley rose and pointed down on to the road across the marsh colin is coming she said theres his motor certainly a mile away there was to violets young eyes an infinitesimal speck on the white riband but to the dimness of the old that must surely have been invisible lord yardley following the direction of her hand could see nothing no mother theres nothing to be seen yet he said proving that he too was absorbed in this unaccountable business of waiting for colin but i am right she said you will see that i am right i must go to the front door to welcome him she let the stick without which she never moved slide from her hand and with firm step and upright carriage walked superbly down the terrace to the door of the gallery he is coming home she cried he is coming for his bride and there will be another marriage at stanier let the great glass doors be opened they have not been opened for the family since i came here sixty years ago they were never opened for my poor son philip i will open them if no one else will i am strong tonight philip moved to her side no its raymond you are thinking of mother he said they will be opened in october you shall see them opened then she paused some shade of doubt and anxiety dimming this sudden brightness and laid her hand on her sons shoulder raymond she said yes of course i was thinking of raymond raymond and violet but to please me my dear will you not open them now for colin colin has been so long away it is as if a bridegroom came when colin comes we are only ourselves here the staniers may do what they like in their own house may they not i should love to have the glass doors open for colins return the speck she had seen or divined on the road had come very swiftly nearer and now it could be seen that some white waving came from it i believe it is colin after all said raymond how could she have seen old lady yardley turned a grave glance of displeasure on him do not interrupt me when i am talking to your father she said the glass doors philip raymond with a smile halfindulgent of senile whims halfprotesting turned to the girl glass doors indeed he said the next glass doors are for us eh violet surely some spell had seized them all violet found herself waiting as tensely as her grandmother for philips reply she was hardly conscious of raymonds hand stealing into hers all hung on her uncles answer and he as if he too were under the spell turned furiously on raymond the glass doors are opened when i please he said your turn will come to give orders here raymond but while i am at stanier i am master once for all understand that he turned to his mother again yes dear mother he said you and i will go and open them inside the house no less than among the watchers on the terrace the intelligence that colin was at hand had curiously spread footmen were in the hall already and the majordomo was standing at the entrance door which he had thrown open and through which poured a tide of hot air from the baking gravel of the courtyard exactly opposite were the double glass doors venetian in workmanship and heavily decorated with wreaths and garlands of coloured glass the bolts and handles and hinges were of silver and old lady yardley crippled and limping no longer moved quickly across to them and unloosing them threw them open inside was the staircase of cedar wood carved by gibbons which led up to the main corridor opposite the door that gave entrance to the suite of rooms occupied by the eldest son and his wife what strange fancy possessed her brain none knew and why philip allowed and even helped her in the accomplishment of her desire was as obscure to him as to the others but with her he pushed the doors back and the sweet odour of the cedar wood confined there for the last sixty years flowed out like the scent of some ancient vintage then even as the crunching of the motor on the gravel outside was heard stopping abruptly as the car drew up at the door she swept across to the entrance already colin stood in the doorway for coolness he had travelled bareheaded and the gold of his hair tossed this way and that made a shining aureole round his head his face tanned by the southern suns was dark as bronze below it and from that ruddybrown his eyes turquoise blue gleamed like stars he was more like some lordly incarnation of life and sunlight and springsplendour than a handsome boy complete and individual a presence of wonder and enchantment stood there then swift as a swordstroke the spell which had held them all was broken it was but colin dusty and hot from his journey and jubilant with his return granny darling he said kissing her how lovely of you to come and meet me like this father ever so many thanks for sending the motor for me ah and there are violet and raymond raymond be nice to me let me kiss you for though were grown up were brothers and violet i want a kiss from violet too she mustnt grudge me that what the glass doors open ah of course in honour of the betrothal raymond you lucky fellow how i hate you but i thought that was only done when the bridegroom brought his bride home a whim of your grandmothers said philip hastily disowning apparently his share in it instantly colin was by the old ladys side again granny how nice of you he said but youve got to find me a bride first before i go up those stairs and even then its only the eldest son who may isnt it but it was nice of you to open the doors because i was coming home he had kissed raymond lightly on the cheek and violet no less lightly and both in their separate and sundered fashions were burning at it raymond in some smouldering fury at what he knew was colins falseness violet with the hot searing iron of his utter indifference and then light as foam and iridescent as a sunlit bubble of the same he was back with his father again leaving them as in some hot desert place and dinner must now be put off growled raymond to himself because colin wanted to have a bathe first and wash off the dust and dryness of his journey and his father would stroll down after him and bring his towel so that he might run down at once without going upstairs colin had come home it appeared with the tactics that were to compass his strategy rehearsed and ready never had his charm been of so sunny and magical a quality and by contrast never had raymond appeared more uncouth and bucolic but raymond now so ran his fathers unspoken comment on the situation had an ugly weapon in his hand under the blows of which colin winced and started for more than ever he was prodigal of those little touches and caresses which he showered on violet philip could not blame him for it it was no more than natural that a young man engaged and enamoured should use the light license of a lover indeed it would have been unnatural if he had not done so often and often ten times in the evening philip would see colin take himself in hand and steadfastly avert his eyes from the corner where raymond and violet sat but ever and again that curious habit of selftorture in lovers whom fate has not favoured would assert itself and his eyes would creep back to them and seeing raymond in some loverlike posture recall themselves and as often the sweetness of his temper and his natural gaiety would reassert its ray and the usual light nonsense the frequent laugh flowed from him exquisite too was his tact with violet he recognised it was clear that their old boyandgirl intimacy must in these changed conditions be banished he could no longer go away with her alone to spend the morning between tenniscourt and bathing pool or with his arm round her neck stroll off with a joint book to read reclined in the shade not only would that put raymond into a false position he the enamoured the betrothed but so argued the most pitiless logic of which his father was capable that resumption of physical intimacy as between boy and boy would be a tearing of colins very heartstrings not only for himself but for her also in such sort of intimacy colin with his brisk blood and ardent lust of living could scarcely help betraying himself and surely then violet little though she might care for raymond would see her pool of tranquil acceptance shattered by this plunge of a stone into the centre of it her liking for colin was deep and she would not fail to see that for her he had even profounder depths a light would shine in those drowned caves and colin as wise as he was tender seemed to shew his wisdom by keeping on the surface with violet and only shining on her tranquillity never breaking it sometimesso thought his fatherhe shewed her a face which in virtue of their past intimacy was almost too gaily indifferent she would attempt some perfectly trivial exhibition of their old relations perch herself on the arm of his chair and with the contrast of his bronzed face and golden hair tell him that he must gild his face like the grooms in macbeth or dye his hair but on the instant he would be alert and spring up leaving her there for the need of a cigarette or a match he allowed her not the most outside chance of resuming ordinary cousinly relations with him his motive was sound enough loving her he mistrusted himself she was sealed to be his brothers wife and he must not trust himself within sight of the notice to trespassers it was better to make himself a stranger to her than to run the risk of betraying himself so at least it struck an outsider to colins consciousness he avoided then all privacy with violet and no less carefully he avoided privacy with raymond if the three men were together and his father left them colin would be sure to follow him and if they all three sat up together in the smokingroom colin would anticipate the signal of a silence or of his fathers yawning or observation of the clock to go to bed himself here again he almost overdid the part for as the first week after his return went by philip firmly determined to be just to raymond thought he saw in him some kind of brotherly affection for colin which the latter either missed or intentionally failed to respond to there could be no harm in a seasonable word and when one morning raymond after half a dozen chill responses from his brother had left him and colin together philip thought that the seasonable word was no less than raymonds due but the seasonable word had to be preceded by sympathy he sat down in the window seat by colin well he said those blue eyes gay but veiled by suffering answered him its damned hard on you colin he said are you getting used to it old boy colin with one of those inimitable instinctive movements laid his hand on his fathers shoulder no not a bit he said but ive got to i cant go on like this i must feel friendly to raymond and violet i must manage to rejoice in their happiness got any prescription for me father ill take it whatever it is lord how happy i used to be all that philip had missed in rosina was here now the tender subtle mind which should have been the complement of her beauty his sympathy was up in arms for this beloved child of hers and his sense of fairness elsewhere raymonds doing his best colin he said i wonder and he paused you can say nothing that will hurt me father said colin go on well i wonder if youre responding to that to put it frankly whenever he makes any approach to you you snub him colin lifted his head snub him he said how on earth can i snub raymond hes got everything i might as well snub god this was a new aspect i cant do otherwise father said the boy i can only just behave decently to raymond in public and avoid him in private dont bother about raymond raymond hates me and if i gave him any opportunity he would merely gloat over me i cant behave differently to him im doing the best i can if you arent satisfied with me ill go away again till its all over and irrevocable perhaps you would allow me to go back to capri philips heart yearned to him i wish i could help you he said you do help me but lets leave raymond out of the question theres a matter that bothers me much more and thats violet if i let myself go at all i dont know where i should be what am i to do about her am i right do you think in the way im behaving we were chumsthen she became to me as i told you so much more than a chum i cant get back on to the old footing with her it would hurt too much and shes hurt that i dont i can see that i think i was wrong to come back here at all and yet how lovely it was you all seemed pleased to see meall but raymondand i didnt guess the bitterness of it it was inevitable that philip should recall his surprise at violets passivity colin whose heart he knew had been in all outward appearance just as passive and he could not help wondering whether that passivity of violets cloaked a tumult as profound as colins the suspicion had blinked at him before like some flash of distant lightning now it was a little more vivid if that were true if from that quarter a storm were coming up better a thousand times that it should come now than later tragic indeed would it be if after she had married raymond it burst upon them all but he had nothing approaching evidence on the subject it might well be that his wish that violet could have loved colin set his imagination to work on what had really no existence outside his own brain i hate seeing you suffer colin he said and if you want to go back to capri of course you may but youve got to get used to it some time unless you mean to banish yourself from stanier altogether dont do that colin pressed his fathers arm ill do better father he said ill begin at once wheres violet it was in pursuance of this resolve it must be supposed that when lady yardleys rubber of whist was over that night colin moved across to the open door on to the terrace where violet was standing in some spasm of impatience at raymonds touch she had just got up from the sofa where he had planted himself close to her leaving him with an expression half offended half merely hungry five minutes stroll outside vi he asked its rather late she said right said colin cheerfully and went forth alone whistling into the darkness the moment he had gone violet regretted not having gone too since colins return she had not had a halfhour all told alone with him and the tension of his entire indifference to her was becoming intolerable she had not dreamed that he would cut himself off from her with this hideous completeness nor yet how much she longed for the renewal of the old intimacy bitterest of all was the fact that she meant nothing to him for he had never been more lightheartedly gay where philip knowing what he did saw strained and heroic effort she saw only the contemptuous ignoring of herself and raymond and now with that same craving for selftorture that is an obsession to the luckless in love when colin made his first advance to her again she must needs reject it there was raymond watching her and revolt against that hungry look of his decided her she stepped out on to the terrace colin had come to the far end of it his whistling directed her and now in the strong starlight she could see the glimmer of his shirtfront she felt her knees trembling and hid the reason out of sight as she strolled as unconcernedly as she could towards him soon he perceived her and his whistling stopped hullo vi he said so youve come out after all thats ripping they were close to each other now and bright was the stream of starlight on him managed to tear yourself away from raymond for five minutes he asked i was beginning to think i should never have a word with you again thats your fault said she you have been a brute all this last week i a brute said colin what do you mean i thought i had been conducting myself superbly he looked up quickly at the oblong of light that flowed from the open door into the gallery and saw that it framed a shadow hullo theres raymond he said looking after us here we are raymond come and join us he heard violets clicked tongue of impatience i had to say that he whispered he wont come colins psychology was correct enough raymond had not meant to be seen he only meant to see besides he had a grievance against violet for her impatience just now he was annoyed with her no thanks he said im going to the smokingroom thats to punish you vi said colin with a tremble of laughter in his voice but perhaps we had better go in you mustnt vex him nothing could have been better calculated is one of the conditions of my engagement that i mustnt speak to you she asked certainly it seems like it colin tucked his arm into violets well well break it for once he said now youre vexed with me thats very unreasonable of you you made your choice with your eyes open youve chosen raymond and stanier it stands to reason we cant always be together you cant have raymond and stanier and me it was your own doing and i thought everything was going so well whenever i look up i see you and him holding hands or else hes kissing the back of your neck ah said violet with a little shiver youve got to get used to it vi said he youve got to pay for having stanier isnt it worth it he heard her take a quick breath her control was swaying like a curtain in the wind oh dont be such a brute to me colin she said i hadnt realised thatthat you would desert me like this colin just passed his tongue over his lips oh that doesnt mean anything to you he said but it does it does said she they were back now in the shadow of the yewhedge where one night she had kissed him as he thought of that he knew that she was thinking of it too give raymond up he said let him and stanier go it will be the wisest thing you can do he paused a moment and all the witchery of the night came to the reinforcement of his charm i want you vi he said promise me give me a kiss and seal it for one second she wavered and then drew back from him no i cant do that she said ill give you a kiss but it seals no promise kiss me then said he now confident there was no mistaking the way in which she surrendered to him she stood enfolded by him lambent and burning she knew herself to be bitterly unwise but for the moment the sweetness was worth all the waters of marah that should inundate her ah you darling never mind your promise said he i shall have that later just now its enough that you should hate raymond and love me she buried her face on his shoulder colin colin what am i to do she whispered he could see well that though her heart was his the idea of giving up stanier still strove with her tonight she might consent to marry him tomorrow that passion for possession might lay hands on her again she was bruised but not broken and instantly he made up his mind to tell her the secret of his mothers letter and of the entry at the consulate that would clinch it for ever when she knew that by giving up raymond and stanier together she retained just all she wanted out of her contract and gained her hearts desire as well what are you to do he said you are to do exactly what you are doing youre to cling to me and trust me ah youre entrancing but ive got something to tell you vi something stupendous we must go in i cant tell you here for not even the trees nor the terrace must know though it concerns them but colin about raymond i cant be sure he pressed her to him thrilled all through at this ebb and flow of her emotional struggle youve finished with raymond i tell you he said youve given him up and youve given up stanier havent you youve given up everything some diabolical love of cruelty for its own sake of torturing her by prolonging the decision which pulled at her this way and that possessed him its a proud hour for me vi he said i love stanier as madly as you do and youve given it up for me i adore you for doing that youll never repent it i just hug these moments though there must come an end to them let us go in or raymond will be looking for us again go straight to your room i shall come there in five minutes for theres something i must tell you tonight i must just have one look at raymond first thats for my own satisfaction colin could not forego that look at raymond he knew how he should find him prospering with a glass of whisky disposed as his father had said to be brotherly having all the winning cards in his hand stanier would be his and before that violet would be his and colin might be allowed if he were very amiable to spend a week here occasionally when raymond came to his throne just as now he had been allowed a starlit stroll with violet these were indulgences that would not be noticed by his plenitude morsels let fall from the abundant feast the life only of one man already old lay between him and the full consummation already his foot was on the steps where the throne was set just one glance then at victorious raymond raymond fulfilled the highest expectations whisky had made him magnanimous he was pleased to have granted colin that little starlit stroll with violet it was a crumb from the masters table his heavy face wore a look of great complacency as his brother entered hullo colin he said finished making love to violet colin grinned you old brute he said not content with having everything yourself you must mock me for my beggary you lucky fellow he poured himself out a drink and sat down raymond i had no idea how devoted violet was to you till tonight he said i think shes afraid to let herself go to shew it too much the grossness of raymond his animal proprietorship was never more apparent it was enough for him to desire her oh vis all right he said colin felt his ribs aquiver with the spasm of his suppressed laughter he distrusted his power of control if he subjected himself to further temptation im off to bed he said i just looked in to envy you wheres vi asked raymond colin bethought himself that he did not want raymond knocking at violets door for a goodnight kiss oh she went upstairs half an hour ago he said she told me she was awfully sleepy in fact she soon got tired of me he drank in a final impression of raymonds satisfied face and went upstairs going first to his room where from his locked despatchcase he took the two letters which salvatore had given him and which now bore the dates of march and march then passing down the long corridor he came to her room the door was ajar and he rapped softly and then entered violet in anticipation of his coming had sent her maid away and was brushing her hair golden as colins own before her glass often and often in the days of their intimacy had he come in for a talk during this ritual on dry frosty nights violet would put out her light and pale flashes of electricity and cracklings and sparks would follow the progress of her brush her hair would float up from her head and cling to colins fingers as seaweed that had lain unexpanded on the shore spreads out floating and undulating in the return of the tide tonight it lay thick and unstirred rippling for a moment under her brush and then subsiding again into a tranquil sheet of gold she saw him enter in the field of her mirror and heard the click of the key as he turned it just in case raymond takes it into his head to say goodnight to you he said she had risen from her chair and stood opposite to him what have you got to tell me colin she said he looked at her a moment with parted lips and sparkling eyes each seemed the perfect complement of the other together they formed one peerless embodiment of the glory of mankind through them both there passed some quiver of irresistible attraction and as two globules of quicksilver roll into one so that each is merged and coalesced in the other so with arms interlaced and faces joined they stood there two no longer even colins hatred for raymond flickered for that moment and was nearly extinguished since for violet he existed no more then the evil flame burned up again and he loosed violets arms from round his neck now youre to sit and listen to me he said what i have got to tell you will take no time at all he opened the envelope which he had brought with him and drew out the two letters he had decided not to tell violet any more than what when his father was dead all the world would know salvatore viagi gave me these he said he is my mothers brother you know and i saw him at capri they were written by my mother to him and announce the birth of raymond and me and her marriage to my father take them vi look at the dates and read them in order she gave him one quick glance took them from him read them through and gave them back to him then in dead silence she got up and stood close to him i see she said on uncle philips death stanier everything will be mine according to those letters that is he nodded yes on the one condition of course that you and i are wife and husband she looked at him again with a smile breaking through her gravity i promised that before i knew she said and now that i know that stanier will be mine instead of believing that my choice forfeited it it isnt very likely that i shall change my mind theres something else you know too he said youre marrying she interrupted im marrying colin she said but as regard you is it horrible for you ah ive been thinking of myself only stanier and myself she moved away from him and walked to the end of the room where pushing the blind aside she looked out on to the terrace where they had stood this evening as clearly as if she spoke her thoughts aloud colin knew what was the debate within her it lasted but a moment colin ifif you hate it she said tear that letter up ive got you and i would sooner lose stanier than let you be hurt tear it up let raymond have stanier so long as i dont go with it oh my dear is it the same me who so few weeks ago chose raymond and who so few hours ago wondered if i could give up stanier even though to get it implied marrying him and now nothing whatever matters but you instantly colin felt within himself that irritation which love invariably produced in him just so had his fathers affection except in so far as it was fruitful of material benefits fatigued and annoyed him and this proposal of violets under the same monstrous impulsion promised in so far from being fruitful to prove itself some scorching or freezing wind which would wither and blast all that he most desired but bridling his irritation he laughed that wouldnt suit me at all he said and besides vi how about honour stanier will be legally and rightfully yours how on earth could i consent to the suppression of this but lest you should think me too much of an angelfather asked me one day how my wings were getting oni tell you quite frankly that it will be sweet as honey to send raymond packing my adoring you doesnt prevent my hating him and as for what is called irregularity in birth who on earth cares i dont im a stanier all right look at half the dukes in england where do they spring from actresses flowergirls the light loves of disreputable kings who cares and besides my case is different my father married my mother up and down his face her eyes travelled seeing if she could detect anywhere a trace of reluctance and searched in vain are you quite sure colin she asked absolutely theres no question about it once more she held him close to her oh its too much she whispered you and stanier both mine my heart wont hold it all hearts are wonderfully elastic said he ones heart holds everything it desires if only it can get it now theres a little more to tell you yes come and sit here tell me she drew him down on to the sofa beside her well my uncle sent me these letters said he but naturally they wont be enough by themselves it was necessary to find out what was the entry in the register of their marriage my father had told me where it took place at the british consulate in naples and i got the consul to let me see the register i told him i wanted to make a copy of it i saw it the marriage apparently took place not on the st of march but on the st but then i looked more closely and saw that there had been an erasure in front of the there had been another figure but whoever had made that erasure had not done it quite carefully enough it was possible to see that a had been scratched out the date as originally written was not that tallies with the date on my mothers letter colins voice took on an expression of tenderness incredibly sweet vi darling he said you must try to forgive my father if it was he who made or caused to be made that erasure which might so easily have passed unnoticed as indeed it did for when the consul prepared my copy with the original he saw nothing of it word by word he went over the two together you must forgive him though it was a wicked and a terrible fraud that my fatheri supposepractised for unless he had other children he was robbing you of all that was rightfully yours i think the reconstruction of it is easy enough my mother died and he was determined that his son one of them should succeed i imagine he made or procured the making of that erasure after my mothers death he had meant to marry her indeed he did marry her and i think he must have desired to repair the wrong the bitter wrong he did her in the person of her children ive got something to forgive him too and willingly i do that we must both forgive him vi i the bastard and you the heiress of stanier violet would have forgiven satan himself for all the evil wrought on the face of the earth from the day when first he set foot in paradise oh colin yes she said freely freely thats sweet of you that is a great weight off my mind and youll make your forgiveness effective vi she did not grasp this in what way she asked i mean that you wont want to make an exposure of this now said he i should like my father never to know that i have found out what he did i should like him to die thinking that raymond will succeed him and that his fraud is undiscovered of course you would be within your rights if you insisted on being established as the heiress to stanier now there are certain revenues certain properties always made over to the heir on coming of age and raymond and i come of age in a few months can you let raymond enjoy them for my fathers sake he has always been amazingly good to me oh colin what a question she said what do you take me for would that be forgiveness thats settled then bless you for that the only objection is that raymond scores for the present but that cant be helped and theres just one thing more aboutabout what has happened between us shall i tell my father tomorrow then we can settle how raymond is to be told oh colin tomorrow said she so soon he laughed tonight if you like he said though its rather late of course if you want to put it off and have raymond nosing about you still like a ferret dont he shant then now i must go one kiss vi she clung to him im frightened of raymond she said what will he do howl like a wounded bear i suppose hullo there was the sound of knocking at the door and raymonds voice violet he said may i come in just to say goodnight colin frowned been listening probably he whispered and heard voices without pause he went to the door and turned the key and handle together come in raymond he said as he opened it violets been talking of nothing but you so here we all are bride and bridegroom and best man lets have one cigarette before we all go to bed raymond wore his most savage look i thought you had gone to bed he said and i thought you said violet had gone to bed half an hour before that oh raymond dont be vexed said colin havent you got everything in just such a voice dexterously convincing had he pleaded with violet that she should forgive his father chapter vii philip was waiting in his library for raymonds entry wanting to feel sorry for him but as often as he could darken his mind behind that cloud the edges of it grew dazzlingly bright with the thought of colin and the sun reemerging warmed and delighted him yet he was sorry for raymond and presently he would express his sympathy coldly and correctly he was afraid with regret and truism and paternal platitudes but duty would dictate his sentiments at the most he could not hope for more than to give the boy the impression he was sorry and conceal from him his immensurable pleasure in the news colin had made known to him all these weeks ever since on that morning in capri he had learned of raymonds engagement and colins desire he had never been free from heartache and his favourites manliness his refusal to be embittered his efforts with himself gaily heroic had but rendered those pangs the more poignant and in the hour of his joy colin had shewn just the same marvellous quickness of sympathy for raymonds sorrow as when philip had first told him of the engagement he had shewn for raymonds happiness i would have given anything to spare raymond this father he had said as you know i kept all i felt to myself i didnt let violet see how miserable i was and how i wanted her and then last nightit was like some earthquake within everything toppled and fell vi and i were left clinging to each other after colin philip had seen violet and she too had spoken to him with a simplicity and candour she had already begun to love colin she thought before she accepted raymond but how she loved stanier she had been worldly ambitious stifling the first faint calls of her heart thinking as many a girl thought whose nature is not yet wholly awake that raymond would do as regards herself and do magnificently as regards her longing for all that being mistress of stanier meant to her then came colins return from italy and the whisper of her heart grew louder she could not help contrasting her lover with her friend and in that new light raymonds attentions to her his caresses his airshe must confessof proprietorship grew odious and insufferable and then just as colin had said came the earthquake in that disruption all that from the worldly point of view seemed so precious turned to dross at that point she hesitated a moment and philip had found himself recording how like she was to colin with just that triumphant glow of happiness with which he had said raymond has got stanier father violet and i have got each other so violet now after her momentary hesitation spoke to him stanier for which i longed uncle philip doesnt exist for me any more how could i weigh it against colin colins happiness nothing could dim that sunshine for his father and the sunshine was not only of today it was the sunshine that had shone on him and rosina more than twenty years ago his heart melted with the love that through colin reacted on her surely she must rejoice at the boys happiness today raymond to be sure was the fruit of her body also but it was through colin that she lived he was the memory and the gracious image of her beauty raymond entered snapping the golden thread you wanted to see me father he said philip had been attempting to drill himself into a sympathetic bearing towards his son but raymonds actual presence here in succession to colin and violet brought sheer helplessness for the brightness and beam of the others there was this solid selfsufficiency it seemed as if a crime had been averted in the transference of the girl to another bridegroom what unnatural union would have been made by this mating of her his heart sang it were vain to try to throttle it into silence yes raymond sit down said he indicating a place on the sofa where he sat oh thanks it doesnt matter ill stand said raymond ive got bad news for you said philip you must brace yourself to it lets have it said raymond philip felt his sympathy slipping from him he wanted chiefly to get it over there was no use in attempting to lead up to it it concerns you and violet he said a savage look as of a hungry dog from whom his dinner is being snatched came across raymonds face well he said she wished me to tell you that she cant marry you said his father she asks you to set her free from her engagement the savagery of that sullen face grew blacker i dont accept that from you he said if its true violet will have to tell me herself philip made a great effort with himself it is true he said and i want at once to tell you that im very sorry for you but it would have been very painful for her to tell you and it was i who suggested that i should break her decision to you i hope you wont insist on having it from her she has got to tell me said raymond and is that all father if so ill go to her at once no theres more said he raymonds face went suddenly white his mouth twitched he presented a mask of hatred and so its colin who has got to tell me the rest he said is that it she is going to marry colin for a moment raymond stood perfectly still just his hands were moving knitted together they made the action of squeezing something once it seemed that he tried to speak but no word came only the teeth shewed in his mouth colin has got to tell me then he said i will see colin first philip got up and laid a hand of authority on raymonds shoulder the boy for all his quietness seemed beside himself with some pentup fury all the more dangerous for its suppression you must not see either of them in the state you are in now he said thats my affair said raymond its mine too youre my son and so is colin you must wait till youve got more used to what has happened and you must remember this that a few weeks ago colin was in the same case as you are now he loved violet and it was i then out in capri who told him that violet was going to marry you and he took it like a man like the generous fellow he is his first words were by jove raymond will be happy i shall never forget that and you mustnt either raymond raymond gave a dry snap of a laugh i wont he said thats just what colin would say perfect character isnt he only last night i found him talking to violet in her bedroom i wasnt pleased and he begged me not to be vexed as i had got everything he had taken violet from me when he said that or if not he came back when violet was in bed and got engaged to her then engaged now stop that raymond said his father very good he was already engaged to her when he told me i had got everything you dont understand colin he hates more than he loves he has hated me all my life by jove raymond will be happy ill be even with colin some day now im going to see him or shall i say by jove colin will be happy then youll consider me a generous fellow once again philip tried to put himself in raymonds place and made allowance for his bitter blackness his hand went on to the boys shoulder again with less of authority and more of attempted affection raymond you must do better than this he said you would be very unwise to see colin and violet just now but if you insist on doing so you shall see them in my presence i cant trust you in the mood youre in not to be violent not to say or do something which you would bitterly repent and which they would find it hard to forgive and if which i deny colin has always hated you what about yourself both of them now were on bedrock by implication by admission by denial even they had got down to the hatred that like a vein of murderous gold ran through the very foundation of the brothers existence who knew what struggle might have taken place what prenatal wrestling in the very womb of life of which the present antagonism was but a sequel logical and inevitable even as philip spoke he halfrealised the futility of bringing argument to bear on raymonds nature for this hatred sprang from some ineradicable instinct an iron law on which intelligence and reason could but perch like a settling fly he could deny that colin hated his brother he could urge raymond to show himself as generous as he believed colin to have been but nothing that he could say no persuasion no authority could mitigate this fraternal hostility and even while he denied colins animosity with the evidence he had already brought forward to back it he found himself wondering if at heart colin could feel the generosity he had expressed or whether it was not a mere superficial goodnature mingled with contempt perhaps that had given voice to it raymond had ceased from the clutching and squeezing of his hands you dont know what colin is he said and i know it is no use trying to convince you i shant try you judge by what you see of him and me and you put me down for a blackhearted sullen fellow and hes your hearts darling youve got no right to say that said philip but can i help knowing it father asked he philip felt that his very willpower was in abeyance he could not even want to readjust the places which his two sons held in his heart or rather to find place in his heart for the son who had never been installed there yet and there would be no use in wanting even if he could accomplish that colin held every door of his heart and with a grudging sense of justice towards raymond he was aware that colin would grant no admittance to his brother or was that conviction only the echo of his own instinct that he wanted no one but colin there he had no love to spare for raymond such spring of it as bubbled in him must fall into colins cup the cup that never could be filled how could he but contrast the two here was raymond sullen in his defeat attempting and with unwelcome success to put his father in the wrong jealous of the joy that had come to colin insisting shylocklike on such revenge as was in his power the pound of flesh which would be his in making a scene with the girl who had chosen as her heart bade her and the boy who was her choice on the other side was colin who when faced with an identical situation had accepted his illluck with a wave of welcome for the more fortunate and raymond would have it that that splendid banner was but a false flag under cover of whose whiteness a treacherous attack might be made i dont know that we need pursue that said philip your feelings are outside my control but what is in my control is to be just to you in spite of them i have tried to tell you with all possible sympathy of of violets jilting me interrupted raymond and you have clearly shewn me father your sympathy with colins happiness philip felt every nerve jarring i am not responsible for your interpretations of myself he said nor do i accept them if your design is to be intolerably offensive to me you must work out your design somewhere else i am not going to have you stop here in order to amuse yourself with being rude to me and spoiling the happiness of others ah just so said raymond colin philip was exasperated beyond endurance quite right he said i am not going to have you spoiling colins happiness and violets i should have suggested you leaving stanier for the present for your own sake if you had allowed me to show sympathy for you as you do not i suggest that you should do so for colins sake you may go to st jamess square if you like and if you can manage to behave decently you may stop on there when we come up next week but that depends on yourself now if you want to see violet and your brother you may but you will see them here in my presence i will send for them now if that is your wish when you have seen them you shall go well suddenly the idea of leaving colin and violet here became insupportable to raymond he had to see them as lovers and hate them for it his hate must be fed with the sight of them must i go father he said yes you have forced me to be harsh with you it was not my intention now do you want to see them raymond hesitated if colin could be cunning he could be cunning too i should like to see them both he said philip rang the bell and in the pause before they came raymond went across to the windowseat and sat there with face averted making no sign and in the silence philip reviewed what he had done he had no wish as he had said to be harsh to raymond but what possible gain to any one was his remaining here he would be a misery to himself and no entertainment to others and yet the boy wanted to stop thinking perhaps that thus he would be sooner able to accept the position it was impossible to grudge him any feasible alleviation of the blow that so far from stunning him had awakened all that was worst in him much must depend on his behaviour now to colin and violet they entered together colin looked first at his father then without pause seeing the huddled figure in the windowseat went straight to raymond all else violet even was forgotten he laid his hand on raymonds shoulder oh raymond he said were brutes i know that philip thought he had never seen anything so exquisite as that instinct of colins to go straight to his brother could raymond recognise the beauty of that and was it indeed raymond who now drew colin on to the windowseat beside him thats all right colin he said you couldnt help it no one can help it when it comes i couldnt he stood up fathers told me about it all he said and i just wanted to see you and violet for a moment in order to realise it ive got it now goodbye colin goodbye violet he went across to his father with hand outstretched thanks ever so much for letting me go to st jamess square he said and im sorry father for behaving as i did i know its no use just saying that ive got to prove it but thats all i can do for the present he went straight out of the room without once looking back is raymond going away asked colin yes its better so colin heard this with a chill of disappointment for among his pleasurable anticipations had been that of seeing raymond wince and writhe at the recasting of their parts raymond would have hourly before his eyes his own rle played by another and with what infinitely greater grace the part of heroine would be filled by its creator but in this remodelled piece what sparkle and life she would put into her scenes where she had been wooden and impassive she would be eager and responsive that icy toleration would melt into a bubbling liquor of joy then there would be the part now to be filled by raymond would he fill that with colins tact and sweetness of minor characters there would be his father and grandmother and with what convincing sincerity now would they fill their places but raymonds absence would take all the sting and fire out of the play oh father does he feel like that asked colin did he feel he couldnt bear to stop im sorry no it was i who told him to go said philip he behaved outrageously just now with me but hes sorry said colin he wants to do better maynt he stop hell be wretched all alone up in london a sudden thought struck him a touch of genius but it concerns vi most he said what do you vote darling by all means let him stop said she nothing but colins wish here clearly indicated could have any weight with her then may he father he asked that is good of you come and tell him vi raymond was in the hall he had just ordered his car and was now about to telephone to the housekeeper in town to say he was coming when colin and violet came out of the library philip followed them to complete the welcome and saw colin go up to his brother raymond dont go he said we all want you to stop vi does father does i do raymond saw his father in the doorway may i stop then father he said by all means we all wish it said he raymond looked back again at his brother colin was standing just below the portrait of his ancestor the very image and incarnation of him ive got you to thank i expect colin he said their eyes met colins glittered like a sword unsheathed in the sunlight of his hatred and triumph raymonds smouldered in the blackness of his hatred and defeat i wish there was anything i could do for you ray said colin gently the entertainment which colin had anticipated from these alterations in the cast of this domestic drama did not fall short of his expectations he held raymond in the hollow of his hand for raymonds devotion to violet gross and animal though it had been gave colin a thousand opportunities of making him writhe with the shrewd stings of jealousy and with gay deliberation he planted those darts the coup de grce for raymond would not come yet his fathers death would give the signal for that but at present there was some very pretty baiting to be done not one of those darts so becomingly beribboned failed to hit its mark a whispered word to violet which made the colour spring bright and eager to her face a saunter with her along the terrace in the evening and even more than these colins semblance of sparing raymonds feelings his suggestion that he should join them in any trivial pursuitall these were missiles that maddingly pierced and stung no less adequately did philip and old lady yardley fill their minor parts he with the sun of colins content warming him was genial and thoughtful towards raymond in a way that betrayed without possibility of mistake the sentiment from which it sprang while lady yardley braced and invigorated by the same emotion was strangely rejuvenated and her eyes dim with age seemed to pierce the mists of the encompassing years and grew bright with colins youth as regards his own relations with violet colin found he could for the present anyhow manage very well the old habits of familiarity and intimacy appeared to supply response sufficient for she shuddering now as at some nightmare at her abandoned engagement to raymond and blinded with the splendour of the dawn of her love saw him as a god just alighted on the gilded and rosy hills colin shrugged his shoulders at her illusion she presented to him no such phantasmal apparition but he could give her liking and friendship just what she had always had from him soon so he hoped this vision of himself would fade from her eyes for even as he had found his fathers paternal devotion to him in capri a fatiguing and boring business so he foresaw a much acuter gne that would spring from a persistence of violets love no doubt however she would presently become more reasonable what above all fed colins soul was to stroll into the smokingroom when violet had gone upstairs and his father had retired to his library and to make raymond drink a cup more highly spiced with gall than that which had refreshed him in public raymond had usually got there first while colin lingered a moment longer with violet and had beside him a liberally mixed drink and this would serve for colins text hullo raymond drowning dull care he asked thats right i cant bear seeing you so down by jove didnt violet look lovely tonight with her hair brought low over her forehead did she said raymond he tried to entrench himself in selfcontrol he tried to force himself to get up and go but hatred of colin easily stormed those defences stop and listen said that compelling voice glut yourself with it love is not for you hate is as splendid and as absorbing did she echoed colin as if you hadnt been devouring her all the evening but we all have our turn dont we every dog has its day last week i used to see you and violet now you see violet and me tell me raymond does violet look happy we can talk so confidentially cant we as we have both been in the same position what a ticklish thing it is to be a girls lover how it ages one i feel sixty but does she seem happy she used to wear a sort of haunted look last week i suppose that was her wonder and her misgiving at a mans brutal adoration it frightened her as if we werent frightened too did the idea of marriage terrify you as it terrifies me a girls adoration is just as brutal colin moved about the room as he spoke dropping the sentences out like measured doses from some phial of a potent drug after each he paused waiting for a reply and drinking glee from the silence in that same silence raymond was stoking his fires which were already blazing yes every dog has its day he said replenishing his glass and every dog has his drink said colin lord how youll get your revenge when your day comes what sweetness in your cup that vi and i will never be allowed to come to stanier again youll like that raymond youll have married by that time i wonder if it will be the tobacconists girl wholl have hooked you youll be happier with her than vi you know and i shouldnt wonder if vi will be happier with me than with you still there was silence on raymonds part you must be more cheerful raymond said colin whatever you may do to me hereafter you had better remember that im topdog just now i shall have to ask father to send you away after all if you dont make yourself more agreeable it was i who made him allow you to stop here and i will certainly have you sent away if youre not kinder to me you must be genial and jolly though its a violence to your nature you must buck up and be pleasant so easy and so profitable nothing to say there was a step outside and their father entered he carried an opened letter in his hand ive just had a note from the governor of the asylum at repstow he said one of their patients has escaped a homicidal lunatic gosh ill lock my door said colin no use for him what else father its no joke colin the keeper at the repstow lodge was out attending to the pheasants coops this afternoon and while he was gone a man vaulted over the fence frightened his wife into hysterics and decamped with his gun and a bag of cartridges then he bolted into the woods its almost certain that he is the escaped lunatic raymond who had been listening intently yawned but theyre out after him i suppose he said theyll be sure to catch him colin wondered what that yawn meant to any boy of twentyto himself anyhowthere was a spice of excitement about the news it was impossible not to be interested but raymond did not seem to be interested or did he wish it to appear that he was not interested colin with an eye on raymond turned to his father two or three more little darts were ready for his brother at which he would not yawn oh father said he come and sleep in my room and well take watches what glorious fun you shall take the watch from midnight till till halfpast eight in the morning and then youll wake me up and ill take the watch till five in the afternoon without a wink of sleep then raymond and vi can slumber in safety now i shall go upstairs and say goodnight to vi better not tell her about it tonight said lord yardley rather not we shall have other things to talk about thanks but not a minute before halfpast eight father goodnight goodnight raymond sleep well raymond in spite of these good wishes passed an almost sleepless night if he shut his eyes it was to see colins mocking face floating on the darkness of his closed lids and to have echoing in his ears the mockery of colins jibes as he passed violets door on his way up to bed he had heard the sound of speech and laughter from within and his jealousy seemed to arrest his tiptoeing steps so that what he might overhear should give it the bitter provender it loved but some newborn fear of colin made him go on instead of lingering colin seemed prospered in all he did by some hellish protection a mysterious instinct might warn him that there was a listener and he would throw open the door and with a laugh call violet to see who was eavesdropping on the threshold then after they had laughed and pointed at him colin would shut the door again locking it for fear ofof a homicidal maniacand the talking would go on again till it was quenched in kisses he had tossed and turned as on a gridiron with the thought of colin and violet together to feed and to keep the fire alive he did not believe that colin loved her if she had not promised to marry himself he would not have sought her it was from hatred of himself that he had given her a glance and a smile and whistled her to him so that she threw away like a scrap of wastepaper the contract that would have installed her as mistress of the house she adored colin had idly beckoned just to gratify his hate and she had flamed into love for him what subtle arts of contrivance and intrigue were his also he had wanted to feast that same hatred on the sight of his brothers defeat and discomfiture and a word from him had been sufficient to make his father revoke his edict and let him remain at stanier thus colin earned fresh laurels in the eyes of the others for his compassionate forbearance and by so doing accomplished his own desire of having raymond there like a moth on a pin as the hours went on strange red fancies crossed his brain he imagined himself going to his fathers room and smothering him so that next day he would be master of stanier and free to turn colin out not another hour should he stay in the place out he should go and violet with him better still would it be to come behind colin with a noose in his hand which he would draw tight round his neck and laugh to see his face go black and his eyes start from his head with the strangling that would satisfy him he could forgive colin when he lay limp and lifeless at his feet but till then he would never know a moments peace or a tranquil hour all this week his fever of hatred had been mounting in his blood tonight the heat of it made to flower in his brain this garden of murderous images and all the time he was afraid of colin afraid of his barbed tongue his contemptuous hate above all of the luck that caused him to prosper and be beloved wherever he went just at birth one stroke of illluck had befallen him but that was all earlier in the evening he remembered an idea had flitted vaguely through his head which had suggested to him some lucky accident he had purposely yawned when that notion presented itself so that colin should not see that he took any interest in what was being talked about for the moment he could not recollect what it had been then he remembered how his father had come into the smokingroom and told them that a homicidal lunatic had got hold of a gun and was at large probably in the park that was it he had yawned then for he had pictured to himself colin strolling through the leafy ways and suddenly finding himself face to face with the man there would be a report and colin would lie very still among the bracken till his body was found ants and insects would be creeping about him that had been the faint outline of the picture now in the dark it started into colour what if once again colins luck failed him and in some remote glade he found himself alone with raymond he himself would have a gun with him and he would fire it pointblank at colins face and leave him there it would be supposed that the escaped madman had encountered him it was but a wild imagining born of a sleepless night but as he thought of it raymonds eyelids flickered and closed and just before dawn he fell asleep when he was called a few hours later that was the first image that came into his mind and by the light of day it wore a soberer a more solid aspect what if it was no wild vision of the night but a thing that might actually happen no fresh news when they met at breakfast was to hand about the escaped man indeed in answer to an inquiry sent by lord yardley to the asylum there came the reply that though searchparties were out after him nothing had as yet been seen of him colin was engaged to play a round of golf on the rye links and the chance of falling in with him seemed so remote that soon after breakfast he went off on his motorbicycle promising in order to soothe violets apprehensions to travel at the rate of not less than forty miles an hour that did not please her either in fact there was no pleasing her about his expedition whether he went fast or slow so he kissed her and told her to order her mourning at the last moment however at his fathers wish he slipped a revolver into his pocket raymond as usual refused to play golf and preferred a wander in the park with a gun as a defensive measure for himself and as an offensive measure against the plague of woodpigeons they were most numerous in the woods that lay on the steep slope through which the road to repstow passed that had been colins road too and when raymond set out a quarter of an hour later the dust raised by his motorbicycle still hung in the windless air ten minutes walking brought him to the point where the road which hitherto had lain across the open grass of the park descended into the big belt of wood which stretched as far as the lodgegates on each side of it the ground rose sharply covered on the one side by firs and birches with groundwork of heather on the other by the oaks of what was known as the old park according to tradition they were of the plantings of elizabeths colin and for age and grandeur they might well be so for stately and venerable they rose from the short deernibbled turf wellspaced with full freedom for roots and branch alike no other trees were on that slope but these great leafy sentinels stood each with his ring of shade round him like welltried veterans who have earned their leisure and the dignified livery of repose a low wall of grey stone some four feet high mossy and creviced and feathered with small ferns separated this old park from the road it was among these great oaks that the pigeons congregated and raymond was soon busy with them this way and that startled by his firing they flew often wary and slipping out of the far side of a tree and interposing its branches between him and them so that he could get no sight of them but at other times coming out into the open and giving him a fair shot before long the whole battalion of them were in commotion wheeling and flying off and returning again and in an hours time he had shot some forty of them not reckoning half a dozen more which winged or otherwise wounded trailed off on his approach fluttering on in front of him raymond was quite willing to put any such out of their misery if they would only stop still and be killed like sensible birds but on a hot morning it was too much to expect him to go trotting after the silly things especially when he had killed so many he took no pleasure in the cruelty of leaving them to die he was simply indifferent he had come almost to the end of his cartridges and if he was to continue his shooting he would have to go back to the house for more ammunition or borrow some from the keeper at the repstow lodge that was nearer than the house but before going he sat down in the shade of one of old colins oaks to cool down and have a cigarette for the last hour he had been completely absorbed in his sport now with a snap like that of a released spring his mind leaped back to that which had occupied it as he walked here and saw the dust of his brothers motorbicycle hanging in the air he had locked up in his mind when he began his shooting all connection with that his hate the sleepless night with its visions that seemed so wild at the time but which on his waking had taken on so much quieter and more likely an aspect and now when he unlocked his mind again he found that they had grown like fungi in the darkness of a congenial atmosphere they were solid and mature where before there had been but a fairyring of imagination where nightly elves had danced there were now those red firmfleshed poisoned growths glistening and corrupt his subconscious mind poured out its storage it had been busy while he was shooting and wonderfully acute it reminded him now that a quarter of a mile further on the old park came to an end and one clump of rhododendrons stood behind the wall which ran along the road just here the road took a sharp turn to the right a man walking along it or for that matter bicycling along it would only come into sight of any one who might happen to be by that rhododendron bush halfadozen yards before he came to it himself and anything else he might see there a gun for instance would be at pointblank range such a gunbarrel would rest conveniently on the top of the wall any one who happened to be holding the weapon would be concealed between the wall and the bush these pictures seemed to be shewn raymond rather than to be imagined by him it was as if some external agency held open the book which contained them and turned over the leaves it might prove to be himself who would presently lie perdu there but he had no sense of any personal volition or share in the matter his hatred of colin had somehow taken counsel even as doctors consult over a bad case with the necessity that colin should die and this was their advice raymond was but the patient who in the apathy of sickness was going to do as they told him not caring much what happened only conscious that if this advice was successful in all its aspects he would be restored to complete health he hardly knew if he hated colin any more all that he was certain of was that there existedsomewherethis black dynamic enmity he hardly knew whether it was he who was about to shoot colin as presently on his motorbicycle he would come round that sharp bend by the rhododendron bush all that he was certain of was that colin would presently lie dead on the road with his face all shattered by the shot the homicidal maniac of course escaped from the asylum must have been his murderer there was no use for more cartridges than the two which he now slipped into his gun if the fellow hidden behind the rhododendron bush could not kill colin with two shots he could not kill him with twenty and raymond looking carefully round began moving quietly down the slope to the corner keeping in the shadow of the leafage of the splendid trees his foot was noiseless on the cropped plush of the turf and he passed quickly over the patches of sun between the shadows of the oaks pausing every now and then to make sure there was no one passing along the road or the hillside who was within sight of him but there was no one to be seen after the cessation of his shooting the deer had come back to their favourite grazingground and were now cropping at the short sweet grass or lying with twinkling ears alert in the shade no one was moving up there at the top of the old park where a footpath made a short cut to the house from the repstow lodge or the deer would not be so tranquil while his own sharp eye assured him that within the circle of his vision there was none astir his remembrance of the rhododendron bush close to the angle in the road was astonishingly accurate the top of the grey wall was a most convenient rest for his gun and a man coming round the corner from the direction of repstow would suddenly find himself within six yards of the barrels probably he would never see them at all there would be just a flash of flames close to his startled eyes perhaps even the report of the explosion would never reach him that was the only imperfect touch in these schemes which had been thus presented to raymond he would like colin to know onehalf second before he died whose hand had pulled the trigger and put a muzzle on his mocking mouth and a darkness over his laughing eyes and he determined that when the beat of colins approaching motorbicycle sounded loud round the corner he would stand up and show himself it would be all too late for colin to swerve or duck then and he should just see who had the last laugh raymond felt that he would laugh as he fired till that moment it was best to conceal himself from the road and he leaned against the wall crouching a little with the muzzle of his gun resting on it it was already after one oclock colin would be here any minute now a quarter of an hour before colin had arrived at the repstow lodge with a puncture in his hind tyre luck was kind to him as usual the puncture had occurred only a few yards down the road and he could leave his machine with the lodgekeeper and send a mechanic from the garage to repair it and bring it back to the house for himself he would take the short cut through the top of the old park back home that reduced the distance by at least a half and on this hot morning the softturfed shade would be pleasant then a sudden thought struck him and he asked whether the escaped madman had been captured the walk home would be less exciting but perhaps pleasanter if they had caught him and again it appeared that colins affairs were being well looked after the man had been found on the other side of the park half an hour ago cleverly taken so the keeper said he must have been in the woods all night and they came upon him as he dozed seizing the gun he had possessed himself of before he woke and getting a noose round his arms so that was all right and colin with a smile for the keepers wife and a sixpenny piece for the small child who regarded him with wide wondering eyes set off for the mile walk to the house he took his revolver out of his pocket with the intention of giving it to the keeper and having it brought up to the house with the bicycle but then thought better of it and emptying the cartridges out replaced it it made a rather weighty bulge in his coat but on general principles it was wise not to leave firearms about the thought of raymond at his pigeonshooting occurred to him as he walked but no sound of firing came from the direction of the old park which now lay close in front of him and he supposed that his brother would have gone home by this time what a sullen awkward fellow he was how he winced under colins light artillery how impotently raymond hated him colin could not imagine hating any one like that and not devising something deadly but raymond devised nothing he just continued hating and doing nothing colin had come to the beginning of the old park the path lying along the top of it wound in and out of the great oaks below to the right lay the road with the low stone wall running beside it the road had been out of sight hitherto forming a wider circuit but just below him now there was a sharp corner and it came into view but what was that bright line of light on the top of the wall just at that point something caught the sun vividly gleaming for some reason he was imperatively curious to know what gleamed there just as if it intimately concerned him and halfclosing his eyes to focus it and detach it from that baffling background of dappled light and shadow he saw simultaneously and unbidden the idea of raymond out shooting pigeons occurred to him but what was he doingif it were raymondhidden behind that darkleaved rhododendronbush with his gun resting on the wall and pointing at the road that was a singular way of shooting pigeons very singular colins face broke into one great smile and he slipped behind one of the oaks looking out he saw that another tree lower down the slope hid the rhododendron bush from him and keeping behind the broad trunk he advanced down the hill in its direction twice again in similar cover he approached and peering round the tree he could now see raymond close at hand raymonds back was towards him he held his gun with the end of the barrels resting on the top of the wall looking at the angle of the road round which but for that puncture in his bicycle he himself would already have come there was now but one big tree between him and his brother and on tiptoe as noiselessly as a hunting tiger he crept up to it and drawing his revolver from his pocket he came within ten paces of him then some faint sound of his advancea twig perhaps snapping beneath his stepor some sense of anothers presence reached raymond and he turned his head quickly in colins direction he found himself looking straight down the barrel of his revolver raymond if you stir except to do precisely what i tell you i shall shoot said colin quietly if you take your eyes off me i shall shoot colins finger was on the trigger his revolver as steady as if a man of stone held it open the breech of your gun he said and let the barrels drop now hold it in one hand with your arm stretched out thats right good dog now lay the gun down and turn round with your back to me stop like that without moving remember that i am covering you and i could hardly miss at this distance colin picked up the gun and took the two cartridges out and put them in his pocket not till they clinked against the revolver cartridges that lay there did he remember that all the time his pistol had been unloaded he stifled a laugh take off your cartridgebag raymond he said and put it on the ground there are no more in it said raymond speaking for the first time you illconditioned swine do as i tell you said colin i shant give you an order twice again well what you said seems to be true but thats not the point the point is that youre to do as i tell you now have you got any more cartridges in your pockets no colin thought he had better make sure of this for himself and passed his hand over raymonds coatpockets now you stand just where you are he said because weve got to talk but first ill put some cartridges in my own revolver it has been perfectly empty all this time isnt that damned funny raymond dear there were you expecting every moment would be your last and obeying me like the sweet obedient boy you are laugh cant you its one of the funniest things that ever happened colin lit a cigarette with shouts of laughter well to business he said turn round and lets see your face do you know a parlourtrick called thoughtreading im going to tell you what youve been thinking about you expected me to come round that corner on my bike and from behind the wall you were going to fire pointblank at me not at all a bad idea there was the homicidal lunatic you thought loose in the woods and my death would have been put down to him but you would have been hanged for it all the same because he was taken nearly an hour ago without firing a shot so ive saved you from the gallows good idea of yours but it had a flaw in it colin came a step nearer his brother his eyes dancing raymond i cant resist it he said youve got to stand quite still while i smack your filthy face just once hard itll hurt you im afraid but youve just got to bear it if you resist in any way i shall tell my father exactly what has happened this morning as soon as i get in i shall tell him at lunch before violet and the servants i may settle to tell him in any case that depends on how our talk goes off but if you dont stand still like a good boy i shall certainly tell him now shut your eyes and see what ill give you there it quite stung my fingers so im sure it stung your face sit down no i think you look nicer standing let me think a moment colin lit another cigarette and stared at his brother as he smoked it youve been wise about one thing he said in not attempting to deny the truth of my pretty thoughtreading youre beaten you see you darent deny it youre a whipped cur who darent even growl lucky for you that youre such a coward now ive settled what to do with you as soon as we get in you shall write out for me a confession you shall say that you intended to shoot me and put down quite shortly and clearly what your plan was you shall sign and my father and i will sign it as witnesses he shant read it i will tell him that it is a private friendly little matter between you and me and we just want his signature im devilish good to you you know its lucky that that affair about my revolvercartridges amused me that and smacking your face then i shall send your confession to my bank to be kept unopened there except in case of my death in which case it is to be sent to my father thatll keep you in order you see you wont dare to make any other attempt on my life because if it were successful it would be known that you had tried to kill me before and that would be a suspicious circumstance hows your face answer cant you its all right said raymond good lord i dont want to know about your face what do you say to my proposal the alternative is that i tell my father and violet all about it i rather fancycorrect me if i am wrongthat he will believe me shocking affair but true answer i accept it said raymond of course you do now pick up your gun did you have good sport with the pigeons answer pleasantly i got about forty said raymond and you hoped to get one more at that corner didnt you yes damned rude of you to call me a pigeon ill pay you out for that philip was out on the terrace when the two boys came in colin took raymonds arm affectionately when he saw him hullo father he said weve had such a ripping morning i won my match and raymond downed forty pigeons and theyve caught the madman oh my bicycle punctured by the way but that was a blessing in disguise for i had a jolly walk through the old park and found raymond weve had a nice talk too and we want you to witness something for us after lunch whats that said philip oh just a private little arrangement that only concerns us shant we show it father ray oh i think not said he colin raised his eyebrows as he met his fathers glance all right he said just as you like chapter viii colin was lying on the beach of the mens bathingplace at capri after an hours swim a great wave of heat had swept over europe and now though it was late in october the conditions of summer still prevailed it might have been june still and he here with his father quietly making the plans that had turned out so well on this beach it was that he lay pondering his reply to violets letter which told him she was engaged to raymond he had thought out his reply here that congratulatory reply saying how delightful her news was and as for feeling hurt that had been a thorn to violet which had pricked and stung her as she had confessed she had confessed it to him between dusk and dawn on their marriagenight he knew all about it that casual kiss in the dusk of the yewhedge the night before he and his father left for italy had begun it his indifference to her had made her ache and his arrival back in england had made the ache intolerable to be mistress at stanier had become worthless to her and to reward her sense of its worthlessness had come the news that she would not be that only colin stirred his sunstained body to get a fresh bed of hot sand and pebbles for his back he had absorbed the heat of those on which he had been lying but a little kneading movement of his elbow brought him on to another baked patch that was gloriously hot it made him pant with pleasure as he anticipated one more cool rush into the sea he purred and thought of the lovely days that had passed of the lovely day that was here of the lovely days that awaited him quite methodically he began at the beginning violet and he had been married in the first week of october on the very day indeed that had been arranged for her marriage with raymond there was a suave brutality about that he had made raymond under some slight hint of pressure advocate it raymond under that same hint had become marvellously agreeable he had been almost sentimental and had urged violet to be married on that day he himself would be best man if colin would allow him instead of being bridegroom her happiness it appeared was of greater import to him than his own little conversations with colin in the smokingroom before colin went up to say goodnight to violet were responsible for this scotch sentimentality raymond had been quite like a noble character in a sloshy play he had understood and entered into the situation he had given up without bitterness he had rejoiced at his brothers happiness and had been best man the happy pair had left that afternoon for italy the attitude which he had forced on raymond gave colin the most intense satisfaction he had been made to appear to be affectionate and loving highminded and altruistic and colin knew what wormwood that must be to him it was tiresome enough as he knew from his experience of the last fortnight to be supposed to love when you only liked but how infinitely more galling it must be to be supposed to love when you hated but he did raymond justice a mere hint at publicity for that paper which lay at his bankers together with his mothers letters and that confirmatory line from uncle salvatore produced wonderful results raymond could be bridled now with a single silken thread colins thought turned over that leaf of the past and pored over the presentthis delightful actual present there was the sun baking his chest and legs and the hot sand and pebbles warm to his back while the cool clear sea awaited him when the rapture of heat became no longer bearable violet had not come down with him today she had taken to the rather more sophisticated bathing establishment at the marina where more complete bathingdresses were worn and men did not dress and undress in the full eye of day colin quite agreed with her that the marina was more suitable for her this bay was really the mens bathingplace and though women could come here if they chose they were rather apt to be embarrassing and embarrassed she would find the huts at the marina more satisfactory and still more satisfactory to him was to be rid of her for a few hours there was a stern pitiless insistency about love which bored him he could not be quite tranquil when from moment to moment he had to make some kind of response a glance or a smile served the purpose but when violet was there he had unless he betrayed himself always to be on the look out this love was a foreign language to him and he must attend if he were to reply intelligently he liked her liked her quite immensely but that which was a tireless instinct to her was to him a mental effort it was no effort on the other hand to be with raymond for there his instinct of hatred functioned flawlessly and automatically colin turned over that page of the present and cast his eyes over the future at the first glance all seemed prosperous there his father had aged considerably during the last few months and just before their marriage had had a rather alarming attack of vertigo when after a hot game of tennis he had gone down with colin to the bathingpool to swim himself cool the boy had not been the least frightened he had brought his father to land without difficulty and on his own responsibility had telephoned for his fathers doctor to come down to stanier the report had been quite reassuring but a man who had left his sixtieth birthday behind him must not overexert himself at tennis and then bathe nature the wise old nurse protested this suggested eventualities for the future no doubt his father would now be more prudent and enjoy a long ripe old age colin quite acquiesced his father had been so consistently good to him that he scarcely felt any impatience about that but what this morning occupied him with regard to the future was the idea not of his fathers death but of raymonds in this uncertain world accidents or illness might carry off even the strongest and sulkiest and he himself would then be in a very odd position supposing as was natural his father died first raymond on the strong case that could be built on the evidence of his mothers letter to salvatore and the erasure in the consulate archives would no doubt be incontinently hoofed out of his promised land and violet be in possession with him as husband to the owner but if raymond died first colin by his juggling would merely have robbed himself of the birthright which would be rightfully his it had been a great stroke to provide at his fathers death for raymonds penniless illegitimacy and by himself marrying violet to submerge his own not possibly could he have provided for the eventuality of raymonds predeceasing his father as well but now that he had married violet it was worth while brooding and meditating over the other something might conceivably be done if raymond died first though he could not as yet fashion the manner of it the morning had sped by all too quickly and by now the other bathers had gone and the beach was empty and colin plunged once more into that beloved sea the cool brisk welcome of it encompassed him its vigour seemed to penetrate his very marrow and brain with its incomparable refreshment and he began to think of this problem with a magical lucidity colin regretfully left the water and put his clothes into the boat in which he had been rowed round from the marina meaning to dress on the way there young antonio the son of giacomo philips old boatman had brought him round here and was now asleep in a strip of shadow at the top of the beach waiting till colin was ready to return there he lay with his shirt open at the neck and a carnation perched behind his ear lithe and relaxed like some splendid young faun the boys mouth smiled as he slept was he dreaming thought colin of some amorous adventure proper to his age and beauty his black hair grew low on his forehead the black lashes swept his smooth brown cheek it seemed a pity to awake him and for a minute or two colin studied his face violet before now had remarked on his extraordinary resemblance except in point of colouring to colin and he wondered if through his noble viagi blood they were related he liked to think he resembled this merry nino he would almost have been willing to give him his blueness of eye and golden hair and take in exchange that glossy black which caught the tints of the sky among its curls then nino stirred stretched a lazy arm and found his hand resting on colins shoulder at that he sprang up ah pardon signor he said i slept you have not been waiting colin had picked up italian with great ease and quickness it came naturally to his tongue ive been watching you smiling as you slept nino he said what have you been dreaming about nino laughed and if i was not dreaming of the signorino himself he cried what about me demanded colin oh just a pack of nonsense he said we were in the boat and it moved of itself without my rowing and together we sat in the stern and i was telling you the stories of the island you have heard the most of them i think by now are you not going to dress ill dress in the boat said colin but theres that story of tiberio which you wouldnt tell me when the signora was with us indeed a story of tiberio is not fit for the signora a fat bald old man was tiberio and as ugly as a german seven palaces he had on capri there was one here and so shameful were the things done in it that so the priests say the sea rose and swallowed it but i do not know that the priests are right they say that do you think signor to frighten us from the wickedness of tiberio and one day tiberio sawscusi signor how attractive was the pagan gaiety of these young islanders they believed in sunshine and wine and amusement and a very good creed it was they took all things lightly except the scirocco love was a pleasant pastime an affair of eager eyes and a kiss and a smile at parting for had he not seen nino himself in a corner of the piazza yesterday making signals to his girl or one of them and then strolling off in the warm dark they were quite without any moral sense but it was ludicrous to call that wicked pleasure sanctified all they did they gave it and took it and slept it off and sought it again how different from the bleak and solemn northerners imagine mused colin as this really unspeakable history of tiberio gaily unfolded itself encouraging a gardeners boy to regale you with bawdy tales how he would snigger over the indecency thus making it indecent how heavy and dreary it would all be but here was nino with his dancing eyes and his laughing mouth and his scusi signor and all was well these fellows had charm and breeding for their birthright and somehow minds which vice did not sully the end of the story was rapidly told with gestures to help out the meanings of recondite words for they were approaching the marina and colins signora was waiting for him there as nino had already seen with a backward glance an amazing moral was tacked on the conclusion of those dreadful doings of tiberio for when tiberio died god permitted the devil to torture him from morning to night as the anniversary of that orgy came round but thats not likely nino said colin deeply interested if tiberio were so wicked the devil would not want to torture him he would be the devils dear friend nino took both oars in one hand for a second and crossed himself what do you do that for nino asked colin it is safer said nino who knows where the devil is colin made an admirably apposite remark a thing that neapolitans said so mr cecil had told him when they found themselves talking about the devil and nino was duly appreciative that is good said he that muddles him up yes signor it is as you say if tiberio were very wicked he and the devil would be very good friends do you believe in the devil signor in england were not quite sure and in capri nino not when the sky is blue like like the signors eyes said nino but when there is scirocco we are not so certain the prow of the boat hissed and was quenched against the sandy beach there under the awning of the stabilimento was violet rather fussed at the leisurely progress of colins boat for in two minutes more the funicular would start and if they missed that there was the dusty drive up to the town quick darling quick she called out we have only a couple of minutes oh dont fuss said he run on if you want to nino and i are talking folklore he felt in his pockets and spoke in italian again nino i havent got a single penny he said to pay you for your boat if you are in the town tonight come to the villa and i will pay you if not tomorrow i shall want your boat again at ten sicuro said the boy buon appetit he stepped into the water and held out his bare arm like a rail for colin to lean on as he jumped on to the beach thanks he said same to you nino villa stanier you know violet was waiting at the edge of the beach the midday steamer had just come in from naples and now there was no need to hurry for the funicular would certainly wait for the passengers who were landing in small boats at the quay nice bathe darling she said as colin joined her colin found himself mildly irritated by her always saying darling she could not speak to him without that adjunct which might surely be taken for granted yes darling he said lovely bathe darling and you darling there was certainly an obtuseness about violet which had not been hers in the old days she seemed to perceive no impression of banter however goodnatured in this repetition instead that slight flush which colin now knew so well spread over her face yes darling the water was lovely she said like warm silk ugh said colin fancy swimming about in silk what horrible ideas you have dont be so literal said she just a silky feeling look at these boatloads of people arent they queer that little round red one like a tomato just getting out colin followed her glance there was no doubt whom she meant for the description was exactly apt but even as he grinned at the vividness of her vegetable simile a sense of recognition twanged at his memory the past which he had thought over this morning was sharply recalled and somehow somehow the future entered into it why thats mr cecil he said the consul at naples you must know him vi mr cecil greeted colin with welcome and deference consular business had brought him to capri he had no idea that mr stanier was here was lord yardley here also no but somebody much more important laughed colin my wifewere on our honeymoon violet this is mr cecil who was so kind to me when i was here last mr cecils our consul at naples it was natural that mr cecil should have his lunch with them though he pleaded shortness of time he was going back by the afternoon boat but you clearly must have lunch somewhere said colin and well give you a very bad one probably but a quick one if you are in a hurry ah thats delightful of you colin was hugely cordial exerting the utmost of his charm he even curtailed his siesta in order to walk down with his visitor to the consular office in the town and gratefully promised on behalf of violet and himself to spend the night at his house on their way back to england he wanted that he had made up his mind to get that invitation for it formed part of the plan which had come to him in his final swim that morning before he got into ninos boat and heard that horrible scandal concerning tiberio he wanted violet to pass the night at the consulate there might arise emergencies which would render that convenient it was like her to have waited for his return instead of going to her room for the afternoon sleep and there she was under the pergola where they had lunched at the far end of the garden she was sitting with her back to the gardendoor and did not see him enter and quick as a lizard and as silentfooted colin tiptoed into the house if she saw him she would discuss mr cecil she would linger in the garden and as likely as not linger in his room and he wanted his nap if she chose to sit out under the pergola it was no business of his there was no proof after all that she was waiting for his return another day he would take a sandwich down to the bathing place and like nino have his siesta in some strip of shade down there where no one would disturb him or wait for him or want to talk with him violet was a dear it was hardly possible to have too much of her but just now and then it was nice to have no one watching you and loving you a couple of hours later he strolled still coatless into the great cool sittingroom she was already there waiting to make tea for him i never heard you come in darling she said i was waiting for your return in the pergola and then eventually i came in and peeped into your room and there you were fast asleep funny i shouldnt have seen you said colin i just went down with mr cecil to the piazza and was back in less than halfanhour i adore mr cecil he enjoys himself so much and drinks such a lot of wine a gay dog oh i thought he was a dreadful little man said violet youre too refined said colin you dont like little red bounders by the way ive solemnly promised him that you and i will spend the night at his house in naples on our way home darling how could you asked violet to please him he thinks youre marvellous by the way dont elope with him vi besides its a good thing to be friends with a consul he reserves carriages and oils the wheels of travel colin youre full of surprises said she i should have thought mr cecil was the very type of man you would have found intolerable colin laughed you dont allow for my viagi blood he said the bounding viagi blood shouldnt i love to see you and uncle salvatore together now what shall we do lets go for an enormous walk till dinnertime she came behind him and stroked the short hair at the back of his neck darling would you mind if i didnt come all the way she asked im rather tired i had a long swim this morning ill start with you and make myself comfortable and wait for you to come back dont come at all vi if youre tired he said i cant have you tired and then if you sit down and wait for me i shall feel youre waiting and hurry in consequence besides i shall have to come back the same way then ill certainly come with you all the way said she its more laziness with me than tiredness colin moved his head out of reach of the caressing fingers as if by accident you tickle me he said and if youre obstinate i shant go for a walk at all and i shall get fat like mr cecil stop at home and be lazy for once vi colin as usual had his own way and managed in his inimitable manner to convey the impression that he was very unselfish in foregoing her companionship he established her with a book and a long chair and greatly to his own content went off alone up the steep hillside of monte solaro it was but a parody of a path that lay through the dense bush of aspen and arbutus that clothed the slopes and he would have had to keep holding the stiff elastic shoots back for violet to pass to have tarried and dawdled for her less vigorous ascent had she come with him but now having only his own pace to suit he soon emerged above this belt of woodland that buzzed with flies in a hot stagnant air and came to the open uplands that stretched to the summit the september rains and the thick dews of october had refreshed the drought of the summer and as if spring were here already the dried and yellow grasses tall and seeding stood grounded in a new velvet of young growth and tawny autumn lilies reared their powdered stamens laden with pollen still upwards he passed and the air was cooler and a wind spiced with long travel over the sea blew lightly but steadily from the northwest presently he had reached the top all the island lay at his feet and the peaks of the nearer mainland were below him too floating promontory after promontory on the molten rim of the sea far away to the west like the shadow of a cloud he could just descry the coast of corsica all the world and the glory of the sea lay at his feet and how he lusted for it what worship and fealty was he not ready to give for the possession and enjoyment of it there was no crime thought colin that he would not commit if by that the flame of life burned brighter he would do a child to death or rob a sacristy of its holy vessels or emulate the deeds of tiberius to feed that flame and he laughed to himself thinking of the amazing history told by nino with the black eyes and laughing mouth surely tiberius must have made an alliance and a lovematch with evil itself such gusto did he put into his misdeeds in this connection the thought of the family legend occurred to him dead as the story was belonging to the mists of medivalism you could not be a stanier without some feeling of proprietorship in it naturally it was up to anybody to make a bargain for his soul with the devil if he believed in the existence of such things as devils or souls and certainly for generations when sons of his house came of age they had either abjured their original benefactor or made alliance with him of course they had really made their choice already but it was quaint and picturesque to ratify it like that but for generations now that pleasant piece of ritual had dropped into misuse it would be rather jolly mused colin when he came of age next march to renew it the edges of his thoughts lost their sharpness even as the faroff capes and headlands below melted into the blue field of sea and sky and as he lay in the little sheltered hollow which he had found at the very summit of the peak they merged into a blurred panorama of sensation his life hitherto with its schemings and acquirings became of one plane with the future and all that he meant the future to bring him he saw it as a whole and found it exquisitely good soon now he must return to the love that awaited him in the villa and before many days now he must go back to england a night at the consulate first with violet and then just a waiting on events till his fathers death or raymonds his eyelids dropped the wind rustled drowsily in his ears colin sat up with a start he had not been conscious of having gone to sleep but now wideawake again it certainly seemed as if his brain recorded other impressions than those of this empty eminence had there been some one standing by him or was it only the black shadow of that solitary pine which his drowsiness had construed into the figure of a man and had there been talking going on or was it only the whisper of the wind in the dried grasses which sounded in his ears in any case it was time to go for the sun had declined westwards and losing the flames and rays of its heat was already become but a glowing molten ball close above the sea how strangely the various states of consciousness melted into each other though the sense of identity persisted whatever happened that remained at the corner of the garden perched on the wall which ran alongside the steep footpath up from the town was a little paved platform where they often sat after dinner there had been a letter for colin from his father which had arrived during his walk and now holding it close to his eyes to catch the last of the swiftlyfading light he communicated pieces of its contents to violet raymonds gone back to cambridge he said father seems reconciled to his absence thats funny now theres my elder brother an undergraduate and me a married man and not of age yet it was touch and go whether it wasnt the other way about vi oh dont colin said she i cant bear to think of it but you did think of it wasnt that a nice surprise for you when i told you that to marry me didnt mean giving up stanier that made all the difference she came close to him colin dont be such a brute she said theres just one thing you mustnt jest about and thats my love for you i wish almost i wasnt going to get stanier in order to show you dont jest about it i wont then serious matter but dont you jest about getting stanier vi if you would move your head an inch i should get more light what else does he say she asked colin ran his eyes down the page lots of affection he said he wants us back uncle ronalds down at stanier and aunt hester then some more affection oh he has had another little attack of giddiness nothing to worry about so we wont worry and aunt hesters going off a bit apparently getting to repeat herself father says and then some more affection colin lit a match for his cigarette disclosing a merry face that swam before violets eyes after the darkness had closed on it again thats so like old people he said aunt hester wrote to me the other day saying she was quite shocked to see how slowly my father walked shes quite fond of him but somehow it gives old people a little secret satisfaction to look for signs of breaking up in each other colin youve got a cruel eye sometimes said violet not in the least only a clear one and then theres father saying that aunt hester is beginning to repeat herself and in the same dip of the pen he repeats himself for the third time sending us his love violet gave a quick little sigh at the risk of repeating myself you really are cruel she said when you love you have to say it again and again you might as well say that if youre hungry you mustnt ask for something to eat because you ate something yesterday its a permanent need of life i hope you dont think im breaking up because i have told you more than once that i rather like you poor vi sadly changed said colin teasing her i have changed she said but not sadly were both changed you know colin a year ago we no more thought of falling in love with each other than of killing each other but i dont call the change sad colin felt extremely amiable this evening pleasantly fatigued by his walk and pleasantly exhilarated by his dinner but he had to stir up his brains to find a suitable reply there was the unfair part of it violet talked on this topic without effort indeed it was an effort for her not to whereas he had to think but you call it serious he said i mustnt laugh about it and i mustnt weep what am i to do nothing darling i want you just to be he determined not to let his amiability be ruffled i certainly intend to be as long as ever i can he said i love being its wonderfully agreeable to be and i would much sooner be here than at cambridge with raymond ah poor raymond said violet that exasperated colin to pity or to like raymond appeared to him a sin against hate my dear how can you talk such nonsense he said thats pure sentimentality vi born of the dark and the stars you dont really pity raymond any more than i do and im sure i dont i hate him i always have and i dont pretend otherwise why just now you were telling me not to mention him and two minutes afterwards you are saying poor raymond you were reminding me of what might have happened she said it was that i could not bear to think of but i can be sorry for raymond after all he took it very well when uncle philip told him what we were going to do i believe he wanted me to be happy in spite of himself this was too much for colin the temptation to stop violet indulging in any further sympathy with raymond was irresistible she should know about raymond and hate him as he himself did he had promised raymond not to tell his father of a certain morning in the old park but he had never promised not to tell violet why he had not already done so he hardly knew perhaps he was keeping it for some specially suitable occasion such as the present moment he wanted you to be happy did he he exclaimed do you really think that if so you wont think it much longer now do you remember the morning when there was an escaped lunatic in the park yes said she raymond went out shooting pigeons and i played golf my bicycle punctured and i walked home through the old park there i found raymond crouching behind the wall meaning to shoot me as i came round that sharp corner of the road i came close up behind him while he watched for me by the rhododendrons and oh lord we had a scene absolutely scrumptious there was i covering him with my revolver which all the time hadnt got a cartridge in it and i made him confess what he was up to stop colin its not true cried she it is true he confessed it and wrote it all down and father and i witnessed it and he signed it and its at my bank now perhaps he thought you would be happier with him than me and so from unselfish notions he had better fire a barrel of number five full in my face all for your sake violet my word what unutterable bunkum his hate had submerged him now that final bitter ejaculation showed it clearly enough and it pierced violet like some metallic stab he had no vestige of consideration for her no faintest appreciation of the horror of his stinging narrative which pealed out with some hellish sort of gaiety she could not speak she could only crouch and shudder colin got up scintillating with satisfaction i promised him not to tell father he said which was an act of great clemency perhaps it will be too great some day and i shall and i didnt distinctly mean to tell you but you really forced me to when your heart began bleeding for that swine and saying he wanted to make you happy come vi buck up raymond didnt get me it was clever of him by the way to see his opportunity when the looney was loose i rather respected that lets go indoors and have our piquet she got up in silence just pressed his arm and went up the gravelled path towards the house colin was about to follow when looking over the gardenwall he saw ninos figure coming up the path and remembered he had told him that if he were in the town he might come up to the villa and receive the liras he was owed for his boat this morning instantly the picture of sitting with nino out here in the dusk with a bottle of wine between them presented itself gay and garrulous would nino be that brighteyed laughing faun more faunlike than ever at night with tiberian or more modern tales and wonderful gesticulations that would be a welcome relaxation after this tragic irritating talk with violet he was much more attuned to ninos philosophy indoors there would be a game of piquet with those foolish pasteboard counterfeits of kings and queens and knaves and five liras as the result of all that dealing and meditation and exchange of cards that knave nino would be far more amusing and even piquet was not the worst of the tedium he would find indoors there was violet clearly very much upset by his tale she would be full of yearnings and squeezings and emotional spasms tomorrow she would be more herself again and would bring a lighter touch to life than she would be disposed to give it tonight he really could not spend the evening with violet if it could possibly be avoided he called in a low voice to nino signor said nino with gay upturned face wait ten minutes nino he whispered if i dont come out again you must go i shall want your boat tomorrow morning but wait ten minutes and then perhaps i shall be able to give you a glass of wine and hear more stories if you have half an hour to spare si signor whispered nino pleased at this mystification and intrigue colin followed quickly after violet she was in the big studio where a cardtable was laid walking up and down still horrified and agitated she placed her hands on colins shoulders and dropped her head there it required all his selfcontrol not to jerk himself free oh colin she said the horror of it how can i ever speak to raymond again i wish you hadnt told me there was blame in this but he waived his resentment at that for the present i wish i hadnt indeed darling he said if its disturbed you so much and im afraid it has go to bed now you look awfully tired we wont have our piquet tonight we shall neither of us attend its all so terrible she said supposing your bicycle hadnt punctured he laughed i remember i was annoyed when it happened but it was a blessing after all he said the point that concerns us is that it did and another point is that youre not to sit up any longer but youd like a game she said what will you do with yourself colin knew his power very well he turned drawing one of her hands that rested on his shoulder round his neck the first thing i shall do with myself is to take you to your room he said and say goodnight to you the second is to sit up for another halfhour and think about you the third to look in on tiptoe and see that youre asleep the fourth which i hope wont happen is to be very cross with you if youre not now im not going to argue darling the ten minutes were passing and without another word he marched her to her room she leaning on him with that soft feminine clinging touch and closed her venetian shutters for her leaving the windows wide now promise me youll go to sleep he said put it all out of your mind raymonds at cambridge youve got not to think about him i dont goodnight vi at the door he paused a moment wondering if she had heard him speak to nino over the wall in case she had it were better to conceal nothing im just going downstairs to give nino what i owe him for his boat this morning he said i told him to come up for it i shall just peep in on you vi when i go to bed if you arent asleep i shall be vexed goodnight darling colin went downstairs again and opened the garden door into the road there was nino sitting on the step outside he beckoned him in and shut the door behind him come and have a glass of wine nino he said come quietly the signora has gone to bed he led the way into the diningroom and brought out a bottle of wine there sit down he said softly cigarettes wine now for another of your histories only fit for boys to hear not women so tiberius had supper with a gilded girl to wait on him and a gilded boy to give him wine and what then the atrocious tale shocked nobody this brighteyed nino was just a faun with the candour of the woodland and the southern night for conscience in face and limb and speech he was human but not of the humanity which wrestles with evil and distrusts joy and just as colin knew himself to be except in his northern colouring another nino in bodily form so in a resemblance more remarkable yet he recognised his spiritual kinship with this incandescent young pagan violet he thought had once been like that but this love had come which in some way had altered her giving her a mysterious fatiguing depth a dim tiresome profundity into which she seemed to want to drag him too all her charm her beauty were hers still but they had got tinged and stained with this tedious gravity she had lost the adorable soullessness which knew no instinct beyond its own desire and on which no frost of chill morality had ever fallen colin had been hospitable towards ninos glass the boy was becoming faun and bacchant in one he ought to have had a wreath of vineleaves in his hair it amused colin to see how gracefully intoxication gained on him there would be no sort of vin triste about nino only a livelier gesticulation to help out the difficulties of pronunciation and then the melancholy seized tiberius said nino with a great hiccup for all that he had done and it must be a foolish fellow signor who is melancholy for what he has done i would be more likely to get the melancholy when i was old for the things i might have done and had not and the signor is like me i think ah thank you no more wine i am already half tipsy but it is very good wine talk yourself sober then nino said colin filling his glass what then shall i tell you all capri is in love with the signora and you some with one and some with the other it was thought at first that you must be brother and sister so like you are and both golden you were too young they thought to be married it was playtime still with you are you going to marry nino asked colin there is time yet presently perhaps i do not reap in spring there spoke the faun the woodland the drinker of sweet beverages who drank with filled cup till the drink was done and wiped his mouth and smiled and was off again by a luxury in contrast colin envisaged violet lying cool and white in the room above sleeping perhaps already in answer to the suggestive influence of his wish while he below breathed so much more freely in this atmosphere of fauns where nothing was wicked and nothing was holy and love was not an affair of swimming eyes and solemn mouth love was a laugh nino the handsome boy no longer existed for him in any personal manner nino was just part of the environment a product and piece of the joyous paganism with which the night was thick the paleblue flower of the plumbago that clothed the southern wall of the house nodded in the open windowframe the stir of the wind whispered the starlight with a moon lately risen all strove to be realised and nino seemed some kind of bilingual interpreter of them no more than that who being boy spoke with human voice and being faun spoke the language of nature cruel and kindly nature who loved joy and was utterly indifferent to sorrow she went on her course with largesse for lovers and bankruptcy for the bilious and the puritan she turned her face away from pain and with a thumb reversed condemned it she had no use for suffering or for the ugly the brighteyed and the joyful were her ministers on whatever errand they came thought and tenderness and any aspiration after the spiritual were her foes for in such ascetic fashion of living there was sorrow there was fatigue and striving colin was at home here like a fish put back into water after a panting excursion into a rarefied air his gills expanded again and drank in the tide and have you chosen your girl yet nino he asked dio no i am but twenty presently i will look about and find who is fat and has a good dowry there is seraphina costi she has an elder brother but the inheritance will be hers he passes for the son of costi but we all know he is no son of costi it was like this signor colin si signor nino said colin scusi but to me you are signor colin no with loving thanks no more wine my father says it is a waste to drink good wine when one is drunk my father was boatman to your father before you and i were born that is strange to think on how the old oaks flourish and bear leaf still two stepmothers already have i had and there may be a third yet have you stepmothers signor i would put all old women out of the way and all old men the world is for the young sometimes i think to myself would it not be very easy to put my hands round my fathers neck and squeeze and squeeze again and wait till he was still and then leave him thus and go to bed they would find him there in the morning perhaps i should be the first to find him and it would be said that he had died in his chair all cool and comfortable colin was conscious of some rapturous surprise at himself in his appreciation of the evening as it was compared with the evening as it might have been normally he would have played a couple of games of piquet with violet and thereafter have drowsily rejoined her there would have been whispers of love and then sleep all that was already routine to him instead he through the medium of this wonderful faun was finding himself and that was so much better than finding violet nino with those swift gesticulations was shewing him not nino but himself but by now the boy was getting extremely drunkthe vision was clouding over there was time for just another question or two but arent you afraid of satana asked colin if you kill your father why should i be afraid satana is a good friend to me and i to him why should we fall out he and i those full eyelids drooped and as on this morning the lashes swept the brown cheek nino you must go to bed said colin si signor but i doubt if i could carry myself down to the marina tonight i have the legs of the old woman as i shall know when i come to stand up may i sleep myself sober in your garden beside the cistern it is the signors faultscusithat i am thus my fault for taking but his for giving colin rapidly pondered this should violet be wakeful and open her venetian blinds she would surely see him there he pointed to the sofa against the wall lie down there nino he said and i will bring you a rug you will be more comfortable than on the gravel you must be off before dawn just wait a minute colin kicked off his shoes so as not to disturb violet ran upstairs and peeped into her room there was silence and stillness there and going into his dressingroom next door he picked up a folded rug off his bed and went downstairs with it nino was bowed over the table helpless and inert and colin choked down a spasm of laughter within him nino wake up for one minute he said put your arm round my neck and let me lay you down oh do as i tell you nino nino leaned his whole weight on colins encircled neck and was laid down on the sofa colin loosed the smart tie with which he had adorned himself for this visit to the villa and unbuckled his leather belt and taking out a ten lira note from his purse he thrust it into ninos breastpocket ive put ten liras in your pocket nino dont forget but that is too much signor murmured nino with a guarding hand on his pocket not for such an agreeable evening goodnight i shall want you and your boat again tomorrow morning sicuro felice notte signor colin went up to bed with no desire for sleep for his blood tingled and bubbled in his veins he wished now amusing though it had been that he had not made nino tipsy so soon for he longed to continue holding up the mirror to himself in that reflecting surface he could see much that he had only suspected in himself and this nino unwaveringly confirmed never till nino had so gaily asserted that he did not fear the devil for the devil was his very good friend had colin so definitely realised that whatever the truth about his elizabethan ancestor might be he had accepted the legend as his own experience twice before had some inkling of this come into his mind once when lying here and listening to his fathers footfall on the terrace below he had realised that hate was as infinite as love and once again this afternoon when betwixt sleeping and waking on the top of monte solaro he had received the impression of taking part in some dreamlike colloquy but on both these occasions he had but dealt in abstractions and imaginings tonight nino had shown him himself in the concrete ah how good it was to be so well looked after to have this superb youthful vitality this rage for enjoyment above all never to be worried and perplexed by any conflict of motives never to feel the faintest striving towards a catalogue of tedious aspirations to take and never to give to warm your hands at the glowing fires of hate and stoke those fires with the dry rubbish called love it was worth any price to secure immunity from these aches and pains of consciousness colin announced to violet his intention of taking his lunch down to the bathingplace next morning and having his siesta there and he saw with impatient amusement that she instantly put out of sight the fact that she would spend a solitary day and thought only of him that will be lovely for you she said youll get a long enough bathe for once and not have to break it off to get back to lunch and what will you do he asked think of you enjoying yourself said she colin marvelled in silence that was a good instance of the change in violet in the old days she would at the most have acquiesced if argument were useless now the only argument that seemed to have any weight with her was his enjoyment anyhow they were at one about that colin spent a most satisfactory day there was nino waiting for him at the marina rather heavyeyed but looking precisely as a bacchant should after a characteristic night you were wonderfully drunk last night nino said colin as they pushed off over the waveless bay nino grinned molto molto he said cheerfully but i slept well and i shall bathe and then it will be as if i had drunk no more than a glass of water and will you confess that to the priest asked colin it may have gone from my mind said nino god only remembers everything and indeed i do not know much about last night but that i enjoyed myself thats all that is worth remembering about anything remarked colin a long bathe followed and a bask on the beach and again a bathe then came lunch lying in a strip of shadow and stories from nino and sleep and it was not till late in the afternoon that colin found himself reluctantly loitering back to the villa where violet awaited him he beguiled himself with wondering what he would do if she were not there if as in some fairytale she had disappeared leaving no trace behind but hardly had he come within sight of the white garden wall when he saw her out on the balcony of his room she waved at him as if she had gone there to catch the first sight of him and then disappeared next moment she was at the gardengate walking down to meet him was there news perhaps from england raymond his father what is it he asked as he came within speaking distance nothing wrong nothing right would have expressed his thought more accurately nothing said she i only came to meet you nice day delicious long bathe good lunch long sleep stories from nino colin hesitated a moment he was rather curious to see what violet would think of last night ninos an amusing youth he said he came up here as i told you for the money i owed him and so i gave him a glass of wine two in fact he told me the most horrible tales about tiberius and others and then got frightfully drunk he simply couldnt walk and slept on the sofa in the diningroom oh colin how disgusting said she i hope youve said you dont want his boat any more ive said nothing of the kind i want it every day violet had nothing to say to this and colin felt his irritation at her rising well what is it he said why shouldnt nino get drunk but you shouldnt have let him colin said she its coarse but i come of a low family said he viagi one side and stanier on the other how many generations of staniers have got drunk most nights of their lives violet stopped at the gate what would you think of me colin if i took that little girl who helps in the kitchen and made her drunk she asked i should think you were a very odd young woman said colin but i should be all for your doing what you wanted to whatever it is dont you think so most people dont want to do anything at all its certainly better to do anything than nothing you may make maria drunk as often as you please provided you assure me that you really like it i infer that you liked making nino drunk colin clapped his hands bravo he said youve guessed right i wanted to find out when nino was most himself tipsy or sober and now i know that it is sober i shant make him drunk again i longed to see pure faunishness but nino sober is faunier than nino drunk faunishness asked she yes joyful immoral wicked lovely nature without a rag to cover not its shame but its glory nino is naked sober he was too heavenly last night beforeerthe coarseness he thought of killing his father because he keeps giving him stepmothers and is generally rather in the way and when i asked him if he werent afraid of the devil he said why should i be the devil is a very good friend to me wasnt that queer just as if he were a stanier i felt as if nino were my brother though of course he could never supplant raymond in my heart but then raymonds my twin that is why we are so wrapped up in each other violet felt as if some lightwinged creature was settling on her now here now there and stinging her just so did colin make her wince and as for the wickednessor coarseness was it notof making any one drunk he added i dont agree with you if people are most really themselves when they are rather tipsy they should be rather tipsy as often as possible when is uncle ronald at his best why when his dear nephew has been sitting by him after dinner and filling up his glass for him lets have tea oh dear i cant do right i did wrong to tell you about raymond yesterday and i did wrong to tell you about nino today i shall lead a double life darling and tell you nothing dimly as he spoke violet was aware of some reverberation of dismay that his words and his manner stirred in her was colin really like that were those light words just gibes and jokesnot very pleasant onesor were they authentic glimpses of himself it seemed that her very faith was at stake at all costs she must refuse to acknowledge so unthinkable a possibility that could not be colin he was just teasing her she must reply with the same outrageousness darling lead more than a double life she said such lots of people do that lead three or four ill do the same well have as many lives as a cat between us now tell me some of ninos stories or i shall be afraid that they werent what mother might call quite nice i dont think for a moment she would call them quite nice said he the month of indian summer with warm days and windless nights passed by in golden procession but now with the deepening of autumn the ponente from the west veering sometimes to a chillier quarter sucked the basking out of the bathing and the evenings grew long with the passage into november the sunshine lost its force rain was scribbled across it the grey seaclouds expunged it the wind roared in it it was like passing out of daylight into some dank and dripping tunnel where windows are closed and voices silent and the magic of the day is quenched more tunnellike even was a certain darkness that fell between the two yet on their honeymoon and in that darkness they grew apart like strangers they were just passengers who chanced to be together in the same compartment to violet that darkness consisted of her own ignorance or so she felt it of what colin really was and in proportion as she began to guess at him it grew of more nightmarelike impenetrability he had his moods of entrancing charm of eager affection but now these seemed more like some willothewisp dancing above a marsh than a flame that while it consumed yet fed her and warmed her his light was not meant for her it only happened to fall on her she was in the circle of its brightness she could not avoid pursuing the thought and seeing where it led her she could see no change in him she perceived that he had always been like this and that it was her own light so to speak the illumination of her love which had revealed him to her she began to question who or what it was that shed that charm and evoked that enchantment and shuddered at her own conjecture hints as to that came from other quarters there was his complete indifference as to his fathers health true lord yardley had told him not to worry for there was no cause for that but how could the son of so devoted a father be so immune to any sort of anxiety not less significant was his attitude towards raymond that namely of contemptuous hate he despised raymond that was clear for his failure to kill him he hated him not for having made his attempt so much as for being raymond and there was a puzzle for violet raymond from what colin had told her could now never stand in his way and at lord yardleys death he would simply cease to exist as an obstacle to all that colin desired but colin still hated it was just the fact of raymond not the fact of raymond having planned to kill him and there indeed was a true flame burning colins feeling about raymond had an authentic heat of its own hate in fact was real to him in a way that love was not there was yet one more puzzle colin was determined to spend the night at the house of the british consul in naples not once or twice only but constantly he alluded to this if he wanted it violet knew that he would get it and for herself it made no great matter she considered mr cecil a little red bounder as colin had phrased it and could not understand his insistence on the point he got impatient now when he having alluded to their night in naples she asked why he wanted it and his answer the same as ever that it would please mr cecil who was a useful little red bounder carried no conviction there was something behind and she could not conceive what it was the day of their departure was still uncertain when a second morning of driving rain caused colin to come down to breakfast with his mind made up its quite intolerable he said capri without the heat and sun is like a pantomime without the fairies what a cursed place it only exists in the summer lets go today vi well catch the midday boat but it goes in two hours said she the sooner the better but darling she said oh lord throw your things into your boxes and sit on them darling said colin if theyre spoiled you shall have new ones but i cant endure this island any more we ought to have left before the weather broke instead of stopping on but i really dont think i can be ready she said besides you wanted to stay the night with mr cecil you cant pounce on him as a matter of fact ive just sent giuseppe down to the telephone office to say that we shall arrive tonight said colin violet felt a justifiable rebellion at this she choked it down with a not very convincing lightness but darling youre being too autocratic she said how would it be if you went and i caught you up tomorrow then you could have your adorable mr cecil all to yourself colin turned on her with a blaze of white fury in his eyes of that she caught one glimpse authentic and terrifying then as if by some magical and instantaneous solvent it melted before he spoke into his most charming mood i know i oughtnt to have telephoned darling until i had consulted you he said but its your fault youve spoiled me youve made me think that if i want to do a thing very much youll agree to it i apologise it was stupid of me now if you really dont want to come just say so and ill run down to the town and reverse my first message if it has gone it shall be exactly as you like violet had to take one moment to steady herself that glimpse of colin the most complete she had had yet of something that lay below had gripped her very soul with terror that stabbed at her and passed and from whence it had come she knew not nor whither it had gone only colin remained my dear of course ill come she said ah thats delicious of you said he she went upstairs to tell her maid to pack everything at once as they were off this morning she found her knees trembling with the effect of that moment of abject terror but already in its vanishing it had taken away with it any impression that could be analysed just that stroke stunning as a blow and then colin again chapter ix for many years now with philip yardley a widower and his mother old stanier had withdrawn itself from the splendour of its traditional hospitalities but now with the installation of violet and colin there on their return from italy it blossomed out again into lavish and magnificent flower throughout november a succession of parties assembled there for the pheasant shooting and in the early frosts of that december the wild fowl snipe and duck and teal in the marshes and the unprecedented abundance of woodcock in the park gave an added lustre to the battues in the evening after an hours concert or some theatrical entertainment for which the artists had come from london or paris the band reassembled in the long gallery and dancing kept the windows bright almost till the rising of the late dawn there were many foreign royalties in england that year and none left without a visit to stanier accompanied by cousins of the english house stanier in fact opened its doors as in the days before the stroke fell on philips father and fairly outshone its own records for magnificence colossal in extravagance there was yet nothing insensate in its splendour it shone not for purposes of dazzling but only as reasserting its inherent and historical gorgeousness violet seemed born to the position which she now occupied while colins father lived it was his pleasure that she should be hostess here and she picked up the reins and drove the great gold coach along as if she had been born and trained all her life for that superb rle she and colin at philips wish occupied the wing which was only tenanted by the heir and his wife and though at his death so he supposed they would not step from porch to possession he loved to give them this vicarious regency out of the silver safe there had come for her the toilet set by paul lamerie boxes and brushes candlestick and spirit lamp and above all the great square mirror mounted on a high base amarini of chiselled metal supported it on each side there was no such piece known in museum or royal closet a double cableband encircled the base and the man who was in charge of the plate showed colin how by pressing a stud in the cable just above the makers mark the side of the base sprang open disclosing a secret drawer for some reason not even known to himself colin had not passed on that curious contrivance to violet then philip had brought out for her as colins wife those incredible jewels which his mother tenant for life had long suffered to repose in their chests and one night she gleamed with the stanier pearls another she smouldered among the burning pools of the rubies another she flashed with the living fire of those cascades of diamonds and more than once she wore the sapphire to which so strange a story was attached some said that it had once belonged to the regalia and that elizabeth had no more right to give it to her favourite who founded the splendour of today than she had to bequeath to him the sceptre of her realm but though twice an attempt had been made on the part of the crown to recover it once at elizabeths death and once with the coming of the german dynasty the crown had not proved successful on either of these inauspicious occasions and had to content itself with what it had this great stone was of carats in weight soft cornflower blue in colour and matchless in aqueous purity how it had got among the crown jewels none knew but its possession was even then considered a presage and a fulfilment of prosperity for beyond doubt elizabeth had worn it on her withered breast every day while her fleet was sailing to encounter the armada by tradition the wearer was decked with no other jewels when it blazed forth and indeed its blue flame would have withered any lesser decoration it figured in the holbein portrait of its original possessor in the stanier line as a brooch to colins doublet and there once more impersonating his ancestor colin wore it at the fancy dress ball which concluded the last of these december parties this took place the night before raymond came back from cambridge strange undercurrents swirling and eddying moved so far below the surface of the splendour that no faintest disturbance reached it admirable as was the manner in which violet filled her part it was not of her that philip thought or at her that he looked when he waited with her and colin for the entrance of royal visitors before dinner in the great hall day after day the glass doors were opened but to his way of thinking it was neither for violet nor for them that they swung wide but for colin his own life he believed to be nearly consumed but about the ash of it there crept red sparks and these too were colins all his emotions centred there it was for him and his matchless charm that these great gatherings were arranged philip obliterated himself and feasted his soul on the sight of colin as lord of stanier while raymond lived that could never come to pass but he beguiled himself with the fantasy that when his own eyes grew dim in death colins splendour would light the halls from which he himself had faded that of all the material magnificence of which he still was master had power to stimulate him sceptical of any further future for himself and incurious as to what that might be if it existed at all the only future that he desired was for the son on whom all his love was centred he knew that he was cheating himself that this sight of colin playing host at stanier was one that in all human probability would never after his death be realised but it was in his power now to give colin a taste of it and himself share its sweetness for this reason he had arranged that these gorgeous weeks of entertainment should take place before raymond got back from cambridge for with raymond here raymond the heavy and the unbeloved must necessarily exclude colin from the place which his father so rapturously resigned to him at christmas there would be just the family party and he would be very civil to his eldest son such was the course pursued by one of these undercurrents two others sprang from violet one in direct opposition to that of her fatherinlaw for she knew that so far from his death dethroning her and giving the sovereignty to raymond it but passed on to her with complete and personal possession could his spirit revisit these earthly scenes it would behold her in ownership on her own account of all the titles and splendours that had been his raymondthere alone her knowledge marched with his desirewould be without status here while for colin there would be just such position as his marriage with her gave him she exalted now by philips desire to play hostess in virtue of her marriage would be hostess indeed hereafter and colin host through his relationship to her these weeks had given her a hint a foretaste of what would be hers and once more as in her maidenhood she felt that she would have made any marriage in order to robe herself thus the splendour of what she was lent had set light to her old ambitions again and this was all to be hers not lent but her own she would enter into the fabled inheritance of the legend that legend to which for its very remoteness she had never given two serious thoughts but now though it still wore like a cloak over its head its unconvincing medivalism the shape of it vaguely outlined and indifferently regarded had something sinister about it it did not matter it was only an ugly shadow in the background but now she averted her eyes from it instead of merely not noticing it here then was the second undercurrent which sluggish and veiled yet steadily moved within her for though with the passing of the inheritance to her it would be she who came within the scope and focus of the legend which frankly when looked in the face presented that meaningless ageworn countenance she felt that she was in the grip of it not directly but somehow through colin she told herself that by no combination of diabolical circumstance could that be for with the knowledge that was hers about the date of colins birth and his mothers marriage it was he he and raymond who had passed out of reach of the parchment with its promises and its penalty yet instinct unconvinced by reason told her that it was through colin that she and the children she would bear him would be swept into the mysterious incredible eddy was it the persistent luck that attended him which induced so wildly superstitious a presage like some supernaturally protected being he passed along his way raymonds attempt to kill him had by the merest most fortuitous circumstance of a punctured tyre led to raymonds utter helplessness in his hands colin moved on a charmed pilgrimage idolised and adored by herself by his father by all who came in contact with him and she was beginning to see he had no spark of love in him that was kindled by these fires analyse him and you would find no faintest trace of it perhaps in spite of his twentyone years now so nearly complete he had remained a child still in respect of the hearts emotions yet who could hate like colin who so she shuddered to think could have shewn though but for a second so whitehot a mask of fury as he had once turned on herself she could not succeed in forgetting that and all colins warmth and eagerness of affection to her ever since could not wash that out all day perhaps in the hospitable discharge of their duties they would scarcely have a word together but when at length for a few hours of rest the house grew silent he sought her side relaxed and sleepy yet tingling so she felt with some quality of vitality that no one else had a spark of youth and high spirits the zest of life and the endless power of enjoyment filled the house but colin alone unwearied and eminent as the sun lit up all others it was not the exuberance of his health and energy that was the source of his burning something inspired them the last night had come tomorrow morning their guests would depart and during the day raymond would arrive that night there had been the fancy dress ball and she wearing the crown and necklace and girdle made by cellini had impersonated the illfated duchess of milan for whom they were made and who while wearing them had drunk the poisoned draught which she had herself prepared for her lover colin adored that story the lover a mere groom of the chambers he averred was a sort of old colin stanierall prospered with him even to the removal of his mistress in this manner for she was growing old and wearied him with her insatiable desire colin himself had appeared as his ancestor wearing the great sapphire violet had undressed and got into bed while he remained downstairs with two or three men who still lingered the cellini jewels lay on her dressingtable and feeling too sleepy to plait her hair she had just let it down and it lay in a spread web of gold over her pillow then the door from his dressingroom softly opened and he looked in not asleep he asked no but nearly oh colin stand under the light a moment there the sapphire is alive tonight its like a blue furnace of flame now shield it from the light violet sat up in bed but its the most extraordinary thing she said not a ray from the lamp touches it yet its burning as brightly as ever where does the light come from it comes from below it i believe it comes from you im frightened of you are you a fire it seemed to him no less than her that some conflagration not lit from without burnt in the heart of the stone blue rays generated within shot from it it shone with some underlying brilliance as if as she had said it was he who kindled it watch it then he said unbuckling his cloak even as he detached it from him the fire in it grew dim only the reflection from outside fed it incredulous at what she thought she saw willing to attribute it to some queer effect of faceted surfaces she laughed youve killed it she said i think i shall have to give it you when its mine so that you may keep it alive ah do he said when you come into your ownmay that day be far distant indeed yes she said he sat down on the edge of his bed and began unloosing the jewelled buttons of his doublet i believe my father would almost give it me now he said though i suppose he has no right to just as elizabeth gave it to the other colin i simply adore it ive been saying my prayers to it standing in front of the picture is that what has kept you she asked no they didnt take me long the prince kept me he wanted to hear the whole of the legend he was frightfully impressed he said he felt as if the original colin had been telling it him and expects nightmare he also besought me to swear allegiance when i come of age and see what happens i really think i shall though after all i havent got much to complain of in the way of what the world can give but it will be i really to choose whether i do that or not said violet well i couldnt tell him that said colin though as a matter of fact i forgot it in any case it isnt i to do that raymonds the apparent heirapparent and dear raymond has shewn his allegiance pretty well already though one doesnt quite see why satan made my bicycletyre to puncture if he had been on raymonds side my face would have been nearly blown to bits no raymonds not his favourite fancy raymond being anybodys favourite oh vi a thousand pardons he was yours just for a little colin was slowly undressing as he gave utterance to these reflections he had taken off his shirt and his arms still brown from the tanning of the sun and sea were bare to the shoulder you brute colin she said you brown bare brute shall i dress again said he if a bare arm shocks you no i dont mind that its the brute i object to by the way raymond comes tomorrowtoday rather how on earth can i behave to him with decency dont you wish he wasnt coming colin picked up a long tress of her hair and wound it round his arm no im looking forward to his coming he said smiling im going to make raymond wish that he had never been born im going to be wonderfully agreeable to him and everything i say shall have a double meaning raymond wanted to kill me well i shall shew him that there are other ways of scoring off people my father isnt very fond of raymond as it is but when he sees how pleasant i am to him and how black and sulky raymond is to me he wont become any fonder of him i must think it all out and then all the time raymond will be consoling himself with the thought that when father dies his day will come and hell reign in his stead theres the cream of it vi hell be longing for my father to die you know and when he does raymond will be worse off than ever and you you once said poor raymond to me raymonds got to pay for that i wont have raymond pitied never had colin worn a more radiant face than when walking in and out of his dressingroom brown and lithe as he divested himself of his gorgeous dress and put on his night clothes his beautiful mouth framed itself to this rhapsody of hatred there was nothing passionate about it except its sincerity he did not rage and foam on the surface of his nature he but gleamed with the fire that seemed so strangely to have lit up those wonderful rays in the sapphire that he had been wearing he still held it in his hand when after having turned out the lights in his dressingroom he closed the door and sprang to her side i dont like to leave it alone he said i must pin it to the pillows it will watch over us with you and it by me i shall lie in enchantment between waking and sleeping floating on the golden sea of your hair raymond lets make plans for raymond she lay in the warm tide of his tingling vitality and soon fell asleep but presently she tore herself out of the clutch of some hideous vision which faded from vagueness into nonexistence as she woke and heard his breathing and felt his cheek resting on her shoulder the next night instead of the long cloth which evening after evening had stretched from the window of the great diningroom to the elizabethan sideboard at the other end there was spread near the fire for the night was cold a small round table that just held the five of themphilip and his mother violet raymond and colinand instead of the rows of silver sconces in the dark panels four redshaded candlesticks sufficient for purposes of knife and fork left the rest of the room in a velvety dimness raymond had arrived only just in time to dress for dinner coming into the gallery but half a minute before his father while colin who all this week had been a model of punctuality had not appeared yet philip gave his arm to his mother and behind unlinked came violet and raymond he had advanced to her with elbow formally crooked but she busy with a sleevelace that had caught in her bracelet moved on apart from him she had shaken hands with him and given him a cool cordial word but she felt incapable of more than that philip sat down with a sigh of relief a reasonable evening at last he said though i wouldnt say that if colin were here i believe he got fresher and livelier every day ah raymond you must know weve had some parties here colin took your place as you had to be at cambridge raymond tried to put into his answer the geniality he did not feel i know he said the daily picture papers have been full of colin are you having more people at christmas father no just ourselves as usual raymond turned to violet you had a fancydress ball last night hadnt you he said i could have got down yesterday if i had known philip conjectured a reproach in this and resented it the last few weeks had been planned by him as colins show if colin could not step into his shoes when he was dead he could wear them for a week or two while he lived i thought your term was not over till today he said i could have got leave replied raymond but i understand father philip felt rising in him that ceaseless regret that colin was not his firstborn and that jealousy of colin implied in raymonds i understand irritated his father he wanted colin to come and relieve the situation as he always did what exactly do you mean by that he asked suddenly old lady yardley joined in i know what he means philip she said he means that he should have been host here if you were going to depute one of your sons to do the honours for you and that you preferred that colin should do them instead that is what he means there mother thats enough said philip an embarrassed silence ensued broken by the sound of running steps in the gallery just as they arrived at the door which one of the footmen opened there was a loud crash and colin slid in on his back and had begun to laugh before he picked himself up gosh what a bang he said i believe somebody greased the boards in the hope that i should be in a hurry and fall down sorry father sorry granny sorry violet for upsetting all your nerves whyraymond colin laid his hand affectionately on his brothers shoulder i never knew you had come he said how are you dear raymond hows cambridge we have missed you in all this hullabaloo every one asked after you and wanted to know why you werent here colin took the vacant place between violet and his grandmother how far have you all got he said oh very well i wont have any soup now this is jolly just ourselves granny and short coats and black ties vi darling why didnt you come and pull me out of my bath i was just lying soaking there i had no idea it was so late colin spared one fleeting glance at his brother and began to put into words some of the things he had thought about in his bath raymond it is time that you came home he said the pigeons are worse than ever in the old park and im no earthly use at that snapshooting between the oaks give me a rabbit coming towards me along a road not too fast and a rest for my gun i can hit it in the face as well as anybody but those pigeons among the oaks beat me yes we might have a morning in the old park tomorrow said his father colin looked at violet as if she had called his attention to something yes vi what he asked nothing oh i thought you jogged my elbow tomorrow father oh what a bore i promised to play golf but i shall be back by one if i go on my motorbicycle may i join you at that sharp corner in the road thats about halfway to the keepers lodge and i could come on with you from there but that corner is at the far end of the old park said his father is it the one i mean has a big rhododendron bush close to it you know where i mean raymond is it at the far end yes thats the far end said raymond i believe youre right oh of course youre right and im idiotic its where i picked you up one day in the autumn when you had been after the pigeons colin applied himself to his dinner and caught the others up theres something in my mind connected with that day he said and i cant remember what it is i had been playing golf and i punctured and walked back along the ridge instead of wheeling my bicycle along the road something funny i remember laughing vi darling cant you remember or didnt i tell you violet saw that even in the red glow of the candleshades raymonds face had turned white there was red light upon it but not of it you certainly did not tell me she said in sheer pity i remember the day too there was a man who had escaped from the asylum and stolen a gun from the keepers yes thats right said colin i believe thats on the track a man with a gun philip laughed one of the most amusing things i ever heard colin he said i am surprised at violets forgetting it is that all colin turned to his grandmother granny theyre all laughing at me because i cant remember fathers laughing at me so is violet you and raymond are the only kind ones man with a gun raymond shooting pigeons that makes two men with a gun then there was me the very best story colin most humorous said his father colin sighed sometimes i think of things just as im going to sleep he said if i think of it tonight i shall wake violet and tell her and then shell remember it if i cant man with a gun oh colin stop it said violet well lets put it to the vote said colin father and violet want me to stop trying to remember it little do they know how it would amuse them if i did granny and i want me to go ondont you dearit all depends on raymond what shall i do ray raymond turned to his father appearing not to hear colins question did you have good sport last week he asked ah raymond votes against us granny said colin hes too polite to tell me directly were squashed granny well squash them at whist afterwards you and i shall be partners and well play raymond and father for their immortal souls it will be like the legend wont it violet shall look on and wonder whether her poor husband is going to heaven or hell i keep my immortal soul in a drawer close to violets bedside granny so if we lose she will have to go up to her bedroom and bring it down oh i say im talking too much nobody else can get a word in edgeways it was a fact that the other four were silent but raymond had the faculty of producing silence in his neighbours cigarettes had come now with coffee and this was the usual signal for old lady yardley to rise tonight however she took no notice of the goldmounted stick which was put into her hand by philip never mind them my dear she said they are amusing themselves listen to me colin there was no other voice in the room but hers the servants had gone out and again she spoke no one moved no one spoke but raymond opposite her leaned forward violet leaned leftwise philip with her stick in his hand leaned to the right she dropped her voice to a whisper but in the tense stillness a shout would not have been more audible there are strange things in this house darling said she to colin i have been here sixty years and i know better than anybody green leaf i have been and flower and fruit and now i am withered sixty years ago my dear i sold my soul to the master of it and from that moment i have been a ghost oh such a happy ghost looking on at the glory of the house and then my son philip married and he brought you here and the moment i set eyes on you i loved you for i knew that you were born of the blood and the bargain philip drew back his chair and got up theres your stick mother he said well follow you quite soon or it will be too late for your game of whist she fumbled for the crook of the handle and rose her eyes were bright and as blue as the sapphire colin had worn last night yes but i must talk to colin again she said no one understands me except colin there used to be other games than whist philip at stanier there was dicethrowing you know on the altar of god we are not so wicked now to all appearance whist in the gallery far more seemly raymond held the door open for her and she hobbled through violet following as she passed out violet looked first at raymond and then swiftly away with a shudder at colin dont be long uncle philip she said in a low voice grandmamma is so queer tonight colin moved up next his father give me a glass of port father he said heres raymond back and im so glad to see him your health ray he drank off his glass father isnt it lovely to have raymond back again he said butthis is an asidehes putting on flesh may your shadow never grow more raymond tell us all about cambridge has it been delightful im sure it has for otherwise you wouldnt look so prosperous speech mustnt we have a speech from him father there on one side of philip was colin brimming with good humour and welcome brimming too as he had shewn during dinner with the mere nonsense born of happiness on the other side was raymond serious and unresponsive without a spark to answer this crackling fire there he sat and what sort of host would he have made during these last weeks he made no attempt to reply to colin and but fingered the stem of his glass you might tell us what has been going on raymond said his father nothing particular just the ordinary term ive been playing for the university at soccer i shall probably be in the team and you never told us said colin lord what a swell he is father were not worthy to hear about it thats what is the matter with us philip turned to raymond thats good he said thats pleasant news theres colin here who wont do anything more violent than golf oh father what about shooting pigeons said colin oh no raymond did that bother there was a man with a gun philip got up now dont get on to that again he said youve amused us enough for one night but i may amuse vi maynt i if i think of the rest of it asked colin philip turned his back on him and took raymonds arm he had the sense of behaving with great fairness but the impartiality demanded effort ring the bell colin will you he said over his shoulder im delighted to hear about your success in thethe football field raymond games are taking the place of sport in this generation your uncle ronald and i never played games there was shooting there was riding oh but theres lots of sport still said colin big game father large animals not footballs things that feel and then my bicycle punctured oh you wanted me to ring at this rite of whist for the sake of old lady yardley it was necessary that one of the five should cut out she herself and philip took no part in this chance the rite was that both should play if there was not another table to be formed raymond turned the highest card and with a paper to beguile him sat just where he had sat when one night the whisttable had broken up and he heard colins mimicry as the four others cut for deal some memory of that must have come into colins mind what an awful night that was vi he said when we were playing bridge with aunt hester she revoked do you remember and swore she hadnt how we laughed and then i thought everybody else had gone to bed and igood lord yes another of colins amusing stories said his father shsh said colin granny you always turn up the ace for your trump card will you give me lessons the rubber was very quickly over and raymond took colins place colin drew a chair up close to his brother and instead of reading a paper in the corner watched his hand and the play of it with breathless attention raymond youre a wizard he said at the end of it every plan of yours was right you finessed and caught the king you didnt finesse and caught the queen why dont i have luck like yours its enough to make any fellow jealous i shant look at your hand any more i shall look at violets my poor wife raymonds got all the winning cards again or if he hasnt hell turn them into winning cards hell down you colin if you would talk just a little less said his father we should be able to attend a little more raymond if no one else fully appreciated the utter absence of reproof in his fathers voice if it had been he who had been talking there would have been at the best a chill politeness there at the worst a withering snub but this was the candour of friend to friend about that signed paper now which colin had deposited at his bank he himself had signed some sort of mad confession that he had planned to shoot colin his will had bent to colins like hot wax to strong fingers but could he not somehow get possession of it again while it was in colins hands it was like a toastingfork in which that deviltwin of his impaled and held him before the fire all dinnertime colin had scorched him and not less burning was this mocking kindliness which made the one appear so warmly genial the other awkward and ungracious how long would he be able to stand it presently at the end of the rubber colin would join him in the smokingroom and reveal another aspect no doubt but he could rob him of that further indulgence he would go to bed as soon as the rubber was over the next hand finished it and lady yardley got up she had won tonight from colin and clinked a couple of halfsovereigns in her hand but it will come back to you darling she said everything there is will come to you if you are wise and careful my eyes grow dim as i get older but there is another sort of sight that gets brighter oh i see very well philip went with her to the door your eyes are wonderful yet mother he said there are years of vision in them yet as if colin had read raymonds thought of going to bed he turned to violet i may be a little late tonight darling he said raymond and i are going to have a long talk in the smokingroom oh i think not said raymond im tired i shall go to bed colin whisked round to him not just yet ray he said i havent seen you for so long it would be nice of you to come and have a chat i know you will persuade him to do as i ask vi who knows what important things i may have to tell about philip rejoined them i shall just come in and have a cigarette with you boys he said goodnight violet ah thats jolly said colin they preceded him to the smokingroom for he turned into his own room a moment and as soon as they were there colin shut the door father will be with us in a minute he said and i can only just begin my talk but if you attempt to go to bed when he does raymond i shall tell him about the morning when you shot pigeons oddly enough i have remembered all about it and tomorrow ill telephone for the envelope i left at my bank so its up to you colin came a step closer with such an eagerness must some borgia pope have looked on the white skin of the victim he had ordered to be flayed its jolly seeing you again you sulky blackguard he said has anybody smacked your face since i did it for you youre going to spend the whole of the vacation here unless i get tired of you and send you away before ah theres father isnt it jolly father raymond hopes to spend the whole of the vacation here philip did not seem as enthusiastic as colin about this but he was adequately cordial and having smoked his cigarette in silence got up to go are you coming he said to his sons colin nodded to raymond to answer this we were just going to have a talk first father he said very good dont sit up too late colin hasnt been to bed till three for the last fortnight colin waited till the door was shut now for our talk he said isnt violet looking divine arent i a lucky fellow even the thought of being mistress of stanier wasnt enough to make her tolerate you we had a lovely honeymoon raymond we often talked of you lord how she loathes you i should think even you could see that now an interesting question i ask for information do you think she knows about that morning we were speaking of at dinner i have no means of telling said raymond well well assume she doesnt now i want you to observe her closely again tomorrow and see if you think she knows then ive remembered all about it and as you heard me say i was thinking of telling her just drowsily and quietly tonight and then tomorrow youll guess whether i have done so or not take coffee for breakfast if you think i have tea if you think i havent what a jolly christmas game colin poured himself out a glass of whisky and soda fancy father saying that i didnt care for sport he said i adore the thought of the sport im going to have with you you used to be rude to me when we were alone now you have got to be polite i can always send for that paper which you signed and father witnessed now dont be tedious and say that the condition on which you signed was that i would not tell him what does that matter to me you wanted to kill me all that i do now is in selfdefence otherwise you might plan to kill me again he yawned im rather sleepy tonight raymond he said i thought the satisfaction of seeing you again would make me wakeful i shall go upstairs violet will be pleased that i have not sat up late after all i shall sit on her bed and talk to her last night her hair made a golden mat on the pillow there is a marvellous fragrance in her hair do you remember that from the daysnot many of themwhen you used to kiss her how she winced now its your turn to wince we shall talk about you no doubt and remember about the tea and the coffee tomorrow day after day colin amused himself thus morning after morning raymond had to guess whether violet had been told until one evening wearying of this particular game colin casually mentioned that all his guessings had been superfluous for violet had known ever since one day on their honeymoon when she had provoked him by saying poor raymond even as a cat with a mouse so colin played with him taking no notice of him except in ordinary intercourse for nearly a whole day and letting him seem forgotten then with quivering shoulders he would spring on him again tap him with sheathed claws and a velvet paw or with more forcible reminder nip him with needlelike teeth it was useless and worse than useless for violet to plead for him her advocacy her appeal to the most elementary feeling of compassion only exasperated colin darling as if my brain wasnt busy enough with raymond you must go and add to my work like that he said ive got to cure you of being sorry for raymond as well i thought you were cured when i told you he tried to murder me just let your mind dwell on that he planned to shoot me from behind that wall ill take you there tomorrow and show you the place to make it more vivid to you ones brother must not make such plans and fail without suffering for it afterwards perhaps you would prefer that he had succeeded ah i made you shudder then you trembled deliciously ive got such a delightful christmas present for him a little green jade pigeon with ruby eyes it cost a lot of money the greeni shall explain to himis his jealousy of me for hes devoted to you still and the red eyes are the colour of my blood and the whole will remind him of that amusing morning the new year came in with three nights of sharp frost and the ice on the bathing lake grew thick enough to bear the lake was artificial lying in a small natural valley through which a stream ran a dam some twelve feet high had been built across the lower end of it in which was the sluice gate thus the stream confined by the rising ground at the sides and the dam at the end had spread itself into a considerable sheet of water shallow where the stream entered it but some nine feet deep at the lower end where was the bathingplace and the header boards and pavilions for bathers the dam was planted with rhododendron bushes whose roots strengthened the barrier and in summer the great bank of blossom overhung the deep water a path ran behind them crossing the sluice by a stone bridge with balustrade raymond had gone down there directly after breakfast and came back with the news that he had walked this way and that across the ice and that it seemed safe enough for some reason which colin failed to fathom he seemed in very cheerful spirits today it might be that the end of the christmas vacation was approaching when he would return to cambridge it might be that he like colin himself had seen the rapidity with which old age was gaining on his father there was humour in that raymond looked forward and little wonder to his own succession here not knowing poor shorn lamb that he would be worse off than ever when that unpropitious event occurred as for the remission of subtle torture which his return to cambridge would give him there were several days yet thought colin opportunity for much pleasant pigeonconversation so raymond got his skates while colin and violet sitting cosy in the long gallery wondered whether it was worth while going out and he went down by the long yew hedge to the lake with brisk foot and brightened eye after all other people besides colin could make plans and one of his had matured this morning into a luscious ripeness sleepless nights had been his with hands squeezing for colins throat and dawn breaking in on the fierce disorder of his thoughts before he had distilled his brain down to the clear broth wild and vagrant fancies got hold of him goaded as he was to the verge of desperation by this inhuman persecution red madnesses had flashed before him like the cloaks that the matadors wave before the bull and whether he charged or not another ribanded dart pierced him he had bitten his lip till the blood flowed in order to recall himself to selfcontrol and to use those hours of the night when colin was with violet to hew out some defence to the fluttered red and the ribanded dart there had been his handicap hate of colin had made him violent whereas colins hate of him had made colin calm and selfpossessed he must cease to rage if he hoped to arrive at any plan so night after night he had curbed himself making his wits reduce their mad galloping to an orderly pace and pull steadily in harness the grass was encrusted with the jewels of frost every step crunched a miracle of design into powder and now for the first time since he had come to stanier raymond fed with the braced joy of a frosty morning on the banquet which the season spread he was hungry for it all these days he had been starved and tortured sick with apprehension and shuddering at the appearance of colin with rack and pincers but now he was hungry again for the good things of life and the long draught of cold air was one of them and the treading of the earth with muscles alternately strong and relaxed was another and the sense of the great woodlands that would in no distant future be his was a third for how old how rapidly ageing was his father and the cong he would soon give to colin and violet was a fourth sweeter than any how sour had turned his love of violet if indeed there had ever been any sweetness in it he lusted after her that he knew but just because she knew the events of that morning when all had gone so awry he thought of her as no more than a desirable mistress ha there was a woodcock in the frost of the morning it had lain so close that he approached within twenty yards of it before it got up he was near enough to see how it pulled itself forward grasping a blade of grass in its reedlike bill before it could get those long wings free of the ground where it squatted with a flip flap it skidded and swerved through the rhododendron bushes even if he had had a gun with him he could scarcely have got a shot flipflap it was just so that he had escaped from colins barrels those nights of thought when he had bandaged the eyes of rage had given him simplicity at last such simplicity as colin had so carelessly arrived at when he came through the oaks of the old park he had trusted to the extraordinary similarity of his own handwriting to that of colin and had written a letter in colins name to colins bankers requesting them to send the letter which he had deposited there last august with the note on the outside of it about its eventual delivery in case of his death to his brother lord stanier whose receipt would be forwarded raymond knew it to be a desperate measure but after all nothing could be more desperate than his position here bound hand and foot to colin as long as that sealed envelope remained at messrs bertrams the bank might possibly make a further inquiry telegraph to colin for confirmation but even if that happened colin was doing his worst already no such disaster had followed this morning raymond had received from the bank a registered letter containing the unopened envelope forwarded to him by direction of hon colin stanier so now as he went briskly towards the frozen lake the confession which he had signed was safe in the lettercase he carried in the inside pocket of his coat and for very luxury of living over again a mad moment which now was neutralised he drew it out and read it there it was in that crisis of guilt covered by colins pistol he had consented to any terms but now let colin see what would be his response when next he talked in flashes of that veiled lightning concerning a shooting of pigeons concerning a morning when there was a lunatic at large indeed raymond determined that this very day he would fling the challenge himself instead of sitting dumb under colins blistering jibes he would defy him he would insult and provoke him till he was stung into sending to the bank for the famous confession vowing an instant disclosure of the whole matter to his father how raymond would snap a finger in his face for that threat and how when colin received the answer from the bank that the packet in question had been sent by his own orders to his brother would he choke with the derisive laughter of hate who without solid proof would credit such a tale besides raymond had it all ready now no doubt lord yardley would remember witnessing with colin the paper about which he now impotently jabbered had not the brothers come in together ever so pleasantly on that morning of the pigeonshooting and asked for his witnessing signature that paper so raymond now framed it had set forth how he had determined to make a better job of brotherhood than he had hitherto done and to realise that violet and colin were mated in love and already the pact had fulfilled itself for never had the two spent days of such public fraternal amity write to the bank for it in my name colin would be supposed to have said and tear it up dear ray itll be fun too to see if they can distinguish your handwriting from mine that was what colin would find waiting for him if he sent to the bank for the document on which this insane accusation was based his skates fitted on to boots clanked in his hand his foot trod briskly on the frozen soil that would soon be his own those eyeteeth of colins were drawn his father aged rapidly and without doubt before many months the parkgates would have clapped on to the final exit of colin and his wife perhaps he would let stanier to some dollargorged american he had no feeling for it himself and the other two would abhor that never yet had stanier been tenanted by aliens it was enough to make the dead turn in their graves what was more important it would make the living writhe perhaps colinhe would be very rich alaswould try to take it the wouldbe lessees must be closely scrutinised so here was the lake with its stiff frozen margin a stamp on it and a short slide over the black ice produced no cluck of remonstrance the pavilion of the bathingplace was on the other side but a felled treetrunk made a comfortable seat for the exchange of his walking shoes into the boots with skates on them he had spent a winter month in switzerland two years before and hungered for the bite of the blade on the sweet fodder of that black field instantly as in swimming the instinct of that balance came back to him and with long strokes he curved out on to the delightful playground outside edge and a dropped turn an outside back and a taking up of the direction with the other foot colin at this moment had made up his mind not to skate till after lunch im lazy he said to violet im tired of baiting raymond he was more cheerful than i like this morning vi i shall smoke a cigarette and think of something new lord ive got no matches there was a paper basket handy and he drew a crumpled envelope from it meaning to get a light with it from the log fire uncrumpling it he saw it was addressed to lord stanier and idly turning it over as he made his spill he saw the seal of his own bank the envelope was registered he tore a narrow strip off the edge of it and used it for his purpose i should like to sit here talking to you all morning he said but that beastly motorbicycle of mine has gone wrong again i think ill go up to the stables to see about it skating this afternoon isnt it i hate seeing raymond skate because hes so good at it but as i want to skate myself whats to be done colin floated off in his crisp graceful manner and never was he so alert as when he appeared to be loitering why had raymond received a registered envelope from bertrams bertrams was not raymonds bank what had that envelope contained he strolled out of the front door the stables lay to the right but raymond hugely cheerful that morning had gone to the lake which was in the opposite direction so deferring the matter of the bicycle he went down by the yew hedge and along the path on the top of the dam behind the rhododendrons he could hear the ring of raymonds skates on the frozen surface raymond would have to cease his sport and explain the matter of the envelope hidden by the bushes he had nearly come to the bridge over the sluice when from close at hand there came a noise of loud crackings and splintering across the lake and a great splash for one moment colin stood quite still his heart beating high and fast then with quickened pace he walked on to the bridge over the sluice some ten yards out was a large hole in the surface with jagged edges a cap and fragments of broken ice floated on it and bubbles rose from below he has been carried under the ice thought colin how cold it must be the water is deep there what was to be done nothing it seemed he could run up to the house and get help a rope a plank something to put out across that gaping hole on which the sunlight glittered but before he could return all hope all chance rather of saving raymond must have passed was there no other plan his mind usually so ingenious and resourceful seemed utterly blank save for an overwhelming curiosity as to whether raymond would come to the surface again just once just for a second as he looked leaning on the balustrade of the bridge raymonds head appeared his face was white and wideeyed the lips of his open mouth blue with the cold across those ten yards which separated them their eyes met colins bright and sparkling with exuberant life the others stricken with the ultimate and desperate terror colin waved his hand so youve fallen in he said ill go and see what can be done if im too late well goodbye rather cold isnt it the last words were spoken to emptiness there was the cap still floating and the stream of bubbles breaking on the surface of the sparkling water colin gave one leap in the air like some young colt whose limbs tingle with the joy of life and rubbed his hands which were chilled with leaning on the bridge of course it was no use going to the house the shock and cold and the soft smothering water would have done their work long before he could bring help and the resources of stanier so powerful for the living had no succour or consolation for the dead indeed it would be better not to go to the house at all for he could not imagine himself in this ecstatic moment simulating haste and horror and all that would be appropriate to the occasion so making a circuit through the woods he strolled ten minutes later into the stable yard to see about his bicycle he had a pleasant word for the groom and a joke for the motormechanic just then his brain could only be occupied with trivial things a great glittering curtain seemed to be let down across it behind which were stored treasures and splendours presently when he came to himself he would inspect these he showed himself to violet and his father who were in the long gallery when he got back to the house said a word about his motorbicycle hoped that raymond was having a good time and went into the smokingroom now was the time to pull up that glittering curtain till then the fact of raymonds death just the removal the extinction of him had hidden all that might lie behind it now colin saw with an amazed gasp of interest how all the activity of his brain was needed to cope with the situation raymond was finished with while his father still lived the remote the unexpected the unlookedfor had occurred yet not quite unlookedfor one morning dreaming on the capri beach colin had taken this possibility into account had let it simmer and mature in his brain and as outcome had made violet spend a night at the house of the british consul in naples how wise that had proved he would have been grinding his teeth if he had not done that swiftly he ran over the whole process from the beginning and though there were problems ahead of him so far his course had been flawless first had come the erasure in the consulate register and the insertion of that single numeral in his mothers letter to salvatore he would have to see dear uncle salvatore again that had smoothed the way for his marriage with violet that had ensured even if raymond lived to be a hundred his own mastership and that of his children after him at stanier it was not mastership in name for he would but be husband to its mistress but he knew that name alone would be lacking to the completeness of possession he could not have provided better for the eventuality of his fathers death which according to all human probability would occur before raymonds but fate that blind incalculable chance had decreed otherwise and colin gave a frown and a muttered exclamation to the recognition of the fact that had he left the register alone and torn up instead of emending his mothers letter he would now be heir to stanier as he indeed truly was in his own right it was a pity to have devoted all that ingenuity to have saddled himself with considerable expense as regards that troublesome salvatore when fate all the time was busier and wiser than he yet it had been necessary and it was no use wasting regret over it what stood in his way now was the letter and the register with regard to the former it was easy to destroy it and to indicate to salvatore that all required of him was to hold his tongue or if necessary to tell a mere simple truth that he had given colin two letters onehe seemed to recollectdated march in which his sister announced her marriage the other a fortnight later giving news of the birth of the twins uncle salvatore with his viagi pride so colin smilingly reflected would be glad that the stain on the family honour could be expunged rosina was married when she brought forth for him too it was pleasant to have the bar sinister lifted from him it would not he allowed have weighed heavily on him in any case it would have been amply compensated for by the enjoyment of stanier and the expulsion of raymond but now there was no need for that ounce of bitter so much then for the letters they could be destroyed violet would ask in vain for their production to prove her possession what letters do you mean darling he would answer yes those letters should perish at once he turned his thoughts to the register there at this moment it reposed in that archiveroom bearing the erasure so easily overlooked so convincing when pointed out you had but to look carefully and so to speak you could see nothing but the erased numeral it stared at you he had it was true in his keeping a copy of that entry certified to be correct by mr cecil which bore the earlier date but now that violet had been informed of that erasure she would when stanier changed hands insist on the production of the register and knowing where to look and what to see her lawyer would draw the conclusion which even in the absence of confirming letters might easily satisfy a jury the register had been tampered with and in whose interests but colins and by what hand without doubt by his fathers not that that would hurt him then or his own there was danger remote perhaps but alive and smouldering on that page it must be quenched colin recalled his meditations on the capri beach which foresaw this contingency with a vividness as clear as was the october air on that morning all the circumstances of it were equally sharpedged in his memory the sense of the hot pebbles of the beach on which he lay the sea and its crystal embrace awaiting him when he got baked and pining for its coolness nino the joyous pagan boy asleep in the shade vesuvius across the bay with the thin streamer of smoke that was the milieu where thought came clean and clear to you and clear and clean that morning had his thoughts been providing for this very situation the pieces of it lay in his brain like the last few fragments of a puzzle he had no need even to fit them together for he could see how curve corresponded with curve and angle with angle all was in order ready to be joined up now that raymond no longer blocked his way and the keypiece round which the others fitted was undoubtedly that visit of violet to mr cecil then came quick steps up the passage and violet burst in oh colin she said a terrible thing has happened uncle philip and i walked down to the lake raymond was not there his boots were on the bank there was a hole where the ice had given way at the deep end uncle philip is getting men and ropes chapter x it was not till well on in the afternoon that the body was recovered all day the cold had been intense and the ropes with the tackle for this terrible fishing got stiff and frozen but at sunset they found it the stream had carried it along below the ice towards the sluice philip sat up with colin in the long gallery when violet and lady yardley had gone to bed he felt no sorrow for he had not liked raymond he had not even loved him with his fatherhood for all that had been given to colin often and often he had longed that colin had been the eldest now there was none other than colin he would have all that his father coveted for him but though he felt no sorrow he felt remorse and pity remorse that he had not liked this dead son of his pity that he had died young i reproach myself colin most bitterly he had been saying it was hard to be kind to poor raymond he kept kindness at arms length but i ought to have tried more i ought to have taken example from you you never wearied of kindness colin laid his hand on his fathers arm all the evening he had been keeping things together by a tact so supreme that it appeared pure naturalness he had talked quite freely about raymond recalled a hundred little incidents in which raymond was a mild hero his shooting his prospect of playing football for cambridge it was clear too that the tragedy had made very little impression on his grandmother and so he had taken it for granted that they would play their rubber of whist why not you mustnt think of it like that father he said you did what you could you made it very jolly for him here he liked coming home he was going to stop here the whole of the christmas vacation you know if he had not been enjoying it he would not have done that colin revelled in the underlying meaning of his words how raymond had been enjoying it hadnt he philips servant came into the room he carried on a tray raymonds watch and chain and a pocketbook they found these on his lordships body my lord he said i thought it best to bring them you philip took them and looked absently at the watch which had stopped at a few minutes to eleven he must have fallen in almost immediately he said i had better look at what is in his pocketbook it may contain papers that must be attended to not until that moment had colin given another thought to what raymond had received that morning in the envelope from bertrams bank now in a flash he conjectured that whatever it was and he felt no doubt of what it was it would be found in that pocketbook which his father even then was opening how lucky it was that he had not told his father about that attempt of raymonds how splendid would appear his own magnanimity his own unfailing kindness to him he could emphasise them even more by a reluctance that his father should examine these remains the water it is true might have got in and soaked the paper if it was there into illegibility but the leather of the pocketbook seemed to have resisted well it might easily prove to contain a legible document he got up in an excitement which his father did not understand are you wise to do that do you think he asked in a quick anxious voice there may be something there which will pain you all his papers must be gone through said his father have you any reason colin i cant explain said colin papers were coming out of the pocketbook now in no way perished by the long immersion they were damp but they held together and colin glanced with a lynxs eye at them as his father unfolded them there were a couple of bills he could see which philip laid on one side and then he came to a halfsheet of foolscap he read a line or two looked at the bottom of it and saw his own name what is this he said its signed by raymond and witnessed by you and me dont look at it father said colin knowing that it was inevitable that his father must read anything that was witnessed by himself let me take it and burn it no i cant do that said philip what does this mean what ah dont read it dont read it said colin in a voice of piteous pleading i must then listen to me instead i will tell you never had his father looked so old and haggard as then he had seen enough of what was written there to light horror in his eyes and blanch his face to a deadly whiteness tell me then he said colin sat down on the edge of his fathers chair its a terrible story he said and i hoped you should never know it but it seems inevitable and remember father as i tell you that raymond is dead his voice failed for a moment that means forgiveness doesnt it he said death is forgiveness you see what i mean itsits you who have to teach me that you will see he collected himself again it was after i came back from capri in the summer and after vi was engaged to me he said that what is referred to there took place hepoor raymondalways hated me he thought i had your love which should have been his as well and then i had violets love after she had accepted him for her husband there was a thought in that which made it so bitter thatthat it poisoned him he got poisoned you must think of it like that and the thought raymonds poisoned thought was this he knew that violet had the passion for stanier which you and i have yet when she was face to face with the marriage to him she gave up stanier father dear it wasnt my fault that i loved her you didnt think it was when i told you out in capri and it wasnt her fault when she fell in love with me no colin he said love is like that go on my dear colin spoke with difficulty now then came a day he said when a lunatic escaped from that asylum at repstow you had news of it one night and told raymond and me he was a homicidal fellow and he got hold of one of your keepers guns next morning raymond went to shoot pigeons and i bicycled on my motor to play golf and thenthen father we must suppose that the devil himself came to raymond it wasnt raymond who planned what raymond did he expected me to come back along the road from the lodge and hehe hid in the bushes at that sharp corner with his gun resting on the wall and his plan was to shoot me it would have been at the distance of a few yards only lord yardley interrupted his voice was hoarse and nearly inaudible wait a minute colin he said all this reminds me of something i have heard and yet only half heard colin nodded i know he said ill tell that presently there was poor raymond waiting for me to come round the corner there was this madman loose in the park somewhere and if thethe plan had succeeded it would have been supposed that it was the madman who had killed me but an accident happened my bicycle punctured and i walked back for the trudge along the ridge of the old park colin choked for a moment i caught the glint of sun on a gunbarrel by the wall at that sharp corner he said and i wondered who or what that could be it could not be the escaped madman for they had told me at the lodge that he had been caught and then i remembered that raymond was out shooting pigeons and i remembered that raymond hated me it occurred to me definitely then and i felt sick at the thought that he was waiting for me and then father the mere instinct of selfpreservation awoke if it was raymond if i was terribly right i could not go on like that in constant fear of my life i had to make myself safe i stole down taking cover behind the oaks till i got close and then i saw it was raymond i was white with rage and i was sick at heart i had a revolver with me for you or viyou i thinkhad persuaded me to take it out in case i met the wretched madman and father i had met a wretched madman i covered him with it and then i spoke to him i told him that if he moved except as i ordered him i would kill him he collapsed every atom of fight was out of him and he emptied his gun of its cartridges and laid it down and all the time there wasnt a cartridge at all in my revolver i had taken them out and forgotten to put them back it was after he had collapsed that i found that out a wan smile as unlike to colins genial heat of mirth as the moonlight is to the noonday sun shivered and trembled on his mouth and vanished again leaving it so serious so tender he confessed he said but i had to make myself safe i told him he must put that confession into writing and sign it and you and i would witness it that was done i told youdo you rememberthat raymond and i had a secret pact and we wanted your witness to his signature that was it and it is that you hold in your hand now i sent it to my bank bertrams again in selfdefence for i knew that he would not dare to make any attempt on me since if it were successful however far from suspicion he seemed to stand there would come into your hands the confession that he had attempted to kill me look at the envelope father in case of my death you will read there it was to be delivered to you philip did not need to look go on colin he said how did it come into raymonds possession i can only conjecture that but this morning after poor ray had gone out to skate i wanted a light for my cigarette and i had no matches i drew out something from the wastepaper basket it was an envelope directed to raymond and on the back was the seal of the bank his handwriting as you know was exactly like mine a spider scrawl you used to call it i think he must have written to the bank in my name asking that what i had deposited there was to be sent to him he would never be safe till he had got that andand oh father i should never have been safe when he had got it there was a long silence colins head was bent on his fathers shoulder he lay there quivering while in philips face the grimness grew presently colin spoke again you said you had heard or half heard some of this he said i will remind you one night at dinner the night ray got back from cambridge i made the usual nonsensical fool of myself i seemed to try to recollect something funny that had happened on the morning when ray went out to shoot pigeons a man with a gun i said and you and vi voted that i was a bore but i think raymond knew why i said it and went on with it till you were all sick and tired of me i made a joke of it you see i could not talk of it to him i could not be heavy and say i forgive you i wipe it out that would have been horrible for him the only plan i could think of was to make a joke of it hoping he would understand i think he did i think he saw what i meant but yet he wanted to be safe oh lord how i understand that how anxious i was to be safe and not to have to tell you but i have had to if you had listened to me father you would have burned that paper then no one would ever have known of course colin remembered that violet knew but he went on without a pause im all to pieces tonight he said i have horrible fears and all sorts of dreadful things occur to me that paper is safe nowhere father it wasnt even safepoor rayat my bank supposing vi by some appalling mischance got to see it it would poison raymonds memory for her he did love her i am sure of that and though she didnt love him she thinks tenderly and compassionately of him she is not safe while it exists burn it father just look at it once first if you want to know that i have spoken quiet sober truth which i did not want to speak as you know and then burn it philips first instinct was to throw it straight into the smouldering logs he believed every word colin had said but there was justice to be done to one who could not plead for himself he was bound to see that raymond had acted the story that colin had told him dryeyed and grim he read it from first word to last and then stood up here it is he said you have been scrupulously accurate i should like you to see me burn it the paper was damp and for a little while it steamed above the logs then with a flap a flame broke from it a little black ash clung to the embers and grew red then a faint grey ash ascended and pirouetted philips stern eyes melted and he turned to his only son and now i have got to forget he said that seemed the very word colin was waiting for thats easy he said its easy for me dear father so it cant be difficult for im an awful brute we shall have to make a pact you and i we must burn what we know out of our hearts just as you have burned the evidence of it it doesnt exist any more it was some wretched dream oh colin said his father and in those words was all the wonder of love which cannot credit the beauty the splendour that it contemplates colin saw his father to his room and then walked back down the great corridor quenching the lights as he went for he had told the butler that no one need sit up he drew back the curtains of the window at the head of the stairs as he passed and looked out on to the clearness of the frosty midnight moonlight lay over the whiteness of the gardens and terraces but the yew hedge black and unfrosted seemed like some funeral route to be followed to where the ice gleamed with a strange vividness as if it were the skylight to some illuminated place below then letting the curtain fall again he went softly past the head of the lit passage where his room and violets lay to put out the light at the far end of this corridor in the last room to the left he knew raymond was lying and he went in the last toilet had been finished and the body lay on its bed below a sheet candles were burning as if that which lay there dreaded the darkness and on the table by the bed was a great bowl of white hothouse flowers colin had not seen raymond since that white face looked at him across the rim of broken ice there had been disfigurement he imagined and full of curiosity he turned back the sheet there were little scars on the nose and ears particularly but nothing appalling and he looked long at raymonds face the heavy eyelids were closed the mouth pouted sullenly death had not changed him at all he hardly looked asleep drowsy at the most not a ray of pity softened colins smiling face of triumph for a month after raymonds death the four of them representing three generations of staniers remained quietly there his name was mentioned less and less among them for after colins disclosure to his father philip avoided all speech about him and as far as he could all thought horror came with the thought of him the most his father could do was to try to forget him but for an accident in that matter of a punctured tyre colin would now be lying where raymond lay and all sunshine would have passed from his declining years he was no more than sixtysix but he was old colin used to wonder at the swift advance of old age like some evening shadow which lengthened so rapidly but beyond the shadow philips sky was full of light his desire had been realised though by tragic ways and his death neither dreaded nor wishedfor would realise it there were however events in the future which he anticipated with eagerness the first was colins coming of age next march for generations that festival had been one of high prestige in the family and in spite of the recency of raymonds death he meant to celebrate it with due splendour the other was even more intimately longedfor early in july violet would if all were well become a mother and to see colins son to know that the succession would continue was the dearest hope of his life and these two expectations brought back some st martins summer of the spirit to him he began to look forward as is the way of youth instead of dwelling in the past the lengthening shadow stayed it even retreated but colin had an important piece of business to effect before his fathers death and he was waiting without impatience but watchfully for an opportunity to set out on it as usual he wanted the suggestion which would give him this opportunity to come not from himself but from others he would seem then to do what he desired because it was urged on him a week of dark foggy weather towards the end of february favoured his plans influenza was about and he had a touch of it in no way serious indeed possibly useful after a couple of days in his room he reappeared again but with all the fire gone out of him he was silent and depressed and saw that his fathers eyes watched him with anxiety still feeling rather down asked philip one morning when colin pushed an untasted plate away from him at breakfast colin made a tragic face at the window nothing could be seen outside the fog was opaque and impenetrable thats not very encouraging father he said not convalescing weather he appeared to pull himself together but theres nothing to worry about he said i should feel depressed in this damp darkness whether i had had the flue or not you want the sun said philip ah the sun is there one do show it me philip walked to the window thin rain was leaking through the fog it certainly was not inspiriting well why not go and see it for yourself he said theres sun somewhere go off to the riviera for a fortnight with violet oh that would be divine if we only could said colin buti daresay its funny of mei dont want vi to go through the sort of journey you have at this time of year the trains are crammed a fellow i know had to stand all the way from paris to marseilles i shouldnt like her to do that besides we cant both leave you go alone then violet will understand colin sighed i dont think i feel much like travelling either he said ill stick it out father i can go to bed again i think thats the most comfortable place besides the riviera is like a monkeyhouse just now go to the villa at capri then ah dont talk of it said colin getting up cant i see the stonepine frying in the sunshine and the freesias will be out and the wallflowers nino your old boatmans son wrote to me the other day he said the spring had come and the vines were budding and it was already hot hot i could have cried for envy dont lets talk of it but i will talk about it said philip im master here yet father i dont like that joke said colin very well well leave it out and be serious i shall talk to violet too no no no said colin without conviction hullo here is vi please dont mention the name of that beloved island again or i shall cry morning vi youre enough sunshine for anyone colin strolled out of the room so as to leave the others together and presently philip passed through the long gallery and was certainly engaged in telephoning for a while it was a trunkcall apparently for there was an interval between the ringing up and the subsequent conversation all that day neither philip nor violet made the least allusion to capri but there was certainly something in the air the last post that night arriving while they were at cards brought a packet for lord yardley which he opened there thats the way to treat obstinate fellows like you colin he observed and tossed over to him the book of tickets to naples and back father and violet youre brutes he said i give up colin was ever so easily persuaded by mr cecil to spend a couple of nights if not more in naples before he went across to the island and he had a youthful pathetic tale to tell they had had a terrible time in england no doubt mr cecil had seen the notice of his brothers deathmr cecil could imagine his fathers grief and indeed his own and violets kind messages by the way from them both they would none of them forgive him if he came to england this year and did not reserve at least a week for them either in london or at stanier then colin himself had caught influenza and his father and wife had insisted on his going south for a week or two and letting the sun soak into him but after that month of secluded mourning at stanier it was rather heavenlycolin looked like a seraph who had strayed into a sad world as he said thisto pass a couple of days in some sort of city where there were many people and all gay some stir of life and distraction from his own sorrowful thoughts one has to buck up again some time said colin and often i longed to escape from stanier and just go up to town and dine with some jolly people and go to a musichall and have supper somewhere and forget it all for a time shocking of me i suppose no no i understand i quite comprehend that colin said cecil i beg your pardon i should say lord stanier oh dont said colin i hate the title it was dear raymonds you never saw him i think mr cecil had begun to feel like a family friend he felt himself a sort of uncle to this brilliant boy so shadowed by woe so eager to escape out of the shadow it was his mission clearly to aid in this cure physical and mental of sunlight no never said he only you and your wife and your father a privilege colin drank the hospitable cocktail that stood at his elbow his definite plans were yet in the making but he began to suspect that alcohol in various forms would be connected with them he had the stanier head as regards drink it only seemed to collect and clarify his wits and he remembered that mr cecil on that night which he had spent alone here had quickly passed through joviality and perhaps want of dignity to bland somnolence he got up with an air of briskness and mutual understanding im not going to be a wetblanket mr cecil he said ive told you enough to make you see that i pine for enjoyment again that little restaurant where you and i went beforemay we dine there again i want to see other people enjoying themselves and i want the sun those are my medicines be a kind good doctor to me mr cecils treatment so he congratulated himself seemed wonderfully efficacious that evening colin cast all sad thoughts behind him and between one thing and another and specially between one drink and another it was after twelve oclock before they returned from their dinner to mr cecils flat again even then a story was but halftold and mr cecil drew his keys from his pocket to unlock a very private drawer where there were photographs about which he now felt sure colin would be sympathetic youll like them he giggled as he produced these prints help yourself colin i see they have put out some whisky for us oh lord how funny said colin looking at what mr cecil shewed him but i cant drink unless you do say when mr cecil mr cecil was looking at the next photograph and colin took advantage of his preoccupation the big bunch of keys by which this private this very private drawer was opened still dangled from the lock and this one said mr cecil applying himself to the liberal dose but what a glorious creature said colin may i help myself mr cecil had a confused idea that colin had finished his first drink and wanted another so he finished his own and wanted another of course my dear boy he said just a nightcap eh a drop of whisky at bedtime ive noticed makes one sleep all the sounder colin was on the apex of watchfulness photograph after photograph was handed to him but long before they came to the end of them the effects of the nightcap were apparent in mr cecil the keys still hung from the lock and colin as he replaced the last of this unblushing series got up and stood between this tabledrawer and his host and that statuette there he said pointing to the other side of the room surely weve seen a photograph of that mr cecil chuckled again but the chuckle could hardly emerge from his sleepslack mouth ah ill tell you about that tomorrow he said looking round at it colin with one of his caressing boyish movements put his hand on mr cecils shoulder and ever so imperceptibly drew him towards the door i feel a different fellow altogether he said i shall sleep like a top and i have enjoyed myself you ought to give up your consular work and start a cure for depressed young men youd make a fortune they were out in the passage by this time and it was clear that the nightcap had banished all thought of his keys from mr cecils head he saw colin to his room lingered a moment to see that he had all he wanted and then went to his own a charming young fellow he thought performed a somnambulistic feat of undressing and fell into his bed colin heard his door shut and then in a moment turned off his light and stealthily opening his own door stood in the entry listening for any sound for a minute or two there were faint muffled noises from his hosts room but soon all was still except for the creaking of his own shirtfront as he breathed then reentering his room he stripped and put on his pyjamas and soft felt slippers which would be noiseless on the boards outside once more he stood there and waited and now from inside mr cecils room came sounds rhythmical and reassuring enough light dribbled in through the uncurtained windows to guide his steps without fear of collision and he glided into the room they had just left and felt his way to the table where the keys still dangled he unloosed them grasping them in the flap of his jacket so that they should not jingle as he moved and went down the passage to the door of the consular offices the big key for the door was in the lock and turned noiselessly the archiveroom lay to the right and with the door into the house shut behind him he permitted himself the illumination of a match and passed through the shutters were closed and he lit a candle that stood on the table for official sealing there in the wall was the locked press that he so well remembered and the trial of halfadozen of the keys on the bunch he carried gave him the one he looked for the date labels were on the back of the volumes and he drew out that which comprised the year he wanted quietly he turned over the leaves and found the page which contained the contract between rosina viagi and philip lord stanier even in this onecandlepower light the erasure was visible to the eye that looked for it a paperknife lay among the tools of writing on the table and folding the leaf back to its innermost margin he severed it from the book and thrust it inside the cord of his trousers brighteyed and breathing quickly with excitement and success he replaced the volume and locked the press he grasped the keys as before blew out the candle quenching the smouldering wick in his fingers and went back locking the door of the office behind him into the room from which he had fetched the keys he replaced them in the drawer of unblushing photographs and pausing for a moment at his own door listened for the noise that had reassured him before there it was resonant and rhythmical he closed his door turned up his light and drew the severed page from his trousers he had been gone so his watch told him not more than five minutes rosina viagi to philip lord stanier march or march mattered no more i have but cancelled a forgery he thought to himself as he pored over it it was a pity to be obliged to destroy so ingenious a work which at one time gave him the mastership of stanier but raymonds death had given it him more completely and it no longer served his end but was only a danger yet should he destroy it or his mind went back to the night that he and violet had passed together here how supreme had been his wisdom over that for supposing on his fathers death that violet threatened to contest his succession on the information he had given her to induce her for certain to marry him what now would the register show but an excised leaf in whose interest had it been to remove that except violets for with its disappearance there vanished as far as she knew all record of the marriage had she had an opportunity of doing so certainly for had she not spent a night here on the return from their honeymoon should she be so unwise as to send her lawyer here to examine the register on the ground that it had been tampered with she would be faced with a tampering of an unexpected kind the leaf had gone but how lucky that before its suspicious disappearance colin had copied out the entry of the marriage and had it certified as correct by the consul himself he had it safe with its date march that would be a surprise to poor violet when she knew it and the finger of suspicion wavering hitherto would surely point in one very definite direction as for the letter from rosina to salvatore viagi of which she would profess knowledge on colins authority what did she mean and where was the letter uncle salvatore whom colin would see tomorrow would be found to know nothing about it about the destruction of this page colin fingered his own smooth throat as he considered that supposing violet seriously and obstinately threatened to contest the succession and what if when the page was found to be missing it was discovered in some locked and secret receptacle of her own that would be devilish funny colin hoped he thought that it would not come to that he liked violet but she must be good she must be wise the click of an electric switch and the noise of a step outside sent his heart thumping in his throat and next moment he had thrust the page into his despatchbox and turned the key on it the step passed his room and was no longer audible and with infinite precaution he turned the handle and holding the door just ajar he listened it had not gone the whole length of the passage down to the entry to the consular offices and even while he stood there he heard the chink of keys then the step was audible again and the chink accompanied it at that comprehension came to him confirmed next moment by the repeated click of the electric switch and the soft closing of his hosts door my luck holds thought colin and blessed the powers that so wonderfully protected him in another minute he was in bed but even as sleep rose softly about him he woke himself with a laugh thats where ill put the leaf from the register he thought priceless absolutely priceless it was no news to him when at breakfast next morning mr cecil certified the accuracy of his interpretation of the step amazingly careless i was last night he said i went straight to bed after we had looked at those photographs and fell asleep at once nightcap said colin i did exactly the same well my nightcap fell off said mr cecil it fell off with a bang i hadnt been to sleep more than a quarter of an hour when i woke with a start some noise asked colin carelessly no i hadnt heard anything but my conscience awoke me and i remembered i had left my keys in the lock of that private drawer of mine i got out of bed in a fine hurry for not only was that drawer unlockedthat would never do ehbut on the bunch were keys of cupboards and locked cases in the consulate but there the keys were just where i had left them i cant think how i came to forget them when i went to bed colin looked up with an irresistible gaiety of eye and mouth i know he said you were so busy looking after your patient and you gave me a lot of medicine dr cecil wine liqueurs cocktails whiskies and sodas i was as sleepy as an owl when i tumbled into bed how thirsty it makes one in the morning to be sleepy at night mr cecil broke into a chuckle of laughter precisely my experience he said odd now can you amuse yourself today till im free again not so much as if you were with me said colin but i must pay a duty call on my uncle i dont say it will be amusing do you know him salvatore viagi mr cecil had not that happiness and presently colin went in search of the mansion which salvatore had once alluded to as the palazzo viagi leaving nothing to chance that could be covered by design he had telegraphed from rome yesterday to say he would make this visit and wanted a private interview with salvatore the palazzo viagi proved to be a rather shabby flat in an inconspicuous street but salvatore skipped from his chair with open arms to receive him and assumed an expression that was suitable to the late family bereavement and his joy at seeing colin collino mio he cried what a happy morning is this for your poor uncle yet oh what a terrible blow has fallen on us since last i saw you dear friend dear nephew my heart bled for you when i saw the news so young and with such brilliant prospects lamentable indeed enough he squeezed colins hand and turned away for a moment to hide his emotion at the death of one on whom he had never set eyes he wore an enormous black tie in token of his grief but was otherwise as troubadourial as ever but we must put away sad thoughts he continued i am all on tenterhooks to know what brings you to my humble doors not further bad news no not that your beloved father is well i hope your beloved wife also and your revered grandmother yes put me out of my suspense the health of these was not so much an anxiety at this moment to salvatore as the desire to know that all was well with the very pleasant financial assistance which colin provided it was easy in fact to guess the real nature of his suspense and consequently colin found a delicate pleasure in prolonging it a little yes theyre all well he said my father bore the blow wonderfully considering how devoted he was to raymond violet too and my grandmother you can make your affectionate heart at ease about them all thank god thank god said salvatore ii got your telegram i have made arrangements so that our privacy shall be uninterrupted i have in fact sent vittoria and cecilia to visit friends at posilippo such reproaches such entreaties when they heard their cousin colin was expected but i was adamant and how are vittoria and cecilia asked colin the troubadour was almost dancing with impatience they are well i am glad to say they have the constitution of ostriches or whatever is healthiest in the animal kingdom but time presses no doubt with you dear fellow you will be in a hurry duties and pleasure no doubt claim you no no said colin i am quite at leisure for the day i am staying with mr cecil our consul he is officially engaged all day and all the hours are at our disposal so at last i see the home of my mothers family was it here she lived uncle salvatore no in quite another street my wretched penury drove me here even with your bounty dear collino i can scarcely make the two ends meet colin looked very grave indeed i am very sorry to hear that he said ah you have come to me with bad news exclaimed salvatore unable to check himself any more break it to me quickly vittoria at last colin had pity lets come to business uncle salvatore he said theres no bad news at least if there is you will be making it for yourself now do you remember two letters of my mother which you once sent me we had a talk about them and i want you to give me your account of them can you describe them to me salvatore made a tragic gesture and covered his eyes with his hand the ludicrous creature made a farce of all he touched they are graven on my heart he said deep and bitterly are they graven there the first that i received dated on the seventeenth of march told me of the birth of her twins one named raymond and yourself the second dated march the thirtyfirst announced her marriage which had taken place that day with your father and he ground his teeth slightly colin leaned forward to him uncle salvatore you are a marvellous actor he said why did you never go on the stage i can tell you why you have no memory at all salvatore gave him a hunted kind of look was not his very existence and that of vittoria and cecilia dependent on the accuracy of this recollection was colin putting him to some sort of test to see if he would stick to his impression of those letters dear fellow those letters and those dates are engraved as i have previously assured you on my heart alas that it should be so a sudden light dawned on him you have come to tell me that i am wrong he said is it indeed true that my memory is at fault absolutely with regard to the date of one of those letters said colin the date on that which announced my mothers marriage was surely march the first uncle salvatore you are right about the date of the other colin suddenly broke into a shout of laughter his uncles puckered brow and his effort to recollect what he knew and what he had been told were marvellous to behold presently he recovered himself seriously uncle salvatore he said i want you to see if you cannot recollect that the marriage letter was dated march the first it is very important that you should do that it will be disastrous for you if you dont i just want you to recollect clearly that i am right about it the letters will never be produced for i have destroyed them both but surely when you sent me them you thought that it was as i say probably you will never be called upon to swear to your belief but just possibly you may it would be nice if you could recollect that it would remove the stain from the honour of your illustrious house and also parenthetically from my poor shield colin paused a moment with legs crossed in an attitude of lazy ease he lay back in his low chair and scratched one ankle with the heel of his shoe mosquitoes already he said what troublesome things there are in the world mosquitoes you know uncle salvatore or want of money for instance if i were a scheming inventive fellow i should try to arrange to give a pleasant annuity to mosquitoes on the condition of their not biting me if one bit me after that i should withdraw my annuity what nonsense i am talking it is getting into the sun and the warmth and your delightful society that makes me foolish and cheerful let us get back to what i was saying i am sure you thought when you gave me those dear letters that the date of your adored sisters marriage was the first of march in all seriousness i advise you to remember that it was so thats all i believe we understand each other vittorias future you know and all the rest of it and on my fathers death i shall be a very rich man but memory what a priceless possession is that if you only had a good memory uncle salvatore persuade me that you have a good memory reinstate as far as you can the unblemished honour of the viagis yes thats all colin got up and examined the odious objects that hung on the walls there was a picture framed in shells there was a piece of needlework framed in seaweed there was a chromolithograph of something sacred all was shabby and awful a stench of vegetables and the miscellany called frutta di mare stole in through the windows from the barrows outside this splendid palazzo viagi but the record at the consulate said salvatore with italian cautiousness you told me that though the date there appeared to be the same as that which i certainly seem to recollect on the letter colin snapped himself round from an absent inspection of no doubt vittorias needlework but what the deuce has that got to do with you uncle salvatore he said i want your recollection of the dates on the letters which we have been speaking of and of nothing else at all do i not see vittorias handiwork in this beautiful frame of shells how lucky she has a set of clever fingers if her father has a bad memory she will have herself to support and him as well will she not and what do you know of any register at the consulate the noble viagis would not mix themselves up with low folk like poor mr cecil in fact he told me that he had not the honour of your acquaintance do not give it him why should you know mr cecil about that letter now it was certainly my impression began salvatore colin interrupted i dont deal with your impressions he said was not the letter concerning my mothers marriage dated the first of march thats all yes or no salvatore became the complete troubadour again and his malachite studs made him forget his black tie again he skipped from his chair with open arms i swear to it he said the restoration of my adored idol it has been a nightmare to me to think ah it was just that a bad dream were not those letters imprinted on my heart colin evaded his embrace he was like some monstrous goat in broadcloth thats all settled then he said you were only teasing me when you pretended not to remember you will be sure not to forget again wont you forgetfulness is such a natural failing but what dreadful consequences may come of it let the thought of them be your nightmare in the future uncle salvatore therell be pleasant realities instead if you will only remember and a pleasant reality is nicer than a bad dream which comes true ill be going now i think i cannot permit it exclaimed salvatore some wine some biscuits neither thanks said colin i had wine last night though i cant remember the biscuits probably there were some vittoria and cecilia what an anxiety removed with regard to their future and your movements dear collino exclaimed salvatore you go to capri colin thought of the tawdry bibulous evening that probably awaited him and his uncles question put a new idea into his head his innate love of wickedness made it desirable to him to hurt those who were fond of him if their affection could bring him no advantage uncle salvatore at any rate could do nothing more for him and he was not sure that mr cecil could mr cecil had been a wonderful host last night he had fulfilled the utmost requirements of his guest in getting sleepy and drunk and was there any more use for mr cecil drink and photographs and leerings at the attractive maidens of naples was a very stupid sort of indulgence yes tomorrow he said perhaps even by the afternoon boat today but alone said salvatore how gladly would i relieve your solitude i would bring vittoria and cecilia how charming a family party colin felt some flamelike quiver of hatred spread through him his nerves vibrated with it it reached to his toes and fingertips a delightful suggestion he said for you and vittoria and whatever the other ones name is but i dont want any of you thank you i havent seen either of them but i guess what they are like from you youre likeyoure like a mixture of a troubadour and a mountebank and the man who cracks the whip at the horses in a circus uncle salvatore youre no good to me any more but i can be awfully bad for you if you lose your memory again you know exactly what i want you to remember and you do remember it you forgot it because i told you to forget it now it has all come back to you and how nice that is but if you think i am going to bore myself with you and vittoria and the other you make a stupendous error im very kind to you you know im your benefactor to a considerable extent so you mustnt think me unkind when i utterly refuse to saddle myself with your company i butter your bread for you be content with that goodbye love to vittoria so that was done and he strolled back along the seafront towards the consulate capri a little more solid only than a cloud floated on the horizon and with that delightful goal so near it was miserable to picture another tiresome crapulous evening with the little red bounder last night stupid and wearisome though the hours had been they had yielded him the prize he sought for whereas tonight there would be no prize of any sort in view those interminable drinks those stupid photographs why waste time and energy in this secondhand sort of debauchery he had been prepared when he started from england to spend with mr cecil as much time as was necessary in order to achieve what was the main object of his expedition but that was accomplished now he would be so much happier at the villa where he was after all expected today than in seeing mr cecil get excited and familiar and photographic and intoxicated the whispering stonepine the vinewreathed pergola the piazza full of dusk and youth the steps of belated passengers on the pathway outside the garden made sweeter music than the voice of an inebriated consul with its hints and giggles stout middleaged people if there had to be such in the world should keep quiet and read their books and leave the mysteries and joys of youth to the young it was there in that cloud that floated on the horizon that he had first realised himself and the hand that led him in the scenthaunted darkness and the whispering of the night wind that fed his soul with a nourishment that mr cecils cocktails and photographs were starvingly lacking in he would feast there tonight a promise to spend another night at the consulate on his return from capri made good his desertion today for in point of fact mr cecil felt considerably offcolour this morning and rather misdoubted his capacity for carrying off with any semblance of enjoyment a repetition of last night his reproaches and disappointment were clearly complimentary rather than sincere and the afternoon boat carried colin on it once he had made that journey with his father once with violet but could a wish have brought either of them to his side he would no more have breathed it than have thrown himself off the boat he did not want to be jostled and encumbered by love or hear its gibberish and with eager eyes revelling in the sense of being alone with his errand already marvellously accomplished he watched the mainland recede and the island draw nearer through the fading twilight lights were springing up along the marina and presently there was nino alongside in his boat ready to ferry him ashore he with his joyous paganism his serene indifference to good or evil was far closer to what colin hungered for than either his father or violet but closer yet so colin realised was the hatred between himself and his own dead brother and then presently there was the garden dusky and fragrant with the odour of wallflowers and freesias and the whispering of the warm breeze from the sea and the oblong of light from the open door to welcome him on the table just within there lay a telegram for him and with some vivid presentiment of what it contained he opened it his father had died quite suddenly a few hours ago the whisper of the pine grew louder and the breeze suddenly freshening swept in at the door thick with garden scents with greeting with felicitations chapter xi just a fortnight later colin was lying in one of the window seats of the long gallery at stanier reading through some papers which required his signature they had come by the post which nino had just given him for he had brought the boy with him from capri with a view to making him his valet his own he said always looked as if he were listening to a reading of the ten commandments and colin had no use for such a person nino at any rate would bring cheerfulness and some touch of southern gaiety with his shavingwater besides no servant approached the italian in dexterity and willingness and now that the pause of death was over adjustments businesses the taking up of life again had to begin and his lawyer was getting things in shape for his supervision these particular papers were tedious and hard to follow and were expressed in that curious legal shibboleth which makes the unprofessional mind to wander he tried to attend but the effort was like clinging to some slippery edge of ice he could get no firm hold of it and the deep waters kept closing over him there below the terrace lay the lake where he had seen one such incident happen by that he had become heir to all that this fair shining spring day shewed him his fathers death put him in possession and now this morning wherever he turned his eyes whether on lake or woodland or within on picture and carved ceiling all were his this stately home the light and desire of his eye with all that it meant in wealth and position had passed again into the hands of colin stanier handed down from generation to generation ever more prosperous from his namesake who had built its enduring walls and founded its splendours of his fathers death there was but little to tell him when coming straight back again from capri he had arrived here at the set of a stormy day philip had reeled as he crossed the hall one morning and fallen on the hearthrug in front of the holbein for half an hour he had lived quite unconscious and suffering nothing then his breathing had ceased until the moment of his stroke that bursting of some large bloodvessel on the brain he had been quite well and cheerful rejoicing in the fact that colin by now had found the sun again and already longing for his return violet had been colins informant and she told him these things with that air of detachment from him which had characterised her intercourse with him since raymond had come home for that last christmas vacation she had watched then with some secret horror dawning in her eyes colins incessant torture of his brother that dismay and darkness which had spread its shadow on her in the month of their honeymoon when first she really began to know colin interrupted for a time by their return home and the high festivals of the autumn had returned to her then with a fresh infusion of blackness never once had she spoken to him about his treatment of raymond but he was conscious that she watched and shuddered it did not seem that her love for him was extinguished that horror of hers existed side by side with it she yearned for his love even while she shrank from his pitilessness she feared him too not only for the ruthless iron of him but for the very charm which had a power over her more potent yet then came the weeks after raymonds death and colin thought he saw in her a waning of her fear of him that he reflected was natural some time so he read her mind she knew she would be mistress here in her own right it seemed very reasonable that she should gain confidence for the last few days when the wheels of life were now beginning to turn again he saw with a comprehending sense of entertainment that there was something in violets mind she was trying to bring herself up to a certain point and it was not hard to guess what that was she was silent and preoccupied and a dozen times a day she seemed on the verge of speaking of that which he knew was the subject of her thought till today her father and mother and aunt hester in becoming mourning had been with them now they had gone and violets restlessness had become quite ludicrous she had been in and out of the room half a dozen times she had sat down to read the paper and next moment it had dropped from her lap and she was staring at the fire again lost in frowning thought knowing what her communication when it came must be colin from the very nature of the case could not help her out with it but he wished that she would wrestle with and vanquish her hesitation if it had been he who in this present juncture had had to speak to raymond on this identical subject how blithely would he have undertaken it then finally violet seemed to make up her mind to take the plunge and sat down on the edge of the seat where he lounged he extended his arm and put it round her well vi he said are you finding it hard to settle down i am too but weve got to do it my dear aunt hesters little black bonnet did you ever see anything so chic roguish she gets sprightlier every day violet looked at him gravely theres something we have to talk about colin she said and we both know what it is will you let me speak for a minute or two without interrupting me he put his finger on the line to which he had come in this tiresome document which his solicitor assured him required his immediate attention an hour or two darling the longer the better he said what is it are you sure i know something nice i hope ah is it about my birthday perhaps the last affair that dear father was busy over were plans for my birthday of course i have counterordered everything and we must keep it next year well what is it i wont interrupt any more colin leaned back with his hand still under violets arm as if to draw her with him she bent with him a little way and then disengaged herself i hate what lies before me she said and i ask you to believe that i have struggled with myself i have tried colin to give the whole thing up to let it be yours but i cant i long to be lady yardley in my own right as you told me i should be on uncle philips death all that it means i fancy you understand that but i think i might have given that up if it was only myself of whom i had to think i dont know i cant be sure she paused not looking at him she did not want to know till all was done how he was taking it of course he anticipated it he knew it must be and here was the plain point of it but i havent got only myself to think about she said before many months i shall bear you a child i shall bear you other children after that perhaps i am thinking of them and of you since we married i have learned things about you you are hard in a way that i did not know was possible you have neither love nor compassion i must defend my children against you the only way i can do it is to be supreme myself i must hold the reins not you i will be good to you and shall never cease loving you i think but i cant put myself in your hands which i should do if i did not now use the knowledge which you yourself conveyed to me you did that with your eyes open you asked for and accepted what your position here will be and you did it chiefly out of hatred to raymond that was your motive and it tells on my decision you hate more than you love and i am frightened for my children it is true that when i accepted raymond i did it because i should get stanierbe mistress here anyhow but i thinki was waveringthat i should have thrown him over before i married him and have accepted you though i knew that marriage with you forfeited the other then you told me it was otherwise that in forfeiting stanier i found it even more completely colinhe had promised not to interruptgave no sign of any sort his finger still marked the place in this legal document i have sent for my fathers solicitor she said and they have told me he is here but before i see him i wanted to tell you that i shall instruct him to contest your succession i shall tell him about the register in the consulate at naples and about your mothers letters to your uncle you said you would let me have them on your fathers death would you mind giving me them now therefore he may wish to see them colin moved ever so slightly and she for the first time looked at him there he lay with those wide childlike eyes and the mouth that sometimes seemed to her to have kissed her very soul away he had a smile for her grave glance just so had he smiled when torturingly he tried to remember exactly what had happened in the old park on the day that raymond shot pigeons but even while she thought of his relentless pursuing glee the charm of him the sweet supple youth of him all fire and softness smote on her heart wont you go away till it is all over she said it will be horrible for you colin and i dont want you to suffer the letters are all i want of you i will tell mr markham about the register and he will do whatever is necessary go back to your beloved island you were robbed of your stay there wait there until all this business which will be horrible for you is done you can see your dear mr cecil again she added trying to smile back at him yes i might do that said colin thoughtfully in fact i probably shall but i must try to take in what you have been saying i cant understand it you must explain you referred for instance to my mothers letters what letters i dont know of any letters of my mother as being in existence still less have i got any how could i have she died when i was but a few weeks old do mothers write letters to the babies at their breasts the two letters to your uncle said she colin planted a levering elbow by his side and sat up i suppose it is i who am mad he said because you talk quite quietly and coherently and yet i dont understand a single word of what you say letters from my mother to my uncle ah he took her hand again amending his plan in accordance with his talk with salvatore youre right he said uncle salvatore did once give me two letters from my mother to him little faint things i destroyed them not so long ago one should never keep letters but youre right vi uncle salvatore did give me a couple of letters once but when on earth did i mention them to you what a memory you have got its quite true one announced my mothers marriage the other spoke of the birth of poor raymond and me but what of them and whatoh i must be madwhat in heavens name do you mean when you talk if i understand you correctly about sending somebody out to naples the register in the consulate there and my succession are they connected isnt it usual for a son to succeed his father im all at seaor am i asleep and dreaming pinch me darling i want to wake up what register some nightmare sense of slipping slipping slipping took hold of violet the erasure in the register she said all that you told me colin swung his legs off the windowseat and got up there was an electric bell close at hand and he rang it theres some plot he said and i have no idea what it is i want a witness with regard to anything further that you wish to say to me whats his name your fathers solicitor i mean oh yes markham dont speak another word to me he turned his back on her and waited till a servant came in her ladyship wishes to see mr markham he said ask mr markham to come here at once colin she began it was just such a face that he turned on her now as he had given to her one evening at capri not a word he said hold your tongue violet youll speak presently mr markham appeared precise and florid colin shook hands with him my wife has a statement to make to you he said i dont know what it is she has not yet made it but it concerns me and the succession to my fathers title and estates it had therefore better be made to you in my presence please tell mr markham what you were about to tell me violet in dead silence briefly and clearly violet repeated what colin had told her on the night that they were engaged all the time he looked at her mr markham would have said with tenderness and anxiety and when she had finished he spoke i hope you will go into this matter without any delay mr markham he said my wife as i have already told her is perfectly right in saying that my uncleyou will need his addressgave me two letters from my mother to him she is right also about the subject of those letters but she is under a complete delusion about the dates of them i destroyed them not so long ago i am afraid so the only person who can possibly settle this is my uncle to whom i hope you will apply without delay no doubt he will have some recollection of them indeed he cherished them for years and if the dates were as my wife says that i told her they were he must have known that my brother and i were illegitimate so much for the letters colin found violets eyes fixed on him her face deadly pale wore the stillness of stone with regard to my wifes allegation about the register he said i deny that i ever told her any such story i have this to add when my father and i were in naples last summer i made at his request a copy of the record of his marriage from the consular register he thought i fancy that in the event of his death a certified copy of it here in england might be convenient for the purpose of proving the marriage i made that copy myself and mr cecil our consul in naples certified it to be correct i gave it my lawyer a few days ago when he was down here and it is of course open to your inspection colin paused and let his eyes rest wistfully on violet my wife of course mr markham he said is under a delusion but she has made the allegation and in justice to me i think you will agree that it must be investigated she supposesdont you darlingthat there is an erasure in the register at the consulate showing that it has been tampered with and that erasure points to an attempt on some ones part presumably my fathers or my own to legitimatise his children in answer to that i am content for the present to say that when i made the copy i saw no such erasure nor did mr cecil who certified the correctness of it mr cecil to whom i will give you an introduction no doubt will remember the incident i am glad i have got that copy for if the register proves to have been tampered with it may be valuable my belief is that no such erasure exists may i suggest mr markham that you or some trustworthy person should start for naples at once you will take the affidavitsis it notof my uncle with regard to the letters and of mr cecil with regard to the genuineness of the copy of my fathers marriage you will also inspect the register the matter is of the utmost and immediate importance he turned to violet vi darling he said let us agree not to speak of this again until mr markham has obtained full information about it all now perhaps you would like to consult him in private i will leave you mr markham shared colins view as to the urgency and importance of setting this matter at rest and left for naples that evening with due introductions to salvatore and the consul colin had a word with him before he left and with tenderness and infinite delicacy spoke of violets condition women had these strange delusions he believed at such times and the best way of settling them was to prove that they had no foundation mr markham he was afraid would find that he had made a fruitless journey as far as the ostensible reason for it went but he had seen for himself how strongly the delusion had taken hold on his wife and in that regard he hoped for the best results in any case the thing must be settled never had the sparkle and sunlight of colins nature been so gay as during these two days when they waited for the news that mr markham would send from naples it had been agreed that the issues of his errand should not be spoken of until they declared themselves and here to all appearance was a young couple adorably adorned with all the gifts of nature and inheritance with the expectation of the splendour of half a centurys unclouded days spread in front of them they had lately passed through the dark valley of intimate bereavement but swiftly they were emerging into the unshadowed light where in a few months now the glory of motherhood the pride of fatherhood awaited them in two days from now as both knew a disclosure would reach them which must be one way or the other of tremendous import but for the present pending that revelation presage and conjecture memory even of that interview with mr markham which had sent him across the breadth of europe were banished they were as children in the last hour of holidays as lovers between whom must soon a sword be unsheathed they wandered in the woods where in the hot early spring the daffodils were punctual and coming before the swallow dares took the winds of march with beauty and colin picked her the pale cuckoopint which intoxicated with nonsense he told her comes before the cuckoo dares they spoke of the friendship of their childhood which had so swiftly blossomed into love and of the blossom of their love that was budding now all day the enchantment of their home and their companionship waved its wand over them and at night tired with play they slept the light sleep of lovers certainly for one or other of them there must soon come a savage awakening or more justly the stranglehold of nightmare but there were a few hours yet before the dreams of springtime and youth were murdered the third day after mr markhams departure for naples was colins birthday when he would come of age and violet waking early that morning while it was still dark found herself prey to some crushing load and presage of disaster most unpropitious most unbirthdaylike for the last two days these days of waiting for news they had made for themselves a little artificial oasis of sunshine and laughter now some secret instinct told her that she could linger there no more today she felt sure would come some decisive disclosure and she dreaded it with a horror too deep for the plummet of imagination in that dark hour before dawn when the vital forces are at their lowest she lay hopeless and helpless colin had denied all knowledge of what he had himself told her he had been eager for mr markham to disprove it he knew something which she did not what that could be she could form no idea at all at the worst salvatore would confirm his account of those letters and no such erasure as colin had spoken of would be found in the register had he then invented this merely to ensure her marrying him and now that raymonds death had given him mastership at stanier was he simply denying what never existed at all from what she knew of him now he was capable of having done that in order to make her throw over raymond but it was not that which she dreaded there was something more a black curtain seemed to hang before her and presently some hot blast would blow it high in the air and she would see what lay behind it it was rapidly growing light and outside the birds were busy with their early chirrupings by the window which last night colin had opened pulling back the curtains the silver of her paul lamerie toiletset glimmered with the increasing brightness colin lay close to her with face turned towards her fast asleep his cheek was on his hand the other arm languid and slack was stretched outside the bedclothes his mouth was a little parted and it seemed to be smiling and then he stirred and leaning his head a little back his smile broadened and he laughed in his sleep with open mouth at that some nameless panic seized her and stopping her ears she buried her face in the clothes a child might laugh so but was the merriment of his dream that of a child or had some sense that did not sleep reminded him that his twentyfirst birthday was now dawning she feigned to be asleep when ninos tap came to the door of his dressingroom and she heard colin get up he spoke to her quietly but she did not answer or open her eyes then his room door opened and closed and she was alone colin was already at breakfast when she came down and apparently his mood of the last two days had suffered no ungenial change good morning darling he said i tried to say that to you before but you were busy sleeping what shall i give you theres some nasty fish and some tepid bacon he looked at her with some sort of wistful expectancy as if wondering if she would remember something and the thoughts the wild imaginings which had made the dawn a plunge into some dark menace dropped from her mind like drugged creatures colin dear your birthday what can i give you she said kissing him it was the first thing i thought of when i woke were the same age again i was a year ahead of you till this morning delicious of you to remember it vi said he yes were fortytwo years old between us a great age hullo nino pella signora said nino and gave violet a telegram colin watched her fingers fumbling at the gummed flap of the envelope as if numb and nerveless then with a jerk she tore it across and opened it only once before had he seen a living face as white as that when fingers were slipping from the ice read it for me she said at length i dont seem to see what it means colin took it it had been sent from naples late last night and came from mr markham he read salvatore viagis account of letters agrees with your husbands page containing marriages of year and month in question has been cut out of register at consulate colin passed the sheet back to violet she did not take it from his hand and he let it drop on to the tablecloth he leaned a little towards her vi youre magnificent he said that was a glorious stroke of yours that night when you and i stayed at the consulate no darling dont interrupt let me speak for two or three minutes just as you did a few mornings ago eat your bacon and listen i see now the reason of your pretended reluctance to stay with mr cecil it put me off the scent completely at the time what scent she asked what do you mean i asked you not to interrupt there we were on our honeymoon and so casually so unthinkingly i told mr cecil that we would stay with him on our way home you objected but eventually you agreed your reluctance to stay with him as i say put me quite off the scent having done that you yielded little did i dream then of your superb project she gazed at him like some bird hypnotised by the snake that coil after coil draws nearer colin too drew nearer he pushed his chair sideways and leaned towards her elbows on the table i remember that night so well he said i was sleeping in the dressingroom next door to you and the door was wide for it was hot i heard you get out of bed i heard your latch creak oh yes you called to me first and i did not answer i called to you this morning you remember and you did not answer sometimes one pretends to be asleep till this minute i knew nothing for certain more of what you did now i know you were playing for a great stake i applaud you you got hold of mr cecils keys he is careless about them and tore that leaf out of the register you knew that on my fathers death his marriage to my mother must be proved before raymond or i poor raymond could succeed for of course it was common property that he lived with her before they were married giuseppe his boatman uncle salvatore halfadozen people could have told you that and then oh a crowning piece of genius you make up a cockandbull story about erasure and letters which force us to have the register examined and lo there is no record of the marriage at all what is the presumption that raymond and i were well an ugly word but just there fate was unkind to you through no fault of yours except that failure is a fault and the most fatal one you did not know that i had made a copy of the entry and got it signed and certified by our charming mr cecil before the curious disappearance of that page and then you made just one terrible mistake how could you have done it she turned to him a face of marble faultlessly chiselled but wholly lifeless what mistake did i make she said you kept that leaf said colin pityingly a record of your triumph i suppose like a cotillontoy to dream over when you were mistress here go on said she colin came closer yet darling will you be awfully nice to me he said and give me that leaf as a birthday present it would be a delightful souvenir you know where it is she paused she remembered the tradition of the icy selfrepression of the lady yardleys who had preceded her the frost that fell on them from personal knowledge there was her grandmother that arctic night was darkening on her now and she shivered i dont know where it is she said make up another lie he rose you must learn politeness violet he said you must learn many useful things i am being very kind to you you dont appreciate that night had not quite fallen yet just as you were kind to raymond she said he smiled at her yes the same sort of kindness he said he spoke to her as to a troublesome child with soft persuasion now you know where it is quite well but you want to give me the trouble of reminding you you wont say youre sorry or anything of that sort not wise spring the trap on me she said very well you put it in the secret drawer in the stand of your lovely lamerie lookingglass the evening we came back from our honeymoon you had left me talking to father but as soon as you had gone i followed you it was pure chance i suspected nothing then but i looked in from my dressingroom and saw you with the secret drawer open putting something into it i went downstairs again but i am bound to say that my curiosity was aroused perhaps you might have been having a billetdoux from nino so i took a suitable opportunityi think it was when you were at churchand satisfied myself about it colin reviewed this speech which seemed to come to him impromptu except for the one fact that underlay it which in a few minutes now would be made manifest to violet so poor nino was not my rival he said that was such a relief vi darling for i should have had to send him away but i never really gave a serious thought to that for i believed you liked your poor colin but what i found did surprise me i could not believe that any one so clever could have been so stupid as to keep the evidence of her cleverness when you have been clever it is wise to destroy the evidence of your cleverness shall we come but my lookingglass a secret drawer said violet theres no secret drawer that i know of no no of course not said colin i shall be obliged to show it you but wait a minute i had better have a witness of what i find in the secret drawer of which you are ignorant my solicitor is here but with this other disclosure he might urge me to proceed against you for conspiracy which i dont at present intend to do your maid now no you would not like her to know such things about you she might blackmail you how about nino he will do no more than understand that a paper has been found and that he witnesses to the finding of it one has to protect oneself i had to protect myself against raymond may i ring for nino at that the arctic night fell on violet and presently the three of them were in her bedroom round the base of the lookingglass ran a repouss cable band and colin was explaining to her how if she pressed the stud at the corner of it just where the silversmiths namel a for lameriewas punched in the metal the side of the base would fly open and so it was she pressed it herself while he stood aside and within was the drawer and the folded paper colin took a swift step and plucked the paper out holding it at arms length there darling all your responsibility is over he said i will keep it for you now i will just open it and show you what it is but do not come too close or try to snatch it there names of happy couples one below the other and in the space next the name the date of their marriage halfway down the page you see the names we are looking for rosina viagi and philip lord stanier and the date march the first he turned to nino and spoke in italian and you nino he said you saw me take this paper out of the drawer of the signoras lookingglass and now you see megive me a big envelope from the tableyou see me put it in this envelope and close itit is as if i did a conjuring trickand i sit down and write on the envelope for the signora to read i say that in your presence and in mine the enclosed was taken from the secret drawer in the lookingglass where it had been placed for safe custody by violet stanier countess of yardley and given into the care of her husband colin stanier earl of yardley sign it nino and observe that i sign i date it also thats all nino you may go colin laid his hand on violets neck it has been trying for you dear he said rest a little but your mind may be at ease now the anxiety of having that in your possession is removed and it will be in safe keeping i will give it at once to my lawyer with instructions that it is to be delivered to no one except to me in person and that at my death it is to be destroyed unopened it entirely depends on yourself as to whether it ever sees the light again and then when you are rested shall we go for one of our delicious rambles in the park whats that line of wordsworth this one day well give to idleness thank you darling for your lovely birthday present never on walpurgis night nor at black mass had there ever been so fervent an adorer to his god as colin so satanic a rite as that which he had performed on this birthday morning no need was there for him to make any vow of lipservice or by any acceptation of the parchment that was set in the frame of the holbein to confirm his allegiance the spirit was more than the letter and in no wanton ecstasy of evil could he have made a more sacramental dedication of himself it was not enough for him to have forged ever so cunningly the evidence which while raymond lived proved his illegitimacy nor more cunningly yet to have got rid of that evidence when raymonds death cleared for him the steps to the throne he must in the very flower and felicity of wickedness preserve that evidence in order to produce it as the handiwork of his wife the edifice would have been incomplete otherwise it would have lacked that soaring spire of infamy but now all was done and on his birthday came the consecration of the abominable temple of himself to the spirit he adored he came to her room that night and sat as he so often did on the edge of her bed you have been perfect to me today darling he said you have given me the happiest birthday you have been so quiet and serene and controlled and have you been happy yes colin said she he pulled off his tie and flapped her fingers with the end of it i think i shall go south again he said i was defrauded of my stay in capri owing to my fathers death what about you had you not better stay quietly at home get your father and mother to come down just as you please said she let us settle it like that then and look at me a minute violet she raised her eyes to his ah thats right he said youve had a lesson today darling it has tired you and i will leave you to sleep in one moment we cant have you tired you must take great care of yourself eat well sleep well be out a great deal about that lesson take it to heart vi never again try to cross my path its much too dangerous and youve no delusions left about letters and registers have you answer me dear no said she thats good now ill leave you the march night was warm and moonlit and colin stood by the open window letting the breeze stream in against his skin and looked out over terrace and lake and woodland all that he had so passionately desired since first he toddled about this stately home of his race was his and nothing now could upset his rights and how wonderful the process of arriving at it had been every step of that way was memorable fraud intrigue trickery matchless cruelty had paved the road and today the road was finished he put out his light and curled himself up in bed violets firstborn must surely be a son who should learn early and well from lips that knew what they were saying the sober truth of that which in the legend wore the habiliment of medival superstition he should learn how poor uncle raymond had allowed himself to loveyes there was a time when he had loved mother andwas not that tiresome for himmother happened to prefer father well poor uncle raymond had loved and that perhaps was his undoing for he had fallen into the lake under the ice and the icy water had smothered him and the fishes had nibbled him colin chuckled to himself at the thought of recounting that for a moment as he looked out on to the night he had experienced a dulness and dimness of spirit as of a cloud passing over the bright circle of the moon at the thought that he had accomplished all that had so thrillingly occupied him but at the thought of his fatherhood the brightness shone forth again how fascinating it would be to till and to sow in that soft soil to rear the seedlings that he would water and tend so carefully to watch them putting forth the buds of poisonous flowers that swelled and prospered till they burst the sheaths of childhood and opened widepetalled to night and day his thoughts drowsy and content turned towards violet certainly there had been noticeable in her all day a freezing a congealment she was becoming like those impassive portraits of her predecessors marble women out of whose eyes looked some halfhidden horror a flash of lightning very remote blinked in through the uncurtained oblong of the window opposite his bed and a mutter of thunder as drowsy as himself answered it he slid his hand underneath his cheek and fell asleep the end

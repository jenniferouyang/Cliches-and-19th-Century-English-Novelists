h doran company printed in the united states of america david blaize table of contents chapter i chapter ii chapter iii chapter iv chapter v chapter vi chapter vii chapter viii chapter ix chapter x chapter xi chapter xii chapter xiii chapter xiv chapter xv chapter xvi david blaize chapter i there was a new classroom in course of construction for the first form at helmsworth preparatory school and the ten senior boys whose united ages amounted to some hundred and thirty years were taken for the time being in the school museum this was a big boarded room covered with corrugated iron and built out somewhat separate from the other class rooms at the corner of the cricketfield the arrangement had many advantages from the point of view of the boys for the room was full of agreeably distracting and interesting objects and cicero almost ceased to be tedious even when he wrote about friendship if when you were construing you could meditate on the skeleton of a kangaroo which stood immediately in front of you and refresh yourself with the sight of the stuffed seal on whose nose the shortsighted ferrers major had balanced his spectacles before mr dutton came in or again it was agreeable to speculate on the number of buns a mammoth might be able to put simultaneously into his mouth seeing that a huge yellowish object that stood on the top of one of the cases was just one of his teeth of course it depended on how many teeth a mammoth had but the number of a boys teeth might be some guide and david in the throes of grinding out the weekly letter to his father passed his tongue round his own teeth trying to count them by the sensory quality of it but losing count he put an inky forefinger into his mouth instead there seemed to be fourteen in his lower jaw and thirteen and a half in the upper for half of a front tooth had been missing ever since a few weeks ago he had fallen out of a tree on to his face and the most industrious scrutiny of that fatal spot had never resulted in his finding it in any case then he had twentyseven and a half teeth and it was reasonable to suppose that a mammoth therefore unless he had fallen out of a tree if there were such in the glacial age had at least twentyeight that huge yellow lump of a thing then as big as davids whole head was only one twentyeighth of his chewing apparatus why an entire bun could stick to it and be unobserved a mammoth could have twentyeight buns in his mouth and really remain unaware of the fact fancy having a bun on every tooth and not knowing how much ought a mammoths pocketmoney to be if you had to provide on this scale and when would its mouth be really full and how david was growing a little sleepy blaize said mr duttons voice david sucked his finger yes sir he said have you finished your letter home no sir said david with engaging candour then i would suggest that you ceased trying to clean your finger and get on with it rather sir said david the boys desks transferred from their old classroom stood in a threesided square in the centre of the museum while mr duttons table with his desk on it was in the window the door of the museum was open so too was the window by the masters seat for the hour was between four and five of the afternoon and the afternoon that of a sweltering july sunday mr dutton himself was a tall and ineffective young man entirely undistinguished for either physical or mental powers who had taken a somewhat moderate degree at cambridge and had played lacrosse by virtue of the mediocrity of his attainments his scholastic career had not risen to the heights of a public school and he had been obliged to be content with a mastership at this preparatory establishment he bullied in a rather feeble manner the boys under his charge and drew in his horns if they showed signs of not being afraid of him but in these cases he took it out of them by sending in the gloomiest reports of their conduct and progress at the end of term to the fierce and tremendous clergyman who was the head of the place the head inspired universal terror both among his assistant masters and his pupils but he inspired also a wholehearted admiration he did not take more than half a dozen classes during the week but he was liable to descend on any form without a moments notice like a bolt from the blue he used the cane with remarkable energy and preached lamblike sermons in the school chapel on sunday the boys who were experienced augurs on such subjects knew all about this and dreaded a notably lamblike sermon as presaging trouble on monday in fact mr acland had his notions about discipline and completely lived up to them in his conduct having told blaize to get on with his homeletter mr dutton resumed his employment which was not what it seemed on his desk it is true was a large prayerbook for he had been hearing the boys their catechism in the matter of which blaize had proved himself wonderfully ignorant and had been condemned to write out his duty towards his neighbour who had very agreeably attempted to prompt him three times and show it up before morning school on monday there was a bible there also out of which when the sunday letters home were finished mr dutton would read a chapter about the second missionary journey of st paul and then ask questions but while these letters were being written mr dutton was not sabbatically employed for nestling between his books was a yellowbacked volume of stories by guy de maupassant mr dutton found him most entertaining he skated on such very thin ice and never quite went through mr dutton turned the page yes how clever not to go through for there was certainly mud underneath he gave a faint chuckle of interest and dexterously turned the chuckle into a cough at that sound a small sigh of relief a sense of relaxation went round the class for it was clear that old dutton dubs was his more general nomenclature was deep in his yellow book when that consummation so devoutly wished was arrived at any diversion of a moderately quiet nature might be indulged in crabtree began he was a boy of goatlike face and had been known as nanny till the somewhat voluminous appearance of his new pair of trousers had caused him to be rechristened bags he had finished his letter to his mother with remarkable speed and had by writing small conveyed quite sufficient information to her on a halfsheet there was thus the other halfsheet noiselessly torn off to be framed into munitions of aerial warfare he folded it neatly into the form of a dart he inked the point of it by dipping it into the china receptacle at the top of his desk and launched it with unerring aim enfilading the crossbench where david sat it hit him just exactly where the other half of his missing tooth should have been for his lip was drawn back and his tongue slightly protruded in the agonies of composing a suitable letter to his father the soft wet point struck it full and spattered ink over his lip oh damn said david very softly then he paused stricken to stone and quite ready to deny that he had spoken at all his eyes apprehensively sought mr dutton and he saw that he had not heard being deep in the misfortunes that happened to mademoiselle fifi ill lick you afterwards bags he said gently better lick yourself now whispered bags a faint giggle at bagss repartee went round the class like the sound of a breaking ripple this penetrated into mr duttons consciousness and shifting his attitude a little without looking up he leaned his forehead on his open hand so that he could observe the boys through the chinks of his fingers david of course was far too old a hand to be caught by this paltry subterfuge for playing chinks was a manuvre of the enemy which had got quite stale through repetition and he therefore gently laid down on the sloping top of his locker the dart which he had just dipped again in his inkpot to throw back at bags and with an industrious air turned to his letter again the twenty minutes allotted on sunday afternoon school for writing home to parents was already more than half spent but the date which he had copied off his neighbour and my dear papa was as far as the first fine careless rapture of composition had carried him it was really difficult to know what to say to his dear papa for all the events of the past week were completely thrown into shadow by the one sunlit fact that he had got his schoolcolours for cricket and had made twentyfour runs in the last match but as he knew perfectly well his father cared as little for cricket as he did for football indeed david ironically doubted if he knew the difference between them and that deplorable fact restricted the zone of interests common to them and really the only other event of true importance was that his aunt had sent him a postal order for five shillings it would not be politic to tell his father about that in case of inquiries being made as to what he had done with it when he got home in a fortnights time for the summer holidays he would have eaten it all long before then for it was strawberrytime david bit heavily into his wooden penholder in his efforts to think of something innocuous to say and found his mouth full of fragments of chewed wood these he proceeded to masticate rather ostentatiously while he still sucked his inky lip the joy of this being that old dubs was still playing chinks and would certainly as a surprise ask him before long what he was eating this was stimulating to the mind and he plunged into his letter we are being taken in the museum because they are building a new firstform classroom there was dryrot too in the wainscotting of the old one we have been doing cicero this week as well as virgil and xenophon in greek and medea and holland in geography and james i have got to division of decimals which is very interesting and squareroot which is most difficult because some have it and others dont david gave one fleeting blueeyed glance at mr dutton and saw that the blessed moment was approaching the chink had widened and there was no doubt whatever that it was he who was being observed then he bent his yellow head over his letter again and chewed the fragments of penholder with renewed vigour it was very hot all this week and i and two other chaps were taken to bathe at the richmond bathingplace day before yesterday by blaize what are you eating said mr dutton suddenly david looked up in bland and innocent surprise eating sir he asked my penholder sir a slight titter went round the class for david had the enviable reputation of drawing his pastors and masters always excepting head by the geniality and unexpectedness of his replies but on this occasion the blandness was a little overdone and instead of taking a back seat mr dutton put down his yellow novel on his desk back upwards and came across the room to where david was sitting the dart with its wet inky point lay there and it was too late to draw his blottingpaper over it but a more dramatic dnouement than the mere discovery of an inky dart which might be assessed at fifty linesor perhaps a hundred since it was sundayhung in the air open your mouth said mr dutton not yet seeing the dart david had a good large useful mouth and he opened it very suddenly to its extremest extent putting out his tongue a little which might or might not have been an accident that unruly member was undoubtedly covered with splinters of common penholder and nothing else at all sirmayishutitagain said david all in one breath opening it the moment he had spoken to its widest mr duttons eye fell on the inky dart what is that he said david gave a prodigious gulp and swallowed as much woodfibre as was convenient that sir he said politely a paper dart sir inked did you make it asked dubs davids face assumed an expression of horror sir no sir he said in a tone of wounded and innocent indignation suddenly david became conscious that his impeccable scene with mr dutton was arousing no interest or amusement among the audience and his artistic feelings were hurt for he hated playing to apathetic benches he looked earnestly and soulfully at mr dutton but missed appreciative giggles nobody appeared to be taking the smallest interest in the dialogue and all round were bent heads and pens industriously scratching then he saw what the rest of the class had already seen standing just outside the open window his foot noiseless on the grass was the head austere and enormous and fierce and frowning he had picked up from mr duttons desk the yellowbacked novel that lay there and was looking at it with a portentous face then who made it ifi say ifyou did not said mr dutton still unconscious of the presence of his superior i suppose another fellow said david in very different tones from those in which his moral indignation had found dramatic utterance mr dutton took up the dart and inked his shirtcuff but david did not smile who made he began and turned and saw oh jam said david under his breath the head left the window with the yellow book in his hand took two steps to the door and entered the classroom he was a tall grizzlebearded man lean and wiry with cold grey eyes to the boys he appeared of gigantic height and was tragedy and fate personified terror encompassed him he scintillated with it as radium scintillates and is unconsumed but he scintillated also with splendour he was probably omniscient and of his omnipotence there was no doubt whatever he had rowed for oxford against cambridge and the boys wondered that cambridge had dared to put a boat on the river at all that year he had also got a doublefirst which in itself was less impressive and he was believed to be fabulously wealthy how any woman had ever ventured to marry him no one knew but after all if he had expressed a wish that way it was equally inconceivable that it should not be gratified though there was not a boy in the school who did not dread his displeasure above everything else in the world there was none who would not have taken an infinity of trouble to be sure of winning his approbation one of his legs was slightly shorter than the other which gave him a swaying or rocking motion when he walked which david could imitate admirably but he would nearly have died of astonishment if he had known that more than once the head had seen him do it and had laughed in his beard with twinkling eyes there was no twinkle or laughter there today still with the yellow volume in his hand he came and stood before the skeleton of the kangaroo and a silence fell that will perhaps be equalled for breathlessness on the day that the judgment books are opened but probably not before then he spoke silence he said there was not any more silence possible so he had to be content with that he addressed his lieutenant who stood abjectly twirling a small moustache and trying to look tall but what was the use of trying to look tall beside that matterhorn or to twirl an adolescent moustache when the heads hand clawed his beard it was simply silly mr dutton said the head when the silence had begun to sing in the ears of the listeners by some strange mischancei repeat by some strange mischancei have found this disgusting and licentious book on your desk how it got there how it happened to be opened atat page i do not wish to inquire it is more than enough for me to have found it there i am willing to believe and to tell you so publicly mr dutton before the boys whom you are superintending on this sunday afternoon i am willing to believe that some obscene bird passed over the museum and dropped from its claws this stinkingyes sir stinkingcarrion dropped it sir while your back was turned on the very table where i see the book of books and also the book of common prayer with your leave with your leave mr dutton i will do thus and thus to this unholy carrion then ensued a slight anticlimax for the head though a very strong man in hand and arm found it impossible to do as he had designed and tear three hundred pages across and across but the form generally and mr dutton in particular were too stiff with horror to notice it so instead the head tore off section after section of the lightly sewn leaves instead of tearing the pages laid the dismembered carrion on the floor and stamped on it and then with an indescribable ejaculation of disgust threw the mutilated remains into the fireplace you are excused mr dutton he said from the rest of this lesson which i will take myself but you will do me the honour to call on me immediately after evensong this afternoon his fierce eye wandered from mr duttons stricken face to davids desk where lay the inky dart you are engaged now i see in some inquiry he said a paper dart i perceive on blaizes desk i will conduct the inquiry myself and wish you a good afternoon he waited in tense silence till mr dutton had taken his hat and left the room then he turned to david blaize did you make that dart or did you throw it he asked an expression of despairing determination had come into davids face he was conscious also of a large inkstain on his lips neither sir he said then who made it said the head and also for i perceive the point is blunted who threw it dead silence on davids part do you know asked the head yes sir said david and do you refuse to tell me i am not here to be bullied i may remind you david felt slightly sick but he had swallowed a good deal of chewed penhandle do you refuse to tell me repeated the head yes sir said david then came one of those strange calms in the middle of cyclones which sometimes puzzled the boys but their conjecture a perfectly right one was that the head in spite of questions like these did not like sneaking anyhow for a moment his fierceness faded and he nodded at david just as one pal might nod to another in sympathetic assent quite right my boy he said then he turned to the rest of the class holding up the bedraggled weapon name he said the miserable bags stood up without speech oh you crabtree said the awful voice and so master crabtree thinks that the calm and quiet of sunday afternoon is made to give him leisure to forge these filthy weapons that the paper you are given to write home on is designed to be desecrated to these foul usages and the ink to supply filth to them you will write out with the ink you have so strangely misused two hundred lines of virgil in copperplate hand and eat your dinner at the pigtable apart from your companions for the next week the pigtable it may be mentioned was a separate table in the diningroom without chairs where boys detected in swinish habits had to take their meals standing for the period of their sentence but poor bagss cup was not full yet for the heads eagle eye fell on davids inky mouth i infer that the ink on blaizes lips was made by this weapon he said that is so then you will now beg blaizes pardon and as soon as the catechism and bibleclass is over you will fetch a basin of water and bathe blaizes mouth with your own sponge until it is pronounced clean by your matron the hour for writing home is up sign your names and direct your envelopes catechism now the catechismclass had already been held and the marks for it had been put down in the mottledcovered book which lay on mr duttons desk but to suggest or hint this was not less inconceivable than to propose playing leapfrog the more imaginative saw that there might be fresh trouble when catechism marks were put down and it was found that mr dutton had already entered them in his neat small handwriting but the idea of venturing to correct the head when he was in this brimstonemood was merely unthinkable david indeed the boldest of them all and at the moment with something of the halo of martyrdom about him wondered what would happen if he did so but quailed before the possible result so catechism began again and for a little all went smoothly the head of course knew that among small boys at school christian names are held to be effeminate and disgraceful things and so omitting the first question asked stone the headboy who had given him his name and stone knew ferrers also knew what his godfathers and godmothers then did for him and david expressed himself accurately as bound to believe and to do what they had promised for him the commandments went smoothly but trouble began when the boys had to explain what they chiefly learned from those commandments any meaning that they might have possessed any effort to attach rational ideas to them was overshadowed by the fact that primarily this was a lesson that should have been acquired by heart in order to recite it faultlessly to that aweinspiring presence that frowned at mr duttons desk his duty towards his neighbour had already baffled david that afternoon but for the moment having recited the eighth commandment his turn was passed and troubles never coming singly bags was faced with this abstruse question the first sentences went rightly enough but then he began to falter to honour and obey the king and all that are put in authority under her her asked the head bagss prayerbook a comparatively ancient one given him at his christening by a godmother was a queens prayerbook queen and all that are put in authority under her he quavered getting confused next said the head king and all that are put in authority under him said sharpe major in a shrill treble to submit myself to all my governors teachers spiritual pastors and masters to order myself lowly and reverently to all my betters toto honour and obey the king next said the head with ominous calm the dreary tale of failure went on with that portentous figure sitting in the chair of the innocuous mr dutton consecutive thought became impossible and memory took wings and fled boys who had got full marks earlier in the afternoon found themselves unable when facing this grim mood of the heads to repeat their duty towards anything the ground already covered was taken again in order to give them a fresh start and now the creed itself presented pitfalls and stumblingblocks already the normal hour for the class had been exceeded and from other and happier classrooms the boys poured out into the field in front of the windows or lay on rugs under the shade of the big still elms and with linked arms and treble intercourse wandered across the sunny grass and even when the catechism was done there was the biblelesson to follow and before the biblelesson there was certain to be the discovery that the catechism had already been put down all this was that ass dubss fault for leaving his rotten french novel on his desk worse than anything the biblelesson when it came was that most inexplicable second voyage of st paul thyatira or was it laodicea or were they the seven churches of asia and what exactly did underpinning the ship mean or was that manuvre executed on the other voyage mr dutton always consulted the new testament maclear over this elusive cruise whereas the boys had to shut up that useful volume when they were questioned it seemed scarcely fair and even the biblelesson had not been arrived at yet they were still sticking and bogged in the quagmires of the catechism at last they stuck altogether there was no more progression possible it only remained to hear the sentence on their condemned heads everybody without exception was condemned one had to write out the creed another the commandments and all their duty towards their neighbours and i shall myself take the same lesson today week said the head and if the form generally does not show a far better knowledge of the catechism i shall be unable to adopt the leniency with which i have treated their shortcomings today next sunday then i shall hold the class in my study the significance of this was not lost upon anybody the study was a room of awful import and the comfort of the low red morocco settee the interest of the photographs of oxford crews on the wall in which the head appeared with sidewhiskers and no beard could not compensate for the uneasy knowledge that in the middle drawer of the kneehole table at which he sat were a couple of canes it was no rare thing for the head to take a bunch of rattling keys from his pocket which was the first step and to fit one of them into the centre drawer sometimes with rising voice he turned it and opened the drawer and if things still went badly the trembling victim was put through the farce of choosing which cane he preferred and then advancing the palms of his hands the head paused after this prodigious announcement about the venue for the catechismclass next sunday and opened the markbook mr dutton was scrupulously neat in his methods and there in the first column of the marks for the new week was his list headed catechism the head scrutinised these in silence the marks for todays catechism are already entered he said stone you are the headboy of the class why did you not tell me that mr dutton had already heard you your catechism i will tell you why you wanted me to waste my time and yours so that we should not have so long for the biblelesson was that it sir nno said stone what was your reason then for not telling me stone looked at him in a sort of stunned despair i dont know sir he said it was indeed a black afternoon the head probably owing to his discovery on mr duttons desk was in his sternest and most awful mood already five oclock had struck whereas the lesson should have been over by halfpast four and outside the boys were beginning to gather up their rugs and books and were strolling over the grass of the cricketfield to the schoolbuildings from which the warning bell for tea was invitingly clanging it was maddening to think that all this time might have been saved and all the impositions and the hour next sunday in the dreaded study avoided if only as it now turned out stone had had the courage to say that mr dutton had already heard them their catechism but courage was not a quality that blossomed when the head was in a poor temper and every boy in the class knew that if he had been in stones place he would have held his tongue he might easily have been told not to bully the head a somewhat favourite expression or have been witheringly requested to give him permission to conduct the class in the manner he preferred chapel was held at six and when tea was to come in was difficult of conjecture yet even a tealess chapel would be something of a relief if only the threequarters of an hour that intervened could be got through without storms but before then they would have to embark on this missionary enterprise which if it was as dangerous for st paul as it was likely to prove for the students of it must have required a bold heart and what added sting to it was that stone had received a hamper from home only the day before on which tonight his friends would have gorged sumptuously the minutes went by with paralysed slowness for if the catechism had been trying this was infinitely worse the head who very likely wanted his tea too but for the sake of discipline and education mortified his appetite as well as those of the boys took a gloomier and gloomier view of them and their attainments collateral ignorance of the position of iconium was seen to be a moral crime of the deepest dye and the dictionary was beggared of wounding epithets in order adequately to convey the enormity of not knowing its position as regards lystra if ferrers major had committed parricide under circumstances of unique horror he could not have been held up to blacker obloquy than was volleyed on him for his remarks about thessalonica none escaped the task of making a map with the names of the principal towns and the track of the journey itself in red ink the less fortunate had to produce two maps by this time next week and the only thing it was possible to be thankful for was that this nightmare of an hour had not been taken in the study else it was felt the function of the keys would not have been limited to mere rattling already the field was beginning to be dotted over again with groups of boys who had come out of tea and were waiting for chapelbell to ring how earnestly it was possible to desire chapeltime to come david had never known before but anything even the litany or as would happen today the psalm for the fifteenth evening of the month which had seventytwo verses was better than this sulphurous divinitylesson the whole class was limp with heat and hunger and terror then the merciful relief of the querulous bell came and the head closed his bible the lesson has been disgraceful he said i hope for all your sakesi say i hopethat next sunday will not be a repetition of today i am more particularly distressed when i think that some of you like blaize are the sons of clergymen and have therefore greater opportunities of studying sacred history he got up huge and towering in his rustling silk gown and immediately as was the amazing manner of him who never nagged however severe he might be his mood completely changed and his eyes twinkled as he observed the depressed class there my boys thats over he said and like good fellows try not to make me angry with you again i hate finding fault you may not believe it but i do and neither you nor i have had any tea so when chapel is over you will all go to the housekeepers room and ask her with my compliments to give you a real good tea he stalked out rocking slightly as he went and instantly the oppression of his anger being gone the spirits of the class rose skyhigh jolly decent of him said ferrers gosh im glad he didnt take us in the study i say blazes i wouldnt have my mouth washed with bagss sponge itll be fit to poison you why do you know what he does with his sponge loathsome details invented on the spur of the moment followed fancy being washed by bags at all said stone he dont know how to wash himself yet stone you fool why the devil couldnt you tell the head that dubs had taken the catechism this from bags anyhow im glad my father isnt a clergyman like blaizes do you do divinity with him in the study on sunday afternoon in the holidays whack whack there my boy oh papa dont hit me whack whack oh papa squeaked sharpe major david by a dexterous movement got sharpes head in chancery rubbed his nose on his desk pulled his hair and hit him over the biceps any more remarks about papa he asked cheerfully come on out with them chapter ii the others poured out into the sunshine but david lingered behind with bags and ferrers major and began burrowing in his locker to find the box belonging to his two stagbeetles they were male and female as the ladys absence of long horns testified and it was hoped that even in confinement she might some day be confined indeed there were several bets on as to which form the babies would takewhether they would be eggs or some sort of caterpillar or minute but fully developed stagbeetles the box in question was a small cardboard oblong of cramped dimensions but really it was no more than their saloon travellingcarriage for they lived in davids washingbasin at night since it had been ascertained that the sides of it were too steep and slippery to allow their escape and at other times had the run of his desk in schoolhours and were allowed quantities of healthy exercise when their owner was unoccupied and could look after their wayward steps but now since after chapel david would not come back to the classroom it was necessary to put them in their travellingcarriage which was pierced with holes so that such air as there might happen to be in davids pocket should penetrate to them a few slips of grass and leaves would be sufficient to sustain them until they were regaled with bits of cake and a strawberry or two from the tea which was to be provided for the first form after chapel the lady was lying on her back as good as gold waving her legs slowly in the air having probably fallen down on some climbing expedition about the roof of the locker but the stag himself called the monarch of the glen could not at once be found but a little careful rummaging disclosed him sitting morosely in a crevice between a grammar and a geography book i say i dont believe the monarchs well said david shouldnt think so living in your fuggy desk said bags strolling out of the room suddenly david perceived as by a special revelation that he must kick bags bags had thrown an inky dart at him and though in the depression of the biblelesson that had been forgotten it started into prominence again in his mind further bags had added insult to injury by saying that his desk was fuggy certainly he must kick bags just once juicily and call it all square david gingerly took the monarch by the waist so that his pincers nipped the empty air and put him and his spouse into their travelling carriage come on ferrers he said on their way across to chapel he paused a moment to pick a few leaves from the bright squibs of rootgrowth on the elm just outside the classroom and took ferrers arm dont lets go too quick he said i want to catch bags up just as we get to chapeldoor and if i was alone he might suspect then youll see ill give him one kick just one but a beauty lets seem to be talking diabolically diplomatic david managed his manuvre well gradually gaining on his unsuspecting victim and stalking him with infinite stealth and relish there was no question of honour in coming behind him thus unaware for bags had launched a dart at him without provocation and had also gone jauntily across to chapel after making that illadvised remark about davids fuggy desk should bags resent a good sound kick which was a pretty just payment of the score david would be perfectly happy to fight him afterwards if he desired it it was quite all right david sometimes lounging sometimes hurrying and all the time talking in a foolish interested manner to ferrers came up close to the rear of the enemy just two steps outside chapeldoor they were the last of the boys to go in and david had space to swing his leg for the moment bags was too much astonished to be hurt and david passed him with a slight smile on his hopelessly seraphic face went up the gangway to his seat in the choir just opposite the organ knelt down and covered a gratified face with his hands he loved doing things neatly and to kick bags just once quite correctly like that was as good as cutting a ball just out of reach of point the evening service began psalms and canticles and hymns all to be sung it was that terrible fifteenth evening of the month and page after page of psalm must be gone through only that morning david and ferrers had had an impassioned argument as to whether the old or the new testament was the beastliest ferrers maintaining that there was nothing in the new testament that could compare with the kings of israel and judah while david and his argument was strengthened after the last hour affirmed that nothing bc could beat the missionary journeys not if it tried with both hands but as the psalm for the fifteenth evening to a single chant too went on he felt that it was difficult to feel honestly that there could be anything beastlier especially if you had not had tea he hoped ferrers would not adduce that as a crushing argument for the supremacy of the old testament on it went and as an antidote to its interminableness david began to think of other and more pleasant things there was his elevencap and his twentyfour runs in the last match to muse upon as a resisting topic to the tedium of the children of israel and in especial one gorgeous pull for four he had made also he could feel on the side of his leg the slight vibration from the travellingcarriage of the monarch and his wife which showed they were moving about enjoying it was to be hoped the fresh elmleaves he had nipped off for them it was in his lefthand trousers pocket that these were confined a place to be felt stealthily and exteriorly since handsinpockets was a forbidden attitude in chapel just below the box were the two halfcrowns the yet unchanged splendour of aunt eleanors gift also in anticipation was the thought of the tea that should succeed chapel and in retrospect the remembrance of the beautiful kick he had given bags but the seventyeighth psalm was a corker for all that and if ferrers major brought it up he would have to admit it the psalm began to show promise of ending and it was already possible to count the remaining verses then suddenly there was something so delightful in it as a topical allusion that ferrers could no longer advance it as being beastlier than anything in the new testament and davids contribution to the music swelled out at once more lustily and he looked and beamed towards bags as he sang he smote his enemies in the hinder part and put them to a perpetual shame ferrers caught his eye and understood but bags did not which was a pity david felt he must have seen the appositeness of that verse but he did not look up poor old bags perhaps he was much hurt david had not meant to hurt him much he had only wanted to kick him neatly and squarely and peacefully ready to fight afterwards if desired the senior boys of the first form read the lessons at these services and it was the turn of stone and ferrers to make asses of themselves in the school phrase the rest of the congregation masters and boys followed the reading in their bibles or at any rate found the place and meditated among the masters there was mr dutton looking peculiarly depressed with whom in spite of his general beastliness david felt a certain sympathy as he was commanded to honour the head immediately afterwards on the subject of the yellowbacked novel at the organ were seated the two misses acland daughters of the head one to play the other to turn over leaves for her sister and to pull out stops or put them in she also poked away at the pedals and occasionally dropped books on the keys producing the most wagnerian effects these two female figures with plump backs turned to him afforded david plenty of rather acid reflection goggles so called for obvious reasons but addressed as miss mabel was the elder and wasnt so bad though she had a woeful tendency to improve and console the occasion when any of the boys got into trouble and was a kind of official dove with an olivebranch after the deluge but carrots this concerning her hair which otherwise belonged to miss edith had lately shown herself altogether too beastly it was a moral certainty that it was she who had sneaked to her father when last week ferrers had gone out of bounds because he had seen her in richmond and so of course she had seen him and told the head it had been a wholeschool day and all the other masters had been in their classrooms and it must have been carrots ferrers had had the toothache and was excused afternoon school and feeling better had gone to richmond it wasnt fair of the family to spy for the head he of course and the rest of the masters were your natural enemies and if you were caught by them that was the fortune of war but if carrots or goggles and all the crew were enemies also they ought to be declared enemies instead they pretended to be friends with their sisterly advice and their olivebranches and their treacherous smiles oh the magnificat that was soon over and again davids disapproving eye glanced up at goggles and carrots during the second lesson this time they had turned round on their organbench and spread their bibles on their knees ostentatiously following the lesson as an example to the school david was afraid they were hypocrites and having found his place continued to meditate on them yes there had been a firstform conference on the subject of goggles and carrots when ferrers returned that afternoon from a short and extremely painful interview with the head and it had been settled that goggles and carrots must be cut david had at the time been opposed to cutting goggles as well as her sneaking sister because goggles wasnt such a bad chap and there was nothing against her personally but he and a small minority had been overruled if carrots had sneaked goggles might sneak next and it was wiser to have no truck at all with the enemys family though goggles at this moment looked innocent enough with the low sun shining through a stained glass window on to her spectacles and protuberant eyes david felt that after all it was wiser to err on the side of prudence than to be led into a course of mistaken kindness but it was rather difficult only yesterday she had congratulated him with apparent sincerity on his innings of twentyfour and had offered him a visit to the strawberrybeds in the garden he had been compelled by the resolution passed by the sixthform conference to decline this temptation and to say with a stony face thank you miss mabel but i cant even that was not strictly in accordance with the vow he ought really to have icily raised his cap and said nothing whatever it was part of the career of goggles and carrots to make the service what is called bright which meant there was a good deal of singing this presupposed in order to ensure a proper performance a certain amount of choirpractice these practices were not allowed to take the place of other schoolwork but were held in the less useful hours of playtime in compensation the members of the choir were rewarded with an extra halfholiday towards the end of term if they had missed no practices and before now goggles had been known when a boy had missed say only one practice to falsify the register and send up his name to her father as an unremitting attendant which did not look as if she was a bad chap but on the other hand she was sister to her sister about whom there could be no doubt whatever she must have sneaked ferrers had seen her in richmond and immediately on his return he had been summoned and dealt with probably all girls were dishonourable and so it was best to cut goggles too and it was not as if carrots was only a kid who must be taught the proper ways of schoollife she was quite grown up and very likely would never see fifteen again besidesoh the nunc dimittis though they were a long way off being dismissed yet a slight alleviation happened here for the wind of the organ suddenly ran out with a wail and a wheeze and was started again by the blower in so feverish a haste that the notes shook and trembled as he pumped soon after in privacy of kneeling david was able to peep into the stagbeetles travellingcarriage and observe with delight that the monarch was browsing on elmleaves he appeared to have an excellent appetite and was swiftly put away again as they rose for the hymn instead anthem was announced by the head without further particularisation since there was but one but it seemed scarcely credible that any one could have been so mean as to couple an anthem to that unending seventyeighth psalm no doubt this was reprisal on the part of goggles and carrots it must be duly considered afterwards davids mind had been pretty busy with these trains of thought and his attention to the service from a devotional point of view intermittent and fragmentary more than once he stole a glance at bags as a general reconnoitring measure it appeared from a certain gingerliness in bagss movements when he sat down or stood that he was not quite comfortable and since accounts had been squared between them david hoped he had not hurt him much the kick in the main was meant to be symbolical and he determined that unless bags actually wanted to be nasty he would make it up directly after chapel davids cheerful and eager soul hated prolonged or nagging warfare and since bags had been paid for his injudicious behaviour during school that afternoon david was quite ready to proclaim or assent to a cordial pax naturally if bags did not want pax he should have as much bellum as he wished for and during the prayer for parliament in which it was frankly impossible for a proper boy of thirteen to take any interest david planned a raid or two bags was like a girl in some ways he couldnt stand creeping things so if he didnt want pax he should find blackbeetles in his bed without any more ado about the matter these were easily procured they lived in the waterpipes of a disused lavatory and by turning on a tap horrible halfdrowned specimens descended wriggling into the basin he had put two in bagss bed once before with the splendid effect that bags spent the night on the floor in his dressinggown rather than encounter them whereas when he had tried the same trick on david david had smashed the intruders to death with his slipper and slept soundly amid the mutilated corpses yes they should be about bagss path and about his bedparticularly his bedhe should find them in his pockets and his boots until he abandoned nagging warfare and either came to blows and had done with it or made peace like a gentleman david had fought bags once before and bags did not want any more on that occasion and said so david as a matter of fact did not want any more either and his face for the next few days had been notably more lumpy than bagss but by virtue of an extra ounce of grit he had not said so therefore amen sang david fervently looking as if he had just come down from an italian picture of singing angels but he forgot that the last amen went down instead of remaining on the same note sermontime afforded more opportunities for meditation for he swiftly decided that he could not understand what the head was driving at there was another and most important cricketmatch at the end of this week and until that was over he would not be able to smoke at all because he had made a vow that if he made more than ten runs in the last match he would not smoke for ten days this vow he had written out on a piece of paper and buried it in a matchbox below a certain tree on the whole that had been rather a clever vow since to begin with he did not like smoking at all and only did it because just now it was the smart thing to do but a vow of this importance which he would have to tell the smoking club about when they met on tuesday would certainly be held sacred even by stone who was the dashing president of the club and often smoked a cigarette right through without minding though it was only incumbent on members to smoke half a cigarette at these meetings but they had to do that without being sick and if you were sick three times you were turned out of the club furthermore as an additional cleverness in the vow he had been told by a fellow at a public school that smoking was bad for the eye and even when people were quite old as at oxford or cambridge they never smoked when they were in training again if his vow was not accepted as a reason for abstention he would have to resign but that he really did not mind about for it was stupid to put smoking before cricket also the secret of the smoking club had somehow leaked out and now that the badge was no longer a mystery to those who did not belong half the fun was gone this badge was a piece of copperwire bent into the shape of s c for smoking club and when they were engaged in these sacred operations it had to be worn in the buttonhole otherwise there was a fine of a halfpenny which helped to fill the coffers of the club and was spent in cigarettes but only last week bags who did not belong happened to see his badge and said casually hullo you belong to the sick club do you this was annoying because it not only implied a knowledge of the club but darkly alluded to its rules david had been ready enough on this occasion and had answered smartly if you belonged to an s c it would be the sneak club and the shot had gone home for bags had sneaked once of course it was ever so long ago the term before last before bags had become a decent chap and the incident had been suitably buried but the thought of its possible resuscitation made bags extremely civil for several days certain words the horror of sin the infamy of evil caught davids ears at this moment and he attended for a little it seemed to him rather poor stuff and why the head should sway about and shout like that was impossible to conjecture but it gave him a hint and david closely listening intended to reproduce some of it in dormitory that night a nightshirt made an admirable surplice and a pair of trousers hung over the shoulders would make a ripping stole he himself would be the head as he had thought of it and stone and ferrers should be stuffed with pillows to represent goggles and carrots with his bed as the organ david would march the whole way down the dormitory after the matron had gone with the heads rocking walk and some cottonwool for a beard preceded by a small boy carrying a poker then suddenly the heads voice changed it became extraordinarily solemn and beautiful as it did sometimes when he read to them and the words were beautiful and they affected david in that puzzling incomprehensible manner in which words did words and the pictures dim and only halfconscious that they produced in his mind often had that effect on him they gave him a sort of homesick yearning and an ache as if his mind was hungry and it was clear that what he was saying moved the head in the same sort of way his voice shook and grew lower yet reminding david of something he had felt once when he woke early and heard the chirruping of birds before daybreak so prepare to be men he said and when manhood dawns on you let it dawn on you as on the clean dewy grass with birds singing in your hearts and innocence still looking from your eyes never contemplate evil and the desire of it will fade from you run away from it if by staying near it you would yield and whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things are of good report think on those things david gave a little gulp not only were these beautiful words but they meant something but the sermon was over and it was impossible not to remember that in a few minutes now he would be having tea in the housekeepers room while the wretched dubs was doing the head the honour to wait on him it had been jam to see the head stamp on that yellowcovered book and with any luck the fragments of it would be in the grate of the museum tomorrow david determined to get up early and see what it was about it was in french which was a bore but it was worth while even at the trouble of looking out heaps of words to see what it was that had made the head in such a wax or had it something to do with the things the head told them they must run away from rum old bird the head but he did say jolly things sometimes chapter iii the tea which with the heads compliments mrs lowe provided after chapel was an apotheosis of tea the heads dinner was going on simultaneously and the most delicious remainders were brought in from it for the boys ending with an ice pudding that at its entrance was practically untouched though soon there was nothing left to touch it had really been worth while to voyage at such peril over unknown seas and lands if this was to be the eventful haven and when at the end ferrers proposed the health of iconium his toast was drunk with acclamation thereafter was a little quiet ragging but david had not joined in this for when he was seized by somebody he had said in plethoric tones for gods sake dont bend me or i shall be sick and for fear of that untoward result he had been left alone bags also was not disposed to active exercise and david had taken the opportunity to be agreeable according to his resolution in chapel i say i hope i didnt hurt you bags he said you see i had to kick you just once to make it all square is it pax bags looked sideways at david with his shallow goatlike eyes before he answered oh rather he said it wasnt anything you hardly touched me this was surprising for david had the distinct impression in his toe and instep that this particular kick had been a juicy one right oh then he said i say theres one piece of cake left shall we halve it couldnt said bags getting up though he could not be bent david thought that a cautious attack might defeat the one piece of cake and strategically accomplished this but it was funny that bags should not have tried too and for a moment he had suspicions it is pax then he asked oh rather said bags and your lips all right isnt it blazes quite clean i mean i think the head only gassed about that on the spur of the moment will you swear i washed it if necessary oh yes said david gosh im full and im going to preach in dormitory nightshirt and trousers for a stole i can remember lots of the sermon oh may i come asked bags right but dont be sarcastic and spoil the show itll be in my cubicle rather not said bags moving away may i be goggles or carrots sorry stone and ferrers have bagged them but you might blow the organ and let it go out with a squeak same as it did this evening oh thanks thatll be ripping said bags beginning to practise squeaking in a realistic and organlike manner now bagss mater was as all the world knew a jewess bags had volunteered that information himself on his first day at school adding loftily that she was of the tribe of judah this if it was meant to be impressive had singularly failed in its object and the only consequence was that for his first term or so bags had been the butt of various embarrassing questions as to whether he was allowed to eat sausages or observed other levitical injunctions david as a matter of fact had not joined in these painful catechisms holding that it wasnt fair to consider a fellow responsible for his mater but he had always secretly felt that this might account for there being something rather odd about bags for bags had a retentive and vindictive memory and was ever on the lookout to repay antique scores though other people would have forgotten all about them it was therefore not likely that he would have overlooked a scene so recent as this kick and after bags had gone david said to himself that he was being too infernally geniala jolly sounding word which he had just learnedto deceive the wary in fact though bags had definitely agreed that it should be pax david was subconsciously a little suspicious of him and this attitude was confirmed by bags having said that that one beautiful kick had hardly touched him it absolutely must have there was no mistaking the quality of the touch but he did not dwell on it much should bags prove to be bellicose still in spite of the treaty he felt the utmost confidence that he could deal with him david woke next morning very early with a sense of immense interest in things in general it was still only the hour of faint and early dawn and he lay quiet a little while drawing his knees up to his chin and clasping his legs with his bare arms in order to multiply the consciousness of limbs and body and life generally just behind him was the open window through which the fresh breeze of morning came coolly ruffling his hair and on each side the varnished pitchpine of the walls of his cubicle gay with wonderful decoration his face was turned to the partition close to his bed and thus the earliest object that his eye fell on was the school eleven cricketcap which he had won last week hung on a nail on another nail beside it was his watch and chain his fathers birthday present to him on attaining the immense age of thirteen and on the same nail though not conjoined with this jewellery the mystic badge of the smoking club a little farther on was another gift of his fathers a small chromolithographic reproduction of the sistine madonna by a fellow called raphael whose name somehow appealed to david though the picture itself was rather pi and close beside that a photograph of carrots exchanged for one of his in those happier days before she sneaked now carrotss intelligent features were turned face to the wall and david wondered whether she ought not to be deposed altogether anyhow it had been carrots who had asked him for his photograph promising hers the exchange had come from her side then there was a photograph of ferrers major unframed but tacked to the wall and one of hughes davids great friend who had left a year before and gone to marchester where david hoped to follow him at the michaelmas term hughes was altogether godlike and david adored him then came a small fretwork bracket homemade in the holidays with a sort of petticoat of crimson silk hanging round the edge of its shelf on which was placed a small china lamb lying down among amazing flowers which david assured his friends was jolly valuable he cuddled his knees for a little while contemplating these precious things and forbearing to turn round and look the other way because even more agreeable objects with the exception perhaps of the photograph of hughes would meet his eyes there and the zest for them was to be sharpened by abstention to begin with there was the chair which last night had made so perfect a pulpit and even the sight of his trousers now lying on it which last night had made so lovely a stole would make him giggle again at the thought of his highly successful sermon there also was the photograph of the two elevens in last weeks match and more precious still a snapshot of himself standing at the wicket which ferrerss sister had taken had developed and had sent to him the very next day jolly cute of her thought david he longed to turn round and assure himself by ocular evidence of the permanence of these things but teasing himself went on with his enumeration of them there was his cricketbat and one righthand batting glove which he had bought secondhand most people did not rise to gloves at all indeed stones glove was the only other one in the school and for the moment the idea of staggering humanity by purchasing a lefthand glove also with aunt eleanors five shillings flashed across him probably nobody at helmsworth had ever had two battinggloves before fancy being snapshotted with two gloves then there was a pillbox filled with the yellow dust from the cedarcones in the grounds which he had collected and labelled cedarsulphur and lastly there was his washingbasin in which ever ineffectually trying to climb up its slippery steep sides were the monarch of the glen and his spouse david could resist that no longer rolled round in bed and got up good morning monarch he said politely how and then he stopped there were two or three elmleaves in the basin and a halfeaten strawberry but otherwise it was empty there was no monarch there was no wife for the moment david could not believe it he felt that they must be there and that for some curious sleepy reason although he was not sleepy he could not see them again and again he turned over the leaves and looked underneath the strawberry as if the monarch had been made little by his meal like alice in wonderland but there was no sign of them then he searched about his cubicle scrutinising the varnished walls examining the floor searching in his blankets in case they had strayed there and all the time he felt the futility of this for he was convinced in his own mind that neither the monarch nor his lady could have climbed the glazed ascent of the sides of the washing basin often had he watched them attempting to do so even the gradual slope at the base was beyond the adhesive power of their feet and as for the precipice of the sides themselves they were hopelessly incapable of surmounting it they could not get out themselves some one must have then a sudden suspicion struck him and he went softly and barefooted to the far end of the dormitory where bags slept and shook him awake this had to be accomplished with silent caution since no boy was allowed to leave his cubicle till the dressingbell sounded i say bags have you taken my stags he whispered if you tell me you have and give them up i swear i wont do anything to you bags sat up in bed and yawned heavily to give himself time to think do you really think i would touch those filthy crawlers he asked doesnt matter what i think said david i want to know if you did bags was considerably astounded by davids having so instantly suspected him considering that he had agreed to pax yesterday evening well then i didnt he said so thats flat where did you put them last night in my basin said david suddenly bags saw the stout figure of the matron in the anteroom just outside the dormitory while david facing towards him could not see her if he could detain david in talk here for a minute it was more than likely that she would hear voices and find him out of his cubicle in which case she would certainly report him to the head he had not forgotten about the incident as they went into chapel last night and the temptation was too strong he laughed silently into his bedclothes what are you laughing at said david raising his voice whats the blooming joke bags did not answer and david repeated his question at that bags saw that the matron had heard the talking and was advancing in her felt slippers up the dormitory she was already past davids cubicle and retreat was cut off he sank back gently into bed cave he whispered theres glanders coming and stagbeetles can fly fancy not knowing that and he closed his eyes and sank apparently into a refreshing sleep david turned round glanders was coming straight up the dormitory and had already seen him since there was no hope of concealment he went out to meet his fate out of your cubicle before dressingbell said glanders bleakly i shall report you master blaize not the first time either david got back into bed again in a very different mood from that in which he had awoke half an hour ago the week was beginning just about as badly as it could and the sight of his cricketcap and battingglove failed to console him in the least or bring back the sense of his happy awaking he had two maps of the second missionary journey to make he had to stop in between twelve and one when he should have been practising at the nets to learn his catechism the monarch and his wife had vanished and he was to be reported for being out of his cubicle before the dressingbell sounded that was a serious breach of schooldiscipline and glanders might have gone further when she so feelingly reminded him that this would not be the first time either for it would not be the second either on the last occasion the head had told him precisely what would happen if it occurred again the colours of the new cricketcap had faded the glove looked ridiculous and the washingbasin was like the house of some one lately dead he felt furious and exasperated against fate and it was bitter to be reminded by bags that stagbeetles could fly in a general way he supposed he had known it too but it had not occurred to him that the monarch and his wife would dream of such a thing then there was a good fine caning to look forward to it hurt hideously at the time and you couldnt hold a bat all day afterwards because your hands were so sore there was an awful legend too in the school that the head had once broken a fellows finger and who knew that he would not repeat that savage feat today first one hand then the other and the same bruised and smarting hands again just in the same place and bloodblisters rising there the dressingbell sounded and it was necessary to get up it was just the sort of morning too that made a fellow wild with mysterious delight if things were going well but when things were black it seemed an added insult that the sunlight and the sky were in such excellent spirits there was the cricketprofessional in the field outside whistling as he put up the nets for practice but there would be no practice for david today instead from twelve to one he would be making maps and staring at the catechism and his hands would be tender and bruised and lumpy and there were no stags to cater for he went down to his bath feeling utterly wretched and dispirited with that completeness of emotion that only children know who are unable to look beyond the present and immediate future the happiness or misery of which possesses them entirely other boys were splashing about and throwing sponges at each other and he was hailed with the derisive taunts indicating general good spirits and friendliness hullo heres blazes what reported again blaize dont bully me sir the other hand sir whack whack i say blazes hows the monarch flown away bags says dirty vermin anyhow so whats the odds come and practise at no net at halfpast twelve with me and ferrers david chucked his sponge into his bath and kicked off his slippers cant catechism to learn thanks to stone oh yes so you have i expect you wouldnt be able to hold a bat either never mind buck up all the same in a hundred years besides hughes was caned two mornings running last year and he didnt blub even at the second helping the goatlike bags entered at this moment i say rough luck he said to david i warned you as soon as i saw glanders found the monarch yet this was rather too much david felt suddenly sure that bags was at the bottom of all his misfortunes and already goaded by highspirited sympathy turned on him no i havent he shouted and im jolly well going to search your cubicle i believe you stole him look here you chaps i believe bags took the monarch and i believe he saw glanders coming when i was talking to him and didnt warn me stone took his brown head out of the towel in which he had been rubbing it why what evidence he asked unless youre too blooming omniscient to want evidence said bags because youre a sneak because i jolly well hurt you last night and you said i hadnt to put me off the scent said david with a sudden inspiration why youve got a bruise as big as a football he cried pointing to the injured part of bagss anatomy and yet you said it didnt hurt it must have hurt its all rot to say it didnt and you said it was pax in order to put me off the lookout bosh thats not evidence said ferrers whose father was a kc and was much looked up to on points of schoollaw thats only your blooming guess well it would be evidence if i found the monarch in his beastly cubicle said david or perhaps youd say that stags can fly and that the monarch had only flown there this was sarcasm of the deepest dye and produced its due effect on all the boys who in various stages of undress surrounded the two except stone who never could understand what sarcasm meant oh rot blazes said he at that rate the monarch may have flown to my cubicle but im not going to have you search it and turn everything upside down for the sake of a sickly stagbeetle the man of law considered the points i dont see why you shouldnt make a challenge out of it blazes he said disregarding the obtuse stone if youre so certain of it you can challenge bags to allow you to search his cubicle an if you dont find the monarch there he gives you three cuts of the hardest with a racquethandle and pax immediately afterwards david was standing in his bath and slipping plumped down into it heaving out solid water sorry you fellows he said to those who were wettest right then i challenge bags had moved away in the general stampede caused by davids plunge and on the instant with fresh suspicions teeming in his head david jumped out and got between him and the door of the big bathroom i say bags you havent had your bath he said and were you going back without it arent you going to have a bath not feeling dirty anyhow i challenge do you accept it bags took off his dressinggown oh you thought i was going back to dormitory to put them in your cubicle again did you he said it just happens to be my bath there by the door well but do you accept cried david executing a sort of indian wardance round him no said bags i dont want to give you three with a racquethandle as we made it up last night and i dont want you turning everything upside down in my cubicle ferrers put on his dressinggown with the solemnity of a judge assuming the blackcap then it simply proves the plaintiffs case if you wont have your cubicle searched he said its all rot about your not wanting to whack blazes because it was pax last night hes challenged you it isnt pax any longer state of war ferrers was in his element and it seemed to the court generally even as to him that never at the old bailey had the net been woven in such impenetrable fashion round the most palpable criminal bags too felt that but the net that really enmeshed him was of very different sort from what it appeared to be certainly he was in a hole but not the hole that every one thought he was in the majesty of the law proceeded if you dont accept the challenge said ferrers it proves you are guilty the plaintiff continued to dance ill let you give me six cuts if i dont find the monarch in your cubicle he shouted you must be guilty if you refuse six mustnt he ferrers ferrers tore his sock in trying to put it on to a wet foot not for a cert he said bags is beastly cunning he may be running you up to a higher figure then ill let him have twelve cuts said david feeling absolutely sure about it if i may search his cubicle and not find the monarch oh and search his dressinggown too he added quickly conjecturing a perfectly demoniacal piece of cunning on the part of bags bags stepped out of his bath with dignity feeling there was no escape then i accept blazes challenge of three cuts he said just to show i didnt want to run him up if i did i should take twelve done said david ill go and search at once theres another quarter of an hour before school i may as well search his dressinggown first no not there oh blow what shall i say if glanders finds me in his cubicle again i know bags is in the bathroom and wants his liniment if glanders doesnt think that likely she can come and look at him now bagss dilemma the net in which he was really involved was this he had lain awake for two hours last night in savage anger with david whom in secret boyish fashion he adored and who had been so beastly to him open vengeance was out of the question because if it came to a fight david was more than his match and thus his revenge for that infernal kick must be done stealthily plan after plan suggested itself to him but none were suitable until he thought of the very simple one of taking the monarch and his wife which as he knew quite well lived in davids washingbasin at night that was accomplished very easily without disturbing their owner but a few hours later he was awakened by david himself who had conceived the revolting suspicion that bags had done precisely what he had done then at the same moment almost while he was hot with indignation at being justly accused he had seen the matron at the far end of the dormitory and could not resist the temptation to get david into further trouble this too had been successfully accomplished and david would certainly be caned after morning school and then bags began to regret his success his affection for david whom no one could help liking even when he was being beastly and his sense of his own meanness pointed the finger of scorn at him and having ensured david a caning he wished he had not at any rate taken his beloved stagbeetles as well so lingering behind till the rest of the dormitory had gone to the bathroom he induced the monarch and his wife who were scratching about in his soaptin to crawl on to his sponge and as he passed davids cubicle he had shaken them off on to his bed then had come the bathroom complication he had been forced eventually by ferrerss resistless legal acumen to accept the challenge and he would have to whack david for any one might search his cubicle till doomsday and never find a stagbeetle there and each one of those cuts would be unjust he had taken the stagbeetles and david was perfectly right the fact of having put them back did not ease a troubled conscience david rushed upstairs again to his dormitory and with clatter and publicity went straight to bagss cubicle and began a violent and intimate search he searched in his pockets he examined the lower tray of his soapdish he peered behind pictures and ransacked the receptacle usually called the synagoguebox where bags kept familyletters and suchlike but nowhere was there the faintest trace of the monarch to be seen these operations glanders observedand david observed that she was observing themwith her bleak and stony eyes and just as he was very busy she approached do you want to be reported twice master blaize she asked oh certainly if you like said david but crabtree asked me to get his liniment and why cant master crabtree get it himself then asked glanders and why does he want liniment oh dont be tedious said david he cant get it himself because he hasnt got any clothes on and is afraid of shocking you and he wants it because he has got a bruise which you can see if you arent afraid of being shocked anything else i can tell you muffled laughter sounded from various directions as glanders sniffed which was her congenital way of acknowledging the legality of doubtful proceedings and david finished his search turning over the pillows of bagss bed without further hindrance but there was no monarch to be found and he had to go back to the bathroom to report that he could find no liniment and had lost his challenge this was depressing because the beloved monarch was still missing also his wife the hope of the race and because the loss of the challenge meant three nasty cuts from bags and his racquethandle and the head was going to let fly at him first and there was the missionarymap to be made and the whole blackness of this dreadful monday morning dissipated for the moment by his certainty that he would find the monarch overcast the sky again on his way back he passed his cubicle and pausing to throw his sponge and towel down his eye fell on his bed and there on the blanket were two black blots of familiar shape david gave a great sigh oh monarch and missus he said affectionately you little devils the travellingcarriage of the royalties was to hand and in a moment the black pair were safe again how they had got on to his blanket he did not pause to think and the three cuts due to him were jolly cheap at the price he made but a couple of leaps down the stairs to the bathroom i say ive lost the challenge bags he said but ive found the monarch he was on my blankets and so was she andi say im sorry i suspected you whenll you take your cuts bagss inconvenient conscience and affection gave him a nasty prod at this if david had only not said he was sorry he suspected him he would not have felt so beastly on the other hand it was dangerous to try to stifle his internal beastliness by magnanimity since this might lead to fresh suspicions on davids part but magnanimity salted with sarcasm might serve his turn oh i dont want to whack you he said as you say you were sorry as if i should have touched your filthy stags clip their wings and take them to marchester next half and see if hughes is proud of his pal who keeps vermin david stared in blank surprise to forgo the pleasure of chastisement was not in the spirit of shylock oh well thanks awfully he said if you dont want to take your cuts im sure i dont mind not getting them but why dont you bags was struggling into his shirt and speech was for the moment extinguished simply because the challenge was too silly for words he said as his head emerged the repetition of this silly reason did exactly that which bags desired should not happen suspicion vague and unformulated as yet again sprang up in davids mind such magnanimity was simply childish i think ill take the cuts then crabtree he said to mark the complete severance of friendly relations that roused bags the rejection of his spurious but highly superior motives quite stifled the prods of his inconvenient conscience all right then you shall he said gosh ill let into you ill put beef into them blaize ive got a racquethandle thatll do nicely i bet i break it youll want some liniment afterwards the tenminutes bell sounded at this moment and the boys ran upstairs again to finish dressing and say their prayers for the last five minutes of these ten they were bound to be on their knees at their bedside while glanders patrolled the dormitory but with care and discreet peeping through fingers it was possible to get through some neglected dressing during the devotional five minutes and david who was a good deal behindhand buttoned his collar put on his tie and laced one boot without being detected mr dutton was in an unusually docile mood during this hour from seven to eight and it wanted little penetration on the part of his pupils when they remembered the visit he had done the head the honour to pay him last night to guess the cause of that david felt chagrin at the fact that he had been detained in the bathroom and had not been able to take the dismembered yellowback from the grate to find out what made the head so waxy but there was no doubt that it was the head who had made mr dutton so mild indeed it had often been a debated question as to which was really the worst a caning or a proper jaw from the head for the hardiest were reduced to unwilling tears by the heads tongue when he really chose to apply it so convincing and dismal a picture could he paint of a boys satanic iniquity and the inevitable ruin that such courses fashioned for him in this world and the next but it was a point of honour not to cry at any application of the cane after you were twelve kids might cry but not elderly persons the cane might break your hands and make you set your teeth but it was not allowable to let it break your spirit but a jaw broke your spirit into smithereens and no doubt that disintegrating process had happened to old dubs anything in the way of construing was sufficient this morning and the grammatical questions were mere childsplay it was already ten minutes to eight and the school sergeant a whiskered veteran who visited the different classrooms during early school with orders from the head and summonses for boys who had been reported had already passed the museum door without coming in and davids heart rose if glanders had reported him it was quite certain that the sergeant would have conveyed the summons that he was to go to the head after chapel to his classroom and yet he had passed without delivering it from time to time these remissions happened glanders occasionally forgot to report even when she had promised it sometimes even in the act of complaining the stoniness of her bosom relented then with a sinking of the heart proportionally greater owing to its premature uplifting there was a tap on the door and the sergeant entered saluting beg your pardon sir he said to mr dutton handing him a small slip of blue paper but i forgot this as i went by mr dutton glanced at it blaize to go to the head after chapel he announced and david thought he detected a faint smile showing the malicious glee of a fellowsufferer chapel usually tedious was not long enough that morning and the psalms the lesson the hymns and the prayers passed in a flash ferrers as they went out administered spurious consolation if you stick your hands in cold water he said itll numb them a bit i remember last winter i held mine in the snow for five minutes and it didnt sting nearly so much and theres such a sight of snow about in july isnt there said david bitterly ferrers shrugged his shoulders all right then he said feeling slightly hurt and youve got your three cuts from bags too havent you i bet bags lays on a minute afterwards he was in the awful presence even as he entered he heard the jingle of keys and when he advanced to the table where its occupant was looking vexed he saw that the fatal middle drawer was already open that it could have been opened for any other reason did not strike him he supposed that his case was already judged for the moment the head seemed unaware of his presence and continued to read the letter that apparently annoyed him pish he said at length in a dreadful voice and looking up as he tore it in fragments saw david ah blaize he said i sent for youyes i want you to answer me a question or two this looked as unpromising as possible the drawer was already open but it seemed that a jaw was coming first why couldnt he cane him and have done with it thought the dejected david the head rapped the table sharply question one he said is it the case that my daughters have incurred the wrath of the first form davids head reeled at the thickness of the troubles yes sir he said good question two which you need not answer if any sense of honour forbid you why have they deserved thiser disgrace and why do you join in inflicting it david drew a long breath there was no sense of honour that would be violated in telling the head but to do so was like taking a high header into unknown waters when it required all the courage you were possessed of to go off a low board into four feet of familiar swimmingbath please sir its quite obvious that car he had begun with a rush and the rush had carried him too far carrots said the head suggestively lord how did he know thought david please sir we felt sure that miss edith had got ferrers into a row because she saw him in richmond week before last said david andand sneaked to me suggested the head yes sir told you i dare say miss edith saw him said the head but i havent the slightest idea whether she actually did or not i saw him myself miss edith had nothing to do with it kindly tell your friends so ill tell them said david theyll be awfully glad sir why asked the head again david dived off the high headerboard into dark waters because nobody wanted to think she was a sneak sir he said we always thought she was a good chapyoung lady i mean sir the head nodded and for the next halfminute busied himself with the reports that had come in this morning i think there was something else i wanted to see you about he said yes here it is you are reported for being in crabtrees cubicle before dressingbell this morning any explanation no sir said david you knew it was against the rules yes sir the head drew a large and dreaded book towards him which contained a list of all the boys names and against each the number of times they had been reported for any misconduct during the current term next the name of blaize was that of bellingham and glancing at it hastily he credited david with bellinghams stainless record i see you have not been reported before this term he said the moment he had spoken he saw his mistake on the line below was davids record showing that lie had been reported twice but he waited for davids answer he had not considered what he should do if david accepted the statement but he believed and wanted to prove to himself that david would not a joyful possibility whirled through davids mind it was conceivable that previous reports against him had not been entered and then not really knowing why he spoke no sir i have been reported before he said for the same offence yes sir once before asked the head feeling that his test stood firm no sir twice said david squeezing his hands together the head closed the book he put it in the middle drawer and closed that also thank you for telling me the truth he said and now i want you as a personal favour to make an effort to keep schoolrules they are made for that purpose goodbye my boy ah you are late for breakfast so come and have breakfast with me if you are late for school afterwards explain to mr dutton david was joyfully late for school and not only explained briefly then but categorically afterwards to his form in the interval at halfpast ten sausages he said and poached eggs and bacon and sloshy buttered toast and strawberries gosh the head does himself well he has breakfast like that every day i expect didnt i tuck in oh and another thing carrots didnt sneak at all it was the head himself who saw ferrers in richmond he told me so dont believe it said ferrers who had misogynistic tendencies well then youve got to the head never lies and so carrots is all right and the heads my pal cant think why he didnt whack you though said ferrers perhaps he knew you were going to catch it from bags hes been binding his racquethandle too to get a firm grip this was slightly malicious on ferrerss part but what with special tea last night and special breakfast this morning and the recovery of the monarch and the remission of a caning he thought david a little above himself but even this information about bags did not appear to depress him and he cocked his yellow head on one side like a meditative canary and halfshut his eyes as if focussing something blow it if i hadnt forgotten all about bags he said ferrers theres something rummy about bagss show why did bags not want to take up my challenge if he knew the monarch wasnt in his cubicle and why didnt he take a dozen cuts at me its all rot of him to say that he didnt care about whacking me any decent chaps mouth would water to lick a fellow who had accused him of stealing the two boys had wandered away in this halfhours interval between schools to a distant corner of the field below the chestnuttree there david lay down flat and ferrers flicked the fallen flowers at his face but he stopped at this you see i caught him a juicy hack too last night continued david and hes a revengeful beast in a general way perhaps its the day of atonement or something suggested ferrers david sat up no that cant be it he said else hed want to make me atone hallo here he comes across the field racquethandle and all he suddenly gave a shrill whistle through his broken front tooth i say will you back me up whatever i say he asked ive thought of something ripping ferrers peered shortsightedly across the field he did not often wear his spectacles since they were supposed to give him a resemblance to goggles which was the rise of intolerable comment so they seldom graced his freckled nose yes here he comes he said ill back you up but what is it oh youll see said david bags made a truculent approach swinging his racquethandle he had done all that could humanly be done in the easing of his conscience and since he had been literally unable to get out of the rle of executioner with honour he had wisely determined to dwell on the bright side of it and hit as hard as he could in the same place ill lick you now if you like he said brightly david turned a cold face on him thanks awfully he said but we settled it for twelve you see a good deal may happen before twelve ferrers and i were just talking it over wasnt it a pity that ferrers minor slept so badly last night this remark seemed slightly to disconcert bags but he carried it off with fair success the point asked bags politely slapping his leg gently with the racquethandle oh thought you might see it said david the point is that he didnt go to sleep beforewhen was it ferrers he heard the clock strike one said ferrers at a venture a shade of relief crossed bagss face which the machiavellian david noticed i still dont see the point said bags david pursued his ripping plan no youve mixed it up you goat he said to ferrers your minor told me he awoke and heard the clock strike one and lay awake till dressingbell bang wide awake likelike toothache sorry of course it was said ferrers backing his fellowconspirator up bags shrugged his shoulders and began to walk away afraid i cant see the point he said so ill whack you at twelve blazes david lay down again with complete unconcern right oh he said but of course if youve got anything to say about it all you might be wise to say it yourself and not letwell somebody else say it for you ferrers minor hasnt told anybody yet except his major and me not yet you know he added bags appeared to take no notice of this unless he strolled away rather more deliberately than before then david turned quickly to ferrers and whispered in his ear go and find your minor he said and dont let bags talk to him im going to stop here i shouldnt wonder if bags came back but what on earth is it all about asked ferrers davids eyes sparkled with devilish intrigue cant explain now he said just go and stick on to your minor and dont let bags question him theres something up ferrers obeyed the bidding of the mastermind and by a rapid flank march got in front of bags who called to him but he took no notice and presently david saw him lead off his minor like a policeman at that his habitually seraphic face grew a shade more angelic and any one who did not know him must have been surprised that wings did not sprout from his low slim shoulders the machiavellian device which he had practised had come to him like an inspiration if bagss conscience was clear he would not mind a scrap for the wakefulness of young ferrers and david was morally or immorally sure that bagss conscience was not immaculate he had had something to do with the disappearance of the stagbeetles though exactly what david had no idea then he gave a little cackle of delight for he saw that bags had stopped in his indolent stroll with the racquethandle then that he turned and was coming back towards him david lay down at full length and whistled in an absent manner without looking he became aware that bags was standing close to him i say blazes i want to tell you something said that consciousstricken one at length david sat up with an air of great surprise hallo that you he said tell away then if it wont take too long well its private you must swear not to tell any one david shook his head oh i couldnt do that he said why not david turned on him an indulgent glance oh i expect you know he said its partly because i know already what youre going to tell me and partly because youre a swindling stealing liar and the sooner other chaps know that the better bags made a swinging blow in the air with his racquethandle well then i dont care he said ill give you three of the jolliest cuts you ever had at twelve will you after ferrers minor has told his story asked david well i tried to get out of it said the unhappy bags there was an awful bright moon last night crabtree said david thoughtfully but about what you want to tell me it might make a difference if you told me voluntarily bags capitulated well then i took your beastly stagbeetles and put them back on your bed when you had gone to your bath oh that was the way it was said david pretty cute but then you see i was cuter ferrers minor didnt lie awake a minute as far as i know but i saw you had a bad conscience cant think why you didnt accept my challenge straight off why didnt you he looked at the dejected bags and his funny boyish little soul suddenly grew perceptive whats the row bags he asked bags sat down on the grass by him i feel perfectly beastly he said youre always horrid to me andand i like you so awfully you kicked me fit to kill last night just because i threw an inkdart at you i only did it for a lark just because i felt fit and after i had taken your stags i was sorry and i tried to get out of your challenge though i knew you would lose it david ceased to sit in the seat of the scornful whatever bags had done and he really had done a good deal he had blurted out that he liked him so awfully it was no time to inquire whether he had seen glanders and not warned him or to examine further into the bally show what bags had said in all sincerity took rank over anything bags might have done and with that he wiped the whole affair clean off his mind and held out a rather grubby hand i bet we get on rippingly after this he said hopefully chapter iv david was swaggering aboutneither more nor lessin the new school blazer and elevencap on the morning of the cricketmatch against eagles school which was the great event of the entire year but as a matter of fact this swagger was but a hollow show and though he was completely conscious of being an object of envy and admiration in the eyes of the small boys or indeed of anybody who was not in the eleven he did not envy himself in the smallest degree to begin with he had that which in later life is called an attack of nerves though at present it came under the general comprehensive head of feeling beastly which made his mouth dry and his hands damp and his inside empty but not hungry and to make this worse his father had announced his intention of coming down to see the match that might not sound tragical but to david it was the cause of awful apprehensions which require a true sympathy with the sensibilities attaching to the age of thirteen fully to appreciate to begin with his father was an archdeacon and since he wore a shovelhat and odd black wrinkled gaiters even when as during last summer holidays he climbed the hills in the lake district with a small edition of the poems of wordsworth in his pocket from which he read aloud at frequent haltingplaces david had not allowed himself to hope that on the present inauspicious occasion he would be dressed like any other person and so escape the biting criticisms that his curious garments would be sure to call forth but there was much worse than this for his father was going to stay with the head over sunday and was to preach in school chapel in the evening that had occurred once before and the thought of the repetition of it made david feel cold all over for his father among many other infelicitous remarks in the course of an infliction which had lasted over half an hour as timed by the indignant holders of surreptitious watches had alluded to the chapel and the services there as the central happiness of schoollife david had barely yet lived down that fatal phrase everything connected with chapel had been rechristened the chapel bell had been called the central happiness bell it was time for central happiness one was late for central happiness the school had been addressed as lads in the springtime of hope and promise it was the most deplorable affair and he might easily in this coming trial give birth to more of these degrading expressions which david felt to be a personal disgrace but it was not even his fathers dress nor his possible behaviour in the pulpit that david dreaded most it was the fear that he would again as he had expressed it before take part in their schoollife on that lamentable occasion he had had dinner with the boys not sitting at the masters table which would have been bad enough but side by side with david at the table of the sixth form as illluck had it there was provided for dinner that day beefsteak pudding otherwise known as resurrectionbolly since it was firmly though mistakenly believed that it was composed of all the scraps left on the plates during the last week this tradition was beyond all question of argument and conjecture it was founded on solid proof since ferrers had distinctly recognised one day in his portion of resurrectionbolly a piece of meat which he himself had intentionally left on his plate four days previously consequently however hungry you might be it was a point of etiquette never to eat a mouthful of resurrectionbolly and davids misguided parent had not only eaten all his but like oliver twist had asked for more and unlike him had obtained it and eaten that as well with praise and unction of course he could not be expected to know that he had been eating scavenged remains so much justice was done him but he had remarked on the excellence of it whereas it was popularly supposed to stink clearly then that was the sort of food which blaize was regaled on at home in the holidays and witheringly sarcastic pictures were drawn of blaizes pater in gaiters collecting scraps from the dustbin in his shovelhat and gleefully taking them to the kitchen these miserable forebodings well founded on bitter experience were interrupted by the arrival of the team from eagles school and the home team took the visitors off to the dormitories to put on their flannels it fell to davids lot to be host to a boy called ward of trying deliberation in the matter of dress who parted his hair four times before he arrived at the desired result and looked with a marked abstention from comment at the decorations in davids cubicle consequently when they got down to the field again the rest of the two elevens were practising at the nets the grass was dotted over with groups of boys whose parents had misguidedly determined to visit their sons while the happier class unhampered with the dangers and responsibilities attaching to relations were comfortably dispersed on rugs in the shade of the elms david cast an anxious glance round to see if his own responsibility had yet arrived when his eye fell on the figures at the nets and the appalling truth burst upon him there was no possibility of mistake mingled with the crowd at the nets on the other side of the field was a figure in gaiters and a shovelhat just taking off his coat and betrayingan added horrora brown flannel shirt he held up a cricketball to his eye a moment in the manner of fifty years ago and taking a short stodgy run delivered it his hat fell off and the ball was so wide that it went not even into the net for which it was intended but into the next adjoining davids companion saw for that matter david felt that all europe saw and laughed lightly i say look at that funny old buffer in a flannel shirt he said he bowled into the wrong net i wonder why he wears such rummy clothes david felt his heart sink into the toes of his cricketboots and leak out but there was no help for it his father was perfectly certain to kiss him when he joined the fellows at the nets and the truth might as well come out now oh thats my pater he said oh is it said ward politely with a faint suppressed smile but i expect heshes awfully clever isnt he my guvnor played cricket for england one year and made fifty just then david was beyond the reach of human comfort at any other time it would have been a glorious thing to be walking with the son of a man who had made fifty for england but just now such glory was in total eclipse there fifty yards away was his own father putting his shovelhat on again he wore gaiters and a flannel shirt he bowled into the wrong net he would preach tomorrow and perhaps again eat twice of resurrectionbolly but a certain innate loyalty made him stand up for this parody of a parent oh my father doesnt know a thing about cricket he said but hes frightfully clever he writes books aboutdavid could not remember what they were abouthe writes books that are supposed to be jolly good he took a doublefirst at oxford too the archdeacon had seen his son and to davids great relief did not bowl any more but came towards him there were bad moments to follow for he kissed him in sight of the whole school at which ward looked delicately away also he had turned up the sleeves of his brown flannel shirt as if brown flannel was not bad enough and revealed the fact that below it he wore a longsleeved jaeger vest how hopelessly impossible that was words fail to convey nobody ever wore vests in the summer you had your coat waistcoat and shirt and then it was you it was fuggy to wear a vest in the summer unless you had a cold and everybody would see that he had a fuggy father and oh the idiocy of his attempting to bowl it was pure swank to try it for at home he never joined in his childrens games but here the deplorable habit of joining in the life of the place asserted itself the same habit made him when at the seaside talk knowingly to bewildered fishermen before whom he soon exposed his ignorance by mistaking a mackerel for a herring or when in switzerland in summer holidays to walk about the milder slopes of the alps with a climbers rope about his shoulders and a piece of edelweiss stuck into his shovelhat if he would only stick to the things at which he was frightfully clever and not go careering about in these amateur excursions presently the field was cleared for the match the home side won the toss and poor david who was going in fifth wicket endured the tortures of the lost his father sat next him on a bench in front of the pavilion still with his coat off and continued to enter into the life of the place by pouring forth torrents of the most dreadful conversation there were crowds of boys sitting and standing close round them every one could hear exactly what was being said and every one david made no doubt was saving it up for exact reproduction afterwards and virgil he said you wrote to me that you were reading the story of dido infandum regina jubesbut we must attend to the cricket mustnt we ha theres a fine hit well played sir well played indeed the fine hit in question was accomplished by stone to any one who knew the rudiments it was perfectly plain that he intended to drive the ball but mishitting it had snicked it off the edge of his bat through the slips where it should have been caught instead of which it went to the boundary four a fine four said the archdeacon enthusiastically ah butterfingers the wicketkeeper should have fielded that it was only being thrown in to the bowler said david ah but if the wicketkeeper had fielded it he might have stumped the batsman said his father knowingly suddenly and pleasantly recalling fragments of cricketlore long since forgotten the batsman was yards out of thethe popping crease quite without warning a small boy standing close behind where they sat burst into a bubble of irrepressible giggling and walked rapidly away cramming his handkerchief into his mouth otherwise just close round them was dead silence and attention and david looked in impotent exasperation at the rows of rapt faces and slightly quivering mouths knowing that this priceless conversation was being carefully stored up he was aware that his father was being gloriously funny that if it had been anybody elses father who was enunciating those views he would have listened with internal quiverings or like stephens would have found himself compelled to move away from politeness but agitated and nervous waiting for his innings he could see nothing funny about it wearily he explained that you could not be stumped off a hit to the boundary that you were given four runs without running for them but his father thought it an arguable point and argued two wickets fell in rapid succession after this and david began putting on his pads aunt eleanors five shillings had been spent in a lefthand glove and even at this dark and anxious moment it afforded him a gleam of consolation but the donning of these protective articles awoke further criticism why are you putting all those things on my boy asked the archdeacon you shouldnt be afraid of a knock or two why we never thought anything of a shooter on the shins when i was a lad and gloves surely you cant bat in gloves firm fixed smiles illuminated the faces of those round david had rubbed the second glove in so to speak rather profusely during this last week the school generally had heard a little too much about it but david was hearing a little too much about it now and a shooter on the shins how could a shooter hit your shins blazes pater was talking through his hat that very odd hat oh every one wears pads and gloves if theyve got them said david rather viciously well well i suppose we were rather too spartan for these days said his father ah well blocked well blocked sir things were going badly for the homeside four wickets had fallen for thirty and david was feeling colder and clammier every moment this was far the most important match of the year and he knew quite well that it largely lay on him to stem the tide of disaster he knew too even more keenly that he did not like the look of one of the bowlers in the very least the wicket was fiery and he was bumping in the most nerveshattering manner he himself was primarily a bowler but owing to the twentyfive runs he had made last week was put in fifth wicket instead of being reserved for the tail when the sting being taken out of the bowling he would have been quite likely to make runs but this morning the sting had not at all been taken out of the bowling it was still detestably steady and he saw in the agonised period of waiting for the next wicket to fall that he ought to play a careful game and wait for opportunities of scoring instead of running any risks on the other hand with his nerves in this condition he felt that nothing could give him confidence except one or two proper slogs with them duly accomplished he thought he could wipe off the paralysing effect of his fathers presence and conversation then came a shout of hows that from the field and stone was out caught at the wicket there were three more balls in that over to be delivered not by the bumping terror but by a slow bowler and as david walked out to the pitch he abandoned prudence and determined to hit out if possible at once and so get the confidence he needed he looked carefully round the field and stood to receive his first ball if he had been able to choose he would have selected no other ball than that it was a halfvolley clear of his offstump the very ball to smite at he did so and in the very moment of hitting he heard that he had mistimed it somehow or other he got right underneath it and it soared and soared almost straight up in the air as he ran he knew the feverish clapping of one pair of hands and his fathers voice shouting well hit well hit david then the ball was easily caught by coverpoint and david was sure that never till the end of his life would he be able to get over what had happened he was out first ball off a simple halfvolley in the match of the year everybody from jessop downwards would know and would despise him and it was the boy whose father had made fifty for england who had caught him it is falsely said that the serious troubles of life only begin when manhood is reached there was never anything so grotesquely untrue when manhood is reached on the contrary the apparently irremediable nature of most events almost ceases the man though bitterly disappointed in one direction has the power of seeing that there are other directions he knows also that though he is acutely unhappy at the moment his misery will be alleviated not only by his own efforts but by the mere passage of time but to any boy whose keenness and enthusiasm promises well for the future no such alleviation is possible he has no knowledge of the healing power of time in these crucial years no realisation that other opportunities will come his misery like his happiness is exclusive of all other considerations the moment to david was completely horrible he was out on this monumental occasion without scoring while his hopeless father though with no sarcastic intention had shouted well hit david and there was this added sting in that simple phrase that now every boy in the school would know what his christian name was for christian names at helmsworth were hidden secrets if you liked a boy very much you might tell him what your christian name was but to have it publicly shouted out so that every one knew was quite horrible and as he walked back to the pavilion the world contained no more for him than that he was out first ball and that his name was david all sorts of stories from the book of kings which most unfortunately was being read just now at morning chapel would be treasured up against him they would ask after jesse and as likely as not his stagbeetles would be known as bathsheba and uriah the innings of the homeside proceeded disastrously the whole team was out before lunch for seventytwo and eagles made twenty before the interval without loss of a wicket david at present had not been put on to bowl and was fielding deep near where the archdeacon was sitting talking to goggles and carrots who were apparently instructing him about the disposition of the field while the archdeacon in his manly way deplored the fact that the wicketkeeper wore gloves and pads also he thought that boundaries were an effeminate institution in his day everything had to be run out and a jolly lot of running you had to do thought david but with optimistic hospitality helmsworth hoped that lunch would worry the batsmen though helmsworth howling apparently did not and were assiduous in filling their visitors plates and glasses davids acquaintance of the morning who had made fifteen out of the twenty runs already scored proved himself as distinguished at table as he was at the wickets and ate lobstersalad in perfectly incredible quantities during the last fortnight friendship had prospered as david had thought probable between bags and himself and bags who did not so to speak know a bat from a ball and so was not called upon to defend the honour of helmsworth had a wise thought that day he had been of the group that had listened retentively to the archdeacons preposterous conversation and had seen davids inglorious and fruitless innings then came the wise thought it must be jolly difficult to play cricket if your pater is making an ass of himself and directly after lunch bags proceeded to tempt the pater away from the field he got hold of the key of chapel listened with sycophantic interest to legends about the saints in the windows and managed to inveigle him into a long stroll round the grounds there was something heroic about this for though bags could not play cricket he wanted to watch it and in especial to watch david for when he was nice he was in bagss unspoken phrase such an awfully fetching chap he had all that one boy admires in another he was quick and ready of laughter he was in the eleven which was an attraction he was very goodlooking which was another and in point of fact at that portentous moment when it was made matter of common knowledge that blaizes christian name was david bags would have rather liked it if some one had proclaimed that his own name was jonathan but as it was only george it might as well remain a secret now david was a bowler of the type known as wily in other words he bowled balls apparently so slow and stupid and devoid of all merit that a batsman who did not know quite all about them felt insulted and tried to do impossible things with them so the score having risen to thirty without the loss of a wicket stone said try an over this end blazes david had seen the departure of his father with bags from the field and felt enormously better another opportunity in a new direction had come and as he took up the ball his fingers tingled with possibilities he had a few practiceballs sauntering up to the crease and pitching them slow and high without any spin then epical matters began he took an enormous prancing run at top speed and delivered a ball of surpassing slowness ward who received it suspected there was something funny about it which there wasnt and as it was clearly off the wicket he left it alone the next one was a slow straight halfvolley which he very properly hit for four so also was the next with which he did likewise then came the wile davids fourth ball for which he did not take nearly so long a run was considerably faster than the other two ward completely mistimed it and was bowled off the last ball of his over a really fast one he caught and bowled the incomer this was better though still bad two wickets were down for thirtyeight whereas none had been down for thirty then ensued an hour of tiptop excitement at the end of which nine wickets were down for seventy of which david had taken seven as it was a onedays match it was to be decided on the first innings if there was not time for two and at that rosecoloured moment david was probably the most popular person in surrey it was his over again his first two balls each narrowly missed the wicket the third was gently spooned into his hands and he promptly dropped it the fourth was hit for four and eagles had won by one wicket with his next ball david captured the remaining wicket but he had already lost the match for them by dropping the easiest catch ever seen two exultant batsmen and eleven miserable fielders went towards the pavilion stone with spurious consolation slipped his arm into davids as they walked by jove well bowled blazes he said you took eight wickets for about thirty jolly good for your average oh blast my average said david as if i didnt know i lost the match davids comment was more in tune with the popular verdict than stones it was quite certain that helmsworth would have won had not that ass blazes david blazes dropped the pottiest catch ever seen exactly as in the world afterwards his achievement in having so nearly won the match for them by his bowling was entirely wiped out by his subsequent mistake criticism in fact had nothing to argue about it was all so clear and as tea was in progress in the tent bags and the archdeacon in a state of high animation appeared on the lurid scene they were instructed as to the result somebody caught you you couldnt catch him said davids father playfully yes just that said david wanting the earth to open he could have caught that ball with his eyes shut the archdeacon found himself next goggles who had told him that morning the difference between point and shortleg i have been seeing the chapelorgan he said my young friend crabtree tells me you will play tomorrow a noble instrument and now we have returned to see some more cricket i am afraid the blaize family have not helped you much today but tomorrow we will try again david is in the choir is he not one of us in the choir the other in the pulpit tea thank you a cup of tea after the excitement of the match would not be amiss david felt as if he was being publicly insulted though all that was really at fault was his fathers friendly adaptability he had been markedly interested in cricket when cricket was predominant but the excitement of that being over he transferred his mind to the next engrossing topic which was sunday when the blaize family would make another effort but he erred in not adapting himself to the age and outlook of those with whom he strove to identify himself and in thinking that it was possible for a boy in the school eleven who had nearly won and then quite lost the match for his side to treat a tragedy like that lightly or feel the smallest interest in pulpits or choirs an hour of cricket succeeded tea but since it was impossible to arrive at a finished second innings this was but a tepid performance and after the eagles eleven had been speeded with cheers in which davids father joined with wavings of his curious hat he turned to more serious concerns again and took david off for a stroll in the grounds to have a paternal talk to him there was comedy in some of these proceedings for when they had put a hundred yards or so between them and the cricketfield the archdeacon took out a cigarettecase i should not like to be seen smoking he said by any of your companions but i think we are unobserved now david nearly laughed but managed not to as luck would have it his father had stopped on the very spot which was sacred to the meetings of the smoking club the head smokes he said encouragingly he saw too that his fathers brand of cigarettes was that preferred by the smoking club then ensued the serious talk cricket was commended in moderation but as an amusement only not as an end in itself davids schoolwork was gone into and he gave again the information he had put into his sunday letter a few weeks ago then it appeared his father had heard a boy swear as he watched the cricketmatch and hoped that such a thing was a rare if not a unique occurrence and david with the barrier of age rising swiftly and impregnably between them hoped so too transitionally noticing the blue of the july sky the true meaning of the latin word caeruleus was debated and david cordially agreed that it probably meant grey and not blue then his prayers were touched on which as a rule were not very fervent performances this morning however he had said one prayer with extreme earnestness to the effect that helmsworth should win the cricketmatch which they had just lost and david after the views that had been expressed on the subject of cricket felt it better not to give details on this subject take it altogether the talk was hardly a success davids father feeling that the boy was not being open with him which was perfectly true and david feeling that his father didnt understand anything at all about him this happened to be true also at any rate his father had no conception of what it felt like to be thirteen any more than david had any conception of what it felt like to be fortyfive then came the one bright spot the head is very well satisfied with you said his father as they turned instantly davids eye brightened oh is he really he asked how awfully ripping even after he stopped knowing that his father would not understand even after what said he david blushed oh it was nothing he said i only was going to say after missing that catch butbut i suppose he would think that didnt matter though of course hes awfully keen for the school to win the eagles match he left his father at the heads house and walked back across the field to the museum classroom where he was already late for preparation as the lockup bell had sounded ten minutes before he knew quite well that his father was fond of him and was anxious about his wellbeing but somehow the serious talks froze him up and he could not feel all the things he knew he was expected to feel it was so odd not knowing that fellows swore when they jammed their fingers in doors or were suddenly annoyed at anything probably grownup people did not but that was because they were grownup he was afraid it was a distinct relief that the jaw was over and on the top of that in a way that he did not understand he was sorry he was glad and then suddenly he swept all those puzzling regrets off his mind and he became alertly and absolutely thirteen again walking across the field towards him came mr dutton who on his approach as davids extremely observant eye noted put something in his coatpocket in an interesting and furtive manner without doubt he had been smoking his pipe as he came from commonroom a thing which all the school knew was forbidden to masters in the school precincts for fear of the bad example to the boys this was interesting it might lead to something and david knowing that the fact that he had been walking with his father neutralised all possible penalties for being late for lockup advanced timidly as if he thought he was detected in some breach of rules mr dutton had just come out of meattea with the other masters and was feeling autocratic he called david in a peremptory and abrupt manner come here blaize he said now mr dutton was not at all a nice young man and his unpopularity in the school was perfectly justified he had favourites usually pink pretty little boys whose misdoings he treated with leniency while those who were not distinguished with his regard he visited with the hundred petty tyrannies which his mastership gave him the opportunity of exercising he also had an effective trick of sarcastic speech which is an unfair weapon to employ to those who are not in a position to answer back and of all those under his charge there was none whom he so cordially disliked as david who returned the aversion with uncommon heartiness mr dutton was often not quite sure whether david under a polite demeanour was not cheeking him though he need not have had any doubt whatever on the matter and he was also aware that all the impositions which he set the boy did not make him in the least an object of reverence however in a small way he could make himself burdensome its after lockup blaize he said what are you doing out only walking about sir said david did you know it was after lockup david looked guilty and shifted from one foot to another yees sir he said then you will write out two hundred lines of the fourth neid and bring them to me on monday evening i suppose you thought that your heroic performance today that splendid innings of yours which came to an end a little prematurely perhaps and the wonderful catch you so nearly held entitled you to place yourself above schoolrules this was excellent duttonese cutting and insulting and impossible to answer without risk of further penalties for insolence for the moment davids face went crimson with anger and mr dutton rejoiced in his mean heart and proceeded to pile up irony he had forgotten the pipe in his pocket the smoke of which curled thinly up but david had not forgotten it nor did he fail to see that the head was coming up across the field towards them with his swift rocking motion and a vengeance of a singularly pleasant kind suggested itself to him had not dubs made himself so gratuitously offensive he would not have dreamed of taking it if he had even only stopped there he might not have done so but the disgusting dubs intoxicated with his own eloquence and rejoicing to see david writhing under it did not stop it was a grand day for you was it not proceeded this odious man with your father to look on and call out well played blaizei beg your pardon well played david and to finish with being late for lockup is a fine achievement the head was close to them now coming up silently on the grass behind mr dutton at a few yards distance he joined in the colloquy what is all this what is all this he inquired mr dutton turned blaize is late for lockup he said i have just set him two hundred lines well blaize said the head david shook off the guilty slouch and stood erect and confident please sir i was walking with my father he said mr dutton didnt ask me to explain as he went on about my being out first ball and missing that catch you have only just left your father asked the head yes sir two minutes ago the head nodded we will remit that imposition he observed then david suddenly stared at that which he had been secretly glancing at namely the whorl of smoke from mr duttons pocket please sir youre burning he said anxiously pointing at it something is burning in your pocket the head transferred his awful eye to mr dutton and sniffed with his omniscient nose you may go blaize he said well mr dutton david scuttled off scored off you cad he said to himself still hot with indignation at these insults but as david had expected there were far worse things to be faced than the sarcasms of mr dutton since the conclusion of the match davids performances heavily handicapped by those of his father had been subjected to serious debate and had been found to be wholly unsatisfactory it was true that he had captured a quantity of eagles wickets at small cost but with the match in his hands literally in his hands he had let it go taking his record as a whole therefore his futile innings being also brought under scrutiny it was fair to make unkind allusions to his father there were dissentients from the general view the chief of whom was bags who said hotly that it was a chouse to rag blazes considering that if it hadnt been for him eagles would probably have won by eight wickets instead of one for who stood the slightest chance of getting out the fellow whose father had made fifty for england even weighted as he was with salad of many lobsters but this view was that of a small minority and an untrustworthy sort of hush settled down on the firstform classroom as david entered with simulated composure no master was in charge during this hour of preparation on saturday evening and though every boy had to sit at his desk talking was allowed sometimes a sort of patrolmaster visited them and occasionally for a pleasant surprise the head came round the knowledge of which possibility checked any exuberance but provided that no row was made there was nothing to be feared so there was an uncomfortable silence when david entered the sarcastic intention of which was not lost on him for there was no mistaking the chilliness of his reception bags it is true greeted him with a hullo blazes but otherwise nothing was said then trouble gently began to accumulate like the quiet piling up of thunderclouds with old testament allusions i say jesse must have been a fine old chap said somebody he had such lots of sons oh did he asked somebody else politely how many bout ten but the elder ones didnt seem to matter much there was a dead silence and david gathered himself up within himself then conversation began again with rustling of the leaves of bibles to refresh memories i suppose jesse was a jew oh rather thats why bags is so keen about his kids i say its sausages tomorrow isnt it yes bags and jesse and the kids wont have any breakfast bad luck david looked up and caught bagss mild eye which was gleaming with sympathetic martyrdom then the attack became more direct i say dai mean blazesi hope you had a good blowout tonight david had got a certain fightinglight in his eye which bags altogether lacked he replied briskly yes thanks he said but why oh i didnt know as there are sausages for breakfast and a subdued giggle went round david opened the lid of his desk i say mullins he remarked to the last speaker if you dont know youd better find out ill ask you about it when we go up to dormitory right oh said mullins strong in the consciousness of numbers to back him but lots of chaps will tell you then ill ask them all said david two at a time if they funk his heart quaked but the essence of courage is not that your heart should not quake but that nobody else should know that it does jesse had younger sons as well said somebody else while mullins was thinking about this there was one who was ruddy i should think it was beastly to be ruddy oh yes he was an awful corker and kept sheep dont suppose he could keep wickets or anything like that probably he couldnt hold the simplest catch either but i expect he could spoon them up himself all right old jesse would like that he would probably say well played i say what was the name of the kid asked a voice in tones of the intensest interest david had been rummaging in his desk in a meaningless manner not in order to find anything but to have something to do to cover his selfconsciousness but when this direct question was asked his hand closed firmly on a tight solid classical dictionary and he waited for the answer i think he was called david said mullins who had plucked up again after davids threat which had silenced him for the time yes david i think he repeated oh do you said david and before mullins had time to guard the classical dictionary discharged with low trajectory hit him violently on the nose which proceeded to bleed and if anybody else wants to talk about david thats what hell get chuck it up here bags bags gave a shriek of exultation as he returned the dictionary jolly good shot he said bang on the proboscis though david had followed that excellent maxim of war if in an inferior position attack he probably would have thought twice had he not completely lost his temper before attacking for almost everybody but bags seemed to have coalesced against him and he was taking on rather a large order but the very suddenness and savageness of the attack certainly surprised the hosts of the enemy for a moment and the gorestreaked mullins retired to comfort his nose amid dead silence but davids cause was an unpopular one and he knew it the eagles match was won except for him and no one was levelheaded enough to reflect that it would have been much more decisively lost without him under the circumstances though he had silenced mullins altogether for mullins certainly would not want to be hurt again and david in his present mood did not care two straws whether he himself was hurt or not he knew that he must expect a disagreeable evening david would have supplied that night an excellent concrete example to any philosopher who wished to study the unstable nature of popularity during that exquisite hour when he was tying up and confusing the eagles side with his wily bowling there was no bounds to his popularity and in one moment by the insufficient closing of his hand he had forfeited it all bags alone was faithful and though that shot with the classical dictionary had silenced one of his tormentors it had been a great mistake for any one who had lost the match so palpably as he had done must expect to have sarcastic remarks made and if david had only taken them with the meekness that their justice demanded there would probably soon have been a truce to his punishment but meekness unfortunately was one of those christian qualities which he was totally devoid of and though his summary hardcornered answer to mullins had been successful enough he found that even if it had been possible to continue making violent assaults on everybody he had not the heart to do so so chilly and dispiriting was the general attitude towards him stone for instance though he had congratulated david on his bowling directly after the match was swayed by popular feeling and when on going up to dormitory david offered him one of his supper biscuits which was highly sought after stone said no thanks in a tone that would have chilled a salamander no one definitely cut him and there were no more direct allusions to the son of jesse for the portent of mullinss nose was a dangersignal which it would have been folly to disregard but if he spoke he was answered in polite monosyllables and if he joined a chattering group the chatter ceased until he went away again no one but bags came to sit on his bed and though he made pretence of being particularly communicative and cheerful he jested with a hollow heart next morning was sunday and in lieu of early school the boys were allowed to spend the hour before breakfast at the bathingplace but when david asked stone to come and bathe with him stone replied that he was engaged to mullins and it was bitter to see ferrers lend mullins his towel though after he had finished with it himself and find that mullins fat stupid mullins was regarded not only as an injured person which anybody could see who looked at his face but an unjustly injured person and in the middle of davids bathe who should appear but the archdeacon himself it is true that he went to the far end of the bathingplace which was known as the masters bathingplace where the head himself sometimes swam fiercely about but the stout apparition of his father clad in a striped jersey cut off at the knees and shoulders standing on the headerboard was a distracting affair even the loyal bags who had followed david down to keep him company for bags was not allowed to bathe having a weak heart even bags gazed in dismay at that squat square form and said lor simultaneously somebody behind david remarked anyhow he takes his gaiters off david felt too desolate to resent this also he was watching his father almost praying that he should take a neat header but a loud flat smack was heard as he fell into the water and ferrers said to mullins i say can your pater take bellyfloppers then mullins with a watchful eye on david as he dried himself with ferrerss towel began to whistle once in royal davids city other boys began to whistle it too it was all deplorable the day had begun badly and continued badly david offered to share his hymnbook with the boy who sat next him in chapel who appeared not to see what he did he asked stone to come for a walk with him after chapel and again stone was engaged to mullins but all the time bags was waiting like a dog to divert and console his master if only his master would allow him eagerly braving the unpleasantness of alliance with the unpopular side and though twentyfour hours ago david would have scouted the idea of bags consoling him he turned to him eagerly now and even allowed him to have the monarchs travellingcarriage in his pocket at dinner and though all the slights and sneers which surrounded them were of the general nature of chaff they were of the species of chaff which is meant to hurt as bags had once acutely remarked you can hit a fellow over the head just to show you like him but you can do the very same thing in an opposite spirit and it was this spirit just now that animated these small boys it was a rag no doubt but a rag with a sting in it for david was paying the penalty of having been popular as well as of having disappointed his admirers but an eye wholly unsuspected was watching the situation the head was perfectly aware that david had lost the match against eagles though he had so nearly won it he was aware also what manner of impression davids father would make on his irreverent school and when all day he saw david no longer the centre of groups that were making rather more noise than was necessary but either alone or with bags he took counsel with himself and stroked his grey beard for several minutes then he went across to the museum where the first form were sitting under mr dutton about the time that the catechism would be finished and the third missionary journey embarked on there having excused mr dutton he suddenly addressed david blaize he said though it is sunday and we are in school i must just congratulate you on your bowling performance yesterday i have watched a good deal of cricket at helmsworth for the last twenty years and it was by far the finest piece of bowling i can remember the school ought to be proud of you now for our work antioch stone where is antioch there was no getting round this stone ferrers david and bags walked arminarm to chapel together and mullinss nose suddenly became the subject of unkind and universal comment chapter v david returned from the station on monday morning where he had been permitted to go in order to see his father off in extremely good spirits with his straw hat trimmed with the school eleven colours well back on his head his hands in his pockets where one caressed five distinct shillings the other the travellingcarriage of the monarch while fragments of cheerful tunes came piercingly forth from the aperture caused by his broken tooth the shape of this orifice no doubt had something to do with the deafening quality of his whistle which went through the head of the hearer like the chirping of a canary in a circumscribed room and when deeds of infamy such as illicit feasts were going on in the bushes at the far end of the secondclub field he was often suitably bribed to keep watch at the railings nearest the school buildings for his whistle carried that distance quite easily there was therefore when his melodies were heard time to remove all traces of debauch before dubs or any other incarnation of danger could arrive so desirable indeed was the gift of a really resonant whistle that ferrers had at one time begun operations on one of his own front teeth with the file on his nailscissors in order to get a similar configuration but increasing tenderness had made him desist before he had got far david was conscious of a great many things that made for cheerfulness his father to begin with had put himself gloriously right with the school and had very wisely left in the hour of supreme popularity so that there was no fear of his forfeiting by gaiters or christian names or flat headers at the bathingplace or any such tragic follies the esteem he had won for greatly daring as it seemed to the boys he had asked the head to grant an extra halfholiday and the announcement that it would be given this afternoon in honour of his visit had duly appeared on the school noticeboard it was supposed by some one who had seen his flat header that the phrase in honour of his visit must mark a sarcastic intention on the part of the head but whether that was so or not there was no doubt about the halfholiday which was all that mattered even david when quite respectfully appealed to had no clear idea as to why his fathers visit was an honour but supposed it must have something to do with the books he wrote which were printed by the clarendon press at oxford in any case he felt quite certain now that all the errors of which his father had been guilty would be pardoned and forgotten and that he would never hear any more of his hat or his gaiters of his excruciating performance at the cricketnets of his bellyfloppers into the bathingplace of his betrayal of his own sons christian name or finally of the disastrous discourse he had unfortunately delivered at schoolchapel on sunday evening for the moment as he remembered that davids whistle ceased and he clutched at the five shillings and the monarchs travellingcarriage for comfort it had been too awful not only had he talked the most dreadful rot about the joy and peace of the chapel services same as last year only worse under the influence of which all troubles and anxiety melted away but he had gone on and on and on in a manner quite unparalleled for forty stricken minutes he had detained them stone said fortytwo which beat all known records by at least nine minutes and it was no wonder that the boy next david had written and now in capital letters on the flyleaf of his hymnbook and passed it to him but that was all over he had made the most honourable amends and david knew that his father would be considered a credit to him indeed that he was a firstrate old buffer was quite a moderate estimate of him and one given by the most critical there were other satisfactory points about him also he had asked that david should be allowed to see him off at the station so that he could have a further talk with him this meant missing half an hour or more if he lingered on his way back as he was doing of repetition of latin prose david had not been certain at starting that he would not sooner do prose repetition than have more jaw but the jaw when it came was of the most delightful kind not only was he certainly to go to marchester in september but after consultation with the head it had been settled that he was to go there next week to try for one of the scholarships a wholly lovely adventure apparentlythis was news to davidhis work had shown great improvement during this last term it showed signs of perception and taste and though greatly wanting in accuracy which the archdeacon reminded him could always be attained by the industrious and painstaking it might prove up to scholarshiplevel david did not attend much to these generalities the point was that he would go to marchester for a threedays examination next week finally as a cause of happiness his father had on the platform presented him with the five shillings that now he clutched in his pocket to commemorate his having got into the school eleven that presentation had been so sheer a surprise that david could have fallen flat on his face with astonishment he would have expected if the fatal topic of cricket was to occur again to be reminded that it was only a game and to be bidden to take thought of it just as such and no more but to be tipped on such a scale had not entered into his most sanguine calculations then the train had come in and david submitted to be kissed publicly without shying even though a small vendor of papers with whom he had slight differences before this ceased shouting dily mile and squeaked kiss me ducky in perfectly audible tones he could be dealt with after the train had gone so his father waved his shovelhat from the window and david his straw hat from the platform after which he twitched off the paper vendors cap and rubbed his face upwards with it and hit him on the hands so that he dropped all his papers and strolled back to school again in the highest spirits and not only were his spirits high but for the first time in his life he was conscious of how happy he was instead of just being happy this morning he seemed to stand away from himself and envy the boy only it was himself who was going to try for a marchester scholarship next week and was certainly going there in september and had five shillings and two stagbeetles in his pocket and was in the school eleven child though he was consciousness of self had come to him he knew that his head was full of delightful plans that his limbs were taut and strong that he was set in the enchanted garden of the world he said by gosh and saluted the discovery by kicking an empty tobaccotin that lay in the road with such firm accuracy that it flew with a whirring gonglike sound over the fence of the house where the assistant masters of the school lodged and david thought it wise to go swiftly away and not look behind he dropped to a sober pace again after putting a corner between himself and the masters house into the garden of which the empty tin had so pleasantly flown and from mere happiness made a quantity of good resolutions one of which he immediately put into effect by not going into the tobaccoshop where he had originally intended to buy a packet of cigarettes as a present for the smoking club just now the solid satisfaction of life rendered unnecessary such minor adjuncts and since he did not like smoking it was convenient that it happened to be contrary to school rules there were such hosts of things pleasant and not against school rules that he wished by way of a thankoffering for them to resolve on a virtuous life he really would get up at the sound of the first bell in the morning for the future he would not smoke any more he would not look up the answers to sums before he wrestled with them nor copy out on his shirtcuff the principal rivers of russia they were there now in fact and in this sudden access of being good because he was happy he stopped then and there and with a piece of indiarubber expunged the volga and the vistula and the don and the dnieper and as if to reward him just as he got to the schoolgate eleven oclock sounded which meant that latin prose repetition was over and since today was a halfholiday there was only one more hour of school and that was english literature the one lesson of the week which he actively enjoyed and though the head usually took it was not in the least terrifying he asked but few questions or sometimes there were no questions at all but he would read to them a poem with explanations of difficult words or sentences so that any one could understand it and then perhaps shut the book and repeat it very slowly in his deep smooth voice so that the magic of beautiful words wove its spell round davids wondering mind today on his way to the museum just as david passed the long french windows of the heads study he stepped out and called him so youve seen your father off blaize he asked yes sir thank you sir said david beaming ah well well take a little stroll across the field you and i before we begin our english literature it was one of those days when rhadamanthus unbent when the man who could be so terrible became wholly enchanting a man not to fear but to love these days were not common but when they came they were golden and now that tremendous person who had been a rowingblue at oxford who was the incarnation of fate and retribution laid his arm over davids shoulder and put aside his terrors i had a long talk to your father david he said no no one can hear me call you david dont be alarmed and no doubt he has told you part of what we said that you are to go up for a scholarship at marchester next week do your best wont you and be a credit not to me which doesnt matter so much but to yourself and i told your father i was proud of you and i meant it you and i have had what they call words before now havent we in fact im afraid that sometimes it has come to blows you have often been most unsatisfactory idle and careless and disobedient i dare say theres not a single school rule that you havent broken but i told your father that i had never found you mean nor bestial i look upon you as a boy i can trust davids young skin flushed with pleasure and then went white again with a resolution that frightened himself iive done lots of things you dont know about sir he said i dont think its right you should think me goodive the head stopped and davids heart sank into his boots what an ass he had been to say that why not have received this handsome tribute however undeserved without disturbing the misplaced faith that prompted it and yet he knew that he had done it deliberately and because he had to do you wish to tell me about them asked the head but his voice was still quiet and kind david seemed to himself to be going mad he just heard his voice in a quaking whisper say yes sir well then david i dont want to hear about them said this astounding man though i thank you for wishing to tell me i feel sure you have broken rules of school often enough but i dont think you have broken rules of character they are much more important though school rules have got to be kept as well suddenly his grip on davids shoulder tightened and his eye fixed itself on the back of a small boy who was sitting on the wire railing at the edge of the field unconscious of their approach ferrers minor i think he called out in an awful voice the head thought right and ferrers minor presented his startled and dejected countenance did you or did you not know the rule about sitting on the railings demanded the head yes sir said ferrers minor then this is wilful disobedience thundered the head i will not be bullied by you ferrers minor nor have you disregard the rules with which you are perfectly well acquainted i suppose you wish to make a fool of me to hold me up to ridicule for having the impertinence to frame rules which mr ferrers minor keeps or not as he finds convenient was that your plan nno sir said ferrers minor then i will make a plan for you instead and it is that you write out in your best copyhand i will not sit on the railings like an ass a hundred times you may go ferrers minor but rhadamanthus the inexorable terror had only mounted his judgment throne for a moment and came down off it again his grip relaxed and he patted davids shoulder and now for our literature lesson he said its too hot to hold it in the museum isnt it blaize when we can sit under the trees instead lets have it out here go in will you and tell the class to come out and personally i shall take my coat off and anybody else who likes to do the same of course may the boys trooped out at davids summons peeling off their coats and grouped themselves in the shade of the four big elms that stood in a quadrilateral clump at the edge of the field the head had taken off his coat and leaning on his elbows lay on that part of his person which in ordinary mortals is called the stomach with a book or two in front of him all comfortably settled he said thats all right now today im going to talk to you about a man whom very likely you have never heard of and read you something he wrote his name was keats john keats has anybody heard of him nobody had he was a chemists assistant said the head and if some ninety or a years ago you stone or you blaize had gone into a doctors little dispensary near hampstead to get a dose because you had a pain in your inside from eating too many strawberries or from having shirked into richmond and devoured more than a sufficiency of maids of honour you might have had your medicine given you by one of the greatest lyrical poets who ever lived the doctors assistant a pale young man with a bad cough might perhaps have mixed it for you and if you were wide awake you might have seen that when he got up to give you your pill or your powder he laid down a pencil and a piece of paper on which he was scribbling stone if you leave that wasp alone he will not get angry and sting you or lose his head and think it was me who was annoying him yes and then when you had paid your twopence and gone away with your pill you may be sure he would have taken up his pencil and paper again no doubt if you had asked him he would have copied out for you what he was writing on another piece of paper in which he was accustomed to wrap up parcels and wondered that you cared to pay another twopence for it but if you sold that piece of paper today you would get not twopence but hundreds of pounds for it for on it would be written lines by john keats in his own hand and what you might have found on that piece of paper is this my heart aches and a drowsy numbness pains my sense as though of hemlock i had drunk or emptied some dull opiate to the drains a minute since and lethe wards have sunk lethe we had in our homer not long ago lethe the water of forgetfulness sometimes i think blaize and others of you have drunk it tis not through envy of thy happy lot but being too happy in thy happiness that thou lightwingd dryad of the trees in some melodious plot of beechen green and shadows numberless dreamest of summer in fullthroated ease he read on occasionally stopping to explain a word once and again his voice trembled as it did sometimes when he preached once it nearly stopped altogether as he came to the lines perhaps the selfsame song that found a path through the sad heart of ruth when sick for home she stood in tears amid the alien corn in tears amid the alien corn he repeated the entire informality of these proceedings the absence of the sense that they were being taught and had got to learn disarmed the boys and before this stanza was reached the fact that it was the portentous head who was reading to them had quite vanished they were all sitting or lying about at ease on the grass one or two of them listening intently the others for the most part feeling just lazy and soothed and comfortable but among the intent listeners was david and as the head paused and repeated alien corn he rolled over on to his back absorbed and lost golly he said quietly to himself oh golly then he became aware that he had spoken aloud but scarcely wondered whether the head had heard or not so completely did the magic of the words possess him and in some mysterious way they added to his store of happiness they became part of him and thus part of the fact that he was going to marchester next week and would see hughes that there was a halfholiday this afternoon that he was in the eleven keatss poem was part of the whole joy of life it and its music and the sense of longing for something he did not know about which it produced in him then his attention was completely diverted by the feeling of a slight vibration in his trouserpocket caused by the movements of the monarch and his wife who were there in their travellingcarriage and now that he recollected them became part of the beneficent joy of things in general so for fear of their not getting their proper share of the oxygen of the world he withdrew the box from his pocket laid it on the grass and forgot about them again in hearing of the foam of perilous seas the head finished the ode and invited questions stone wanted to know what hippocrene was thinking this an intelligent question but ferrerss inquiry as to what the magic casements were earned stronger approbation from the head who mysteriously told him that no one could tell till they looked out on to the perilous seas it was not like the commentaries of julius csar this which he had read them because it could mean different things to different people each sentence of the commentaries meant one thing and it was the business of boys to find out with the aid of a dictionary what it was but music and poetry were altogether different they meant to you what you were capable of finding in them then he turned to david who alone of the class had not asked any questions intelligent or otherwise nothing you want to know blaize he asked no thank you sir said david but would you read it us again sir as you do sometimes the head sat up clasping his knees with his arms and without answering david began the ode again in that extraordinary voice of his this time not looking at his book he began in tones so low that it needed an effort to hear him it boomed out over charioted by bacchus and his pards it sounded like a breeze at night in the stanza i cannot see what flowers are at my feet again it shook with emotion over the sad heart of ruth and david felt a lump rise in his throat a mysteriously blissful misery took possession of him and when the head finished he found himself smiling at him with mouth that trembled a little there was silence a moment that will do for today said the head you can go the group rose from the grass with alacrity for though keats was all very well an extra halfhour at the bathingplace for the lesson had been very short was even better but in spite of the permission david lingered did he write much else sir he said the head handed him the volume you may see for yourself he said give it me back when youve finished with it david deposited this in his desk in the museum and then ran after the others to the bathingplace with lines still ringing in his head but untying and unbuttoning as he went so as to lose as few seconds as possible before the first heavenly plunge out of the heat and baking sunlight into the cool arms of the water that too on this morning of vivid life was more consciously delicious than ever before when with a long run he sprang an arrow of gleaming limbs off the headerboard which he left vibrating with his leap and burrowed into the cool embrace of the water some flower must have opened in his brain today quickening his sense of living and though no whit less boyish than before he was far more conscious of the water and the sun and above all of himself he swam and floated and dived came swiftly up behind stone who swam in rather a waterlogged manner and with a firm hand placed suddenly on the top of his head sent him down to the bottom of the bath and before he came up again spluttering and more waterlogged than ever was floating with arms and legs spread starfish fashion gazing serenely and unconsciously into the sky stone concluded mistakenly that it was ferrers who had done this thing and raised a storm of splashing in his indignant face and got ducked again for that and so precisely flicked with a wet towel when he came out that he cried on the name of his maker and danced with the shrewdness of the touch upon which david forgetting that his mouth was submerged laughed and thereon swallowed so much water that he had to come out and lie face downwards on the grass in order to disgorge it that was pleasant also and he lay there on the grass with his forehead on his arms till his back was dry and baked then making a compact parcel of himself with his hands clasped round his ankles two friends lifted him and swung him into the water again bags the unbathed had brought down some strawberries and newly baked buns and david having filled himself up with those things took to the water again in spite of ferrerss warning that if you bathed directly after a heavy meal you got cramp in your stomach and sank like a stone to rise no more it was necessary to test the truth of this remarkable legend and it was found to be wholly untrustworthy and all the time the magic casements and the alien corn wandered fragmentarily in his head the first eleven played the next sixteen that afternoon and still that happy tide of the consciousness of life and the beautiful jolly things of life bore david along he made a catch of an unparalleled order off his own bowling from a hit so smart that he had only meant to put up his hands to protect his face and the ball stuck in them to his great surprise and hurt more than anything had ever hurt subsequently he made thirty runs after being missed three times which added zest to the performance and took the heads volume of keats up to bed with him but glanders being ill and the dormitory unpatrolled he had a wonderful pillowfight with bags instead of reading and did not as his custom was go instantly to sleep when at length he got into bed instead he lay in a lump with his hands round his knees saying jolly happy jolly jolly happy by gad fairy lands forlorn fairy lands forlorn gosh how that catch hurt but what frightful sport marchester next week too five bob and these images lost their outline and became blurred with the approach of sleep one of the housemasters at marchester was an old friend of the archdeacon and it had been arranged that david should stay with mr adams when he went up for his scholarship examination hughes davids great chum of a year ago was in adamss house and by permission met him at the station and after the first greetings looked david over with an eye made critical by the adamantine traditions that bind junior boys at public schools hughes was extremely glad to see him but he had certainly been very anxious to get an early and private view of him to see if he came up to the standards and ordinances then prevailing and make such corrections in his bearing and attire as were necessary it would be an awful thing for instance if david turned up in a straw hat with his school eleven colours as those were identical with the rugby fifteen colours at marchester and to be seen walking about with a small alien boy in fifteen colours was a nightmare possibility but there was a lot as he saw at once to be said in davids favour his clothes were neat he looked exceedingly clean not grubby a thing which hughes from his faded reminiscences of helmsworth was dismally afraid of his hair was short behind and well inside his collar and he stood straight on the other hand there were certain details that must be altered i say have you been travelling in a smoker he asked second too david wished he had spent his last shilling in going first yes first was so frightfully expensive said david oh i didnt mean that all the fellows go third yes the bus will take your luggage up and well walk shall we itll take the fug of the smokingcarriage out of your clothes david marvelled at this he had thought a smokingcarriage must be the manly thing he had a packet of cigarettes also in his coatpocket dont fellows smoke here he asked looking up in timid admiration at hughes who had grown enormously oh yes in some scuggy houses he said but not in adamss its thought frightfully bad form in adamss david fingered his packet of cigarettes nervously conscious suddenly of the enormous gulf that yawned between a private and a public school and yearning to bridge it over by every means in his power ive got some cigarettes in my pocket he said oh chuck them away said his friend or give them to a porter it would be a rotten affair if any of the fellows in the house knew youd come here with a bad name davids face fell for a moment for those were goldtipped cigarettes which he had thought would probably be so exceedingly the right thing hughes noticed this and gave consolation for really blaize was extremely presentable i say blazes he said im awfully glad to see you and well have a ripping time but its best to tell you whats the right thing and what isnt dont you think david responded cordially to this rather he said and its jolly good of you thanks awfully do tell me if theres anything else hughes gave him another critical glance as solemn as a tailors when looking at the fit of a coat that he wants to be a credit to him oh well that buttonhole he said i think i should take that out only tremendous swells wear them and even then its rather side david instantly plucked out the offending vegetable he probably would have torn out a handful of his hair if crisp yellow locks showed side hughes nodded at him approvingly now youre firstrate he said oh just send your stick up with your luggage now come on you look just as if you were at marchester already you see i got leave for you to come and brewhave tea you knowin my study this afternoon and it would have been beastly for both of us if you werent up to adamss form and it turned out that you smoked or kept white mice or something hopeless the two handsome boys went on their way up to the mecca of davids aspirations and he thought with the deepest relief of his decision not to bring the monarch and his wife with him it had been a wrench to part with them even for a few days and an anxiety to leave them even in the care of the assiduous bags to whom he had given a paper of directions about diet and fresh air but if it was hopeless to keep white mice how much more dire would have been his position if he had been found possessed of stagbeetles or if as might easily have happened without this oblique warning he had incidentally mentioned to some of hughess friends that his tastes lay in those verminous directions and hughes proceeded inspired by that authoritative conventionality which public schools so teach that every wellbred junior boy of fifteen or sixteen in any house is in characteristics of behaviour exactly like every other at one time buttonholes and smoking are de rigueur at another they are quite impossible at one time it is the fashion to be industrious and every one works at another to be as idle as is possible morals are subject to the same strict but changeable etiquette for years perhaps the most admirable tone characterises a house then another code obtains and satan himself might be staggered at the result jove it was a good thing i came to the station he said and i wanted to too else you might have appeared with a stick and a buttonhole and a cigarette and a slowworm for all i knew do you remember we had a slowworm you and i at helmsworth of course some fellows go in for natural history and maddox whos the head of our house collects butterflies but then hes such a swell he can do just what he likes im his fag you know and hes awfully jolly to me damned hot it is lets walk slower david was extremely quick at picking up an atmosphere and he made the perfectly correct conclusion that though smoking was bad form swearing was not but the mention of maddox roused the thrill and glamour of heroworshipa heroworship more complete and entire than is ever accorded by the world of grownup men and women to their most august idols oh go on tell me about maddox he said i dare say youll see him sure to in fact hes not very tall but hes damned goodlooking hes far the finest bat in the eleven and the funny thing is he says crickets rather a waste of time and hardly ever goes up to a net hes editor of the schoolpaper and played racquets for us at queens last year but what he likes best of all is reading thats queer said david tis rather he makes all our juniors work too i can tell you but hell help anybody and hell always give you a construe of a bit you dont understand if youve looked out all the words first and hes only just seventeen think of that so that hell have two more years here he never plays footer though he can run like hell and says rugby is a barbarous sport and in the winter when hes not playing racquets he just reads and reads his mother was french too rum thing that and the point is that h t thats hairy toe an awful ass who teaches french is english and maddox knows about twice as much as he he makes awful howlers maddox says and pronounces just as if he was a cad but thats all right because he is david skipped with uncontrollable emotion oh i say how ripping he said but i wish maddox liked cricket and footer well footer he detests but he only means that thinking of nothing but cricket is a waste of time by the way youre in luck theres a twodays match begins tomorrow against barnards team fridays a whole holiday some frowsy saint they say jessops coming wouldnt it be sport to see him hit a dozen sixes and then be cleanbowled by cruikshank oh and whos cruikshank asked david well thats damned funny not to have heard of cruikshank fastest bowler weve ever had and hes in adamss too he and maddox dont get on a bit though of course theyre awfully polite to each other cruikshanks awfully pi fit to burst here we are hughes again cast an anxious eye over david for the moment was momentous as the whole school would be about but he really felt that david would do him credit they paused a moment in the gateway if you like well stroll round the court he said before we go down to house theres chapel you see and hall next beyond it foul place stinks of mutton then two more college boardinghouseswhat but which is adamss asked david oh thats not here these are all college houses inboarders and rather scuggy compared to outboarders then theres fifth form classroom and sixth form classroom and school library up on top i dare say maddox is there now big school behind more classrooms and then the fivescourt like to walk through no devout catholic ever went to rome in more heartfelt pilgrimage than was this to david it was the temple of his religion that he saw the public school which was to be his home his horizon and aspirations stretched no farther than this redbrick arena for to the eyes of the thirteenyearold those who have finished with their public school and have gone out from it to the middleaged universities are already past their prime they are old they are done with unless the fact that they play cricket for oxford or cambridge gives them a little longer lease of immortality but to be a great man a maddox or a cruikshank in this theatre of life which already his feet trod was the utmost dream of davids ambitions and if at the hoary age of eighteen he could only have played a real part in the life of the scenes that were now unrolling to him he felt that an honoured grave would be the natural conclusion everything that might happen after public school was over seemed a posthumous sort of affair you were old after that and at this moment even the head for all his terror and glamour appeared a tomblike creature hughes exchanged hullo with a friend or two and said right halfpast four to one of them which made david long to know what heroic thing was to happen then and took him past the east end of chapel without further comment david quickly and quite mistakenly drew a conclusion based on his private school experience i suppose chapels pretty good rot he said this was worse than buttonholes chapel rot said hughes why its perfectly ripping maddoxs uncle was the architect its the finest schoolchapel in england bar eton perhaps youll see it tonight you never saw anything so ripping oh sorry said david flushing but i didnt know hughes paused a moment and looked at him again i say blazes its awful sport your coming down like this he said do sweat your eyes out over this exam it would be ripping if you got a scholarship were all working like beans in the house thats maddoxs doing works quite different if you take an interest in it you know yes that path goes down to the bathingplace and there are nightingales in the trees then hall fuggy spot we all have dinner there both outboarders and inboarders see that don there in cap and gown he takes the fifth form hes frightfully polite and is learning to ride a bicycle consequently you always touch your cap to him as he goes wobbling along and he takes a hand off to return your chaste salute and falls off good rag theres his classroom with the library up above well just go down there and ill answer to namecalling on my way they turned out of the big court into an asphalted square full of boys a master was standing on a raised dais at one end calling out names with extreme deliberation oh damn hes only just begun said hughes after listening a moment we wont wait he touched another boy on the shoulder i say answer for me plugs he said you owe me one right oh whats your voice now topknot treble or bass bout midway something with a crack in it thanks awfully plugs whoever plugs was saw hughess companion whos your friend he asked scholarshipchap from my tother school decent that was an aside but clearly audible and david swelled with pride and tried to look abnormally decent they made their way through the crowd that was collecting and dispersing as the rollcall proceeded and went back down the long empty passage past the steps leading up to the school library even as they approached them there was a clatter of feet on the concrete floor above and a boy came flying down them four steps to his stride beneath one arm he carried a sheaf of books and his straw hat was in the other hand maddox said hughes quietly and on the moment maddox took his last six steps in one leap and nearly fell over them both all the heroworship of which david was capable flared up never did hero make a more impressive entrance than in that long lithe jump that landed him in the passage he nearly knocked hughes down and dropped all his books but caught him round the shoulders and steadied him again there was a splendid crisp vigour about every line of his body his black short hair his dark fullblooded face topknot you silly owl he said dont get in a mans light when hes in a hurry havent hurt you have i id die sooner than hurt you david picked up the scattered books and maddox turned to him oh thanks awfully he said youre topknots pal i suppose come up for the scholarshipracket good luck he nodded to david flicked the end of hughess nose and went off down the passage to the sixthform room whistling louder than even david thought possible gosh said david there was really nothing more to be said oh hes always like that remarked hughes feeling that the meeting could not have been more impressive and he wished me good luck said david still feeling dazzled wasnt that awfully jolly of him and he flicked your nose same as you might flick mine oh lord yes said hughes after this all that immediately followed seemed but the setting and stage from which the chief actor had departed for that glimpse of maddox had been to david like some appearance of the spirit itself of public school soon they left the college buildings and walked down some quarter of a mile to where the red roofs of adamss rose between fullfoliaged elms they had to cross a broad swiftflowing chalkstream where rushes twitched in the current and cushions of starflowered waterweed waved and hughes pointed out the wagging tail of a great fat trout who was supposed to have baffled the wiles of all fishermen from time immemorial arrived at the house they had to part for david as a guest must present himself formally at the front door while hughes went round through the yard where stumpcricket was going on to the boys quarters there were cheerful cries of hullo topknot and david waiting for the bell to be answered thrilled again at the thought of being part of all this the idea of mr adams was no longer formidable though he had pictured him as being rather taller than the head he was shown through a big oakpanelled hall into mr adamss study and even if he had entered in trepidation his fears would have been at once set at rest in a long chair by the open window with a pipe in his mouth while two boys were leaning over the back of his chair sat his master clerical as to collar but with a blazer on instead of a black coat just as david entered one of the two boys scarcely older than himself to all appearance and with a shrill voice yet unbroken was expostulating with him oh i say do go back and construe that again sir he said i wasnt attending sorry adams held out a hand to david thats right he said delighted to see you just wait half a moment now ted if you dont attend this time i will not go over it again ted took an injured tone well there was a wasp he said it wasnt my fault please get on quick sir david thought he had never seen so pleasant a room nor one which less suggested school as he had known it the windows looked out on to a big lawn in the centre of which two boys and a tall blackhaired girl whom he conjectured to be adamss daughter were playing croquet round the edge were cut five or six golfholes where other boys were putting slightly to the derangement of geranium beds and half a dozen more were sitting in the shade of limetrees reading and talking here inside two occupied the sofa and as david waited for ted to be construed to another tall fellow strolled in and lay down on the hearthrug with an illustrated paper the walls were lined with low bookshelves on the top of which were strewn cricketballs books and straw hats while on the table in the centre was a litter of papers and in the middle a great bowl of roses honeysuckle trailed trumpeted sprays over the spaces of open window and the darkstained floor was bright with persian rugs the construing was soon over and adams gave the book back to one of the boys then he who had lain down on the hearthrug looked up from the paper sir jessops coming down he said adams got up from his chair then get him out at once with the very fastest ball ever bowled crookles he said some one from the sofa joined in oh dont be too hard on him crookles he said let him hit you over the pavilion a bit first davids eyes took on their most reverential roundness without doubt this must be cruikshank the fastest bowler the school had ever had and yet he had a casual private life of his own and was called crookles and heres blaize come down on purpose to see it all said adams and incidentally to get a scholarshipeh david horrors the christian name again but nobody appeared to think it the least ridiculous any more than that ted who was climbing out of the window should be known as ted adams looked rather unfavourably at one of the two boys on the sofa ozzy go and wash your hands at once he said i wont have fellows in here with dirty paws sir maynt i just finish began ozzy no finish when youre clean come out into the garden david hows your father topknot met you at the station didnt he and youre going to have tea with him we might find some strawberries david was packed off early to bed that night in order that his brain might be in its most efficient mood for his examination next day in a whirl of happy excitement never in all his daydreams had he conceived that adamss could be like this it was not like a school it was like some new and entrancing kind of home with the jolliest man he had ever seen as a master and father and for family these friendly boys and the blackhaired girl adamss daughter whom everybody called by her christian name and yet the glamour of public school lay over it and among this happy family there moved like ordinary mortals the great ones of the earth maddox and cruikshank and westcott captain of the school fifteen behaving like everybody else and seemingly unconscious of their divinity and these heroes had been seen with his mortal eyes and he had been taken by hughes into maddoxs study after tea where he had been permitted to help in washing up his teathings that to him was the vatican a room some twelve feet by ten in material dimensions but a shrine a centre there were books everywherenot schoolbooks merely but novels books of poetry books in french which maddox read for his own amusement cricketbats and a press of rackets were piled in the corner and such space on the walls as was not filled with books was a mosaic of school photographs and perhaps most astounding of all though maddox had his school cricket colours his racket and five colours there was no trace of those glories anywhere instead on a nail behind the door was hung a straw hat with just the housecolours on it which david himself would be allowed to wear next september somehow that was tremendously grand it was like a king who had the right to cover himself with stars and garters preferring to go out to dinner in ordinary evening dress davids bedroom was in the private part of the house but next door was one of the boys dormitories merry muffled noises leaked through the walls and from the open window of the dormitory there came into his room whistlings and cheerful riot and from time to time the clump of boots kicked off on to the floor by degrees these sounds grew quiet but he still lay in wideeyed contemplation and expectancy the most trifling preoccupation was always sufficient to make him forget to say his prayers and tonight he had got into bed without their ever occurring to him but as he lay awake among the million surmises that came to him about life in this enchanted place he wondered whether fellows in the house said their prayers since chapel apparently was a thing to be proud of and on the moment he tumbled out of bed and knelt down but only one petition seemed possible and he made it o lord let me get a scholarship and come to adamss he said very fervently he thought for a moment but really there seemed to be nothing else that his heart desired amen he said and jumping into bed again fell asleep chapter vi it was the morning of the day before helmsworth broke up examinations were over lists had been read out and places and removes assigned to those who would reassemble in september and just now the whole school was employed in the joyful task of packing playboxes this was not an affair that usually demanded anxious consideration it consisted in shying your books into your box and shaking it until the lid consented to close or burst in the attempt but david on this particular occasion was not sure that it was very joyful and as an outward and visible sign of his doubts he was actually packing his books fitting them in one with another that is to say instead of making salad glorious things had happened and a dazzling future was no doubt to follow but he was dimly aware that a chapter in life was closing which in spite of its drawbacks and terrors and annoyances had been jolly he had been happy he was aware without knowing it and whatever the future held it would not hold this again no such scruples afflicted ferrers who was emptying his locker into his playbox in the manner of a cheerful cataract holding up for competition anything he did not want old testament maclear he said quis for an old testament maclear list of kings of israel and judah in it with lots of noughts and crosses over it lord id like to make a parcel of it and send it to dubs without any stamps on david was considering the question of a catapult in the famous visit to marchester he had discovered that catapults were scuggy inventions but he had at present been unable to bring himself to part with this one so great was its calibre the stagbeetles he had given to ferrers minor the day after his return and their new owner had sat down on them with total loss of life a few hours subsequently and now he hardened himself again quis for a catapult he said heroically and a chorus of ego answered him he threw it to stone who had clearly been first with his ego rotten things catapults he said to strengthen himself only scugs use them at marchester then he came upon the smoking club badge since his return from marchester he had broken with the s c but since as a leaving gift he had made the club a magnificent present of twentyfive cigarettes and a cherrywood holder his defection had not roused unpleasant comment but the badge had still something of the preciousness of the past about it he remembered the pride with which by the assistance of a pair of tweezers he had shaped the copper wire into the mystic letters he slipped it into his playbox there was a loose cricket scoringsheet which he had craftily torn out of the book because it showed his own analysis on the day of the eagles match and did not record the fact that he had missed the catch which lost them the game well there was no use for that now any more than for catapults or stagbeetles since the fellows at marchester would care precious little what his bowlinganalysis had been against a private school of which nobody had ever heard they had not heard of him either and at that thought david saw just where his vague regrets and melancholy came from he had to start all over again on a new page to part with everything that for its own sake or from familiarity had become dear to be a nobody again instead of being a big boy in his circle he had been used to consider himself rather a swell with an assured position now he was nobody again with no position at all the school sergeant the minister of fate who brought round the slips of blue paper on which the head had written the name of culprits whose attendance was required looked in at this moment master blaize to go to the head at once he said davids heart stood still not with fear but with suspense for the last three days he had hourly expected that news would come of the result of the marchester scholarship examination and perhaps this meant its arrival but his friends thought otherwise and ferrers major rattled his keys and slapped a book with suggestive resonance dont bully me sir he said the other hand sir whack whack whack all in the same place the fellow who was going to take all the wickets in the old boys match wont be able to bowl a ball whack whack sobs and cries oh piffle said david getting up that was a word he had brought back from marchester and was new to the helmsworth vocabulary he had distinctly overworked it with the result that two days ago there had been a piffle conspiracy against him whatever question that is to say that david asked anybody was answered by piffle which became rather wearing to the nerves but the conspiracy was shortlived it had lasted indeed only a few hours since david distinctly announced that he would firmly hit in the face the next fellow who said piffle to him that checked off the juniors at once but unfortunately there were others and when david the moment after said to stone will you come and bathe stone said piffle immediately afterwards stone had a black eye and david a bleeding nose but he went for the next piffler with undiminished zeal and the thing had dropped for it was not worth while fighting david over a little thing like that he also had dropped the use of the word and this time it slipped out by accident and if anybody says piffle he remarked cheerfully theres heaps of time to smash him silly before i go to the head this was too highhanded one two three said stone and the whole classroom simultaneously shouted piffle at the tops of their voices that was a manuvre previously agreed on in case david used the word again and he was scored off oh funny asses he said witheringly which was about the best thing that could be done under the circumstances david walked down the path that led to the heads study with a suspended heart feeling certain that this was scholarship news and not one of his private misdeeds that was to be set before him but yet hurriedly attempting to recollect the omissions and trespasses of which he had lately been guilty but he credited himself with so stainless a record that he was really open to the damning imputation of having become a saint for the effect of that glimpse of public school life had been magical on his conduct he had literally not cared to do the sort of things any more that spelt trouble at helmsworth at marchester for example only scugs smoked and therefore the temptation of so doing especially since he did not like it had ceased to beckon him the only reason for indulging in it had really been the notion that it was grand and if by a higher standard it was not grand at all the point of it was gone again the fact that at adamss house it was the thing to work had made industry a perfectly palatable mode of passing the time or where when he had once seen a master like adams was the use of cheeking that dreary ass dubs you couldnt cheek dubs any more it was beneath you to do any such thing dubs was pure piffle there had been a paralysing row in the school a few days before at which the head had appeared in his most terrific light but david had had nothing to do with that a series of small thefts had been going on and the culprit had eventually been caught redhanded in a dormitory deserted for cricket had been held up to public execration and expelled that scene had made david feel sick with terror personally he did not in the least desire to steal other fellows things but he quaked at the thought of being made the scorn of the assembled school as had happened to anstruther he supposed that his whole subsequent life would be cursed and blasted as indeed the head had assured anstruther that his was david tapped at the door and entered in obedience to a stern gruff permission the head looked up frowning blaize yes wait a moment he finished a letter reread it and directed it and threw it on the floor that was one of his great ways he just threw letters on the floor if he wanted them to be posted and they were picked up and stamped i have just heard from marchester he said you have done well but you have not got a scholarship there were six given and you were eighth on the list dont be discouraged you have done well but i am recommending your father to send you to mr adamss house anyhow it is more expensive than an inboarders and i wish you had got a scholarship so as to begin helping in your own education but i think you may consider that you will go to mr adamss next september the head suddenly took his keys from his pocket and rattled them in the lock of the drawer that held the canes but he was doing it so it seemed to david in a sort of absence of mind and not to be thinking of what lay within then leaving them there he got up and rocked across to the fireplace where he stood on the hearthrug looking gigantic he began a portentous terrorbreathing discourse david he said a few days ago you saw a schoolfellow publicly expelled i saw you turn white i saw your horror at the task that was forced on me now you are on the point of going out into the bigger life of a public school and when you have been a week at marchester you will look back on the time you have passed here as a sort of babyhood and wonder whether it was you who smoked half a cigarette now and then and cheeked mr dutton and puterput resurrection pie into envelopes and burned it good lord thought david is it going to be a caning for sundries apparently it wasnt but you will find continued the head that there are worse things than smoking and all the misdeeds you may or may not have been punished for and you will find out that there are even worse things than stealing and that many quite good chaps as you would say dont think there is any harm in them do you know what i mean david looked up in quite genuine bewilderment no sir he said thank god for it then said the head then he moved across the room to his cabinet of cigars and broke his own rule for he took one out and lit it and smoked it in silence for a moment in the sacred presence of one of the boys then he turned to david again you dont understand me now he said but you will and when you do understand try to remember for my sake if that is anything to you or for your own sake which certainly is or for gods sake which is best of all that there are worse things than stealing things that damn the soul david and now forget all i have said till the time comes for you to remember it you will know when it comes and dont listen to any arguments about it there is no argument possible yes sir said david blankly he could not understand why it was the head had thanked god but there was no time for wonder for instantly the heads whole gravity and seriousness vanished that is all i wanted to say to you he said and i feel sure you wont forget it now when does the old boys match begin twelve isnt it i hope youll be in form today with your bowling we havent beaten the old boys for six years but i dont think weve ever had such a good chance as we have today the wicket ought to suit you if the sun comes out gradually the sense of this dawned on david its tremendous import he flushed with incredulous pride oh but fellows like hughes will hit me all round the clock sir he said they will if you think they are going to remarked the head thats all then david hughes is staying with me over the night youll sup with us yes sir thank you sir said david in spite of his failure to win a scholarship david walked on air as he went back to the packing of his playbox for far more important from his own point of view than the getting of a scholarship was the fact that he was going to adamss for a minute he wondered about what the head had said concerning things that were worse than stealing but having been told to forget all about it instantly proceeded to put the question out of his mind in favour of more agreeable topics and there was no doubt that the head implied that it was he who might win the old boys match for the school jolly decent of him considering that it was he who had certainly lost the eagles match for them soon after the great men from eton and harrow and marchester began to arrive and each appeared more enormous than the last today however there was no baleful father to trouble davids peace and in the halfhour before the match began he went and bowled to hughes at the nets who incontinently hit him three times running out of the field but david had the true temper of the slow bowler who expects to be hit while he studies the hitter and observed that hughes was not nearly so comfortable with a slightly faster ball pitched a little outside the leg stump and if luck accompanied the intention breaking in he quite mistimed two that david sent down upon which having got this valuable hint david bowled no more of that variety lest hughes should get used to them then as there were plenty of bowlers at hughess net he went on to the next where cookson who had left two years before was batting there again the wily david tried the ball which hughes did not care about but found that cookson had a special affection for it and hit it juicily to square leg but he was less confident with a very slow ball such as hughes had hit so contemptuously so here was a second bit of information david committed that to memory and tried a third net where he had no success of any sort or kind there had been six school matches before this stone had lost the toss on five occasions and on the sixth when he had won had put the other side in with disastrous results today however having contrary to all expectation won the toss he took the innings and by lunchtime six wickets were down for a hundred and three while cookson the only bowler of any real merit was losing his sting and david in the last over before lunch had hit him impertinently for twelve thus bringing his own contribution up to twenty during lunch he made a beautiful plan that he would really go in for hitting hard afterwards but this miscarried and he lost his wicket off the first ball he received owing to his hitting hard at it at the moment when his bails were already whizzing like driven partridges through the air three quarters of an hour later the innings closed for a hundred and thirtyfive a total which might have easily been worse but undeniably should have been better davids heart sank when he saw two immense figures coming out of the pavilion to open the innings of the old boys and found that he had to begin bowling to one with a moustache and a forearm that seemed about as big as his own leg but as the head had augured might happen the sun had come out during lunchtime and this after the rain of the night before which had rendered the wicket easy this morning might render it very difficult and also very suitable for his mode of attack during the afternoon without doubt the turf would cake and a ball if judiciously handled might do very odd things indeed he felt as if the head had ordered the sun on purpose for him which was a kind thought and suddenly glowing with optimism again pranced up to the crease with his usual extravagant action and was immediately hit clean out of the ground the head had appeared in front of the pavilion just in time to see this done and david candidly reflected that it was worth seeing it didnt often happen that the first ball of an innings was slogged for six juicy hit too david approached the crease again in a much more staid manner and delivered a second ball exactly like the first there was really no reason why it should not have been treated in exactly the same way but the giant carefully blocked it instead for it looked different that thoroughly pleased david he was creating an atmosphere he did not use that phrase to himself he merely thought that the batsman suspected something again he altered his action and took hardly any run at all but this time he delivered the slightly faster ball which had puzzled hughes during the practice at the nets and it was feebly returned straight into his hands where it remained till he buzzed it vertically into the air gosh im devilish deep said david to himself in a spasm of odious pride by six it was all over helmsworth had won by twenty runs and david had taken eight wickets and though since his return from marchester he had often told himself that this was only a scuggy little private school this was a moment worth living for for not only did the scuggy little private school roar at him as he came to the pavilion with the rest of the team but the disgraced and vanquished giants of public schools people of sixteen and seventeen came out shouting well bowled blaize with the most generous appreciation the head was there too clapping his hands and goggles was there beaming through her large round spectacles and carrots with her hair shining in the sun they were all there david came up the steps to the pavilion all alone for the rest of the eleven suddenly stood away from him and shoved him forward crimson in the face with exertion and joy oh twasnt me sir he said to the head who patted his shoulder it was just the ground it played awfully queer and he buried his delightful confusion in a quart of lemonade so in delicious triumph the last hours of davids schoollife passed and from the train next morning he saw between the trees the fleeting glances of the roofs which for three years had been his home chapter vii davids father lived in a grey rambling house in the close at baxminster a plan of his that as far as david went had something to be said both for and against it in its favour was the fact that the house contained a whole topstory of dusky and mysterious attics roofed in the dimness by cobwebby beams and used only for lumberplaces and cisterns here it had been delightful in years gone by to find pleasing terrors in these dark and doubtful corners amid the gurgles of waterpipes here he and his sister in those years gone by or in other words until a few months ago had often passed entrancing wet afternoons daring each other particularly at the closing in of dusk to explore the farthest recesses even to that last attic of all which contained a large coffinlike box and a cistern that unexpectedly gave sudden and mirthless goblinchuckles to itself most harrowing to nerves already keenly on edge the rules generally in force were that one of them had to go and sit alone in that very spooky chamber with face turned honestly away from the door while the other dressed up in any horrific garb that might suggest itself to a fevered imagination and having stealthily entered frightened the watcher with this hideous apparition accompanying it by any such noise of screaming or groaning that might appear suitable with the victim looking steadily away from the door these noises might go on like an artillery attack until his nerves were thoroughly shaken though he had not yet seen what the apparition was to be david had once frightened margery into hysterics here having entered the room in silence swathed in a sheet and wriggling snakewise along the floor he had coloured his face purple from margerys paintbox and having serpentined along till he was in front of her suddenly yelled and disclosed the horrors of that apoplectic countenance on that occasion the gurgling cistern had been useful for he swiftly washed his own face to reassure her but by a variation of the rules it having been ordained that the frightener should enter the room first and get himself up to receive the frightened on entry margery had got back her own again for she had chalked her face and put her tongue out and lain down in the coffinshaped box closing the lid as usual david had looked for her with quaking tremors behind the cistern and found her not he had peered into the darkest of all corners where an empty bookcase concealed a dangerous recess when suddenly the lid of the coffinbox which he had not suspected flew open disclosing margery lying quite still with white face and protruding tongue david had run as far as the nurserylanding before he could master the panic of his legs clearly then there was or rather had been advantages in this house but today as margery and david sat idly beneath the mulberrytree in the garden from which every now and then a fat sunripened fruit plopped on to the grass david announced that there was no more savour in these childish things margery was a year older than he but being a girl and already turned fifteen and he a boy who had but last week celebrated his fourteenth birthday his father had given him a copy of the christian year for which he had very little use she was essentially some five years his senior and knew how david felt yes it used to be ripping he said discontentedly in allusion to those years and i used to be awfully excited but i dont care now you see the point was that we were frightened that was the ripping part of it besides you know if any of the fellows at adamss asked me what sort of games we played at home it would be sickening to have to say that we just hid behind boxes in a frowsty attic taint no use any more so what are we to do all this afternoon and tomorrow and the next day its funny that you cant suggest something else margery gave a long sigh and ate one of the fallen mulberries she would have given anything to be able to suggest something else in appearance she was so like david that if brother and sister had dressed in the others clothes and corrected the discrepancy of hair and broken front tooth either might have passed a frontier with the passport of the other well ive suggested heaps of things and you say they are all rot she said ill play anything you like we used to have rather fun playing cricket wouldnt you like to play cricket oh whats the use said david i should hit you into the deanery garden all afternoon and always bowl you first ball i took eight wickets against margery had a good deal of davids spirit as well as his bodily aspect i know you told me that she said twice david had a certain sense of being illused common to his sex at his age oh all right he said with dignity but you used to be interested in my things margery had probably never heard of womens rights she only knew that her beloved david was rather unfair sometimes on these occasions she never by any chance took refuge in pathos silly gubbins she said you told me twice and i was interested even the second time david do buck up go and smoke a cigarette wont you its quite disgusting of you to smoke and some day father will smell it and therell be trouble but it used to make you feelfeel starched given up smoking said david morosely ages ago hurrah did it make you feel extraspecial unwell no you ass but its scuggish to smoke only scugs smoke at marchester margery nodded at him approvingly i always told you you would cease to think it grand when you got with nice boys she said oh shut up said david margery melted completely under this she felt that he was only a little boy in spite of all the wickets he had taken and that she was a woman instinctively she took up the glory and burden of her sex oh david whats the matter she said i am sorry you feel beastly what is it david slid off his chair and lay down flat on the grass staring up into the thick green leaves chinked with blue sky almost immediately a ripe mulberry dropped on his nose and burst and though it was immensely funny margery continued quite grave david said damn and solemnly wiped it off then she sat down on the grass by him what is the matter david she repeated david blew away a fly that wished to settle on his face oh its so dull he said i am so bored and fancy being stuck here all august as fathers in residence youre a ripper all right but then youre a girl i expect you cant help ill come and play cricket if you like i dont said margery go on i dont suppose you would understand said the superior sex but you see ive got to start again its scuggish to smoke or to keep stagbeetles and i shant see any of the chaps i was friends with again and some of them were jolly decent in spite of what you say about smoking except bags its its like emigrating of course its perfectly ripping going to marchester but oh well i feel rotten this afternoon oh is bags going to marchester asked margery yes i heard from him this morning hes going to adamss too davids tone was not that of one who finds a consoling circumstance and margery felt her way but youre tremendous friends with him arent you she asked oh yes i suppose so he was jolly decent to me last half when a lot of the fellows were against me but he doesnt play games you know and has got a weak heart and hes rather an ass in some ways and he says he has persuaded his governor to let him go to marchester just because of me well then hes very fond of you said margery i know he is that makes me feel rather a cad of course itll be awfully nice to have bags there and all that but oh i cant explain and you cant understand but margery being a child herself could completely understand the unfathomable mind of childhood i shouldnt worry about that david she said even if bags cant play cricket perhaps youll find he can do something else thatll make him all right david regarded the roof of mulberryleaves severely well i suppose ive just got the hump he said i dont care for the old things and i havent got any new ones yet look at these holidays i hate cathedrals and were going to stop here all august i dont want to grub in the attics any more or to play pirates and theres no cricket except one match against those rotten little choirboys and father talks the most awful tosh about cricket says he never wore pads when he was a boyi dare say they werent inventedand anyhow he could never have played for nuts i cant argue with him it isnt any use because he doesnt know david sat up in a despair of indignation only the other day he said at the county match he asked me where jessop was fielding so of course i said at coverpoint which he was and father said perhaps it wasnt perhaps it was coverpoint there wasnt a perhaps in the whole blooming show why even you know that that makes it so unfair if father tells me that dogtooth ornament comes in norman architecture i dont say perhaps the wise margery continued her course of consolation oh but david she said there are a lot of things you like besides cricket theres that ripping poem you read me the other day keatss ode to the nightingale i loved it was he head master of eton david wiped the final remains of the burst mulberry from his face in a magisterial manner head master of eton he said why he was in a sort of doctors shop where you might have got something for stomachache the head said and all the time he was writing that ode isnt it rummy the boy is father to the man so also is the girl to the woman margery with secret glee saw that david was feeling better and inclined to be interested yes you did tell me she said penitently but i forgot sorry david oh thats all right i forget lots of things i say its an awful pity youre a girl margery you would have been such a ripping boy i dare say i should have got on all right said she or perhaps you might have been a girl me a girl said david but i couldnt think of the things girls have to do its ridiculous margery felt she must stand up for her sex i dont see that the things we have to do are more ridiculous than your smoking or keeping those beastly stagbeetles said she for she shared bagss horror of that which crawled david got up with extraordinary dignity those are the things i told you in confidence he said well and whom have i told demanded margery besides theyre all finished said david you shouldnt bring them up against me i didnt i was only arguing then lets stop arguing said david lord its only just three theres that beastly cathedral clock striking i suppose thats norman too isnt it what are we to do margery made a little sympathetic grimace at david oh david i do understand she said and im so sorry youre bored i know exactly whats the matter with you wish youd tell me said david you know too really youve dropped one lot of things and havent got the next lot yet then theres this do you remember that green snake you used to keep and how when it was changing its skin it used to lie quite still not eating or drinking and seeming awfully depressed i expect that sort of thing is happening to you i shouldnt a bit wonder if our minds changed their skins now and then just like snakes david was interested in this but it was necessary in his present humour to be rather depreciatory girls do have such rum notions he said i cant think where you get them from but what then just that you have been a little boy up till now although you were no end of a swell at helmsworth and youre just beginning to see it you know you would have been furious with me if i had told you even only last holidays that you were only a little boy but you dont mind now because you know it yourself youre changing your skin whatoh i forget that word of yours the marchester one piffle suggested david yes what piffle you would have thought the keats ode only a few months ago and at that time you thought it grand and grownup to smoke david sat down again thoroughly interested in his own metamorphosis yes thats rum he said no not really its just growing up it sounds sort of philosophical said he margery picked up two or three fallen mulberries and put them into her mouth absently one after the other i dare say she said oh david do be quick about changing your skin and let me see the new one and now lets go and do something i vote we go and look at that old bookstall by the priory gate we might find a keats among the cheap lots in the tray you asked me to come and look for one this morning she held out her hands to her brother and he pulled her up right oh he said i say margery youre not a bad sort and margery was extremely content the garden where they had been sitting was one of peculiar charm though to david it ranked rather high among the disadvantages of the place for the lawn was not big enough to play any game into which hitting hard or kicking hard entered and as that was the paramount requirement demanded of pieces of grass there was really very little to be said in favour of this garden balls always went into bushes or flowerbeds it was a very secondrate arena the house itself rambling and greystoned lay between it and the road that circled round the close and to north and south the garden on its longer sides was bounded by brickwalls which centuries of sun and wintry weather had mellowed to an inimitable softness of hue below the southernfacing wall a deep flowerbed the grave of many balls ran the whole length of the grass which on the other side came up to the wall flush as a carpet to a wainscotting a few rosebeds sunned themselves below the low stone terrace that bordered the house but the most distressing thing from davids standpoint was that this kindly thickleaved mulberrytree propped and strutted like a very old man taking the air stood bang in the centre of the lawn so that lawntennis was out of the question along the far end of the garden was a collection of sculptured stones roman or something beastly was his verdict there probably unearthed when the garden was first made here a gate in the middle of the third brickwall led into the kitchengarden which of course from the orthodox athletic view of gardens was also quite futile but to the unorthodox nothing could have been more charming the brickwalls were starred with stonecrop and selfsown wallflower and over the greytiled roof of the house rose the norman tower of the cathedral grave and gracious against the sky the care of the flowerbeds had lately been given into margerys hands who had adopted radical measures against the dreadful rows of geraniums calceolarias and lobelias with which the gardener had been accustomed to make gay the long border and she had gone back to happier junglemethods sweetpeas stood in clumps like stooks of flowering corn pansies and heliotrope and loveinmist were lowlier citizens and behind hollyhocks and sunflowers kept sentinel and over all pervasive and mellow as the august sunshine brooded that atmosphere of studious serenity which belongs to such ancient homes of peace as cathedrals and monastic places but sthetic as such an atmosphere is it is not greatly appreciated by the young nor indeed is there the smallest reason why it should be everybody and everything such was davids view was old here and for some inscrutable reason age was considered an advantage an old bishop lived in an old palace and the venerableness of both appeared to the inhabitants of the close to be equally admirable elderly rooks at least they talked in an elderly and boring way cawed in immemorial elms roman remains were constantly being dug up and put in the museum or if not worthy of that fate carefully grouped as here into the form of an outrageous rockery and now for seven weeks since this year the archdeacon was in residence in august and september the monotony of six deadly weekdays was only to be broken by the even deadlier monotony of sunday such was the pessimistic outlook over life that david took today and since pessimism was of uncommonly infrequent occurrence with him it was more than possible that margerys reference of it to skinchanging was a correct one this sort of philosophical explanation on her part had already done something towards restoring him to more normal levels and the inspection of the boxes of books outside the window of the secondhand shop with the events that followed completed the process for there by the most apt dispensation of providence they found margery actually found it and instantly passed it on to david a rather battered and dogeared copy of keats this was a triumphant affair showing that good could come even out of baxminster and they hurried inside to complete the sixpenny purchase coming out again into the street they saw outside a strawhatted figure turning over the boxes they had just left and suddenly davids heart leaped for he saw that the colours on it were those of adamss house the moment afterwonder upon wonderhe saw who it was maddox turned round as they came out and frowned for a second wondering where he had seen david before then he remembered whywhy youre topknots pal arent you he said then he saw that david was with a girl i beg your pardon he added quickly raising the enviable hat david took his courage in his hands probably it was awful cheek but after all it was in the holidays and they were not at school oh this is my sister he said margery this is mr maddox maddox shook hands and turned to david again do tell me your name he said for the only piece of it i can remember is david you came down to try for a scholarship and stayed at adamss it seemed wonderful to david that anybody so great should remember anything blaize he said of course and so you and david live here miss blaize in this ripping town i never saw such a jolly place i could prowl about the close and the cathedral for weeks yes my paters archdeacon said david i wish mine was said maddox but ive got some right here i came down two days ago to stay with my uncle whos bishop i expect you know him dont you hes got one of those gorgeous houses in the close david again made a stupendous call on his courage i say wont you come to tea he blurted out if you like these houses in the close we live in one you know margy do ask him david and i would like it awfully if you would come she said maddox laughed and he tilted his head back a little as he laughed and on the moment that appeared to david the only possible way to laugh thank you very much he said we should all three like it awfully then so why shouldnt we do it but may i just look through this box i love looking through old booktrays you never know what you maynt find though personally i never find anything but volumes of antique sermons printed by request of a few friends have you been buying something yes but only an old keats said david holding it out to him maddox looked at the titlepage which was intact and his eyes grew round my goodness you lucky beggar he said and you bought it just this minute yes why only because its a book that a booklover would give a lot for second edition of keats thats all o lord if i hadnt sat down doing nothing after lunch instead of coming here oh i say please take it then said david i didnt know anything about it i just thought i would like a keats any other one would be all the same to me maddox looked at him gravely a moment and then began to smile thanks very much he said and i will then sell it you if you like for ten pounds then he laughed again im a greedy brute he said but there are limits take it back quick or it will grow on to my fingers you are a lucky chap ten pounds said david incredulously i should think about that but i dont really know im not in the habit of buying second editions of keats lets look again a minute ill try to give it you back yes its quite complete suddenly david remembered that the find was not his but margerys i bang forgot he said margery you found it congrats for a moment his face grew troubled and i offered it you not remembering he said to maddox i really did mean it do take it margery you understand dont you maddox laid his hand on davids shoulder and looked at him its quite ripping of you david he said and at that moment david loved his christian name but whether its your sisters or yours i couldnt possibly but thanks most awfully but are you sure asked david he laughed why of course i am what do you take me for oh i cant bother about these beastly books now i know whats come out of that tray shall we go then but on the way the question of the rightful possessor of this treasure had to be laid before him margerys contention was that david had suggested going to see if they could find a keats and that she had merely accompanied him and therefore the book was his david on the other hand had contended that she had found it and you couldnt get over that they both referred the decision to maddox with his seventeen years experience of the world depends on what you are going to do with it he said if you mean to sell it i really think i should divide the proceeds if notwell i should have a box made for it with two keys one for each of you anyhow i shouldnt suggest the solomontrick and cut it in half the immenseness of all this momentarily obscured the honour and glory of taking maddox home to tea and the fate of the keats was warmly debated david was rather inclined to sell it and revel in gold but margery hinted that if they were each possessed of five pounds it certainly would not be they who revelled in gold but the savingsbank before the question was settled they had got back to the close and david pointed out his fathers house a little way ahead of them maddox clicked his teeth with his tongue in a show of impatience this is rather too much he said you find a second edition of keats and bring it home to the most beautiful house in baxminster i call it rotten may i see all over it before tea and the garden david felt he must apologise for the garden oh the gardens an awful hole he said though margery doesnt think so theres no room for anything as youll see so the fairy prince was led in and taken all over the house and as they went merits and glories undreamed of dawned on david what had been dark ugly wood turned out to be a jacobean panelling and a frowsy old picture of davids greatgrandmother in a mobcap was pronounced the most ripping romney who in his line appeared to be up to the high standard already set by keats and most astounding of all was maddoxs verdict on the attics which david had abandoned as a proper playground for anybody who was going to marchester in september but the fairy prince thought otherwise what awful fun you could have playing horrible games like hide and seek up here he said i hope you do lord whats that groan oh a cistern is it i thought it must be a ghost how ripping david instantly dismissed his resolution of not playing games here any more oh theres a worse room yet he said do come and look at it theres a box like a coffin in it margery and i used to play gorgeous games up here dressing up and frightening each other you know wasnt it fun margery margery was the soul of loyalty she would no more have reminded david that only today he had come to the conclusion that these games were silly than she would have had him led out to instant execution yes when it begins to get dark its awful up here she said you cant see anything distinctly and the cistern suddenly groans and you cant tell whats coming next maddox in spite of his seventeen years and olympian elevation did not seem to be unbending david in fact if his utterances this afternoon were to be taken literally had to unbend to him i love being frightened said maddox you ought to read ghost stories to each other here and the one who reads may make any sort of noise he chooses at any moment just when the ghost is going to appear you know lord i hope i shall never get beyond that sort of thing he margery and david were standing in a row opposite the coffinshaped box just then the cistern in the room behind gave one of its best goblingroans and maddox looked awfully round oh whats that he said thats not the cistern thats a man bleeding to death in there that is his throats cut from ear to ear no said david im sure it was the cistern are you it may have been the cistern before but i dont believe it was that time pity its not a little darker theres too much light really just now already to david the attic bristled again with entrancing possibilities under this stimulus it was queer that any one of maddoxs age and attainments should see sport in what a few hours ago had seemed childish and savourless to himself but since this was so it was clear there must be something in it but schoolboy heroworship made him see through his heros eyes and all that maddox did or said was invested with authority true he had seen him perhaps half a dozen times altogether but that was quite sufficient to make this matchless glamour in all the world there was no one so instinct with romance and glory as this boy three years his senior who realised for him all he wanted to be of course they went downstairs again on the pronouncement that it was not dark enough im afraid youll think the garden is rot said david theres a beastly mulberrytree bang in the middle of the lawn but its not so bad to have tea in margery cant we have tea out there so the fairy prince was escorted downstairs and out into the garden to give his verdict on that despised spot and looked round with those quick movements of his eye from side to side without turning his head which again seemed now the only possible way of looking at things but what on earth is good enough for you david he said you cant read keats except out of a second edition and you told me the attics were rather fun once and you say the garden is rotten look at those brick walls look at the house look at the mulberrytree oh i say what are those stones in the corner isnt that a roman altar yes i believe so said david do you care about those things maddox and he walked down to the collection of old stones which had appeared to david the dullest of the antique things of baxminster some of the lettering on one of these was still distinguishable yes optimo maximo said maddox i expect that gap is jovi then lower down do you see p aelius that must be the chap who dedicated it funny that it should stand here now for you and me to read while the cathedral tower squints at us over the attics where the ghosts live maddox had seated himself crosslegged on the grass to examine the altar and david leaned over him following the letters as he traced them with his smooth brown finger and at once the subject even of roman altars leaped into interest maddox shaded the lowest line of the inscription with his hand to catch the shape of the weatherworn letters cant read any more he said but anyhow one day long before the cathedral was built publius aelius set that up because the gods had been good to him what a lot of jolly things there are and some fellows go mooning along never looking at anything im afraid you mean me suggested david modestly maddox looked up at him over his shoulder well i dont he said and theres a bit of an arch perhaps that came from the temple where p aelius put his altar maddox asked for and was given another look at the keats before he left and proposed to david that he should walk with him as far as the old palace best afternoon ive spent for ages said the idol as they parted i wish i wasnt going away tomorrow or i should ask to be allowed to come again anyhow we meet at adamss in september a haunting doubt had been present in davids mind at intervals all that heavenly afternoon now it had to find expression i say i hope it hasnt been awful cheek of me to have asked you to have tea and all that he said i can stand lots of that sort of cheek said the other chapter viii it was the afternoon of such a november day as the pessimistic call typical a cold southwesterly gale drove streaming flocks of huddled cloud across the sky like some fierce and boisterous shepherd and the whole of the great court at marchester stood ankledeep in gravelly pools of windflecked rainbeaten water the gale had stripped bare of their few remaining leaves the avenue of limetrees which ran between the gate and the inboarders house at the far end of the court and today they stood stark pyramids of dripping branches and twigs that whistled as the wind hissed through them though the day was saturday and in consequence a halfholiday there were but few signs of outdoor animation for the conditions of the weather were sufficiently diabolical to tinge with some touch of respect the contempt in which healthy boys hold the vagaries of climate one occasionally with collar turned up fled splashing across the court from one house to another or now and then a small company of drenched enthusiasts would trot in in dripping shorts and sweaters from their training run along the london road or a couple of figures with racquets protected under their coats would dash across from the racquetcourt but football had been officially announced to be off since the field was neither more nor less than a morass and without doubt the most comfortable conditions of life were today to be obtained in front of a fire with a novel to read or under stress of necessity arrears of work to be overhauled and demolished there was however in one of the open fivecourts near the porters lodge a notable exception to this indoor tendency there two boys capless and streaming with water were absorbingly engaged in playing squash a most apt occupation since they and the earth and the sky generally seemed to be in a condition of squash even in the drier parts of the court the ball as it bounced sent up a squirt of water at other times it pitched in more definite puddles and so did not bounce at all but the two david and bags were quite undeterred by such small drawbacks and david talked without the least intermission six all he said and as i gave you six ive caught you up before youve scored have some more points wont you very well if youre proud you neednt but if i played squash at all like you i should be damned humble o bags you ass i dont believe youll ever be the slightest good why cant you hit the ball with the middle of your racquet for a change there look at that exactly oneeighth of an inch above the line i like them like that seven six oh good shot jolly well got up but observe you cant get that so whats the use of throwing yourself against the wall eight six oh damn puts you in six eight ill give you two hands if you like oh youll take that will you one hand out then oh do get on run cant you its raining there suck it you expected it the other side of the court and thats exactly why i didnt send it there puts me in ill play you for sixpence if you like next game and give you eight and two hands no prudent fellow i wish the rain wouldnt get into my eyes though its sweat as well i expect lord i am hot isnt it ripping david paused a moment both from talk and athletics a truce gladly accepted by the panting bags and pushed his dripping hair out of his eyes he was a completely dishevelled and yet a very jolly object and was quite altogether wet his knickerbockers clinging like tights to his thighs the skin of which showed pink through them while the water trickled steadily down his bare calves into the dejected socks that lay limply round the tops of his shoes they and his legs were stained with splashes of watery gravel his shirt open at the neck and slightly torn across the shoulder lay like a wet bag glued to his back and his hair was a mere yellow plaster from which the water could have been wrung in pints bags was in similar plight except that he wore a thick woollen jersey over his shirt which gave him a slightly less drowned aspect the game and with it davids running comments were resumed after a minute or two and neither of the two saw a figure with trousers much turned up and a large golfing umbrella who had paused on his way to the gate just behind them yes im going to play racquets for the school some time next century david was saying and squash is jolly good practice nine six thats rather a sell bags oh i say look at that for a halfvolley just a shade maddoxy i dont think the halfvolley in question that clung close to the left wall of the court finished the rally and david turned to run to pick it up and found that maddox was the spectator david you juggins why havent you got a sweater on asked he hullo said david oh because i couldnt find mine some brutes collared it i suppose well by rights you ought to get pneumonia and be prayed for in chapel and die in spite of it david pushed back his hair again and laughed thanks awfully but otherwise engaged he said are you going up to house after youve finished being drowned asked maddox no i was going to have tea with a fellow in college said david but im rather wet im afraid youll go up to house and change first do you see said maddox and you might bring up a parcel there will be for me at the lodge hasnt come yet but itll come any minute right said david the game was resumed but maddox still lingered both boys played with redoubled keenness before so honourable a spectator but davids artless and incessant conversation was felt by him to be unsuitable maddox watched in silence for a minute no let the ball drop more he said bags having made an egregiously futile return dont take an easy ball like that till its quite low david you play with your whole arm like a windmill whereas you only want your wrist just keep flicking it look here maddox gave david the large umbrella to hold and taking his racquet knocked up down the lefthand wall of the court sending each ball parallel and close to it with easy accuracy like that more or less he said now im wet blast you both he took his umbrella again reminded david of the parcel and splashed off across the quadrangle familiarity and closer acquaintance had not in the least made david get over the glory and wonder of maddox by gad he said fancy his taking the trouble to coach two scugs like you and me isnt he a ripper come on lets have one more game oh i vote we stop said bags its too wet for anything rot we cant possibly get wetter than we are david of course had his way and it was not till twenty minutes later that they trotted off down the bath road on their way to adamss david going by preference through the larger puddles bagss mind and no doubt davids also still ran upon maddox does he always call you david he asked at length lord yes when were alone said david and i suppose he thought you didnt count i remember how sick i was when my father called me david at helmsworth sort of disgrace to have your christian name known what beastly little scugs we were with smoking and keeping stagbeetles i never did either said bags in a rather superior manner david jumped with both feet in a particularly large puddle and covered bags with splashed water i know you didnt he said you were such a scug you see that you didnt do those things when it was scuggish not to but now when its scuggish to do them i believe you do i bet you smoke you and plugs went out smoking yesterday after hall well what if i did said bags and how did you know because i stunk you when you came back simple what a funny chap you are you never smoked at helmsworth where it was the right thing and yet you do here where its the wrong thing bags plodded on for a little while in silence adams doesnt really mind our smoking he said he chiefly wants not to have it brought to his notice yes but maddox does said david i wish hed catch you at it you wouldnt sit comfortable for a week or two david pranced into the footpath there was a limit to the amount of mud that it was convenient to carry on your shoes lets walk a bit he said im blown they moderated their pace to a walk and david squeezed his hands into his pocketsa difficult operation as they were glued together with wet several fellows have asked me about maddox he said and i dont know that the deuce theyre after hughes has for instance hughes used to be a ripper but hes different somehow now he asked me the other day if maddox had become a saint and if id converted him what the devil was he talking about i dont like hughes as much as i used he told some filthy tale in dormitory the other night and some of the fellows laughed i laughed too i supposed it was polite but i didnt see a hang what it all meant what was it asked bags god knows some awful piffle sounded filthy too he wanted to explain it to me came and sat on my bed and wanted to explain but just then maddox came to bed hed been sitting up late working and he hoofed hughes out again in less than no time it was the day after that that hughes asked me if maddox had become a saint lord wait a minute for some inconjecturable reason known only to the feline mind mrs adamss cat had thought good to sit out in the rain this afternoon on the top of one of the brick pilasters which stood at the entrance of the passage up to the house there she sat unconscious of david and bags contemplating the scenery with infinite craft david having picked up a small pebble threw it with such accuracy of aim that it passed through the fur at the top of her head between her ears she threw up her paws and looked wildly round in startled dismay and was there no more slap between her ears shrieked david lord didnt she look funny when she threw her hands up blow ive forgotten maddoxs parcel what an ass you are not to have reminded me hot bath anyhow then ill go back to college and fetch it this cloudladen gale had caused the dusk of evening to close in very early and the passage leading from the dormitories to the big room with its rows of baths was already nearly dark on either side of the passage were the studies of the prefects and david had to tiptoe delicately through the dangerzone since he owed fifty lines to cruikshank and had not yet written them though they were overdue but he reached the bathroom without encountering the enemy and wallowed in a heaven of water so hot that if he moved he must almost scream bags was in a neighbouring bath but finished his washing first and left david intent as the water cooled a little on matters of soap and mud between his toes then his rainsoaked head did not seem satisfactory and he washed the showers out emerging eventually towelgirt to rub his head into a semblance of dryness this was a tingling exhilarating affair and he accompanied it by bouts of piercing whistlings next door to the bathroom was maddoxs study and about this time he perceived that david had not filled his kettle for tea since davidfor his whistle betrayed himwas next door it was simpler to go and fill his kettle himself rather than go in to fetch david to do it there on the end of the bench below the steamclouded windows was david sitting his head enveloped in a towel violently scrubbing and whistling whenever the towel was not in actual contact with his mouth he had not noticed his entry and maddox thought it would be rather amusing to sit down without speech close beside him holding out in mute reproach the empty kettle that david should have filled this he did in a minute davids head was sufficiently dry to satisfy him and it emerged from its towel he looked round astonished to find any one there for bags had gone hullo maddox he said yes got to fill my kettle myself he said david jumped up i say im awfully sorry he said i bang forgot give it me but maddox still held it looking at him oh it doesnt matter he said just having a bath were you david paused there was maddox only looking at him only smiling but instantly he had some sense of choking discomfort he looked back at him frowning and puzzled and his sense of discomfort hugely increased he merely wanted to get away oh then i think ill go and dress he said hurriedly and picking up his sponge left the room and ran away down the dark passage to his dormitory david sat down on his bed for a minute feeling as if he had escaped from some distant nightmare that had vaguely threatened to come near him then very sensibly running away from it instead of thinking about it he began to dress in a great hurry he washed his hands over again went on rubbing his hair did anything to occupy himself in a few minutes bags came in dressed from his dormitory next door but david had no voluble conversation on hand as he had half an hour ago in the fivescourt and continued dressing in silence bags tried a few amiable topics but got no more response than grunts and monosyllables which were quite unlike davids usually rampageous loquacity after three or four thwarted attempts it was borne in upon his lucid mind that there was something the matter whats up blazes he inquired nothing why said david savagely oh i dont know you havent got as much to say as usual well who wants to talk to a chap like you asked david getting his tie in a knot and venting himself in irritation bags felt slightly hurt for he was unaware how he could have caused this but since david did not want to talk to a chap like him the most rudimentary sense of selfrespect forbade the chap like him to make any further overtures david cracked his nail over his collarstud failed to get any sort of parting in his hair and broke a bootlace these material adversities somehow sobered him and he began faintly to see that really bags had nothing to do with his own mood sorry bags he said at length having tied the ends of the broken bootlace together bags was the most amiable of mankind and besides this was david right oh he said at once but do tell me whats up if i can be of any use good old bags but you cant thanks awfully dont ask me anything about it if you dont mind suddenly the fact of the parcel at the lodge which he had forgotten to bring down for maddox presented itself he felt that he couldnt see maddox again just at once i say there is one thing you might do he said i wish youd come up to college with me and get that parcel of maddoxs i should be frightfully obliged if you would im going to tea with a fellow there and i should have to go up and down twice bags felt that if david offered this as an explanation of his illhumour it was a pretty thin one oh is that all youre so sick about he asked davids irritability returned all right dont come then he said david was ready by now and without another word he marched to the door he would have to bring the parcel up himself but he was determined to get somebody else to take it to maddoxs study wait a second said bags in a slightly injured tone of course ill come up with you david took his arm you are a brick he said but dont ask me anything more it isnt anything i expect ive made a fool of myself shouldnt wonder a bit said bags pacifically funny fellow dont strain yourself maddox had gone straight back from the bathroom to his study without filling his kettle he sat for ten momentous minutes in front of his fire without doing anything without thinking even but looking with open eyes so to speak on himself all these weeks that intense friendship which was springing up between himself and david had been splendidly growing and till now his influence over him had been exerted entirely for davids good he had constantly shielded him as on the night when he had found hughes sitting on his bed from all that could sully him he had checked any hint of foul talk in davids presence for of all his lovable qualities there was none so nobly potent to the elder boy than davids white innocence his utter want of curiosity about all that was filthy it didnt exist for him but the danger of it though thank god it was passed he knew that he himself had brought near to him then he got up and looked at himself in the mirror above his mantelpiece hating himself you damned beast he said you deserve to be shot presently there came a tap at his door and he remembered that he had told david to bring up a parcel for him probably this was not david for he usually whistled and hardly ever tapped on his answer bags entered oh its your parcel maddox he said blaize forgot to bring it down after we finished playing squash and so i went back with him and brought it maddox held out his hand for it thanks he said diddid blazes ask you to bring it me yes he was having tea in college has he gone there yes we went up together maddox got up right he said but hes forgotten to fill my kettle would you mind please that was exactly like maddox he always thanked fags who did things for him and treated them politely bags in consequence retired with pleased alacrity and returned getting on all right crabtree asked maddox no troubles oh no thanks i like it all awfully thats right i forget who your fagmaster is cruikshank oh yes hell look after you thanks for filling my kettle bags went delicately and rather proudly away cruikshank never thanked him maddox put his heel into the fire to make a level place for his kettle and sat down again to work but other thoughts kept interposing themselves between him and his books claiming precedence he knew from davids abrupt exit just now that he scented danger or if that was too strong an image just turned his back on the miry road that had been in maddoxs mind and his getting bags to do the forgotten errand confirmed that vaguely perhaps david had guessed something of the nature of that muddy place and had gone cleanfooted from it with much greater sureness maddox saw that if their friendship was to continue he must turn his back on it too and convince david that he had done so he was ashamed he hated himself the kettle boiled over sending a puff of steam and light ash into the grate and he took it off and put it in the fender and still he sat there looking backwards into his life and finding no comfort there and then looking forwards seeing a gleam of saving hope at last outside his study there came a familiar step but there was no whistling and after the step paused there came a tap at his door david entered looking shy and frightened oh i came to clear your things away and wash up he said hurriedly maddox did not want to shirk what lay before him the friendship that had become so intimately dear to him was at stake will you shut the door a minute david he said rising and standing by the mantelpiece with his face turned away david did so and remained by the door i want to say just one thing said maddox im damned sorry and i apologise you neednt be frightened of me it shant happen again thats all theres nothing to wash up i havent had tea some subconscious horror still lingered in davids mind he had been obliged to come back here to see to maddoxs washingup else perhaps maddox would have sent for him and that would have been worse at the moment he had no other desire in spite of what maddox had said but to get away ill go then he said quickly all right david left the room but he had gone only a little way down the passage outside when his feet simply refused to carry him any farther or to allow him to leave maddox like this all his love and his loyalty insisted that he was wrong not to trust the regret and the assurance that had been given him that he was doing a mean and cowardly thing to retreat like that but the talk that he had had with the head on his last day at helmsworth was very vivid in his mind the head had told him there was no use in arguing about certain things and his instinct in spite of his innocence told him that such vaguely and distantly were the things about which the head had spoken but the head had never told him to turn his back on a friend or to refuse to trust that which his heart knew was sincere and so once more from inside maddox heard a familiar step return and once more david tapped and entered i dont know why i went away he said or why i was frightened when you said i neednt be soso i came back sorry then he had the instant reward of his confidence he saw maddox look up at him with unshadowed eyes of affection he came and stood close to him its bang all right he said imim awfully glad its all right then a positive inspiration seized him there was nothing more to be said on this subject and the sooner it was dismissed the better he instantly became maddoxs fag again i say youre awfully late having tea he said why your kettles not boiling any longer maddox followed his lead no i took it off and forgot he said put it on again and theres a cake in the parcel bags brought take it out will you david tore open the bag two cakes he said which do you want now either you can stop and have tea with me if you like thanks awfully but i had tea with a chap in college well have another david considered this proposition simply on its own merits well i think i will he said but youve got a rotten fire shant i take your kettle to the gasstove yes good egg pour a little into the teapot first though hi not over my fingers sorry it didnt really touch you did it maddox laughed no of course not i should have smacked your head if it had thought it was going to just for safety said david i always swear before im hurt then they take more care yes stick my kettle bang in the middle of the gasstove say its mine if any one objects right said david itll be boiled in two shakes chapter ix david had been placed in one of the two parallel forms just below the lowest division of the fifth form when he entered marchester at michaelmas but failed to get his promotion at christmas and now in the middle of the lent term he was face to face with the fact that nothing in the world was more unlikely than that he should get out of it at easter there would be not more than half a dozen boys out of each remove promoted then and as his place was seventeenth in the list of the halfterm results lately published only a firstclass miracle the sort that does not occur would do it for him he had just received a letter on the subject from his father who as usual david thought failed to grasp the situation altogether but as david had not dreamed of telling his father what the situation really was it was not much to be wondered at that the archdeacon failed to grasp it but there were things you couldnt tell your people and this was one at the moment david was reading extracts to bags from this letter with comments interspersed he must have been an absolute infant phenomenon he said if he really got his promotion every term as he says nobody does now it simply isnt done and hes written to adams about my work blow him bad luck said bags and has asked whether i hadnt better have a private tutor in latin in the holidays continued the outraged david its really too sickening just as if one didnt have enough of the dreary fellows in the term and of course i had to lie about what goes on in the form he asked me at christmas whether there was any cribbing and i looked as if i simply didnt know what cribbing meant perhaps nobody cribbed when he was an infant phenomenon said bags david scratched his head its all rather rotten if you come to think of it he said i only crib sufficiently myself to get off impots and very often i run it too fine and dont crib enough but i do think its rot to crib your way to the top of the form cribbing wasnt meant for that plugs got full marks last euclid lesson just by copying the propositions slap out of the book he didnt have the decency to make a howler or two bags inserted a lump of sugar in a small hole which he had bitten in the rind of an orange and began to suck the sweetened juice he had come on amazingly during this last halfyear and david was no longer in the least ashamed of him as a pal he wasnt any good at games and consequently would have been an entire nonentity in any house except adamss but in adamss so the rest of the school thought even the juniors took an interest in all sorts of queer things like reading books which had got nothing to do with school work and knowing the difference between liberals and conservatives such topics and pursuits were held to be laudable affairs for the occupation of the mind in adamss and the daily paper was not merely the source from which it was discovered who had made a century in a county match adams had half the house in and out of his study all day and the conversation was generally supposed to be of the most abstruse type an odd thing was too that the house was just as keen on games as any other and was possessed of most of the competitive cups but having trained and practised and won their cup the house did not make this the sole topic of interest and congratulation this was not the usual plan and the consideration that bags had won at adamss would certainly not have been his elsewhere bags considered this short disquisition on the proper sphere of cribbing for a little he himself was in the parallel remove to davids where it so happened that no cribbing went on this was merely a question of fashion and was as arbitrary and inexplicable as all other fashions but as binding some forms cribbed some didnt local fashions not any sense of honesty directed it tisnt a satisfactory state of things though he said if everybody cribbed everything it would be all right because then everybody would get full marks david laughed but old tovey is a suspicious dog he said and in that case he might suspect something hes as blind as a bat and you can have your crib spread out on the desk bang in front of his nose and he wont see it he didnt ought to be a beak at all i put out my tongue at him the other day right out like that and held it there and he never saw i think beaks ought to have their eyesight tested every year or two like they do for the army to see if theyre competent he makes up for his eyes by his ears though if you try to prompt a fellow right at back of the room he hears likelike a megaphone bags continued to suck his orange till david had finished and then went on i repeat if everybody cribbed everything it would be all right he said and the only proper alternative is that nobody should crib nothing oh ah said david case of jerusalem the golden as applied to toveys when were all saints well wear nightshirts stead of pyjamas and golden crowns and bare hoofs dont be profane said bags youre going to be confirmed david wrinkled up his nose right oh said david lord do you remember the catechism classes at helmsworth david finished his fathers letter and tore it up grownup people seem to think that we think the same way as they do he said thats such rot we might just as well expect them to think the same way as us theyve forgotten about being fourteen and we never knew about being forty or fifty do you remember my paters sermon too about the chapel being the centre of school life just because the cathedral is the centre of his i think hes forgotten a lot about being a boy bags had a certain persistency about him cribbing he remarked i dont see why its any worse to get full marks for a thing by cribbing than to avoid an impot by cribbing either you crib or you dont if you crib why not crib it all i dont see that plugs is a bit worse than you blazes why dont you tell maddox all about it youre such pals with him though you are his fag my word you do have rum notions he said it would be sneaking maddox always whacks fellows if he finds they crib but just confidentially said bags simply imposh said david briefly the door of their study was open and at the moment plugs the wholesale cribber came whistling by his real name was gregson and he was freckled he put his head in and said frowsy beasts for no particular reason except that he felt cheerful i say plugs come in a minute said david havehave one of bagss oranges dont mind if i do said plugs politely that is if bags doesnt mind whats the row oh nothing but were just jawing about cribbing thought you might help not much to jaw about remarked plugs its a dead cert that nobody ever got out of toveys without if you mean that why thats your mistake said bags if nobody cribbed fellows would get out of toveys just the same didnt say that said plugs and the mistakes yours i said nobody ever had got out of toveys without cribbing no more they have what would happen if nobody cribbed aint the question every one always has cribbed in toveys since the year one you cant help it with an owl like tovey blazes cribs and hes threequarters way down whered you be without it blazes bim said david promptly there you are then cant think why you dont crib more and get higher but its such silly rot said bags youll crib yourself into the lowerfifth some time nobody cribs in lower fifth wherell you be then i shall be in the lower fifth remarked the astute plugs thats what i crib for then i shall stop cribbing and we all start again fair besides theres a sort of sport in cribbing you may always be nabbed itit sharpens the faculties oh theres a lot to be said for it it would sharpen them just the same to learn your work said bags it might but it would take longer i can learn a thing in half the time if i use a crib i say blazes theres extra confirmation class this evening whole of the second part of the catechi oh blast said david plugs got up and left an arid orangeskin on the table jolly good orange he said and now ive got a squash court want to play cant with this extra confirmationracket said david dont know a word of it crib it said plugs its quite short though tricky just like the third hole on the links lots of little bunkers david jumped up yes i think i will he said ill do catechi after dinner ill be changed in two shakes bagss ideas in this discussion about cribbing were limited to the possibility of its being made systematic it must be at once premised that no sense of the dishonourableness of the practice so much as entered his head but it was absurd that there should be no standard about it at present everybody in toveys cribbed according to his lights some to get full marks others more halfheartedly like david to avoid impositions and that owl tovey in his view was responsible for it it was not a fellow detected in cribbing who ought to get into a row but tovey who made such a state of affairs possible as stated before in the parallel form which bags graced by his presence cribbing was unknown this was probably owing to fashion but no doubt the extraordinary quickness of eye possessed by bills williams the formmaster had something to do with it there it was anyhow nobody cribbed in billss everybody cribbed in toveys and the same number of boys were terminally promoted from each division into the lower fifth bags himself ran a decent chance of promotion this half whereas david had none but he knew that he had not davids brains nor yet the half of them david for instance had been proxime accessit in the scholarship examination last summer whereas there had been no question of bags going up for it it was a rum world bags and david shared their study together presumably in equal quantities but it was easy to see which was the mastermind or from certain aspects of it the masterbody the room measured some ten feet by twelve and appeared to be chiefly given up to davids possessions and implements there were a couple of racquets in a press and a bag of racquetballs a squash racquet for which he presently rushed in buttoning his shirt a cricketbat an old deflated football and a bag of golfclubs there were schoolbooks about equally divided a few cribs belonging to david and on the walls some halfdozen rather thin watercolours of the archdeaconry and cathedral at baxminster executed posthaste by margery after the famous day when maddox had declared that it was the rippingest cathedral in england and davids house the rippingest house in the close there was also a penandink drawing made by david himself of the tower of the cathedral which leaned in an unsatisfactory manner till he had framed it slightly crooked in a cardboard mount which restored its dangerous want of equilibrium the two tables supposed to belong severally to them had been chiefly annexed by david since golfballs fivesgloves and such paraphernalia usurped the one while the other was littered with his books bags excavating a corner for himself when occasion absolutely demanded but this predominance of davids belongings was not accomplished so much by greed on the part of david as by bagss consistent selfeffacement when davids interests clashed with his own indeed it indicated one of the most popular points in bagss character namely that as everybody said he was so deucedly easy to get on with david was easy to get on with too owing to his intense appreciation of the humour of life in general and even when it was not humorous he thought it was which was a cheering way of looking at things but of the two david both publicly and privately was the substance and bags the shadow the shadow danced in obedience to that which threw it but this morning bagsthe nickname had stuck to him in the new school for it was simpler than crabtree and there was not anything else in particular to say about himbags was meditating a dance of his own independently of david he felt certain that if david had been in his division parallel to the one that he mildly cribbed in where cribbing happened not to be the vogue he would probably be somewhere near the top of the form though as it was he was threequarters of the way down david himself bore the weight of things as they were with complete equanimity for there they were and he cribbed sufficiently to avoid the tedium of impositions but not sufficiently to secure himself a decent place he appeared to be quite content with this state of affairs except in so far that it might lead to having a private tutor in the holidays whereas to bags it all seemed a gross miscarriage of justice no doubt if david turned to and worked with industry and zeal he might make his difficult way upwards but it was a tremendous handicap to be obliged to sweat your eyes out in order to get on level terms with people who slowly and correctly construed out of an english translation of the lesson and david would have been the first to turn up his nose at such a proposal it was less trouble to sit seventeenth in the form and avoid impositions bags was not very good at independent action his line was action that fell in with other peoples wishes and he meditated over any possible idea that might suggest itself to him in his new rle he would have liked to tell adams confidentially of course that remove a relied so largely on toveys wellknown shortsightedness but apart from the general feeling that this would be sneaking there was a considerable doubt in his mind as to how adams would take it adams was a splendid chap of coursethat was the only possible view to hold of him but it was undeniable that he didnt want to be bothered he liked things to be pleasant he liked fellows to come and sit about in his study with clean hands and a parting in their hair and to be happy and contented he liked them also to be interested in general topics and to bring their work to him for help but he did not like to know that schoolrules were being broken or that the house was not getting on in a saintly and successful manner he wanted it to manage its own affairs while he like a genial father coming home in the evening to his family saw only bright and cheerful faces round him once bags remembered cruikshank had consulted him on a case where bullying was suspected and bags at cruikshanks invitation had been present as a witness but cruikshanks reception though perfectly cordial had not been of a sort to encourage confidence adams had thanked him had appreciated his good intentions but had told him that he was sure the feeling of the house would prevent any such occurrence in the future the feeling of the house was the best jury and he wished to leave the matter in the hands of the prefects bags conjectured quite easily from his recollection of this what was likely to be his own reception if he informed adams confidentially that remove a consistently cribbed no that would not do and david had been horrified at the idea of maddox being told then quite suddenly all scheme of independent action was taken from bags somewhere down the passage a door was opened and davids name was shouted david in any case was not here having gone to play squash and though the voice was maddoxs bags saw no reason for going to tell him if david did not answer he would conclude that david did not hear probably maddox only wanted him in a general sort of way then came a step along the passage from the bathroom where the prefects studies were and along the corridor and round the corner and maddox entered genial and cordial as usual david out he asked why didnt you shout not at home but when he comes in you might tell him maddoxs eye wandered round the study i say what a godforsaken mess you and david keep your room in he said piles of books and golfballs in between whats this maddox suddenly took up from the table a book in a dark blue cover it was an english translation of thucydides edited by the obliging mr bohn is this yours he asked yes said bags instantly well i shall confiscate it and i shall whack you better come and be whacked now and get it over but its a damned bad plan to use cribs bags when you get into the fifth form youll find youre no end of a way behind fellows whove worked their way up instead of cribbing their way up got any more of these silly things lets have them all i dont want to search your study you know i would much sooner you gave me them all of them and told me there arent any more word of honour you know bags thought feverishly a moment there are several more he said right lets have them bags got down from the table where he was sitting feeling rather limp physically but quite resolved to see this through meantime unfortunately maddox had opened the volume of bohns thucydides with the idle habit of the booklover and turned to the titlepage and you wrote davids name in it though it was yours he asked here was an awful complication and what an unspeakable ass was david so thought bags to write his name in a crib he remembered his doing it now in greek characters he quite intensely wished he had not said it was his own but that he proposed to stick to and if maddox chose he might think him guilty of the unutterable meanness of owning a crib and writing a pals name in it yes i wrote blaizes name in it he said in greek but he did not say it particularly well or maddox was confoundedly sharp probably both oh thats a lie isnt it he said bags was between the devil and the deep sea and any other uncomfortable neighbours that are possible to a boy he had been quite prepared to take a whacking on davids behalf and though the flesh was weak his spirit really embraced the opportunity but now just as likely as not he was going to take a whacking on his own behalf without getting david off it was all pretty bad but how could he have foreseen that maddox would look at the titlepage or have forgotten that david had been such a juggins as to write his name there so being landed in this awkward place he made up his mind to stop there no thats all right he said i wrote blaizes name there maddox looked at him so it seemed to bags with a certain respectful sympathy and in davids handwriting he asked makings of a forger and are you doing thucydides this half david is i know because ive often given him construes but youre in the other remove arent you it was no use lying about this bags surrendered and told the truth yes in remove b he said then you cant be doing thucydides because they always do different books oh cave in out with it well then its blaizes crib said the unsuccessful bags so i knew why did you say it was yours i dont know said bags think then bags threw his sucked orange the third of them into the wastepaper basket because i thought youd just whack me and there wouldnt be any more bother he said maddox again looked sympathetic just to save blaize a whacking he asked bags suddenly took courage maddox was such a ripper he would understand no not altogether he said but i felt id sooner let you think it was mine than his hes so awfully proud of you i didnt want you to know that oh blast it all he added desperately maddox kicked the door shut you didnt want me to know he cribbed he said because then i shouldnt think him such an awfully decent chap about that said bags maddox nodded youre a good chap bags he said but ive found out that david cribs in spite of you and i shall whack him for it tisnt your fault you did your very best and a rather good one too to prevent it but cribbing is all rot i hadnt an idea david cribbed do other fellows in remove a crib much then bags saw his opportunity made for him from beginning to end here was maddox who mattered so much more than adams or any one else asking for information instead of being reluctantly saddled with it for a moment he hesitated since david had been so horrified at the thought of maddox being told but then maddox said taint sneaking bags im not going to make visitations cept on david in fact i want to clear things up bagss hesitation vanished yes they all crib in remove a he said itsits just the fashion blazes doesnt crib much only enough to avoid impots other fellows crib to get marks thats why hes so low never thought of that said maddox no why should you but there it is and do the fellows at the top of the form crib asked maddox remember youre not giving anybody away in the sneaking sense rather thats why theyre there maddox had sat down on a pile of books and golfballs and there was a rollingabout and spilling as he got up thanks he said ill think what can be done and remember you know nothing about it all but the fact that ive found a crib of davids is another matter send him to me when he comes in there was a piercing and cheerful whistle outside at this moment quite unmistakable and david burst gaily in hullo maddox he said hullo i say ive got a thucydides crib of yours here with your name written in it you silly ass collect all the cribs youve got and bring them to my study im going to whack you he waited a moment just to make sure that david was not going to say that everybody cribbed in remove a of course david said nothing of the kind and he went back to his study bags you ass said david innocent of all that bags had attempted to do why didnt you sit on it or something when he came in couldnt there simply wasnt time david searched his shelves swearing softly to himself and the result was a rather voluminous load i shall simply descend to the bottom of the form he said private tutor too in the easter holidays oh damn i think you might have managed something maddox lays on too its a blasted affair david had grown in breadth no less than in height during this last halfyear but it was an extremely limp figure that appeared in maddoxs study a few minutes afterwards with eight volumes of mr bohns classical series he had felt rather queer all morning and the sight of a racquethandle on the table gave him an unpleasant qualm maddox took the books from him these are all david he asked yes thats the lot anything to say asked maddox david might have had something to say namely that everybody cribbed in toveys but it never occurred to him however remotely to say it no he said cept that ive got beastly thin flannels on so i see im not going to jaw you as well as lick you but cribbings an utterly rotten game and i always whack anybody whom i find doing it so get over that chair i shall give you six gosh said david quietly presenting himself maddox gave him four and not in fun it was not meant to be fun and david felt the cold sweat stand on his forehead he could just prevent himself from crying out but there was not much to spare and he felt doubtful if he could stand two more but maddox at the same moment felt that he certainly couldnt and he threw the racquethandle into the corner thats enough he said david straightened himself up and turned round wiping the sweat from a very white face youyou can whack he said i say i feel rather bad may i there was a sudden singing in his ears and maddox caught him as he reeled and put him gently down into a chair as he leaned on him but davids faintness was only momentary and recovering almost instantly he saw that maddox was looking almost as queer as he himself felt im all right again he said i say thanks awfully for not giving me six rotten of me to feel squeamish but i couldnt help it i say for gods sake dont crib again david he said or anyhow dont let me catch you david smiled and got up rather gingerly he understood nothing of what was in his friends mind knowing only that he had been caught with a crib and that summary retribution had been most effectively carried out ill jolly well try not to he said right shake a paw then said maddox by the way bags tried to make me think the crib was histold me so in factbut then i found your name david stared jolly decent of bags he said but whatever did he do that for i expect hes rather fond of you remarked maddox maddox gave two days consideration as to the question of the next step to be taken and found the rival claims of honour and justice rather hard to reconcile as far as he himself was concerned he cared not one farthing what the remove a would think of him in case if as he thought he might have to do he went to adams or the head master with the information that cribbing was the fashion in that form but he realised that it would never do if it came out somehow that bags was the source from whom his information had been derived remove a would argue with irrefutable logic that somebody must have sneaked and would take all steps with all the ingenuity that was theirs to find out who had done so again there was david on whom suspicion might fall it would be certainly known that maddox had licked him for cribbing it would very likely be inferred that he in selfdefence though the selfdefence had proved singularly ineffective had tried to justify himself by saying that the practice was a universal one and that was precisely what david had refrained from saying it would be the rankest injustice that he should be executed for cribbing and disgraced by the supposition that he had attempted to justify himself on the other hand cribbing was a rotten system and maddox intended to do his best to stop it it was not easy to decide what to do and he turned all his acute boyish brain to the solving of the problem which to him seemed one of the utmost delicacy and importance it made all the difference to the wellbeing of the house which quite rightly was to him the world that remove a should cease to crib and that they should be unaware how the news of their habits had come to the authorities he wanted to take the wisest course and had he considered the matter a trivial one he would have been in his sphere and for his age every whit as culpable as the prime minister of a state who shrugs his shoulders at some astounding national abuse it mattered immensely and indeed more than he knew for the right management of the affairs of such small kingdoms as a house or a form in a public school goes to build up the foundations of the right management of the affairs of big kingdoms character and judgment are formed there a responsible boy takes into the big world exactly that which he has learned in smaller spheres maddox it may be remarked not being a prig did not indulge in those edifying reflections but only said to himself as he scratched his curly head im damned if i know what to do but his wise boys brain worked and explored and burrowed and two days after he went to his housemaster i hate bothering you sir he said but im in a fix cruikshank asked adams who knew there was not much cordiality lost between the two for himself he respected cruikshank but loved maddox oh no crookles and i are getting on all right thanks its another thing adams as has been stated disliked exercising his authority he held the slightly dangerous creed that a house managed itself best when left alone and that public opinion was the most effective check on irregular practices you always manage house affairs much better than i could frank he said dont know about that sir but this affects more than the house mr adams lit his pipe he rather wanted to play golf but maddox seldom bothered him with problems and it might be well to listen fire ahead then he said well sir i had to lick david a couple of days ago for having cribs began maddox why isnt the little beast higher in his form then remarked adams i was coming to that i learned fromwell from another fellowthat everybody cribs in remove a that its absolutely the regular thing which is rotten also i learned that david cribs only about enough to avoid impots whereas other fellows crib their way to the top of the class it isnt fair sir adams decided to go into this shut the door frank he said of course all you say is confidential unless you give me leave to mention it go on well sir its really all oldits mr toveys fault said maddox you see hes so jolly blind that fellows practically must crib then david has been suffering vicariously for mr tovey remarked adams maddox laughed yes sir about that he said adams relit his pipe funny thing this should have happened just now he said for mr tovey has been sent to bed with flue maddox gave a cackle of delight gosh what luck he said why instantly a scheme lit itself up in maddoxs head why sir you might suggest to the head that some of the prefectsparticularly me i meanshould take some of mr toveys work hes rather keen on that sort of thing dont you remember he told me to take your form for a couple of days when you were laid up last half well sir if you could manage that i descended on them out of the blue say tomorrow morning before they know that mr toveys gone sick i bet i can reap a lot of them in theyre sure to have learned their work with cribs and then you see ive got davids cribs and i can tell if their construing comes out of cribs o lord i see it all adams considered this and how about telling the head that the form cribs he asked perhaps hed join in and take some of the work himself maddox laughed again gosh what a time remove as going to have he said but the head mustnt make it retrospective it must all be found out afresh sir if you see what i mean adams nodded yes he said the head will understand that later in the day a conference between the powers hostile to remove a was held the powers in question being the head adams and maddox and a diabolical plan of campaign was hatched the classical work of the form hitherto presided over blindfold so to speak by mr tovey was to be taken with the suddenness of a thunderstorm by maddox not a word was to be said he was simply to march in at early school next day and open fire on his own system the lesson was virgil and that evening he closely studied the excellent translation as given by mr bohn in the volume he had confiscated from david construing began from the top of the form and boy after boy translated with extreme elegance and fluency and maddox was beaming and complimentary among his other weird accomplishments he knew shorthand and screened by the sloping cover of his desk he made an accurate transcript of what the translation of each boy had been yes very good very good indeed he said when this was finished quite a lot of you have got full marks he opened the lid of his desk and took out of it the virgil crib which he had confiscated from david three days before i hadnt time to mug it all up he remarked and so i shall just read you through a translation out of a crib whichwhich came into my possession a few days ago he began read a line or two then stopped and consulted his shorthand notes then he nodded to the top of the form just the expression you used he said genially he went on a little farther i think that is how you translated it plugsi mean gregson he observed to the second boy this was not quite comfortable and uneasy glances passed about who could possibly have expected that maddox would bring a crib into form there was a really distressing parallelism between it and the renderings given by most of the boys and in consequence there were pensive faces but maddox made no further comment and proceeded to ask a few questions about grammar and now he said you will turn on a hundred lines farther and translate on paper the twelve lines beginning at line you will use no books at all for this neither dictionaries nornor any other there was a quarter of an hours silence broken only by the scratchings of labouring pens the unlucky gregson who had been positively brilliant over the prepared lines could make neither head nor tail of the fairly elementary passage that maddox had set and ventured on a protest i say mr tovey never gives us unseens he said i dare say but i do remarked maddox suppressed giggles this was rather a score nor do i allow laughing he added decidedly this hour was not going very comfortably and no alleviation was possible for it was somehow quite hopeless to think of ragging maddox it was also very nearly hopeless to translate this unknown passage and then a thing far more dreadful happened than any that had gone before the door of the classroom opened and the head entered in rustling silk gown he nodded to maddox who got up all going well he said in mr toveys absence the form did not think so but unfortunately the head had not asked them what are you doing with them maddox he said virgil lesson sir he said weve had the prepared lesson and ive set them a short unseen very good practice said the head and the marks for the seen translation were satisfactory yes sir very said maddox excellent please take the unseen translations over to my house after school and i will look them over myself it isnt fair to give you all the work yes sir said maddox the head still lingered by maddoxs desk in a rather beastly fashion and peered he was a little shortsighted at maddoxs shorthand notes and what are those cabalistic symbols he asked just notes i took in shorthand of the fellows translations sir he answered ha i shall like to compare these with the unseen write them out for me maddox will you and bring them over to me and this he took up the volume of bohns translation which maddox had been reading out of its a bohn sir said maddox i brought it in myself i hadnt time to learn up the lesson and i thought id better have a crib by me the head so thought the eager audience looked rather stern for a moment then quite naturally he laughed i shall confiscate that he said looking pleasantly round better practice for you maddox to get up your lesson without one he rustled out again leaving uneasiness behind him it had been rather sport to see maddoxs crib taken from him but behind that somewhat superficial pleasure there was a vague idea that dangerous things were getting into dangerous hands maddox had been bidden to supply the shorthand notes of the prepared translation which would reveal the parallelisms between mr bohns renderings and that of the remove a it would be a dreadful thing if the head in an abstracted moment consulted mr bohn also added to that there was the fact that the head was going to look over the unseen work and would no doubt be struck by the amazing contrast between that and the prepared lesson it was almost too much to expect that he would credit the form with such extraordinary industry and taste as to have prepared their set piece so perfectly and yet to be so lamentably wanting over an unseen such at least was the private meditation of most of remove a who wished severally and collectively that they had not been so brilliant over the first part of the lesson breakfast and desultory confabulation when the form assembled again for the next lesson had not tended to make things more comfortable but there was nothing whatever to be suspicious about as to the manner in which those illomened decrees of fate had unfolded themselves mr tovey had happened to have influenza the head had happened to tell maddox to take his place and maddox had happened to set them an unseen and to take shorthand notes of their previous translation and the head had happened to come in to see how maddox was getting on and had taken for his own delectation a crib shorthand notes made manifest and those dreadful attempts at an unseen all this was hurriedly debated after remove a assembled for second school awaiting the arrival of maddox who was a little late and so it was sarcastically said was probably mugging up the thucydides lesson in another crib then the uneasiness increased into dismay for the door opened and there appeared not maddox at all but the head himself he had a packet of papers in his hand which were rightly and instantly conjectured to be the virgil unseen of the hour before dr hamilton did everything rather quietly and slowly and was distinguished for a politeness of manner that on occasion became terrible he had never been as far as the school was aware notable for athletic prowess but in spite of this defect he was always a keen observer of cricket and football matches and was certainly intelligent about these matters so that his heart was felt to be in the right place it was quite certain also that his head was in the right place for he had been the senior classic and chancellors medallist at cambridge a fact which was viewed in the light of a strong testimonial in favour of the dead languages but quite apart from any of his accomplishments was the cause of the awed respect in which he was held and though the sixth themselves could not have told you why he was so impressive a person the reason except to boys was not far to seek it was the justness and the bigness of him his charactera thing not definable by those whose characters are not yet formed but quite clearly appreciable by them to please the head was worth effort his praise was of the nature of a decoration it may be added that it was quite as well worth an effort to avoid displeasing him he went with his rustling gown gathered up in his arm straight to the desk that mr tovey was wont to occupy and for five awful minutes without the slightest allusion to thucydides continued reading from the sheaf of papers he carried with him he did not look at all pleasant as occasionally he made a note or occasionally drew his thick blue pencil across a page and all the time the hapless remove a sat in a state of confirmed pessimism it was noticed that he had divided his sheaf into two packets he came to the end of it and tore up across and across the larger packet of the two the rest numbered perhaps half a dozen sheets then he spoke i have never seen a worse set of unseen translations than those which the form showed up to maddox this morning he said some halfdozen are passable and one that of blaize is good or nearly so blaize yes sir said blaize what is your place in the form by the halfterm marks seventeenth sir said david from his lowly abode the head glared at him and spoke very advisedly that is a disgraceful place for a boy who can make such a decent unseen translation he observed this had precisely the effect that that diabolical head had intended rather bad luck on blaize reflected the form generally to be whacked for cribbing and then to be slated by the head for being so low the head paused a moment you may close your books for the present he said and listen to what i have to say to you it is an extremely serious matter before doing your unseen you construed a piece of prepared work and out of the twentyfour boys in the form sixteen got practically full marks for it you may remember that at last lesson i took away from maddox the crib he had brought in with him and i also took the transcription of the shorthand notes he had made i see by referring to the crib that all or i think nearly all of the boys who got full marks had used that crib they had not even the sense to alter their translations so that their indebtedness to it should not have been so glaringly obvious they are fools in fact as well as knaves and i have no use in remove a or in any other part of the school for either now i have not the slightest intention of asking any of you if you used a crib or not because without your telling me i know that you did i will just take one instance the first that comes to hand gregson translated his prepared lesson perfectly and in it used three expressions which were identical with expressions in bohns translation his unseen on the other hand was simply beneath contempt i use his name only as the first that occurs to me and i do not single him out as being a worse offender than many others nor do i wish him or any of you to confess still less to deny that he used a crib he and you alike are a very rotten set of fellows the form generally during this quiet and biting address was growing stiff with horror and gregson who as plugs had conversed so lightly in bagss study about the advantages of cribbing was feeling singularly empty it was one thing to talk airily about the merits of the system but they were not so apparent when the head spoke like this about its demerits he let this sink in for a bit without looking at poor plugs any more than at anybody else then he continued i have looked through the marks of the halfterm he said and it is quite inconceivable to me that such high marks as those earned by the boys who are at the top of the form could have been come by honestly i am therefore going to cancel the whole of the marks which today determine your places and begin fresh with the marks for the unseen which i have just looked over you will therefore now take your places in the new order which i shall read out and the whole of the marks of the term hitherto are cancelled if any boy high or low in the newly constituted form has the slightest protest to make he will please state it fully and i will listen to it with respect i am not talking sarcastically and i only want to do justice roughly no doubt but to the best of my power i dare say you have all used cribs to a certain extent but i do not want to go into that unless any one wishes me to it is dishonest to use cribs at all and there is the end of the matter i will however go into any individual case for the purpose of doing justice you may talk it over among yourselves if you wish and while you do so i will leave your classroom and come back when you have made up your minds if any boy wishes me to go he will please hold up his hand and go i will no notice will be taken by me of the owner of any hand that is held up they could appreciate that there was a justice about it that commanded respect but though the heads promise was implicitly trusted by all present not a hand was held up the head gave ample time for this i take it then you are satisfied he said at length you will therefore take your places in the new order and do not take any books out of your desks before you take your new places i will read the list and each boy will take his place according to these marks as his name is read there was the scraping of boots the stir of changed places and in a couple of minutes the new order was established and now said the head every boy will look in his new desk and give to its previous occupant all its contents with the exception of any cribs that there may be there now make the exchanges and place all cribs you find in front of my desk there was an impression at this point that the head was showing ignorance he should have known that most cribs were not brought into school at all and that the large majority of them were securely reposing in their owners studies but here they reckoned without their host some dozen books were given up a very meagre total and the form generally wrong once more expected that the head would make a desktodesk visitation himself he did nothing of the kind you will now he said each of you go to the house and the study of the boy whose place you now occupy and bring me all the cribs you find there i have told maddox to go round after you i sincerely hopesincerelythat he will find nothing to do if he does the consequences will be quite serious i shall come back here in exactly twenty minutes and shall expect to find the books ready piled here maddox will go his rounds after you have finished and report to me you all of you share studies with other boys and you will understand that all cribs found therein will be brought here whether belonging to members of this form or not now you had the opportunity of consulting each other before and you must not consult now if any of you dont know the house to which the owner of your present desk belongs ask the head got up rustled down the room and went out looking neither to right nor left a perfectly silent form dispersed they were back again in their places before he reappeared in front of his desk was a solid pile of books he did not even glance at them we will now do our thucydides he said who is the top boy of the form you blaize what chapter of what book are you at book three sir said david chapter fourteen read the greek then aloud till i stop you and then construe a rather trying halfhour followed the form generally was addled with emotion and it was almost a relief when maddox appeared from his search he had no fresh and incriminating volumes with him but he might have left them outside well said the head no sir said he i couldnt find any more and his eye fell almost respectfully on the appalling pile already found thanks said the head i am glad please take the lesson tomorrow morning he instantly resumed thucydides gregson read and translate he said poor plugs at the end the head got up there is no need to speak to you further he said because i think you all understand i may say however that any boy found using a crib in the future will be flogged and degraded into the fourth form you will find it unwise to try at least i think so he gathered up his gown and for the first time apparently saw the heap of books piled in front of his desk the lowest six boys of the form will bring those silly volumes across to my house he said the head boy will count them here and then come across when they are all removed and count them again to see that the numbers tally you understand blaize yes sir said david and i am ashamed of you all said the head chapter x davids soft grey hat with housecolours on it was tilted over his eyes to screen them from the sun and he lay full length on the hot dry sand above highwater mark on the beach at naseby stupefied and simmering with content his arms bare to the elbow in rolledup shirt sleeves were extended and he kept filling his hands with sand and letting it ooze out again through the interstices of his fingers in a pleasant tickling manner hourglass fashion though the action evoked in him neither edifying nor melancholy reflection on the subject of the passing of time beside him lay two coats and two bags of golfclubs for he and maddox with whom he was staying had just come back from a morning round of golf and had gone down to the shore to bathe before lunch they had tossed up as to which of them should go to fetch towels and maddox having lost had just disappeared up the steep crumbling path that led to the top of the sandcliffs where was perched the house his mother usually took for the summer holidays a few hundred yards farther north these cliffs broke into tumbled sanddunes and stretches of short velvety turf where greens nestled in elysian valleys surrounded by saharas maddox would be absent some ten minutes and david let his lazy thoughts float down the stream of the very pleasant thinkings which made up his extreme contentment he did not direct them but let them drift going swiftly here eddying round there while the memoryshores of the last few months glided by in the first place and perhaps most important of all he was staying here with his friendthis was an eddy he went round and round in it though he had been here three days already passing them entirely with maddox playing golf with him playing tennis with him bathing with him and quite continuously talking to him david could not get used to this amazing situation he called him frank too just as if he was nobody in particular and at the thought of it david rolled over on to his side wriggling and said lord it was but a little more than a year ago that he had been in his own phrase a scruggy little devil with stagbeetles capable it is true of heroworship and able to recognise a hero when he saw him for had not his heart burned within him when going up for his scholarship examination the demigod had thrown a careless word to him it was quite sufficient then that maddox the handsomest fellow in the world the best bat probably that marchester had ever produced and altogether the most glorious of created beings should have noticed him at all indeed that was more than sufficient it was sufficient that maddox should exist and since then only a year had passed and here he was calling him frank and leaning on his arm when so disposed and tossing him who should get towels and staying with his mother often she would say something to him in french unconscious which language she talked and frank would answer in french which seemed wonderfully romantic though their ages were so diverse for frank was eighteen and david fifteen and three years when the combined total is so small make a vast difference here staying with him david hardly felt the gap at school it was otherwise a hundred seasons sundered them but here they were equal all difference was swallowed up in friendship friendship even swallowed up heroworship sometimes david dwelled gluttonously on the steps that had led up to this there was that meeting at baxminster with the splendid adventure of the second edition of keats and here he made an agitated excursion into the fate of that he and margery had decided to sell it and had got the enormous sum of twelve not ten pounds for it but the glory of that had been abruptly extinguished for their father had insisted that their equal shares should be invested in the savings bank to roll up at some beggarly rate of interest and do no good to anybody really grownup people were beyond words he dismissed this distressing topic and hitched on to maddox again publicschool life began with his installation as fag and there heroworship had soared like a flame day by day until that afternoon when after playing squash with bags in the rain he had gone back to the house for a bath david had always avoided the thought of that it remained a moment quite sundered from the rest of his intercourse with frank embarrassing and to be forgotten like the momentary opening of a cupboard where nightmare dwelt anyhow it had been locked again instantly and the key thrown away never a sound had again issued therefrom thereafter came a flood of jolly things to swim in after the new arrangement in remove a consequent on that monumental cribbingrow he had got into the lower fifth at easter and would when he went back at michaelmas find himself in the middle fifth frank had made him work with intelligence and industry as well though the distractions of the summerhalf had been frightfully alluring for david was really coming on as a wily lefthand bowler and it had been extremely difficult to give more than casual attention to the commentaries of julius csar when his inmost mind was wrapped up in cricket it was not hundreds of overs but thousands of them that david delivered in imagination when he ought to have been crossing the alps with hannibal or challenging medeas strange use of the pluperfect when that infuriated lady was in the act of stabbing her children but he had got his remove and a satisfactory report of his work so that there was peace and joy at baxminster and his father sanguinely prophesied that he would go up into a fresh form every term as he himself had done halfway through the summerhalf had come the most intoxicating possibility namely that he had a chance of getting his housecolours for cricket his very first year at school this was a thing nearly unheard of though of course maddox had done it but he had been tried in housematches and had done rather well then that hope had gone to the grave for when maddox put up the list of the completed houseeleven his name did not appear but he had known that it was not going to do so already and the manner of its exclusion was secretly to him almost a greater gratification than its appearance would have been that too lying on the hot sand he turned greedily over in his mind licking the chops of memory it had happened thus he had come one afternoon into maddoxs study just before the final promotions were made and maddox opened the subject david would you be fearfully sick if i didnt give you your housecolours he asked abruptly david had already allowed himself to hope for even to expect them and the sunshine went out of life i think i should he said not that it matters a hang i say im going up town do you want anything no thanks but just wait a minute oh dont look like that davids face had taken an expression of the most stygian gloom sorry he said of course i was an ass to hope it no you werent said maddox but ive been bothering about it and i thought id talk to you its like this you and ozzy have about equal claim and if we werent such pals i think i should toss up which of you i gave colours to but the house would think i was favouring you if i put you in theres another thing too its ozzys last year and your first i dont know that that matters so much so if you find yourself left out itll be because were pals see david moved a step nearer the woe had gone from his face gosh then leave me out he said ii prefer being left out if thats it really asked maddox yes rather andand thanks ever so much there had been no need for more than these jerked telegraphic sentences but david went up town treading on air with a secret heavenly pride that was certainly among the rippingest feelings he had ever had he congratulated ozzy with complete sincerity and here was frank himself sliding down the crumbling sandpath with towels frank threw a towel at him and knocked off his hat mothers lunching out he said so we can bathe just as long as we please without being late oh and she said to me need youthats yougo away on saturday i said id ask you david had no hesitation over this no of course i neednt he said at least at least said frank emptying the sand out of his shoes i mean are you sure im not being a bore i should love to stop of course but wont you and your mother get blasted sick of me dont think she will said maddox gravely i shall rather but it doesnt matter in fact i was wondering whether perhaps youd mind going on friday instead of saturday david laughed thats a poor shot at getting a rise out of me he said absolute failure i shant go away on friday or saturday frank just shrugged his shoulders and stifled a yawn with dreadful versimilitude david gave him one short anxious glance and that wasnt such a poor shot after all said frank just for a second you wondered if i was in earnest no i didnt said david promptly and thats a lie said frank david gave it up and lay back on the sand again beginning to unbutton i know it is he said you yawned jolly well frank picked up a handful of the dry powdery sand and let it trickle gently into the gap of shin that showed between the end of davids trousers and the beginning of his sock this caused him to spring up lord whats that he said oh i see funny i thought it was a bug of sorts well if you will grow so that your trousers only reach halfway down your legs what else is to be done with the intervals asked frank i grew two inches last half said david i shall be taller than you before ive done very likely you will be the image of a piece of asparagus if you like that and certainly if you grow up to the size of your feet youll be big enough i shall call you spondee davids shirt was half over his head but he paused and spoke muffled because why he asked because a spondee is two long feet david gave a great splutter of laughter as his shirt came off oh quite funny he said wish i had guessed jove doesnt the sea look good im glad it was made andand that i didnt die in the night you didnt bring down anything to eat did you isnt it bad to bathe on an empty tummy or is it a full one dont know im going to bathe on my own anyhow david theres a sharp line round your neck where your clothes begin when youve got any as if youd painted your neck with the sprainstuff iodine i did said david fatuously standing nude come on the ripping old seas waiting for us the tide was high and the beach steep so that a few steps across the belt of sand all atremble in the heat and a few strokes into the cool tingling water were sufficient to snatch them away from all solid things and give them the buoyancy of liquid existences the sea slept in the windlessness of this august weather and as if with longtaken breaths a silence and alternate whisper of ripple broke along its rims far out a fleet of herringboats with drooping sails hovered like greywinged gulls above an unclouded sun shone on the shining watery plains and on the two wet heads one black one yellow that moved out seawards with sidestroke flashings of white arms clawing the sea amid a smother of foam farther and farther they moved out till at last david rolled over in the water and floated on his back oh ripping he said good old mother sea frank turned over also and lay alongside its like something i read yesterday he said as the heart of usoh something and somethingathirst for the foam i seem to remember it well dont i yes what is it anyhow who did it fellow called swinburne good man is swinburne at times lord you can lie down on the sea like a sofa if you get your balance right oh dear me yes swinburne knows a trick or two for instance when the hounds of spring are on winters traces the mother of months in meadow and plain fills the shadows and windy places with lisp of leaves and ripple of rain and the bright brown nightingaleoh how does it go he lay with head awash and eyes half closed against the glare and the spell of the magical words framed itself more distinctly in his mind o listen david he said drink it in for winters rains and ruins are over and all the season of snows and sins the day dividing lover and lover the light that loses the night that wins and time remembered is grief forgotten and frosts are slain and flowers begotten and in green underwood and cover blossom by blossom the spring begins david would have appreciated this in any case but never had any poem so romantic a setting as when frank repeated it to him here as they lay side by side right out away from land away from anything but each other and this liquid paradise of living water ohoh he said rapturously and whats the name of it go on though frank thought a moment cant remember the next verse he said but its atalanta in calydon oh shes the chap that went out hunting with her maidens said david confidently she is look out theres a jellyfish all right its floating by i say the waters as warm asasi dont know i think youre babbling said david go on about atalanta did she have good sport maddox laughed forgetting that he was balanced in a briny sea and swallowed a large quantity of it whats the row asked david what did i say maddox ejected as much of the water as was accessible oh you are such a kid he said and i keep forgetting it david kicked himself into a perpendicular position and trod water well im getting older as quick as i can he said in selfdefence blast i wish it could go on for ever what as if you didnt know being in the sea and being with you and being alive and so on same here said frank lord but i wish i could be the sea as well rather jam but i dont think id allow everybody to bathe in me said david dogs yes and some people not all or should we charge a shilling and let anybody maddox pushed himself upright in the water fraid we ought to come out he said it must be latish ill race you to shore right oh give me twenty yards start measure them very carefully said frank well twenty strokes then said the wily david shoving from franks shoulder to get a movement on and then taking very long slow strokes letting his impetus exhaust itself now he said both boys swam with the overhand sidestroke breathing whenever their heads happened to be above water and ploughed landwards with waves of bubble and broken water behind them frank overtook the other in the last thrilling ten yards won by the length of an arm and a head and panting but still cool they lay for a little in the shallow water and then reluctantly went up over the beach to where their clothes lay there the hot sun soon rendered superfluous the towels frank had been at pains to fetch and presently after they laboured up the sandy path to the house slack and hungry and content with the half of the wonderful day still in front of them once on the upward ascent david paused his mind going back to the magic of words oooh he said again rapturously blossom by blossom the spring begins i shall read some more of that after lunch lunch took a considerable time for davids appetite like his bones and muscles seemed but to grow larger with the food he ate and it was not till he had taken franks evil advice and drunk a second bottle of gingerbeer that he declared himself able to turn his attention to literature again they were going to play golf once more in half an hour and david staggered out on to the lawn to lie on the shady terracebank for a short spell of swinburne which frank went to fetch from his bedroom letters had arrived during lunch and he found one for himself and one for david which with swinburne and the daily paper that would contain one important matter namely the result of the county match between sussex and surrey he took out with him theres a letter for you he said and theres swinburne and the daily telegraph what order of merit oh telegraph first said david i bet you that surreyoh this letters from margery might just see whats going on i say i know exactly how a balloon feels but it was jolly good gingerbeer frank flopped down on the bank by him and began opening his letter what else do you expect he said if you inflate yourself with gas as you did at lunch dont expect anything else said david thickly and it was you who suggested it i think i must see what happened in the match first well lets have a look too you selfish devil said maddox putting down his halfopened letter cant you turn over and put the paper on the grass here so that we can read it together lord no said david at least itd be a risk but i can sit up if i do it slowly sussex which had the good fortune to be davids county and for which he felt rather responsible had done him credit on this occasion and had won by half a dozen wickets the rest of the paper did not seem to contain anything that mattered and throwing it aside he and frank began on their letters margerys was quite short though good of its kind and having finished it david looked up and saw that frank was reading his and that there was trouble in his face oh i say is anything wrong he asked frank did not reply at once ive heard from adams he said at length theres been a row some letter has been found and hughes isnt to be allowed to come back in september why what sort of letter asked david then as frank was still silent oh something beastly is it he asked what an ass hughes is he was such a nice chap too at my other school frank had finished reading and was looking out over the surrey garden biting his lip i say frank whats wrong with you said david frank gave adamss letter to him read it he said david took it it spoke of the letter written by hughes to a boy in the house a letter disgusting and conclusive then it spoke of the disgrace hughes had brought on himself and the misery he had brought on his father and mother he read it and gave it back to frank well im awfully sorry just as you are he said but if fellows will be brutesold adams seems no end cut up about it but somehow id ceased to be pals with hughes wheres the swinburne but still frank did not answer and david knitted puzzled brows whats up he said maddox turned over on to his back and tilted his hat over his eyes till his face was invisible i might have been hughes he said again the memory of what david always turned his face from came into his mind oh rot he said lamely hating the subject maddox was silent a moment tisnt quite rot he said but then there came a thing which i dare say youve forgotten only i havent you came in from playing squash one wet afternoon and you and your innocence made me suddenly see what a beast i was david could not help giving a little shudder but the moment after he was ashamed of it i dont care what you were like before he said but what im perfectly sure of is that since theni remember it very wellyouve been all right yes there you are then said david frank was still lying with his hat over his face but now he pushed it back and looked at david its all serene for you he said because youve always been a straight chap but its different for me i feel just rotten david scratched his head in some perplexity the whole matter was vague and repugnant to him and he did not want to hear more or know more there were such heaps of jolly proper things in the world to be interested in and curious about but he understood without any vagueness at all and with the very opposite of repulsion that his friend was in trouble and that he wanted sympathy with that so the whole of his devoted little heart went out there it was bad trouble too the worst trouble a fellow could have it must be perfectly beastly for you he said and im as sorry as i can be but youre sorry yourself and what more can a chap do if you werent sorry it would be different theres another thing too to set against what youve done and thats how youve behaved to me youve been an absolute brick to me youve kept that sort of filth away from me i know you have david paused for a moment this morning alone on the hot beach his mind had dwelt long and eagerly on this wonderful friendship and now just when it was the very thing that was wanted to comfort frank this aspect of it struck him he remembered how often frank had by a seemingly chance word discouraged him from seeing much of certain fellows in the house he remembered the night when hughes came and sat on his bed and with what extraordinary promptitude frank had ejected him he remembered how his dormitory had been changed and he had been put in franks and had since then slept in the bed next him all this with swift certainty started into his mind and with it the policy that lay behind it frank had consistently kept nasty things away from him here was his atonement so he went on eagerly i know what youve done for me he said youve alwayssince thenhad an eye on me and kept filth away im no end grateful and since youve done that chalk it up on the other side youve made it easier for me to be decent oh damn im jawing david suddenly became aware of this and stopped abruptly rolling over on to his side with his face to his friend havent you been doing that on purpose he demanded i could give you heaps of instances well yes then lets chuck the whole subject said david in a moment i just want to tell you i tried instead of corrupting you to uncorrupt myself but you did it it was all your doing you made me ashamed david gave a shy little wriggle towards him i never heard of anything so ripping he said though it sounds rather cheek maddox sat up thats what youve done he said and if it was cheeky the other name of that is salvation there was silence a moment and probably david had never known such intense happiness as he tasted then and just because he was feeling so deeply the idea of anything approaching sentiment was impossible it had been said and the harvest was garnered frank felt that too they could not feel differently from each other just then and away went the whole subject a mountain a few minutes ago and now light as thistledown on a summer wind its done he said oh what was the other thing we brought out atalanta in calydon wasnt it first chorus yes that would be ripping said david at the same time its just struck three and we were to play golf at three jove so we were how you must have jawed for one second david was not quite certain whether frank was trying to get a rise out of him or not with such naturalness did he speak sorry he said quickly im afraid i did frank laughed david its no sport trying to get a rise out of you he said you simply rise at anything i really didnt think youd rise at that oh all right said david then it was a nice surprise for you come on if youll give me a stroke hole illill probably get beaten he added in a sudden accession of modesty most unusual i say what a ripping day its being taint bad and youre not such a bad little devil this bordered on past conversation again and he hastened away from it go and get our clubs david he said i lost the toss about the towels this morning thats not fair said david we tossed this morning and thats finished well toss again heads well then it isnt its tails but ill go if you like it was still very hot and the links although the usual august crowd was at naseby were nearly deserted since it seemed to most of the world to be the better part of wisdom to sit quiet till the heat had a little abated and resume activities again after tea the two boys therefore had an empty green before them and since finance in both their cases happened to be precarious and there was no need to keep their places on the green they took no caddies on the right along the first hole lay the sea shimmering and still so near that it was easily possible to say the least of it to slice a ball on to the beach and in front lay the fairway of the course stretches of velvet grass interrupted by tossing seas of sanddunes fringed and bearded with coarse bents while a flag planted thereon showed where lay the direction of the desired haven then came trudges through sandy places with breathless suspense to see whether the balls had carried the last of the bunkers and in other cases the equally vivid conviction that they had done nothing of the sort and would be found nestling in little steep bare hollows and bedevilled hidingplaces david in especial found himself frequently in amazing and awful places of which satan had certainly been the architect but in spite of the intimate nature of all that had passed between the two so few minutes before their unbroken solitude together did not produce in either of them the least wish to reopen the subject it had been closed a door had been triumphantly slammed on it so that even if golf had not been so absorbing they would neither of them have mentioned it again and yet deep down in each and unknown to them all that had passed had taken root and was silently germinating making fibre in their unconscious minds building up the stem on which character bursts into blossom many words were consciously spoken and many thoughts thought and all the words and all the thoughts did not stray beyond the fortunes of the little white indiarubber balls at marchester golf was a recognised school game played on their own links for the two winter halves when it did not interfere with cricket and frankit was just like him so thought davidhad become a fine player with really no trouble at all he had only played for two years but at school he was a scratch player and here at naseby had just won a medal prize starting from four he confessed that it had come easy to him everything seemed to and to davids observant eye he did not seem to do anything particular that caused him not to top one drive and send the next spouting in the air like a geyser when it came to approaching it was with the same supple ease that he flicked the ball high with a little fid of turf flying after it it all appeared so perfectly simple you merely hit the ball with the middle of the club at times if you were playing against him the thing became almost monotonous whatever could be said about davids play it could not be called monotonous he gave an excellent example of his methods this afternoon at the third hole slicing far and gorgeously from the tee out on to the sand there had been no interest in franks drive it had merely gone straight and a very long way and so he came with david to walk up his ball which was found to be lying fairly well silly ass he said to him as david took out an iron and prepared to play with it take your niblick and make certain of getting back on to grass but i could get on to the green with an iron if i hit it said david excitedly and then i should be there in two and you cant get them in less than two and ive got a stroke and should win the hole off you if i putted my first near it right oh said frank never mind the ifs not an atom said david the ball was not lying so very badly and there was really a certain excuse for david so he took his iron and hit the ball rather firmly on the head it went about fifteen yards in an injured manner and settled itself in the moat of what had been a childs sandcastle and itll take the deuce of a putt to get near the hole from there remarked frank david as always took his game very seriously and for a moment felt merely wild with rage impotent ineffective rage nobody cared hell he began then his admirable temper asserted itself before he settled what hell was going to do oh dear youre always right frank he said niblick it is and i wish it had been before now im going to take trouble he shifted with his feet in the loose sand as frank had told him to do till he got a firm stance then which frank had never told him to do he took the most prodigious wipe at his ball and shut his eyes as the sand fell in showers round him didnt see it he said what happened somehow or other he had hit the ball clean and hard and perfectly straight for the green it wasnt a niblick shot at all nobody david least of all knew how it had happened well of all the almighty flukes said frank probably on the green david bubbled with laughter oh i say what sport he said now i know how to play golf if you lie rather badly take an iron and make it worse then take a niblick and hit it home they went back to the course to walk up franks ball it was lying impeccably twenty yards short of the shoredup bunker that guarded the green and for once he was not monotonous he chipped at it with a lot of backspin and it bounced against the boards of the bunker and fell at their feet thereafter he played racquets against the boards then he gave it up and david the reckless and unreasonable was lying just a foot beyond the bunkers in such wise the hot heavenly afternoon went by dreadful and delightful things happened frank after long consideration as to whether he could get over the brook with a drive at the tenth hole decided to play short with a cleek and pitched full into it david with two strokes in hand putted four times at the eleventh before he got down and both of them trying to carry the far bunker at the thirteenth topped into the near one instead but there were delightful incidents to balance these distressing ones frank holed a mashie shot at the sixteenth and at the next david ran through two not one bunkers off a topped drive and a third with his second shot but deep down below the basis of their enjoyment was their friendship and neither thought how easily that priceless possession might have foundered and been lost in quagmires frank won a wholly loathsome putt on the last green which went into the hole not by the honest frontdoor nor even with a kick at the honest back door but with a stealthy sideway entrance after circling round the hole decided the match oh good putt said david politely and instantly the politeness broke down gosh what a fluke he added rot i tried to hole it and did said frank well i said good putt once said david and i cant say it again simply cant after tea at the clubhouse it seemed a necessity to play again and this time regardless of financial stringency frank treated david to a caddy and they went forth with pomp now playing seawards into the hazy east now westwards into the blaze of the declining sun absorbed in their game and yet absorbed in their friendship of boylove hot as fire and clean as the trickle of icewater on a glacier the knowledge of their talk had made frank able to turn himself away from all the bad business of adamss letter and instead of brooding on the irremediable worst of himself he took hold of all that was best and by his side was david the friend of friends now with his arm linked in his now excitedly addressing a cupped ball with his largest driver now brilliantly slicing among untrodden sandhills now dancing with exultation at the success of a shot that was wholly beyond expectation now half whispering to him oh its the rippingest day then followed lawntennis till it was so dark that the ball could hardly be seen at all and in consequence david standing at the net got hit full on the end of his nose which bled with extraordinary profusion indeed had murder been committed that night at naseby as frank said when they went down for a hurried dip before dressing for dinner it would have required no sherlock holmes to draw the certain but quite erroneous conclusion that the deed had been done in davids bedroom and the body carried down to the beach afterwards with the idea of its being taken away and out by the ebbing tide and the seaward current a sloppail with bloodstained water analysed by professor pepper and found to be mammalian would be discovered in his bedroom and at intervals down the path to the beach further traces of the same incriminating gore the cool seawater put an end to davids bleeding and as he dressed he began to feel delightfully uncomfortable as in the attics of baxminster so grimly and gravely did frank reconstruct the history of the crime with fearful imaginative details thrown in a little way from them on the beach was something vague and black and humped up and frank suddenly pointed at it do you know what that is he asked david in a whisper that black thing no what its the body said frank of course this was all nonsense but david peered at it through the gloom and frank suddenly gave a deep and hollow groan which startled him quite awfully it wasnt utterly dead he explained it tried to call for help but it couldnt call loud as its throat was cut from ear to ear but it just groaned the body was that of a boy of fifteen tall for his age david and well nourished david could not help it he had to run in his bare feet to where the supposed corpse lay kicked it and came back only seaweed he said now the murderer did it in my room you say i mean he cut the wellnourished boys throat there and then carried it down to the beach that wont do there are only quite a few drops of blood on the way down if its throat had been cut from ear to ear thered be more blood not at all said frank the murderer held the two edges of the wound togetherno hed want both hands to carry the bodyhe pinned the edges of the wound together withwith safety pins so that it only just leaked he carried it down to the beach like that and then took out the pins because he had a saving disposition and this let the boy bleed to death as i said he thought the tide would carry it away but it didnt and it was found there next morning lobsters had got at it though and howked pieces out of it theres lobster for dinner tonight then the police traced the bloodstains to your bedroom and found the sloppail and you were kept in prison till you were sixteen and then hung at norwich and what did heii dont know which i am the corpse or the murderer youre both said frank the pins they were put back in the pincushion on your dressingtable where i saw them just now there were stains on them that looked like rust but they werent rust they were they were blood said david mammalian frank looked hastily round for more material for horror and saw a fisherman coming down the steep path just behind them carrying two lobsterpots this was luck for david had not seen him being employed in putting his shoes on frank went on without pause after that the beach at naseby he said was not a place where prudent people cared to be after sunset especially during the month of august and particularly onon august the tenth which was the exact day when the murder was committed prudent people avoided it for there was no doubt it was haunted a figure was often seen coming down that steep path just behind us carrying a ghastly burden david looked quickly round with the intention of reassuring himself that there was no one there that was a dreadful mistake there was frank after his one glance at the figure had not looked at the path again good lord said david in a whisper theres something coming down it now its coming straight towards us then he saw more distinctly and gave a great cackle of laughter ohohoh its only a fisherman with lobsterpots he said but you did give me such a turn you said that awfully well when i looked round and saw that old buffer coming down i could have screamed i say do lobsters really eat deaders whenever they can get them there are a good many about now too the cook told me that the one were going to have for dinner tonight had a mans finger in its claws when they brought it up to the house the best ones oh dry up shouted david youve a foul mind frank laughed oh you kid nor was the immortal day over yet the maneating lobster was in turn eaten by man and after dinner frank read to his mother and david the neglected atalanta after which they played ridiculous games till bedtime franks room and davids communicated with each other and as they undressed further details and embellishments of horror were added to the murder story through the open door but to one of franks most gruesome inventions there had been no response and looking in he saw that david was kneeling by his bed and at that he went back to his room again the silence was not of long duration and in a moment david called to him what was that last frank he said it sounded jolly beastly but i wasnt attending frank repeated it and david squealed as he drew his bedclothes up to his chin i think thats enough he said i shall have gory nightmares oh hasnt it been a jolly day ripping good night david good night what a pity it cant be this morning again frank lay long awake that night before he slept he slid out of bed and followed davids example chapter xi david with the tip of his tongue stuck out at the corner of his mouth was engaged in the delicate and apparently until you know the reason meaningless task of lashing two pens together with a piece of cotton so that their respective nibs should be fixed at a particular distance apart from each other the distance as he took pains to measure accurately was exactly that between the first and fourth line on a piece of scribbling paper if this is neatly doneand david with his deft fingers was doing it very neatly indeedit will be clear that if both pens are dipped in ink and one writes certain words along the first line of the paper the second pen duly adjusted will simultaneously be writing the same words along the fourth line similarly when the first pen is engaged in the second line the other will be engaged on the fifth thus provided the pens are securely lashed and behave reasonably a sheet of scribbling paper of the sort that holds twenty lines can be filled with hexameters from any given part of the highly overrated adventures of the pious neas in the time that without this contrivance it would take to transcribe ten of those lines any boy moreover and such adults as still preserve a brain of moderate ingenuity will easily guess why those pens in davids very superior contraption were lashed together at a distance of three lines for were they lashed together at the distance of one or even two lines apart this engaging scheme by which two lines were written simultaneously would be much more easily detected as david had to write out no fewer than five hundred lines of this piffling neid he thus hoped to be quit of his task in the time that it would take a less ingenious devil to write two hundred and fifty it was already getting dark at the close of a halfholiday afternoon towards the end of february and bags while david was engaged in these preparatory processes was making tea for them both in the study they shared together it was a considerably larger one than that which they had inhabited during their first year but davids belongings seemed to have grown proportionately to his own limbs and they still usurped by far the greater portion of the available room his task though tiresome was not one that required much concentration of attention it was mere dull transcribing work and he could quite well converse as it was going on besides it was a very short time since he had copied out these same pages before he had a certain familiarity with them he finished adjusting the pens found that he had got their distance to a nicety and gripping them on the place where their handles crossed he dipped them in the ink then as a refinement of ingenious engineering he took bagss inkpot and put it in such a place that the two pens were dipped simultaneously infandum regina jubes he said what an awful gasser neas was he talked straight off for two books and i suppose dido didnt go to sleep cause she was so mad keen on him why cant i copy out something decent like keats or swinburne instead of this mouldy old johnny i should really rather like that perhaps thats why they dont let you said bags giving him a cup of tea shouldnt wonder if it was thanks awfully bags did you put four lumps of sugar in oh then two more please but as regards the patent pen of course there is a certain risk that owlers this of course was mr howliss will spot it and i shall have to do it again but it aint likely three lines apart great security in three lines apart youve spent most of your time this half writing lines said bags i know i dont seem to be able to keep out of rows i dont want to be late or cut chapel or go out of bounds but i dont seem to be able to help it adams jawed me this morning said he didnt know what to do with me and im sure i couldnt tell him maddox is rather sick with me too which matters more says i play the goat too much and he doesnt know about the seal and this last impot yet i shall have to tell him though its the best rag ive had yet yes more tea please i think youre rather an ass unless you prefer writing out the neid to any other ploy said bags i dare say but i cant help it i simply cant i should never have gone to that silly old fair up town last week if they hadnt put it out of bounds but when they put it out of bounds i had to go it wasnt because i wanted to see the fat woman and the skeleton dude if i take to smoking which i havent done yet it wont be because i like it which i dont but just because its against the rules thats good enough for me bags took up the first page which david had written and which resembled some loose sort of triolet with its repetition of lines in spite of the difficulty of managing two pens with success it was wonderfully uniform and written in davids neat and vigorous hand ill get on with another page of them if you like suggested bags all the fellows say i write exactly like you thanks thats jolly good of you said david and you do write awfully like me i wonder why you used not to as when maddox spotted my handwriting in that crib oh i suppose its being with you and all that said bags vaguely knowing quite well that he had long tried to write like david out of affection and admiration for all that pertained to his pal ill begin at line a hundred shall i so that when you get there you can skip the next hundred and go on at line two hundred yes thats the trick said david thanks awfully sure it doesnt bore you i say shall i lash a couple more pens for you dont think i should get on well with them said bags the lent term about half of which was now over seemed to david a very poor affair in comparison with other terms rugby football was finished with cricket of course did not exist the weather had been consistently diluvian so that the golflinks where he had intended to pass most of his leisure were generally half flooded other fellows it is true were busy on athletics but david seeing through franks eyes had no sympathy with just running when there was no ulterior object except to run quicker than anybody else in fact there were no games except fives and racquets and the demand for courts being largely in excess of the supply he could not get one as often as his energy needed thus since there was so little that might legitimately be done he had chiefly occupied himself in breaking schoolrules and as bags had said he had really passed most of the half in writing lines which though it took time merely bottled up instead of relieving him of his exuberant vitality furthermore since there was not the slightest chance of his getting out of the middle fifth at easter only geniuses of whom he was certainly not one did that david had argued that the less time he spent over work the better the worst of it was there was so very little to do and maddox had jawed david on this subject of playing the goat before suggesting that the devil had entered into him it was not quite that really it was only the rampageous energy of davids youth seeking an outlet he was growing enormously and as sometimes happened this process did not make him languid and slack but seemed only to increase the vitality that stirred and bubbled in him as in some longlegged colt making him throw up his limbs and scamper simply because he was vigorous and growing but his escapades and general obstreperousness somewhat exercised his friend as well as his housemaster who at the present moment while david and bags were writing lines together was talking to the prefect about the house in general and the affairs of david in particular his general line as has been said was to let the senior boys run the house while he enjoyed the tranquillity that their management brought him but davids persistent adventures had protruded themselves into his notice and a consultation with maddox seemed to him desirable about david he said its only energy frank and not viciousness you gave just the same sort of trouble yourself when you were his age sorry sir said maddox but i dont believe i was ever quite such a nuisance as david is if ever theres a crash in the house its always david breaking a window or throwing his boots at somebody cant you do anything with him asked adams hell listen to you when he wont attend to a word i say oh he listens to me all right said maddox but then he forgets besides hes so awfully funny he makes me laugh adams lit his pipe and sat down on the floor in front of the fire for maddox happened to be occupying his particular armchair at the moment all the electric lights went out id bet a shilling said maddox that davids at the bottom of that shall i go and see sir yes do and then come back maddox felt his way along the passage to davids study and knocked he always knocked before he went into other peoples rooms come in shouted david but take care of yourself whoever you are there are inkpots about and its as dark as hell and smells of cheese good old bags fancy finding a candle in this den hullo frank have you been fooling with the electric light asked maddox yes of course this beastly plug didnt work and so i dug a knife into its bowels and something went off and gave me an awful start ass said maddox youve put out the lights all over this passage and adamss study oh what larks said david lets have a procession of the unemployed who want to work like good little saps and cant work in the dark lets let me just get at you said maddox as david dodged round the table ill teach you david squealed with hideous resonance well it wasnt my fault he said i only jabbed it with a knife wow spare me have mercy upon me wow frank drove david to a corner and punched him heavily in the ribs and boxed his ears and smacked his head summary and effectual justice being then done he observed davids patent lashed pens i know that trick he said what is the virtuous bags doing lines too oh yes said bags airily some of the fourth neid for david i suppose eh well yes said bags how many lines is it this time asked maddox and what for five hundred said david at present for a good little owlers gosh i wish you wouldnt hit so hard do you and what has good little owlers done david began to laugh oh lord it was funny he said it was worth five hundred lines hes just as blind as possible blinder than tovey you know and i thought it was very likely i shouldnt be put on construing why asked maddox oh i dont know it seemed likely well he was taking us in the museum so i fetched down a stuffed seal and stuck it up in my place so that if he counted heads i should be there and then i went to play squash bags you go on i didnt see bags took up the wondrous tale there we all were said bags with the seal sitting up in davids place i saw owlers count heads and then we began construing then it didnt quite pan out as david expected for after a bit owlers said go on blaize and of course the seal didnt say anything whatever poor thing how could it said david and then owlers said looking very kind perhaps you havent prepared quite as far blaize but the seal had nothing to say to that and owlers asked him why he didnt answer and then owlers gave him a long jaw and told him he was sulky and there the seal sat with his glass eyes fixed on the ceiling finally owlers got awful sick with him and set him five hundred lines it was no use trying not to laugh the idea of owlers jawing the seal was too much for maddox and the three went off into peals of laughter and didnt he spot the seal at all asked maddox at length rather not he went tottering out at the end of the hour just reminding the seal to show them up tomorrow david took up his double pen again oh i wish somebody else had done it he said for i missed owlers jawing the seal but it was my idea maddox got up well youll get into worse trouble if you dont look out he said im talking you over with adams oh may i come and listen outside the door you may not well stick up for me said david encouragingly maddox went back to his house master still giggling well did david make the darkness he asked yes sir rather he investigated the electric plug with a knife and something went off he said so i hit him about theyre putting another fuse in he laughed again david was writing five hundred lines as usual he said with bags helping i think i must tell you why adams made no attempt at gravity and shook with laughter but it cant go on he said davids becoming a nuisance and gating him and giving him lines to write is no earthly good what he wants is a good licking and plenty of exercise theres not an ounce of harm in him oh hes the straightest chap in the world said maddox well you might warn him tell him next time hes reported to me i shall send him to the head with a request that he shall be swished and hows the rest of the house oh pretty slack sir its rotten weather you see weather makes a lot of difference to us i know theres always more trouble this half than any try to keep them up to the mark frank ill do my best sir but ive got an awful lot of work with this trinity scholarship exam coming or in a fortnight im as rusty as nails over my history adams smoked his pipe for a little in silence by the way you pull all right with cruikshank now dont you he asked rather i used to bar him awfully but wewell we had a talk after hughes was sent away and decided to get on better together crookles is a good chap glad youve found that out said adams you never would believe me when i told you so well tell david that the wooden eye of nemesis is on him and see if you cant make him less obstreperous he thinks more of what you say than of what any one else says he simply jumped down my throat the other day in your defence what about sir because i ventured to criticise your play in that houseracquet tie when we were nearly beaten by thomass i said i thought we should have won more easily if you had served with more care and less force david turned quite purple and said i shouldnt wonder if he knew what he was about frightful cheek said maddox well i dont know he only reminded me that you know more about racquets than i do which is perfectly true well are you off tell david not to make himself so conspicuous maddox went upstairs again after this to his study where his fag was putting out his teathings david of course after his promotion into the fifth form had ceased to be in a state of servitude and his successor was a small bony youth called jevons who usually had a cold in the head and an inky handkerchief with which to minister to it there was no kind of briskness about him he was timid and slovenly and melancholy and went about his duties as if laying out the bakemeats for the funeral of a dear departed friend maddox did his best with him tried to encourage him to look the world in the face a little more and wash a little more and not drag his feet as he walked but it was a dismal change from being attended to by the adroit and willing david david it is true sometimes smashed things by running with them or from excess of zeal in cleaning the inside of a teacup but that was better than finding forgotten tealeaves in the pot one day or crumbs and other foreign substances in the sugar and little bits of butter sticking to the bottom of the plates but though maddox was kind to this spiritless youth david on the occasions when he came across him was severely critical it seemed to him a dreadful affair that his place should be filled by so abject a specimen and mixed with his contempt for jevons there was a certain jealousy that he should go in and out of maddoxs study as he chose and joylessly perform all the offices in which david had delighted fifthform boy as he was he would have loved to continue fagging for maddox for the sake of seeing that he was properly looked after and for the intimacy which that would give him now since their ages and places sundered them so widely in ordinary schoollife david necessarily saw much less of him than before he knew that this must be so but it did not make him like jevons the more there was the sound of cheerful whistling going on from the bathroom where david was washing up on his own account when maddox came up to his study but it ceased as jevons went in to fill his kettle and a halfcracked admonitory voice took its place well have you put a nice bit of butter in the milkjug today it askedthe voice was as unmistakably davids as the whistleor have you rubbed it round the edge of the teacup lord rinse out the kettle before you fill it cant you here give it me i say you really should smarten yourself up a bit jevons wash your hands while i get the kettle ready i wonder maddox can eat a thing when youve touched his crockery david shouted maddox want me asked david yes come here a minute ive got something to say to you david went to his study followed by the depressed jevons who shuffled about the room for a bit dropped a knife and then left them jove its jolly in here said david appreciatively though how you can stand that scug mucking about i cant think i used to run you much better than this frank what do you want me about ive been talking to adams about you said frank and i should advise you to try to go steadier adams told me to tell you that the wooden eye of nemesis is on you and the next time youre reported hes going to send you to the head to be swished david shrugged his shoulders wooden eye is good he said but i dont much care im not sure i wouldnt sooner be swished than be writing lines to all eternity i never get them done there are always some more finished that five hundred said maddox parenthically lord no but i was just washing up and taking an easy bags is going on well i said i would pass on adamss message of course you can be swished if you like nothing easier but the head makes you feel a bit cheap first and afterwards lays on david sighed heavily i suppose i ought to promise you to be an absolute record for saintliness he said but its no use something goes fizz inside me and i cant help playing the fool i wish i was older or younger if i was older i suppose i should see what a rotter i am and if i was younger i should simply do what you told me i know youre right but then comes a minute and i cant help doing something foolish on any account if you know what i mean david looked round the study again and it made him feel rather melancholy he hadnt seen much of frank this term for frank had been working hard and again the sense of the distance they were apart in the world of school severed them it was greater now that he was an independent person in the fifth than it had been when he was franks fag and in remove a and the intimacy which had been theirs at naseby was no longer possible at school at that moment also a tooth began suddenly to ache and gave him a series of staccato stabs with a really brilliant touch gosh and ive got the toothache he said its suddenly begun hurting like hell sorry said frank david leaned back in his chair with his long arms and legs sprawling it ached yesterday he said but then i didnt mind as i was having a good time over the seal but its rot having toothache when other things are beastly why should this blighter decay my other teeth dont what a rotten show it all is whats up david asked frank oh i dont know theres a sort of conspiracy against me whatever i do gets found out and im writing lines and being gated the whole blooming time and the sight of your study gives me the hump i havent been here for a week i should think and now youre sick with me and sos adams well dont play the goat said frank yes its easy to say that observed david but it isnt as if i set out to play the goat it just comes it just happens oh lord the seal was so funny sitting there on its sloping brim and staring with its glass eyes at the ceiling and all my books spread out in front of it soon as id got it fixed i hopped out of the window you know there it was looking at the ceiling all motheaten and the owlers never guessed it wasnt a boy david gave a shrill laugh that began in a high treble and ended baritone for his voice was cracking then he became quite grave again things are rotten he said i get amused like a kid and suddenly in the middle of it i remember im not quite such a kid i know it really but i cant help skipping about and butting round why cant i be your fag instead of that mucky jevons and if not why cant i be a sensible person i made jevons wash while i made your kettle decent again you should have seen his fingers and then he sniffs and blows his beastly nose with a sort of tight sound and im no better ive got the toothache and im gated at five and ive the best part of five hundred lines to write still and youre sick with me and i shall get swished if i dont take care frank had been through this he knew the transitional disquiet of being fifteen which has just got to be lived through he poured out a cup of tea and handed it to david i think i wont he said ive just had tea isnt it rum how you can be no end cheerful as i was when i jabbed the electric light and then suddenly go rotten i dare say its only toothache frank got up theres some chloroform somewhere he said which i used for killing butterflies if you stick some on cotton wool and jam it in your tooth itll be all right he rummaged in his cupboard and with the aid of a pin put the soaked wool into davids tooth gosh thats better already said david after a minute thanks awfully perhaps if i drank some tea the other side it wouldnt hurt it there was a cake also and david was induced to try this as well better he said at last thats good more well just a little then ill wash up for you properly just for once thatll be ripping of you and as were pretending youre my fag again i shall just jaw you you see i know quite well what it feels like to do something goatish just because its against the rules but that wears off david youll get to know that most rules are pretty sensible you see you couldnt have a whole division of stuffed seals therefore you mustnt have any david laughed in a fullmouthed manner oh but wouldnt they look ripping he said yes but things couldnt go on if every one behaved like you therefore you mustnt see by the way i told adams you were the straightest chap in the world david flushed with pleasure oh did you really he said yes why not but hell send you to be swished just the same if you bore him david got out of his chair well ill try not to he said so id better get on with those lines perhaps you had i must work too and dont get any more youve only got to stump along and be ordinary by the by ive got a racquet court tomorrow at twelve and i cant use it you may have it if you like oh ripping said david tooth out first then racquets thanks awfully he lingered a moment what jolly good days those were at naseby he said i know that theyre all alive too therell be lots more of it david put his hands on franks shoulders as they stood together for a moment by the fireplace i believe they are he said and i believe im as tall as you oh youre getting a big lout said maddox but the evil star continued to shine balefully on david next day the device of the double pen was promptly detected by mr howliss his lines were torn over all to be done again and bagss friendly help was vain labour also bags had been opposed to the patentpen system on the ground that it was liable to detection and though theoretically it saved time it didnt save so much as nobody could wield the double pen with the same swiftness as the single one consequently he made no renewed offer of help with regard to the reimposed imposition and david had to stop in at twelve next day after an excruciating interview with the dentist instead of playing racquets and this parsimonious dentist quite refused to whip out the aching tooth and have done with it a pang to which david had strung himself up he said it could be saved and the salvation thereof included a whizzing drill and the stuffing of it with something painful to the feelings and obnoxious to the taste and implied a further visit the day after tomorrow then followed a brief interval of delightful happenings while the baleful star hid itself the tooth was comforted and reinforced so that it could be bitten on again even with nuts an unexpected midterm largesse of ten shillings from his father and half a crown from margery which was almost insanely noble of her turned up and with bags for a partner david won the school juniorfives competition this was a triumph of the juiciest kind for all europe must have known that bags was a fivesplayer of no class at all and that portion of civilised europe which saw the final were aware that david practically played it single butting about from side to side of the court while bags effaced himself in the manner of a shadow against the wall so as not to be in the way that meant another sovereign which had to be expended in the purchase of a small silver commemorative cup and to that sum he added five shillings out of the tips from home and bought for it a black polished stand of pearwood with a plated shield on which was engraved his name and that of his innocuous partner first of my cups he announced when it came home and it jolly well will not be the last wont it be ripping when i have a whole shelffull of them no im blowed if i have my tea in an ordinary cup pour it in here bags and ill drink your good health for getting out of the way so well lord how hot it gets simultaneously with these propitious events came the early rounds of the house handicap golf competition david had adopted a wise policy over this for ten days before the links had been practically unplayable owing to floods but he had remembered a word of franks if you want to improve go out with half a dozen balls and practise mashie shots on to a green when youve got them all there putt them all out so for the last week david had slacked out with a mashie and a putter found a green that was not under water and had put this hint into practice it was dull but then there was nothing else to do and the reward looked within reach he had been entered with a handicap of fifteen but thanks to his practice he was already a stroke or two better than that he had met maddox in the second round and receiving eleven strokes had beaten him then he encountered gregson whom he played on level terms and emerging by the skin of his teeth from that had wiped up the floor with cruikshank who gave him six this brought him to the semifinal then from behind the clouds out popped the baleful star again and shed its dreadful beams on him with peculiar effulgence first of all maddox went up to cambridge for his scholarship examination and david who had never known what school was like without the sense of his being there who was the first person he saw when he woke in the morning and the last before he went to sleep at night felt lost and rudderless next him in dormitory was the empty bed and all day long he knew there was no chance of franks dropping in or calling him to his study then bags got influenza and disappeared also leaving david bereft of his two great friends to find out for the first time how solid and comfortable a pal bags was then came the semifinal of the golfhandicap in which he was completely off his game and got beaten on level terms by the mild and spotty joynes to whom david felt competent to give four strokes in the round but such proved on this fatal afternoon not to be the case it was a gusty boisterous day and david liable at all times to be rather wild and given to exuberant slicing sliced in a manner probably without parallel with his loose arms he could drive a very long ball but today that was a disadvantage rather than otherwise since he sent it to remote coverpoint this was exasperating and joynes who usually had the honour exasperated him further for having himself gone not far but straight up the middle of the course he overwhelmed david with a sort of envious condolence by jove what a long ball he would say as davids drive started on its insane career i wish i could drive like that oh the winds catching it bad luck look where its going miles away itll be rotten bad luck if its on the road or again david would make an astonishingly feeble putt and joynes again showed sympathy pity it wasnt a little harder it was dead on the line i wish i could putt as straight as that hullo youve missed the second one too that leaves me three for it youd much better make me putt them out i can miss anything hullo its gone in sorry this sort of thing goaded david to madness and presently he could bear it no longer i say would you mind not talking quite so much he said politely its awfully rotten of me but i think it puts me off upon which joynes hermetically sealed his lips till they came to the fourteenth hole where the match came to an abject end all this was sufficiently depressing and there was no quietly sympathetic bags to be a comfort nor was there bags to get tea ready and it struck david really for the first time today how invariably bags did that and he could not find his milkjug and when he did it smelled sour for it had not been washed up and there was nothing to eat and he would have to go up to schoolshop to get a cake it was all deplorable and on the way he met gregson his victim in the third round suppose you disposed of joynes all right blazes he asked no he disposed of me easily as anything said david hurrahi mean sorry but you see i bet a shilling he would congratters said david insincerely the wind had turned bitterly cold and spikes of sleet half frozen had begun to fall as he came back from the shop that again seemed to david part of the conspiracy to make his life as disagreeable and uncomfortable as possible nature herself had joined in he did not want to be unreasonable but if on the top of all these things it was going to snow he felt that even jobs patience would break down snow ruined everything it was incompatible with any form of exercise and mournfully he went back to his solitary study but when he had drawn the curtains and pulled his chair up to the hotwater pipes so that he could rest his feet on them and divided his attention between ravenshoe held in one hand he had got to where gus and flora were naughty in church and tea in the other things seemed to cheer up a little outside evidently the weather had got worse for the wind squealed round the corner of the house and on his panes behind the thick red curtains he could hear the muffled patter of the driven snow and after all there was a bright side to snow for it would mean that there would be prayers in the house tonight and he would not have to turn out to go to chapel and maddox would be back on saturday and it was thursday evening already also bags had written to him from the sickroom saying that he was better and expected to be out again by sunday davids spirits began to improve and he kicked off his shoes in order to enjoy a greater intimacy with the hotwater pipes and burst into a shout of laughter as flora announced that she had left her purse on the piano it would have been a poor heart that did not rejoice next morning for during the night the wind dropped and so smart a frost had set in that the snow lay hard and crusted on the ground and it would be clearly possible to go tobogganing on the slopes of the down at twelve at breakfast moreover there was a postcard for him from frank with a highly coloured photograph of the great quadrangle at trinity on the back and a couple of lines to say he would be back by midday on saturday and that cambridge was a topping place it warmed davids heart to think that frank should have remembered him and with the prospect of tobogganing at twelve and the cheer of the frostyshining sun his spirits went up to a pitch of inexpressible buoyancy as he slid along the trodden path to go to tenoclock school paths had been swept in schoolyard between the various classrooms but the rest of the broad space lay white and untrodden david got there while it still wanted five minutes to ten and hung about with a few friends outside the classroom door till the hour should strike there was a quiet exchange of small snowballing furtively delivered for it was very strictly forbidden in the quadrangle and david had just lobbed one not bigger than a racquetball with extraordinary success just between the collar and neck of joynes who had not the vaguest idea who had done this now he was moulding another larger one in his hand with an absent eye in joyness direction and his shoulders trembling with suppressed laughter for joyness attempts to scoop the snow out were really very funny when gregson came up to him jolly good shot he said i saw but i bet you cant chuck a snowball right across the quad betyouican said david all in one word he put down his books took a couple of quick steps and discharged the snowball he had prepared he had aimed it a high howitzer sort of shot at the blank wall opposite but it went rather to the left and at the exact second of his throwing it the door of the masters commonroom opened and out came owlers lord ive got him squealed david though he had not intended to get anybody and immediately behind owlers came the head david was quite right the snowball got owlers just in the middle of the waistcoat and the head saw very quickly and delicately the group of boys among whom david was standing dispersed into the two classrooms that stood side by side david with them and amid stifled sniggers took their places immediately afterwards the head entered stiffly rustling did any boy here throw a snowball across the court just now he asked david stood up at once it was no good not doing that for unless he gave himself up it was quite certain that there would be punishment for the whole of the two forms in their corner of the court and that was not to be thought of you blaize said the head yes sir very well you knew that snowballing in court was forbidden yes sir said david who is your housemaster mr adams sir that was all for the present but after school david saw the head talking to adams and remembering adamss warning felt prepared for the worst and tobogganed without any particular zest subsequently that day adams remarked laconically so youre determined to have your way david and next morning the school porter entered his classroom with a small blue paper which he presented to owlers he peered at it in his shortsighted manner blaize to go to the head at twelve he said going to the head at twelve implied knocking at the door of a small empty classroom barely furnished next the sixthform room the head was there waiting standing in front of the fire and looking vexed blaize i have been talking to your housemaster about you he said and he tells me that you have given a great deal of trouble this term he tells me also that he had warned you that the next time you made a nuisance of yourself he would send you to me did you get that warning yes sir said david very well then i shall give you a good whipping he said it isnt for just throwing a snowball you understand but for all the accumulation of silly disobedient things you have done you have been gated several times this term and you have had frequent impositions your formmaster gives me exactly a similar report of you these punishments dont seem to have made any impression on you so i shall try another plan its no use your going on like this and im not going to have it rules are made for you to obey whereas you seem to think you may break them or not exactly as you please they were not made without a purpose and i am going to show you that they cannot be broken indefinitely without great inconvenience david had not quite allowed for the horrid effect of the heads tongue he had faced the fact that he was going to be swished but he had not faced the fact that the head would take all the stuffing out of him first so to speak just when he wanted the stuffing i am not going to whip you for my amusement he continued walking towards a cupboard far less for yours i am whipping you because i wish to give you something by which to remember that you must keep rules instead of breaking them reasonable methods have been tried with you and they dont succeed and i am going to treat you as if you werent reasonable and hurt you i dont like doing it you will like it much less and i want you to understand that its a lower method of treating a boy like you who is quite big enough and clever enough to know better you have been behaving like an unreasonable animal instead of a sensible boy you are going to be sharply reminded to have more sense in the future now get ready david had not imagined it would be pleasant but it was a great deal more unpleasant than he had anticipated the head never swished unless he meant it there was no such thing as a light swishing and that fact was most clearly comprehended by david during the next minute nor was there any consolation from his executioner when it was over that will do he said you richly deserve what i have given you dont let me have to send for you again david went out biting his lip it had really been very hard not to cry out under those stinging blows considering how very abject he felt before they had begun and almost the worst part of all was the waiting between the strokes which were delivered with pauses for thought but he got through without giving himself away and went down to his house feeling rather glad that bags was in the sickroom since an interval to pull himself together again in solitude was certainly desirable but hardly had he got into his study when there came a tap at the door and maddox entered hullo david he said ive just got back did you get my postcard i half wondered whether you would come up to the station i say whats up just been swished said david what for accumulations so that blasted head told me throwing a snowball finished it oh you infernal ass said maddox you jolly well deserved it at that the devil no less entered into david anyhow i never deserved being expelled he said very evilly frank looked at him a moment then without a word he left the room for a few seconds david was not in the least sorry for that speech he was smarting himself and if all frank had to say was that he deserved it he was glad to have made frank smart too and then with a sudden sense of sick regret he remembered who frank was and all that frank had been to him and on the moment he was out of his study and off down the passage to franks he went in without knocking i say im a damnable chap he said im frightfully sorry i dont know if you can forgive me he put out a rather timid hand instantly it was clasped and held i didnt mean it he said i felt mad david old chap said frank they stood there for a minute in silence for really there was nothing more to be said then david smiled i think id better not make an ass of myself any more he said beastly good idea said frank chapter xii david was sitting on the steps in front of the cricketpavilion in schoolfield with a pad on each leg and a glove on each hand and an icy lump of nervous fear inside his canvas shirt to take the place of a heart but nobody paid the least attention to him or gave him a single word of encouragement or cared at all for his panicstricken condition because everybody was utterly absorbed in what was going on at the wickets the whole school and the whole staff were there watching the end of the final tie in housematches in absolute tense silence except when a run was scored or a smart piece of fielding prevented one being scored then a roar went up from all round the ground cut off again suddenly as if a hand had been placed over all the mouths of some manythroated beast as the bowler received the ball again during the pause between overs a buzz of talk rose as if the cork had been taken out of a bottle where sonorous bees were confined this talk was silenced as the next over began probably such a final as this had been seen before but that did not detract from the tenseness of the excitement the present position arrived at through many delightful adventures was that adamss wanted twenty more runs to win with two wickets to fall maddox luckily was in still and cruikshank a miserable performer with the bat was in with him if either of them got out the forlorn and trembling david had to take his place last wicket to totter down the steps and walk apparently about twenty miles to the wicket in the full light of day with the eyes of the world on him maddox of course was the only hope of salvation neither david nor cruikshank could even by their most optimistic friends be considered as capable of doing anything but getting out against such strength of bowling as they had against them and in order to make david quite happy and comfortable about it all there was indelibly written on the tablets of his memory the fact that he had got out second ball in the first innings without as the school paper would record on saturday having troubled the scorer what if the paper added that in the second innings he proved himself as independent of the scorer again so while the groups of boys round him regaling themselves the while on bags of cherries and baskets of strawberries seethed with pleasant irresponsible excitement david was merely perfectly miserable as he waited for the roar that would go up round the field to show another wicket had fallen that would not be abruptly cut off like the tumult that succeeded a run or a piece of fielding the toveyites would go on screaming well bowled or well caught until he marched out across the field all that he could think of in this hour of waiting was the fact that he had been completely bowled by the second ball he received in the first innings after having been completely beaten by the first tomlin who had kindly sent down that fatal delivery was bowling now and no doubt he would be bowling still when he went in the match had been full of entrancing and agonising vicissitudes adamss had batted first piling up a respectable total of a hundred and eightytwo which gave no cause for complaint then toveys had gone in and had been ignominiously dismissed by cruikshank and mellor for eightyone and the sages were inclined to think that the match was as good as over they had followed on but instead of being dismissed for eightyone again they had amassed the huge total of three hundred and twentynine cruikshank the demon of the first innings had been hit completely off his length and david had been put on as first change not having bowled at all in the first innings but the glorious personal result of that afternoons work gave him no encouragement now for his mind was filled to the exclusion of all else with the fact that in his previous appearance with the bat and not the ball tomlin had beaten him twice and bowled him once but yesterday when he was bowling toveys could do nothing with him he bowled their captain anstruther in his first over after being hit twice to the boundary by him and had proved himself altogether too much for the rest of the side the wicket was fast and true and there was no reason for their not being able to play him except the excellent one that he bowled extremely well he was lefthanded with very high action and had as an accessory cultivated a terrifying prance up to the wickets with a crooked run and a change of feet in the middle of it like a stumbling horse after this he delivered a slow high ball while every now and then but not too often he laced one in as hard as ever he could with precisely the same delivery in the end he had taken seven wickets for ninety runs while the rest of the three hundred and twentynine had been scored off the other bowlers of the side who had captured two wickets one being run out between them there came a roar from the ring of spectators round the field and shouts of derisive laughter from a group of adamss boys standing near and david forgetting everything else for the moment added a piercing catcall whistle to the general hubbub tomlin had changed his field with the obvious intention of getting maddox caught in the slips sending midon there making the fourth of them then he proceeded to bowl a little wide of the offstump maddox had let three balls go by but the fourth he pulled round to exactly where midon had been and scored four for it oh a great stroke and no one could tell perhaps not even maddox how it was done there was one more ball of this over and it was wonderfully important that maddox should score one or three or five off it so as to get the bowling again but it was no use attempting to do anything with such a ball it was all he could do to play it so cruikshank got the bowling well it was better that cruikshank should face crawley than tomlin if only tomlin could receive a telegram saying that his father and mother and his three brothers and his four sisters if he had any were all seriously ill and that he had to go home absolutely this minute it was clear that cruikshank was nervousdavid knew of somebody else who was nervous toobut he presented a dull solid wall to two straight balls then with extreme caution he lobbed one up in the direction of longoff and ran like the devil come on he shouted to maddox for he was just as anxious that maddox should get the bowling as was the rest of adamss maddox wanted a run as much as anybody but he was completely taken by surprise at the impudence of this but there was cruikshank half way up the pitch and it meant a wicket lost if he told him to go back so he too ran like the devil the situation only lasted a couple of seconds but it made up in quality what it lacked in quantity if longoff who already had the ball in his hands had thrown it in to the end from which cruikshank had started he had a good chance of getting maddox run out while if he threw it in to the bowler close to him he had the practical certainty of running cruikshank out which was not nearly so important simultaneously both wicketkeeper and bowler shouted this end and he threw it wildly to about the middle of the pitch and there were fifteen more runs to get to win it seemed to david as he watched forgetting himself for a moment or two that maddox himself was feeling the strain especially after this last and unmerited escape he spooned a ball feebly in the air short but only just short of point and the next though he scored two off it was the most dangerous stroke and as unlike as possible to his usual crisp cutting still it might be only that there was something dreadfully unexpected about that ball which caused him to mistime it but if only he would kindly not mistime balls for a little while longer then came the last ball of the over which he hit out at completely missed it and was nearly bowled so cruikshank had to face the fatal tomlin there ensued some piercing moments there was an appeal for a catch at the wickets confidently made which was not upheld and cruikshank proceeded to play like a clockwork doll imperfectly wound up after failing to play two balls altogether he hit out as hard as he could at the third intending to drive it and snicked it between his legs for one but that gave maddox the bowling again and off the last ball he scored one and thus secured the bowling again a little faint glimmer of hope came into davids heart there was a bye for two which left eleven runs only to get and perhaps perhaps he would not have to bat at all if only maddox would hit three fours in succession a feat of which he was perfectly capable the match would be over and david thought it would be quite impossible ever to stop shouting again for nothing in the whole world mattered to him now except that they should win and nobody mattered except those two white figures at the wicket yet one was frank and david so far mastered his trembling knees as to go to the scoringbox to see how many he had made his score was just eighty so that he could not get his century even if he scored the rest himself rather a pity but certainly nobody would care less than frank at the third ball he opened his shoulders and gave a little skip out to drive and a celestial stroke it was the ball flew along the ground rather to the right of longoff and it seemed as if it must go for four but that odious fellow just reached it stopping it with his foot made a beautiful return and instead of four it was a single only and cruikshank had the bowling a roar had gone up on account of the smart fielding of the last ball and was instantly silent again now there went up another not so soon coming to an end for cruikshanks legstump had been sent flying and there were ten more runs to get david got up put on his cap and then with great deliberation took it off again he didnt know if he wanted a cap or not and it was immensely important to settle that it was sunny but the sun was still high and would not really come in his eyes but he certainly wanted something to drink for his throat had suddenly become gritty and dry like the side of a matchbox and he wanted to run away and hide or to do anything in the world rather than cross that interminable stretch of grass across which cruikshank was now walking but as soon as cruikshank reached the pavilion he would have to go that impossible feat had to be accomplished bags had been sitting by him thoughtfully eating cherries after david had refused them but it was long since he had had any clear consciousness of bags or of any one else except those white figures in the field but at this awful moment bags proved himself a friend in need oh david how ripping it will be he said in a voice of complete conviction that you and maddox win cockhouse match for us up till that moment the possibility had literally not entered davids head he had been entirely absorbed in the prospect of losing it for them but this suggestion put a little bit of heart into him instead of the cold fear by gad he said and drawing a long breath went down the steps on to the level field the moment he got moving even though he was only moving to the place of execution he found that it was not so impossible as it had appeared in anticipation it had seemed out of the question at this crucially critical period in the history of cricket which was more important than the history of the world to face this but now there he was going out all alone bat in hand and he did not sink into the earth or fall down with a few hollow groans and then two other things encouraged him further neither of which he had contemplated as his tall slight figure detached itself from the crowd in front of the pavilion a real cheer went up not from the boys of his house only but from the school in general he told himself that they were not cheering him david blaize but only the last actor in this enthralling piece of drama in spite of which he felt much the healthier for it and the second thing that encouraged him was far better for maddox leaving the wicket had come halfway across the ground to meet him and walk back with him david old chap isnt it ripping he said even as bags had said that its you and me just the jolliest thing that could happen dont bother about runs theyll come all right just keep your end up and dont take any risks the bowlings absolute piffle so long as you dont try to hit it then they had to part company each going to his wicket there were so david remembered with hideous distinctness two more balls of the over and after taking middle and leg he had a look round the two points that struck him most were that the other wicket seemed nightmarishly close to be bowled at from and that there were apparently about thirty fielders but then as crawley walked away to get his run the rest of davids nerve now that the time for action had come was completely restored to him he had never felt cooler nor clearer of eye in his life he received his first ball at first he thought it was going to be a fullpitch but then he saw it was a yorker he saw it in time and he heard sweet as honey to the mouth the chunk with which it hit the centre of his bat close to the end there was no doubt whatever about the second ball it was a half volley well outside his legstump david made one futile attempt to be prudent and resist the temptation but he was quite incapable of it danced out a yard and smote for all he was worth he heard the solid impact of the bat telling him he had hit it correctly andthere was the ball already beyond and high above midon it was not worth while starting to run since this was a boundaryhit if ever there was one andalmost more importantthis was the end of the over opposite he saw maddox shaking his fist at him as the roar of applause went up mingled with shouts from his particular friends of well hit blazes smack em about david and he swaggered out of his ground to slap a perfectly true place on the wicket with his bat he looked up with a deprecatory smile at frank sorry i had to he said you little devil said the other a silence more intense than ever settled down over the ground as the last shouts consequent on davids immortal feat died away for tomlin proceeded to send down perhaps the best over he had ever bowled in his life once he completely beat maddox and must have shaved the varnish off his bails and from the rest the batsman made no attempt to score being quite satisfied with stopping them at the end anstruther looked round the field wace take an over at crawleys end will you he said then that period deadly for a newly arrived batsman had to be gone through when the fresh bowler has a few practiceballs and rearranges the field and it made david fret longon had to be moved two yards nearer and one yard to the right coverpoint had to go much deeper point had to come in a little and the slips went through a mystic dance this being concluded wace proceeded david opened with an appalling stroke that would have been easily caught by cover if only wace had not moved him and thereupon wace brought him in again so david with an even worse stroke spooned the ball over his head so that if he had not been moved the second time he must have caught it for this he scored one amid derisive and exultant yells and maddox hit at him with his bat as they crossed each other and there were four more runs to get then the end came maddox played two balls with great care and the unfortunate wace then sent him a full pitch to leg there came the sound of the striking bat next moment the ball bounded against the palings by the pavilion and maddox had played his last housematch frank waited to see the ball hit the palings and then ran across the pitch to david didnt i tell you so he said and wasnt it ripping that you and i should do that hullo theyre coming for us lets run all round the ground the crowd had broken up wildly shouting some going towards the pavilion but others headed by a detachment from adamss streaming out on to the pitch the two boys ran towards the pavilion dodging the first few of these but both were caught and carried in starfishwise then again and again first maddox alone then both together they had to come out on to the balcony while the house and school generally shouted itself hoarse for this entrancing finish indeed the honours were fairly divided for if maddoxs batting had saved the situation today the situation would have been impossible to save if it had not been for davids bowling yesterday then by degrees the crowd dispersed and the shouting died and the two sat for a while there the happiest pair perhaps in all england blunt and telegraphic with each other david you little devil said frank frightful cheek your hitting that four second ball you received too david gave a cackle of laughter dont rub it in he said i apologised juicy shot too i say tomlin sent you down an over of corkers after that nearly spewed with anxiety said frank absolute limit of an over wicked fellow tomlin quoth david glad i didnt get any of them som i damn glad else of course nobody can bat except yourself said david you cant anyhow but weve won have we really dont interrupt i should have added that you can bowl you cant said david getting level no filthy exercise ill take you down to bathe if you dont bar washing and then ill take you to school shop and you may eat all there is lucky im flush right oh thanks awfully said david but you wont be flush long they got up to go but at the door maddox paused best of all the days ive had at school david he said same here said david school bathing did not begin for another hour but maddox had the sixthform privilege of bathing whenever he chose and adams whom they ran to catch up on their way down gave david leave to go with him he had dutifully and delightedly watched every ball of the match and had helped to carry david into the pavilion as there was no chance of assisting at the entry of maddox yes by all means yes youyou blest pair of sirens he said quoting from the milton ode which was to be sung at concert at the end of the term and take care of david jonathan and dont let him sink from being topheavy with pride we shall want him to bowl next year they trotted on for a little in order to arrive at the bathingplace in the greatest possible heat i say wasnt that ripping of him said david didnt know he knew we were pals jolly cute observed maddox but how did he know we dont go about together in public lord heres the head coming lucky ive got leave they had gone through the gate into the masters garden beyond which lay the bathingplace this was penetrable only by masters and by the sixthform and there was no turning back or avoiding what was to david a rather formidable meeting it was quite illogical that he should find it so since he had leave but he had not met the head since the interview in the disused classroom and the halo of terror still shone about his head he nodded kindly to the boys as they dropped into walking pace and took their caps off and then stopped fine innings of yours maddox he said i congratulate you you too blaize a lot to expect wasnt it that you should bowl mr toveys eleven out one day and keep up your wicket to win the match the next very glad you did it successfully david still rather awed shifted from one foot to the other thanks awfully sir he said iive got leave to bathe from mr adams the head looked at him a moment with a certain merriment lurking below his gravity quite sure he asked david saw this was a joke and laughed i want just a word with you maddox said the head will you go on blaize the head waited a moment its about blaize i wanted to speak to you maddox he said how is he getting on i had to give him a good whipping last term is he moremore rational hes come on tremendously sir said maddox hes getting on excellently im glad you think that because i believe hes one of the most promising boys weve got and you know him i should think better than any of us maddox wondered how on earth the head knew that adams might know but how did the head i dont want his cricket to interfere with his work he said the middle fifth had to write an essay last week and i told mr howliss to send them in to me to look over all but two or three were dreadful rubbish but blaizes was excellent and as youre a trinity scholar as well as being captain of the eleven you can see my point of view do you think hes getting cricket out of focus he ought to be higher in his form you know maddox shook his head oh i dont think blaize is a bit unbalanced about his cricket sir he said i always rub it in that cricket doesnt matter at least i usually do though i didnt today because i couldnt after hed bowled like that but ill rub it in again after tomorrow why after tomorrow asked the head because i was going to put him into the twentytwo tonight sir though he doesnt know yet and i must let him enjoy it a bit and then theres the eleven against the sixteen on saturday next and after his whole record in housematches its just a question whether he oughtnt to play for the eleven there are four places left the trinity scholar had certainly got absorbed in the captain of the eleven you mean he has a chance of his schoolcolours asked the head yes sir if he goes on developing like this said maddox its five weeks yet to the lords match and its easily possible he may be the best slow bowler in the school maddox paused a moment hell have to practice a lot he said and hell have to think about it a lot threequarters of a slow bowler is brains you know sir or would you rather i didnt try to bring him on at cricket he wouldnt notice he hasnt the slightest idea how good he is and even if he had well said the head maddox dropped the surname altogether you see davids the best chap who ever lived he said and were tremendous friends if i didnt put him in the twentytwo even hed think it was perfectly all right as youve talked to me about him sir i want to tell you that ill do what you think best for him i should naturally put him into the twentytwo this evening because he deserves it and as i said i was thinking of playing for the eleven next week but if you think not if you think it would do him more good all round to be kept back well i will but theres no fellow in the school less uppish if you mean that that was all the head wanted he had got at davids character as seen by maddox with far more completeness than maddox knew do just what seems best to you as captain of the eleven he said but there are lots of you fellows who want watching and it takes work off my shoulders if i know that you elder and steady men are doing some watching for me good luck to both of you if you live till ninety youll never find a better thing than a friend at least i havent maddox found david wallowing in the tepid water and at intervals making hazardous experiments from the high headerboard this was instructive as showing the flight of heavy bodies through space and was occasionally followed by further interesting results as showing what happened when these heavy bodies flatly met a flat and incompressible material thereafter they went to school shop and david ate his way so to speak from in at one door to out at the other this was a long and sumptuous process for the place was full and congratulations were hurled at them tomlin the diabolical was there among the crowd taking his defeat in a wideminded manner thought you had me once or twice during your last over said maddox to him fiendish over tommy tommy considered this twasnt a very bad one he said i think i should have liked to have sent it down to blaize instead of you jolly good match though hullo blaize youre a rotten bad bat you know ill stand you both strawberrymess it was perfectly impossible for david not to feel elated at sitting down to strawberrymess with two members of the eleven in the full light of day and in sight of the school generally or having dreamed night and day of being some good in housematches not to feel exalted when those dreams had merged into realities that so far exceeded all his imaginings but in a little while maddox and tomlin began to speak in undertones and david rose with the sense that private conversation was going forward i think ill be getting back to house he said thanks awfully for the strawberrymess tomlin wait a minute said maddox im coming down in a second go and blow yourself out a little more david thought it the part of wisdom not to do that and strolled outside to wait for his friend glorious as all those things had been there was nothing so glorious as that frank and he had been associated in them that friendship meant more to him than cricket or this sort of open recognition of itself till now their ages and places in the school had necessarily divided them in public and so today it was best of all the delicious happenings when frank joined him and they went off together the head asked after you this afternoon david said frank made inquiries i told him you were fairly rotten david did not rise at this you always stick up for a chap he observed anything else yes i may as well tell you as everybody else will know by chapeltime fact is im putting you into the twentytwo tonight and on saturday next week youre playing in the eleven and sixteen match for the eleven david stopped quite dead and then he thought he saw frank had tried to get a rise out of him just now and failed and of course was trying again it wasnt really quite nice of him to try to get a rise out of him over such matters but then he didnt know how dreadfully david cared oh jolly funny he said and walked on again david do you think im such a brute as to try to get a rise out of you with that sort of thing asked frank bbbut do you mean its true asked david suddenly stammering yes you ass thats what i wanted to consult tommy about and he agrees we cant have a kid like you bowling the eleven out so youve jolly well got to bowl the sixteen out instead and ill take away your twentytwo cap if you dont oh frank i cant quite believe it said david whats it all for what have i done thats one of your bad points as i told the head said frank i said you were filthily conceited lord said david well congratters on your twentytwo and you can bring your preparation to my study if you like and ill give you a construe i havent got any work to do myself comes of being a scholar of trinity remarked david and fled frank had written out the list of promotions into the twentytwo when david came to his study with a copy of dipus coloneus which was his lesson for next day and he pushed it over to him ive stuck you in first he said to prepare for your appearance next saturday now well leave the silly business alone whats your work dipus coloneus yes twentyfive lines of a chorus thats simply beastly said david finding his place there line frank looked over his shoulder oh its not without merit he said now look out every word you dont know and then try to make something of it for half an hour after that ill give you a construe no talking oh wont you construe it first asked david itll save me a lot of trouble and did you suppose i wanted to save you trouble asked frank david sighed thought you might he said its rather flat working after this afternoon no it isnt youve got to learn that people like sophocles matter more than any silly housematch twasnt a silly housematch said david dont talk david looked round lend me your dictionary then he said ive left mine in my study david had a very vivid sense of the beauty of words and though it took him some time to whistle his mind away from the splendours of the afternoon and from the glories of that list that lay on the table which would soon be displayed before the eyes of the entire school he became conscious before long that the words of the beastly chorus which was open before him were beautiful things and that their meanings so his dictionary told him were beautiful also for it was all about horses and nightingales and thickets and ivy the colour of winethis was rather puzzling unless perhaps it meant crme de mentheand clustering narcissus then by degrees he became absorbed in it and all the time was slightly ashamed at being able to be interested in a mere greek chorus when his name lay on the table as heading the list of promotions into the twentytwo but his absorption gained on him why its ripping he said to himself under his breath and whistling softly hunted up another jewel of a word then he lost himself again diving into wonderful translucent depths gosh ive done more than twentyfive lines he said at length and i never noticed i say give me a construe frank ive been more than half an hour i want to hear how it sounds in english frank drew his chair up to davids so that they could both share the same book right oh he said but let me read it through first this was the education of david and frank was tremendously anxious to construe the beautiful passage well and he took some five minutes more going over it while davids glance fed on the list of the twentytwo promotions then he began stranger he said blast it that wont do it sounds american guest suggested david yes thats better o guest in this land of horsemen thou hast come to the most fair of earths homes to gleaming kolonos frequented by the nightingale that bubbles liquidly in the shelter of green glades making his habitation amid the winedark ivy and the untrodden bowers of the god myriadberried unseen of the sun where dionysus master of revels ever treads companied by the nymphs that nursed him oooh said david pushing back his yellow hair and still rather shy of liking this and fed with heavenly dew the sweet clusters of the narcissus are flowering morn by morn the immemorial crown of the great goddesses and the goldenbeamed crocus is ablossom nor dwindle ever the sleepless springs whence come the wandering waters of the kephissus but every day he flows in stainless tides over the plains of earths ripening bosom giving speedy increase nor have the choirs of muses abhorred the spot nor goldenreined aphrodite maddox paused thats your twentyfive lines he said oh ripping said david it really is absolute a do go on i told you it had merit said frank and proceeded to the end of the chorus why its better than atalanta said david at the conclusion despite his barbarian instinct that things like the beauties of greek literature might perhaps be thought about but hardly talked of maddox however had no such notions of course it is he said and some time if you work frightfully hard and love it all youll find as the head told us the other day that you simply laugh at the thought of translating it at all youll know it cant be translated and that will be the reward of your work for it will mean that greek has got into your blood that its part of you do you mean the heads like that asked david all the same i think i would sooner translate it like you you dont understand but you would if you had heard him the other day we had a plato lesson with him but instead of going through a single line of it something set him off and he talked to us for the whole hour about athens and the life they led there you never heard anything so splendid you could go up to the acropolis in the morning and look at the frieze pheidias had put up in the parthenon a procession of horses and boys riding to the temple on athenes birthday he showed us pictures of it some were mountedoh lord they had good seatsand others were still putting their horses bridles on and one horse was rubbing its foreleg with its nose or tother way round pheidias asked david yes biggest sculptor theres ever been far ahead of michelangelo or rodin or any one and when you had seen that you and your friendyou and me that iswould sit on the wall of the acropolis looking over the town out to the mountains the purple crown of mountains as they called them hymettus where the honey came from and pentelicus where they got the marble for the parthenon and another onewhats its nameoh parnes then to the south you would look over the sea all blue and dim out towards salamis which as the head said was the trafalgar of athens where they beat those stinking persians and then we should lunch off grapes and figs and cheese wrapped up in vineleaves and yellow wine and go down to the theatre just below to hear perhaps this very play by sophocles first performance and no end of an excitement then perhaps we should see pericles awfully handsome chap and the biggest prime minister there ever was and a queer ugly fellow would go by who would be socrates and all the boys and young men were fearfully keen about games quite as keen as we are because they used to date the year by the olympic games same as we use ad or bc lord im jawing i wish i could tell it you as the head did oh go on said david well it wasnt only games that they were so keen about they loved sculpture and painting and writing so much that no one ever touched them at it before or since it was the consummate age so the head said and then when it came to fighting a little potty place like attica no bigger than a small english county just wiped the persians up in everything so the head told us the athenians of the great age were the type of the perfect physical and intellectual life oh david lets save up and go to athens rather but why did the romans walk over them frank got up the bell for chapel had begun because they became corrupt and beastly what an awful pity i say you made me feel awfully keen with that construe and telling me what the head said i havent thought about the twentytwo forfor ten minutes and ones got to try to get at it all by sapping yes thats how youll get to love it sounds almost worth while said david but they liked games as well thats a comfort frank took up his straw hat he took up also the list that lay on the table come on he said i want to put this up on the noticeboard before chapel oh dont said david all the fellows will see it and i shall turn crimson when we stand up for the psalms bosh every one expects it davids volatile mind went back to the greek talk pheidias was it he said yes sculptorman said frank david usually a solid sleeper could not take his usual plunge into the dim depths that night on getting into bed but he did not make any particular effort to do so for it was really waste of time not to lie awake when there were so many delightful things to think about round and round in his head they turned like some bright wheel and now it was the events of the last three days housematch in other words now the more immediate happenings of the evening his promotion into the twentytwo and the much huger honour of playing for the eleven next week that sparkled on the wheel or again this sudden illumination with regard to the greeks fed his contemplation up till now it had not been real to him that the people who wrote these tedious or difficult things which he had to learn were once as alive as himself or that beauty had inspired them to make plays and statues even as beauty had inspired keats and swinburne until frank had given him the gist of the heads discourse he never thought of those plays as being performed in a theatre before an audience who had not to look up words and learn the grammar and consider what governed an apparently isolated genitive or account for an irregular aorist they were not bookworms and scholars but men and boys who ran races and crowned the victor and had their trafalgar just as if they were english it was all vague but decidedly there was a new light on matters concerning sophocles but permeating all these things was their inspiring spirit frank who lay in the bed next him whose face he could dimly see in the light from the unblinded open window just opposite and then for the first time it was borne in upon david with a sense of reality that in a few weeks more five and a piece to be accurate frank would have left at that thought all the pleasant and interesting things which had so delightfully entertained this waking hour was struck from his mind and he sat up in bed giving a little despairing groan hullo said frank softly you awake too whats the groaning about oh nothing said david lying down again well then what isnt it about david slewed round in bed facing him as he leaned on his elbow its only five weeks to the end of the half he whispered andand you dont come back i know its foul i was thinking of it myself its been keeping me awake david was silent a minute then frank spoke again im sorry to leave for a whole heap of reasons he said one more than any whats that said david fellow called blaize thought i should just like to tell you now dont groan any more go to sleep you swell in the twentytwo right oh fellow called maddox said david chapter xiii david was sitting on the bank below the pavilion on the last afternoon of the term waiting for frank who was paying certain bills in the town to join him and take his cricket things away to save time david had packed them for him emptying his locker into his cricketbag and now it and his own ready packed lay beside him on the grass the plan was to sit here and talk till chapelbell began when they would take their belongings down and leave them at the lodge in readiness for the bus to the station next morning it was their last opportunity of being alone together for after chapel they would have to go down to their house to dress for concert and after concert was the housesupper in honour of their having won the cricketcup it would all be exceedingly public and rejoiceful and frank would have to make a speech and david was afraid he would want to groan again instead of applauding which was quite out of the question as the occasion was one of uproarious mirth the last five weeks had passed with awful speed he had worked a good deal he had played cricket a good deal and though he had not got into the eleven everything had been tremendously prosperous he had been tried twice for the eleven once against the next sixteen once against a team of old boys from cambridge and in both matches he had bowled with considerable success but then the weather had changed and instead of the dry crumbling wickets which suited him there had been ten days rain wickets were soft and slow and certainly would be for the match at lords the day after tomorrow and david had become about as much use as a practical bowler as a babyinarms would have been so crawley only this morning had been given the last place in the eleven which was absolutely all right for crawley could bat as well and in the last school match had both taken wickets and made runs the slow ground suiting his style in both respects in the same match maddox had scored a hundred in his inimitable style and david had shouted himself hoarse and and all these things were dead and done with apart from cricket work had taken up a good deal of his time and work mere silly work in a class room taken by mr howliss had assumed a different aspect this had all come out of that talk with frank when he translated the chorus from dipus coloneus on which occasion david had realised that pheidias was a real person and pericles a real prime minister and that socrates was jolly to young fellows and told them heavenly stories about the gods they had all become people who went to the theatre like anybody else and went to olympia just as anybody now might go to the oval and had playwriters like aristophanes who made just the same sort of jokes as people make nowadays out of that evening too had resulted the fact that david instead of occupying a modest and unassuming place some halfway down the middle fifth had heard to his great astonishment his name read out at the top of that distinguished form a prize was the consequence of that presented him that morning at prizegiving by a royal duchess who said she was very much pleased which was distinctly civil of her but all those things were dead also they had happened there was but little more to happen little that mattered there was the concert in which david was one of a group of tenors who would take part in the milton ode that would be rather jolly there was a delightful passage at the end about o may we soon renew that song and the name blest pair of sirens had an aroma about it adams had quoted it to him and maddox just after cockhouse match when he had asked for leave to go down to bathe what a good day that had been perhaps the best day of all these dead days then after the concert would be the uproarious housesupper with a farewell speech from frank david felt empty inside at the thought the field was speckled with groups of boys straying about in the idleness of the last day some sat on the grass some were playing stumpcricket and all seemed unreasonably cheerful now and then two or three passed near him and he exchanged friendly hullos with them sometimes they would ask him to join them in a stroll but davids reply was always the same sorry but i promised to wait here for a chap then bags detached himself from a passing group and sat down by him david could talk to him with freedom oh bags i feel beastly he said what rot the end of term is but youre going to have rather a decent time arent you asked bags oh yes theres a cricket week at baxminster and theyve asked me to play in two matches and its awfully good of you to want me to come and stay with you ill let you know as soon as ever i can depends on my pater perhaps were all going to switzerland come whenever you like said the faithful bags i shall be at home all the holidays i think you might enjoy it theres a lot of rabbitpotting in august you know and some partridges in september is it easy to shoot asked david lord yes i get on all right and i havent got your eye well its awfully good of you i should like to come if i may but i dont care about anything today hump i suppose bags looked out over the yellowgreen of the midsummer field heres maddox he said almost running wonder what hes in such a hurry for david sat up so he is he said i say lets sit next each other at housesupper take a place for me if you get in first im a singer at concert and singers always get out last right oh said bags he got up quite slowly and it seemed ridiculous to david that he should not skip away at once but he still lingered i dare say maddox is coming up to take his cricket things away he remarked i dare say thats it said david by a stroke of providence gregson and a friend came by at this moment ripping sport said gregson come on bags theres a terrier at schoolshop and theyre going to put a ferret into the ratholes placell be alive with rats coming too blazes no hate rats said david bags departed a moment after frank joined david just nodded to him and sat down by him been waiting he asked sorry i couldnt get through with my jobs before have you stuck my things into my bag good work we can just sit here till chapelbell yes i emptied your locker said david i stuck everything into your bag old shoes old twentytwo cap all there was afraid i didnt pack it very neatly doesnt matter said frank funny that there should be an old twentytwo cap still there very curious said david precisely frank gave a short little laugh its all pretty beastly isnt it he said you look rather depressed too but theres the housesupper to cheer you up oh damn the housesupper said david franks pretence at light conversation broke down tisnt as if we were going to lose each other said he and were not dead either of us david do buck up cant said david then its rotten of you it isnt a bit worse for you than me youve lots of things in front of you youll get into the eleven next year youll get into the sixth at christmas if you try youll swagger horribly youll frank could not manage to pump up any more consoling reflections they were all beside the point so like a sensible boy he left them alone and went to the point instead david old chap he said i dont believe two fellows ever had such a good time as weve had and it would be rot to pretend not to be sorry that this bit of it has come to an end i dare say we shall have splendid times together again but theres no doubt that this is over on the other hand it would be equal rot not to feel jolly thankful for it the chances were millions to one against our ever coming across each other at all so buck up as i said david had rolled over on to his face but at this he sat up picking bits of dry grass out of his hair yes thats so he said but it will be pretty beastly without you i shant find another friend like you youd jolly well better not interrupted frank david could not help laughing i suppose were rather idiots about each other he said i dare say but its too late to remedy that now oh david its a good old place this look at the pitch there what a lot of ripping hours its given to generations of fellows me among them theres the roof of the house through the trees do you see you can just see the end window of our dormitory i wonder if happiness soaks into a place so that if the famous professor pepper oh mammalian blood said david whats that oh yes the crime at naseby same one i wonder if he would find a lot of happinessgerms all over the shop i could do with a few said david with a sudden return to melancholy no you couldnt youve got plenty of them as it is lord theres that rotten speech i have to make at housesupper what am i to say oh usual thing say adams is a good fellow and were all good fellows and its a good house and a good school and a good everythinghurrah thats about it said frank oh theres one other thing david look after jevons a bit will you hes turning into rather a jolly little kid inky little beast said david all right again they were silent for a while rather a ripping verse in the psalms this morning said frank at length was there i wasnt attending well it seemed rather applicable i thought for my brethren and companions sake i will wish thee prosperity just as if the other david not you was talking to his school and theres chapelbell beginning they sat still a moment longer then frank rose we must go david he said wouldnt do to be late as its the last time give me your hands ill pull you up david stretched out his great brown paws and frank hauled him to his feet david stood there a second still holding good old psalm he said chapter xiv david was sitting in front of the fire in his housemasters study one afternoon late in november occasionally reading the sporting and dramatic and otherwise listening with a strong inward satisfaction to the slinging of the sleet on to the window panes which as pointed out by lucretius emphasises the warm comfort of present surroundings he had a large foot on each side of the fire just below the chimneypiece and a large cushion at the back of his head and no intention at all of going into the foul cold showerbath called outofdoors what made his satisfaction the more complete was that a notice had been passed round at hall from gregson the captain of the house at football that every one had to go out for a threemile run with a view to keeping in training for housematches and it added to davids pleasure to think of all those poor wretches plodding through the rainy sleet and the mud and the puddles while he like the kings daughter in the psalms was all glorious within gregsonalias plugswho was a pal of davids had called him by all the insulting names he could think of when david had absolutely refused to obey orders and the end of it had been that david had picked gregson up he was a little fellow though an admirable halfback at rugby football and carried him all the way upstairs in his arms and round each dormitory in turn to show him that he was in perfectly good training already thereafter he had taken the sporting and dramatic from the readingroom against all rules and retired to adamss study to spend a cosy time before the fire adams himself came in before long and david pushed his chair back and took down his large feet so that he did not usurp the whole of the hearthrug and the entire warmth of the fire he had like half the house the habit of sitting in adamss study who wanted nothing better than to have his boys about not gone for a trainingrun david asked he no sir plugser gave me leaveoff adams lit his pipe and sat down on the hearthrug which was his usual place on what grounds he asked david laughed i carried him round the house sir to show him i was in good training he said he didnt mind a bit thatll do for my text said adams i wanted to sermonise you thats the sort of thing david that i wish you wouldnt do you are rather given to undermining authority it doesnt set a very good example and though you probably dont know it the house takes its tune from you and one or two others you are pals with gregson i know and thats all the more reason why you should support him and while im on the subject i want to ask you not to swear so much david sat up in astonishment sir i bet youve never heard me swear he said i know i havent but ive heard young jevons and i draw the perfectly correct conclusion that you do im awfully grateful by the way for your taking him up as youve done and teaching him to wash his hands and not look as if everybody wanted to thrash him did anybody suggest it to you oh yes frank said david well youve done good work though i didnt mean to praise you but jevons copies you he brushes his hair like you and whistles between his teeth or tries to and runs instead of walking and as i say swears do stop it will you he was leaning out of his study window yesterday exchanging compliments with somebody and i never heard such an assortment of billingsgate its such awfully bad form you know also the sentiments expressed by bad language are not edifying ill try sir said david ii never thought of swearing as meaning anything i know you didnt i never said it was the expression of a foul mind but the house is becoming a perfect company of bargees try not to swear yourself and kick anybody who does when its convenient thats all about that right sir said david then theres another thing said adams i want you to tell me about the court of appeal ive only just heard about it and i dont think i like it david frowned this wasnt his idea of a comfortable afternoon indoors at all and he wished he had gone out for a run instead of carrying plugs round the house i dont think i can sir he said there are other fellows concerned in it oh i know that the court is you and gregson and bags chiefly you thats why i asked you i heard about it from the head he doesnt like it either i said i would go into the matter i dont promise that he wont as well i suppose that little beast manton told him remarked david i dont agree with little beast said adams but i agree that probably manton told him i really dont see what else the head of the house could do now i want to hear what the court of appeal have to say about themselves just as i shall want to know what the prefects say about them gregson and bags are quite safe in your hands as advocatuswell perhaps not quite diaboli you can trust me for that david raised himself and sat turkfashion with crossed legs in the big basketchair its rather a long story sir if im to tell it from the beginning he said never mind well you see sir there was such an awful change in the house when frank and cruikshank left at the end of last half you see they were proper prefects they used their authority properly and it was jolly well necessary to respect it you couldnt cheek fellows like them when they gave orders it simply couldnt happen and it was so frantically different to get little clever squirts like manton and crossley in authority instead they couldnt keep order a hang the whole house would have been out of hand in no time youll see that the court of appeal was really meant to preserve order why the very fags used to laugh at them one of them put soap in mantons kettle one day and when it boiled it came bubbling out of the spout like blowing soapbubbles you never saw anything so funny but the court of appeal stopped that adams preserved his gravity thats rather a new light he said go on david you neednt bring in names if you think youd better not but its only fair that the head should know your side of the question as he has heard mantons david got red in the face mantons a bl filthy little sneak he observed also i bet he hasnt told the head the truth he probably told him the truth as it struck him said adams it strikes you differently but he didnt sneak as you think the head got his first news about the court of appeal from quite another source may i know what source asked david yes i dont mind telling you but you must be officially ignorant jevons went to breakfast with the head the other day and remarked in an outburst of confidence that you were far the biggest swell in the house because you were the president of the court of appeal he said it in all innocence but the head was naturally interested to hear more and applied towell to the proper quarter which was manton david recovered from his spurt of temper that funny little jev probably thought it all quite regular he said of course he did he wouldnt have given you away on purpose go on weve got to the soap in the kettle david laughed yes sir you should have seen it coming all rainbowy out of the spout so of course manton sent for thethe fellow who did it and he couldnt even cane him alone but had to have crossley in to help its perfectly degrading sir to have prefects like that so crossley held the fellow down and just as manton began to lay on the fellow kicked out and crossley slipped across to get out of the way and manton landed him an awful wipe over the shin and so crossley let go and stamped about and they made such a row between them that i had to look in id gone on tiptoe to the door sir in case anything funny occurred and so as i say i looked in and there was babbingtonoh name slipped out by accidentfit to burst himself with laughing and the kettle boiling over again with soapbubbles and crossley hopping about on one leg and manton apologising to him and then manton turned on me and told me i was undermining discipline so i had to say there seemed a precious lot of discipline to undermine and then manton lost his presence of mind and whacked out again at babbington and missed him and smashed his electric light o lor i never saw anything so funny david shrieked with laughter again at the remembrance and adams could not resist joining him as he turned to beat out his pipe against the bars of the fire well he said at length i could tell you heaps of stories like that said david wiping his eyes another time it was crossley who told a fellow to write out fifty lines so he wrote out fifty lines just like that on a sheet of paper and showed it up fancy doing that to frank or crookles why you couldnt and then crossley told him to write them out twice so he took another bit of paper and wrote them out twice on it and then crossley said he would cane him so jevonslord theres another name please forget it sirjevons came and appealed precious lot of good that did him for the court were satisfied that hed deserved his fifty lines and so i gave him six frightful stingers myself as i knew crossley wasnt fit to for cheek to a prefect and yet you and manton say im undermining discipline sir added david in a voice of outraged virtue why were enforcing it jev had to write out his hundred lines and got a whacking too though the court of appeal can reverse a prefects decision it also may enforce it and then thethe appellant gets it twice as hot for having appealed same as in english law sir this is all rather news to me remarked adams well sir something had to be done said david or the whole house would have gone to pot why the fags might have taken it into their heads to cheek fifth form next when theyd finished with the sixth and there would have been trouble you see most of the big fellows in the house are in the fifth thats the way the court of appeal started go on said adams well the next thing wasoh i must tell you thisone night a couple of juniors made an applepie bed for gregson awful cheek so naturally he whacked them soundly and formally and they went to manton and told him that gregson had been whacking them so round comes manton and tells gregson before the whole dormitory and him captain of football that hes no right to as he wasnt a prefect and of course gregson said hed heard that a little before manton had caned crossley that was the babbington affair and that he hadnt any right to cane a prefect thats the sort of thing that went on all the first weeks of this half sir thered have been a regular revolution unless wed done something and so i say that the court of appeal is more to support authority than the other way about well now well take the other way about said adams i mean i want to know about the cases in which you upset the prefects authority david thought for a moment well sir those two manton and crossley did all sorts of things were not accustomed to have prefects doing he said when they went the round of the studies during preparation to see that we were working they used to put on slippers and open the door quick to try and catch you doing nothing and of course they often did well thats not playing the game sir frank always came clumping along and he always tapped at your door it was just the same when they went the rounds of dormitories after lights were out slippers you dont do any good by spying you know you wont stop fellows ragging oror anything else that sort of way it only means that two can play at that game and if you want to do anything of the kind that you shouldnt you just put a sentinel at the door spying just encourages fellows to break rules smoking too well smoking said adams crossley suspected a certain fellow of smoking and one day when he was out he went and looked in his table drawer and found a pipe there now sir that sort of things all rot he wanted to whack him for it and the fellow appealed so naturally we gave it in his favour when it came out that crossley had looked in his private drawer you wouldnt dream of doing it yourself sir naturally not so of course we reversed crossleys sentence and wouldnt let him be whacked did you three appoint yourself the court asked adams yes i suppose it was about that we were all pals you see sir and the rest of the house seemed satisfied that wed take a fairish view of things and so about a month ago after wed settled that something must be done we just let every one know that they could appeal against any impot or caning that those two manton and crossley proposed to give and we would decide but then you see sir if any one appeals as i said and the court upholds the prefect he gets it twice as hot hundred lines instead of fifty etcetera weve written it all out in a book constitution of the court of appeal so as to have it regular and in case we forgot good gracious its a constitution is it asked adams david became slightly dignified yes we thought it better to put it on an orderly footing sir he said and have everything regular so that we shouldnt contradict ourselves and do one thing one time and another another also the fellows know what to expect and whats more we see that the impots are properly done if we confirm them canings too why one day crossley caned a fellowdavid began to bubble with laughter againand he pretended to go to sleep and snore and when crossley told him it was all over he pretended to awake and said hullo morning already why its a farce sir its sheer childish whats the use of caning a fellow if you dont jolly well hurt him so we took that out of the prefects hands and the impots get properly written and fellows get properly whacked if its a whacking i dont say it increases the respect in which the house holds those two little fellows at the top but surely its better to have some authority than none adams thought over this for a while the head had apparently been given to understand by manton that the authority of the two prefects had been wrenched out of their hands by these large athletic upstarts of the fifth form and that in consequence anarchy prevailed and the house had become a sort of medmenham abbey but davids account had put a perfectly different aspect on the affair and one that was eminently reasonable adams was a fairminded man and putting aside altogether the fact that he delighted in david and disliked manton he believed that davids version was the true one it had always been his plan to let the house look after its own affairs as far as possible he gave it home rule in fact and certainly the transfer of government to the fifth form though highly irregular and in defiance of schoolrules he believed to have been distinctly for the good of the nation again a thing which bore out this view the first weeks of the half had been full of trouble and worry small boys were for ever appealing to him against the prefects and prefects were as constantly invoking his authority to endorse their own lack of it then about a month ago all these disturbances had ceased and adams with his habitual optimism had supposed that the house had shaken down together now but in the light of all this it seemed far more reasonable to suppose that the remedy had been brought about by this brigandage of authority certainly the restoration of peace and quiet was coincident with the establishment of this impertinent court of appeal which would have to come to an end as a recognised institution but during its existence it seemed to have been effective do you reverse many of the prefects rulings asked adams oh no sir not now said david anxious to do such justice as could be done to those two impotent figureheads you see neither of them liked their silly rulings reversed and theyve become much more sensible but you simply cant have a prefect looking in your study when youre out and wanting to cane you because he finds a pipe there fancy frank or cruikshank doing a scruggish lowdown trick like that you seem rather fond of that instance said adams yes sir because its so jolly typical said david adams got up im considering what to say to the head he remarked i shall certainly tell him theres another side to the question besides mantons oh ripping said david cordially i felt sure youd see it i suppose you enjoyed the court of appeal a good deal he asked rather sir said david i should think we did wish you could have heard one of the trials with us three on the bench and manton as defendant and some junior as plaintiff you see sir manton and crossley consented to it all thats another point in our favour isnt it gregson planned all the ritual because his paters a real judge in appeal courts and we call each other my learned brother crabtree or blaize for of course there are no nicknames or christian names in court its all quite serious theres no rag about it we were thinking of appointing a permanent counsel to plead for plaintiffs adams laughed david you dont suppose that the court of appeal is going to be allowed to remain in existence he asked thats as you wish sir he said but well asked adams nothing sir i was only thinking that therell be rather rows again i hope not said adams thats exactly what you and fellows like you have got to prevent but how can we if youre going to stop it asked david in hundreds of ways by backing the prefects up without overriding them youre sensible enough to know that david considered this is the head sick about it sir he asked hes never sick about anything till hes in full possession of the facts he was prepared to be uncommonly sick when he had only heard the other side in fact he said something about giving you another lesson with regard to obeying authorities but after what youve told me i dont think you need be alarmed oh im not said david of course hell see theres another side to it same as youve done something had to happen when we got manton and crossley instead of frank and cruikshank at this moment a small and completely soaked boy burst into the room not seeing adams who was sitting behind the door but only david letter for you blaize he said oh and i want to appeal sorry sir i didnt see you you do now jevons said adams so go on tell blaize what the appeals about well sir somebody put my sponge on the top of mantons door made a boobytrap and because its my sponge he says im responsible unless i find out who put it there adams nodded to david go on learned brother blaize he said notice in writing jev he said he had seen the handwriting of his letter and tore it open oh i say how ripping he said franks mothers ill and is ordered out of england for christmasat least its beastly that shes illbut frank wants to know if he can stay with us for a week i say jev youre awfully wet arent you i mean you couldnt get much wetter so i wonder if youd take a tellywag just down to the office rather and ill put my appeal in your study shall i yes right ill be back in a second if youll have your tellywag ready is the telegram to frank saying he can come asked adams yes sir then hadnt you better write to your father first it might not be convenient the impulsive david had already written ripping stay as long as you can but he paused oh well i suppose it would be best sir he said i wish you hadnt thought of it david got up to go to his study and write the note which was so far outstripped by his desire and may i talk to bags and plugs about the court of appeal sir he said certainly you can talk it over with manton too if you like in fact i rather recommend it adamss recommendation seemed to be rather sensible when david thought over it though not perhaps strictly in accordance with adamss idea in suggesting it it would give the court an opportunity perhaps of finding out what manton had said to the head and should manton not choose to tell them it was easy to threaten as a countermove that the court when called upon as it undoubtedly would be to appear before the head would give a highly coloured account strictly based upon facts of what had led to its formation also they could put before manton and crossley a very depressing picture of what their position would be if the court was dissolved and privately chose not to back up their restored authority it required but small imagination to picture the status of those two unfortunate prefects if they had to enforce discipline in the house without the support of what had been the court bags and gregson had just come in from their run and gregson being in his bath and in the superior position of having no clothes on could take reprisals by water on davids having refused to go out david in fact had to dodge a soaking sponge thrown at him before he had time to begin to explain oh pax a minute he said theres a damnedan awful serious thing happened plugs the head knows all about the court of appeal and its goin to be gone into rot said gregson filling his sponge again now who wouldnt go out for a sweat david tisnt rot shrieked david snatching up a towel to shield himself i swear it isnt while you brutes have been having an innocent happy sweat along the road this nice weather ive been jawed by adams its a solid fact were all going to be hauled up before the head and he was disposed to be uncommonly sick about it so adams said do shut up being funny with sponges right oh said plugs if you swear youre not lying swear said david hurry up and dress and come to my study because you and i and bags have to talk itsits a welter of politics the court accordingly met in about ten minutes time in davids study where he had made tea for them and where on the table lay jevonss appeal he laid before the other two all his talk with adams reproducing it with laudable accuracy and as its a dead cert that we shall appear before the head he finished up weve got to agree exactly what we say we mustnt give different accounts of it bags caressed what he hoped was going to be a moustache of course not he said weve just got to say whats happened truth whole truth and nothing but oh i didnt mean we were to make things up said david but the only question is how much we tell the head i vote for a conferenceadams suggested itwith manton and crossley and see if we cant let each other down easily compromise out of court suggested plugs yes something of the kind we can give them away hopelessly by saying how inefficient they were and they can give us away by saying that we have undermined the prefects authority dont you see it might all be toned down a bit thats no use said bags if mantons given us away already but thats just what we dont know said david i vote we try to get manton to tell us what he told the head he may not have told him much he may have said it was an amicable sort of arrangement on the other hand he may have told him that our object was to undermine prefects authority well as i told adams theres another side to that we generally supported it except when it was manifestly unfair i want to know what manton told him that we have put ourselves above the prefects is true but we did it in the cause of order though of course we all enjoyed it frightfully and the house accepted us said bags lot the head will care for that i want to get manton and crossley to come and talk crossley doesnt matter but manton anyhow as hes already seen the head you see when the head has us up we can tell him a lot if we choose hell ask us for our account of it mantonll see that he isnt a fool though he is such a squirt with plugs as well as bags david was the mastermind and after a few minutes bags went to mantons study and quite politely asked him to come round and confer with the court manton rather liked this he promised himself a pleasant time in telling the court that the head was going into the whole matter himself and that he had nothing more to do with it he was prepared to be maliciously civil and courteous and to express his regret the court had made such an ass of itself as its spontaneous generation implied he thought it would be rather fun and came very blandly with his spectacles on and a book that he was reading his finger kept his place in a cursory manner here i am he said hullo blaize hullo gregson yes the court of appeal it wasnt i who went to the head about it you know it was that little fellow blaizes friend who let it out whats his name i forget oh jevons said david yes jevons told the head about it and so of course the head asked me more he put it rather nicely he said it was my business to tell him about it as head of the house david was seated between his two learned brothers just as if a regular court was going on oh we know about jevons he said we can leave jevons out waive said plugs formally yes we can waive jevons said david as my learned brother suggests manton gave a little cackle of laughter i shouldnt wonder if you had to waive everything he observed pleasantly oh were not going to waive you just yet if you count for anything retorted david but perhaps you dont count for much bags suddenly laughed in a hoarse manner i beg pardon brother blaize he said right oh brother crabtree but just contain yourself well manton youve been to the head with your version and next we go to the head with ours we can make it pretty sultry for you if we choose and we shouldnt mind doing it a bit but it all depends on what you have told the head thats what we should like to know manton still felt in a very superior position all he had told the head was quite true namely that these three fifthform boys put themselves in a position above the prefects so that any order or punishment by the two sixthform boys in the house could be appealed against and if they thought proper could be reversed the head had been extremely grave about it and at present there was no doubt in mantons mind that he was going to uphold the authority of the prefects in a summary manner and probably make it very hot for those who had set themselves above it he felt quite secure and comfortable and smiled in rather a lofty manner i dare say the head will tell you as much of what i said as he thinks good for you he observed but i really dont see why i should you see he takes the view that prefects are not to be dictated to by two or three members of the fifth form bad precedent you know it might lead to a couple of fellows out of the fourth form dictating to you jevons and a friend might make a supercourt of appeal rather funny that would be david passed the ghost of a wink to gregson he wanted to draw manton on a little further before he unmasked his batteries it required some control to assume an attitude of humility when delicious sentences were beginning to seethe in his brain but it was heavenly to see mantons malicious little eyes beaming at him through his spectacles and notice what an awful scug he looked with his hair rather long behind lying outside his collar he gave a sigh i say im afraid were in for it he said disconsolately manton let his mouth expand into an odious smile yes i should say you were he observed you see the heads view is that the authority of prefects is an institution which has his support and he doesnt quite see why it should be taken away by three fellows in the fifth he asked me all sorts of questions and so i had to give him a pretty full account i should make a clean breast of it i think if i were you david could stand this no longer he felt that he must burst if he had to listen to any more of mantons advice you say you gave him a pretty full account he said though you have not chosen to tell us what it was well i shouldnt wonder if we made it a bit fuller for you i beg your pardon brother crabtree bags was leaning back looking dreamily at manton learned brother gregson he observed do you remember one day how mr manton wanted to whack a little boy called babbington and how he had to call in mr crossley to help plugs assumed a portentous air yes brother crabtree he said and how soapbubbles came out of mr mantons kettle though he had not meant to wash david chimed in and we all remember my learned brother he said how the house was a perfect beargarden for the first month of this term before we started our worshipful court and how david turned to manton perhaps you didnt tell the head that he said we shall we shall tell him how you couldnt get lines done for you till we enforced the authority you hadnt got we shall say how you walk round the house in slippers and when you get back to your own fuggy studies you darent walk straight in for fear of finding a boobytrap come down on your mangy heads jolly wise precaution too on your part we shall tell the head all that david licked his lips as he warmed to his work he took jevonss appeal off the table in front of him i shall take this to the head and read it him he said just listen pretty dignified position for you isnt it to the court of appeal please blaize manton got an awful soaker because somebody else put my sponge on the top of his door which soused him and because it was my sponge he says hell whack me unless i find out who did it and tell him which isnt fair because its not my business so i appeal m c jevons manton was getting a little rattled otherwise he would not have done anything so foolish as try to grab this paper david whisked it away i shall say too that you tried to get hold of this he said better sit down manton thats right and i shall tell him that your notion of authority is to look in a fellows private drawer when hes out to see if you can nail a pipe i never did said manton wildly that was crossley oh then i suppose crossley will explain that said david of course it may all be stale news to the head since you gave him a pretty full account but ill just see if the head happened to listen to that part you see we dont in the least mind telling you what were going to say to the head though youre too superior to tell us what you said ive told adams about it already and he thinks youre an awfully good prefect of course and then you see concluded david cheerfully when weve told him all that really happened why shouldnt we make up a lot that didnt probably you did the same gosh the head will have a wonderful high opinion of you before ive done i shouldnt wonder if it isnt more than he can bear and jolly well breaks down and sobs and kneels and gives thanks that he has such a ripping couple of prefects in this house to keep us all in order well you neednt be sarcastic about it said manton yes i need because you began about having a fourthform court of appeal to override us you think that its only you who can be so damned sarcastic and superior and give any garbled account you like to the head it wasnt garbled it must have been or do you suppose that a sensible chap like the head could have taken your side perhaps you didnt invent things but i swear you left out some jolly important ones like your not being able to cane a cheeky junior without getting crossley to help you and then whacking him on the shin instead you should have seen adams shaking when i told him about it and i bet you said we set ourselves in opposition to you thats a lie we backed your authority up except when you made such utter squirts of yourselves that we couldnt we helped you you goat we did for you what you couldnt do for yourselves lord it makes me hot to talk to a chap like you go on bagsi mean brother crabtree manton was beginning to present so ludicrous an appearance that learned brother blaize could hardly prevent bubbling with laughter which would have spoiled the forcibleness of the situation his finger no longer kept his place in his book his tight little mouth no longer complacently smiled but had fallen open in dismay at davids surprising remarks and learned brother crabtree with his suave style and slow sentences did not reassure him you see theres nothing like fair play manton said bags i take it that you agree and as youve had an uninterrupted innings with the head and have run up a good score against us im sure it is only proper that we should have our turn now you were not wise in refusing to tell us what you had said to the head but the time for that is past now and even if you wanted to i dont suppose we should listen to you it was foolish of you because you make us guess what it was and naturally we guess that you made up a lot of lies since we think that is the sort of thing you would do so when you leave us now which will be very soon we shall make up some rippers about you and crossleyreally awful things you know i began making some up when brother blaize was addressing you they are beauties gregson took up the tale with a wink at david in the eye away from manton and yet i dont know that we need bother to make things up brother crabtree he said its easier to say just a few of the things that really happened we will tell the head the sort of thing that goes on in mantons study when he thinks all the house are at preparation now manton for all his feebleness and ineffectiveness as a prefect was as blameless as the ethiopian but i dont know what you mean he said gregson gave a little laugh which he transformed into a cough oh really he said but the head will soon know what we mean davidi mean brother blaize knows david had caught the wink correctly he put on a scornful face oh that he said yes disgusting you should be more careful about shutting your door manton i and gregson were walking about the house in slippers following the example of the sixth form but i dont know what youre talking about said manton right oh we wont talk about it any moreto you it was in vain that manton assured himself that as was perfectly true his conscience was as clear as noonday for this wicked and subtlyacted fraud on the part of those fifthform devils made him uncomfortable in spite of himself and though he had not told the head anything false about this beastly court of appeal he certainly had not put their side of the case before him with the directness that it now appeared they were going to do on their own behalf he had not for instance said that the court of appeal propped up endorsed supported the authority of himself and crossley far more than they overrode it though it was perfectly true as he had told the head that they arrogated the supreme authority to themselves nor had it occurred to him to tell the head that he and crossley were quite incompetent to maintain discipline that they got ragged to the point of having soap put in their kettles that they toured the house in slippers truly the supplement to his tale was likely to be as voluminous as the tale itself then david rose well i dont think we need detain you he said politely in fact weve got a good deal to talk over among ourselves thanks awfully for coming i expect we shall all meet again at the heads thats all then but manton was not quite sure that this was all various remarks by one or other of the members of the court were beginning to cause him somewhat acute internal questionings in especial he disliked the fact that adams was in possession of the courts side of the case and as like as not would give the head the benefit of it perhaps we might discuss it all a little more he said with a faint air of condescension still lingering about him i canwell go to the head because he told me that if i had anything more to tell him i was to i might sayi really should be quite glad tothat crossley and i didnt want to get you into trouble oh thats all right said david cheerfully dont bother about that youve got us into no trouble at all i expect we shall come out perfectly right but the head was awfully sick about it said manton he laid a good deal of stress on the fact that you did set yourselves up as an authority superior to the prefects i expect ill make that all square said david i dare say i shall put our case as strongly as you put yours adams will have done the same too im pretty sure of course we thought we might let you down more easily if you told us what you told the head and after all we gave you an opportunity of doing so but you didnt take it so thats finished well i think perhaps i was wrong not to tell you said manton im sure you were assented bags warmly isnt it an awful pity one doesnt think of that sort of thing sooner and so if you like ill tell you now said manton finishing his sentence oh we dont care a hang either way said david if you wish you may tell us but itll be because you ask us if you may we dont want to hear it but i thought you asked me to said this dismal prefect we did but its no use to us now weve made up our minds what to do well shall i tell the head that you did often support the authority of the sixth it might make him less sick with you rubbish said gregson youre proposing these things now simply because you want us not to tell the head our side of it is that the reason or not i think it would yes or no said brother blaize in a terrible voice yes why not have asked for mercy sooner then instead of giving yourself all these airs get on it was a very unstuffed manton who was left at the end of this recital for though he had not told the head anything palpably false yet the picture the head must have drawn of the whole affair was about as erroneous as it could possibly be he had let the head assume that the authority of the prefects over the house was complete and satisfactory until the court of appeal set itself up and he had certainly not said that the court in most cases endorsed their authority and saw that their orders were obeyed all this was drawn from him by cool and ruthless questioning at the end david gave a long whistle well pon my word you are in a mess he said im not at all sure that i shouldnt resign my prefectship if i were you before the head kicked me out you are the deuce of a hand at suppressio veriaint that it brother gregson why there isnt an ounce of truth that you havent suppressed and its all as full of suggestioer falsi said bags yes suggestio falsi as it can stick the best thing you can do is to go and talk it over with crossley and then come back and tell us what you propose to tell the head if you dont make a clean breast of it to him and let him see that hes only got a garbledyes i said garbledversion of it at present you may be sure we shall and when youve made up your minds come back and tell us tap at the door first the unstuffed manton rose yes ill do that he said erthanks the door closed behind him and david who was growing extremely red in the face with suppressio risus turned over and buried his face in the sofacushions kicking wildly in the air the other learned brethren stifled themselves lest manton should hear them and for a few minutes the court of appeal writhed in the agonies of silent mirth o lord said david at length i didnt know there was such richness in the world to think that half an hour ago that little squirt thought he had us on toast toasts there all right but tisnt we who are on it and now hes making up another version which is ours and wanting to know if thatll satisfy us for him to go to the head with o lord too much mercy to let him said bags not a bit of it its much more effective if manton puts our side of it to the head but what if he doesnt tell the head all he says hes going to asked plugs he must the only way he can save his face is by going to him at once before adams can oh theres toast enough besides when the head sees us we can soon tell if mantons given him the correct version david as president of the court was summoned to the supreme presence next day ive been into the question of the court of appeal said the head and what manton told me last night puts a different complexion on it from what i had heard before of course the court must be dissolved at once blaize you understand that yes sir a faint smile spread over the heads face as he looked at the big jolly boy and tell youryour learned brethren he said what i say the authorities in your house are mr adams and the prefects and there are no other authorities but i believe now that on the whole the court meant well and i am quite certain it enjoyed itself immensely that particular enjoyment i am afraid must cease but i want itthe court that isto continue meaning well in a private capacity and to support the prefects authority though it may no longer enforce or reverse their orders and blaize this is for your private ear alone i think the court probably did very useful work but we mustnt have any more courts thats all then how are you getting on well i hope and mr adams seems to think so heard anything from your friend maddox lately gosh what a brick said david to himself as he went out chapter xv david was lying on his back under the big elmtree near the cricket pavilion one sunday afternoon in midjune by him upright and attentive sat the faithful bags listening and occasionally playing the part of greek chorus that is to say putting in short appropriate reflections to a quantity of surprising information both boys wore the white tie characteristic of prefects on sunday for both had got their promotion into the lower sixth at easter and were colleagues of the inefficient manton and crossley those two young gentlemen it may be remarked were vastly relieved to have the burden of authority taken off their somewhat feeble shoulders and david and bags particularly david ruled the house with genial exuberance and when necessary a rod of iron just now both the iron and the exuberance were relaxed and david lay there in an abandonment of physical laziness his straw hat with cricket eleven colours was tilted over the top part of his face so as to shield his eyes from the speckles and sparkles of sun that filtered through the canopy of leaves above him and his mouth and chin alone were visible his long legs were stretched out in front of him showing a white hiatus between a despondent sock and the end of his trousers and a persistent fly kept settling there an attention which he acknowledged by dabbing at it with the other ankle tisnt as if i was a little boy any longer he said when a fellow is close on seventeen as you and i are its time he began to realise that hes grown up why my mother was only seventeen when she married but do you propose to marry at seventeen asked bags with sarcastic allusion to the conversation that had gone before wherell she live she cant very well sleep in dormitory david gave a little spurt of laughter and the sun shone on his white teeth and down his red throat but he quickly became grave again is that funny he said if so i suppose id better laugh though i wish i saw the point who said i was going to marry o gosh what a clipper she is and its not much more than a fortnight ago that you thought all girls were rotten said bags more fool me then and more fool you for still thinking so lord i wish i was really grown up quite old i mean nineteen or twenty i say do you think she looked at me at all in chapel this morning i dont think so said bags cheerily and i was watching her pretty nearly all the time as i knew you would ask oh yes she did once when you began to sing amen before it was time but she looked away again at once ha ha said david in a dry speaking voice not laughing at all well shes bound to come to the old boys match isnt she and i dont see how she can help noticing if i take any wickets nor if you get constantly hit out of the ground said bags david found he agreed with this youre a jolly sympathetic sort of pal he said at length bags had a certain defence well it seems so queer of you he said its rot if youre going to think about and talk about nothing else than a female girl besides she must be frightfully old i shouldnt wonder if she was twenty why your mother had been married three years when she was as old as that yes and had had two children and had also died said david rather embarrassingly oh sorry i didnt know said bags but about your girl now he went on hurriedly how do you know she isnt engaged already she easily might be shes awfully pretty i grant you that at least i suppose she is though both you and i used to think that all girls looked exactly alike idiots idiots we were said david kicking wildly in the air and what are you going to do continued bags who always saw the practical issues are you going to tell her how frightfully keen you are on her i expect she guesses said david solemnly she came to tea with me twice in my study and its rather marked for a fellow to ask a dons daughter to tea twice in the same half specially if she comes the first time well but you didnt say anything sweet and moonlightly to her said bags you talked about nothing but cricket besides plugs and i were there the whole time and so was mother gray david drew a long breath and stretched his arms and legs out in the form of one crucified till elbows and knees were taut violet gray he said dwelling on the syllables did you ever hear such a jolly name and its just like her its a slim honeycolouredhair name bags groaned slightly it really was appalling for david to be in this deplorable state violet gray he said in a businesslike manner hm violet gray i think it sounds better than violet blaize david sat up bags you dont understand one single thing about it he said how can i explain shes just the most wonderful and beautiful thing that ever happened i wonder if frank will understand i shall tell him but nobody else hes coming down end of next week hell probably cut you out said bags who thought a bracing treatment was best for his idiotic friend not he were pals of course he could if he wanted since any girl would fall in love with frank straight off if he held up his little finger jove id give anything to see the varsity cricketmatch this week and to think that in final housematch last year i was in at one end and a cambridge cricket blue the other well that happened to everybody else in the houseeleven said bags since maddox went in first and carried his bat david laughed so it did he said ill back you against any one in the world bags for bald literal prosaicness you havent got an ounce of imagination you see things just exactly as they happen youve less of romance thanthan a horseroller he said looking round for inspiration and seeing that useful article with its shafts in the air perhaps i have perhaps i havent said bags but its perfectly true i dont jaw about it never mind that look here supposing you might either kiss violet gray twice well say or see the oxford and cambridge match which would you choose depends on the match said david of course if frank was going to make a century and i were to see him do that i dont know what else i could choose o lord but fancy kissing her though i wish you wouldnt ask such stumpers but thats you all over you want me to be practical and say which i should like best but i just cant ii feel like a dog which is being whistled to from opposite directions by two fellows it loves doesnt know which way to go bags sniffed scornfully oh youve not got it so desperately if you only feel like that he said david shut his eyes and made his mouth tight with an air of martyrlike determination i should choose kissing her he said because frank could tell me all about the match afterwards and besides it would all be reported in the sportsman and i could read about it but i couldnt read about my kissing her in the paper at least i dont know in which oh lord but fancy missing seeing frank putting perfectly straight balls away to the leg boundary in the varsity match and then scratching his ear as he always does when he hits a boundary as if wondering what on earth has happened to the ball i dont know which i should choose i dont know david looked mournfully round for inspiration and lay down again after all i wonder whether its worth while doing anything or getting anything he said with a sudden lugubrious accent i tried to think it would be a damned finejolly fine thing to get into the sixth and yet before a month was out we both got absolutely accustomed to it its been just the same about getting into schoolelevenoh well not quite because i do enjoy that most awfully still but i dare say it wont last why a year ago if i had been told that i might have any two things i wanted i should have chosen to get into the sixth and the eleven it didnt seem that there was anything more to want i should have thought you would have chosen that maddox shouldnt leave remarked bags no use wishing that he had to besides if he hadnt he wouldnt be in the cambridge eleven now and you cant choose anything that clips your pals wings tisnt my expression adams said it the other day when he was talking to me about jev didnt know jevons had any wings said bags nor did i but adams seems to think so i say adams is rather a wise sort of man and he sees just about three times as much as i thought oh and he told me hughes had passed into sandhurst he must have become a decent chap again they do said bags jolly glad about adams i always imagined that as long as he wasnt bothered he didnt mind much what happened short of a public row but i believe his funny old eye is on us more than we think and much more than it used to be said bags you know the bizz about the court of appeal woke him up tremendous there was a regular insti and constitution going on in the house under his very nose and he had never suspected it up till then he didnt bother about what any one did as long as there wasnt a row you know david the house was a perfect hell about the time you and i came here and adams hadnt a notion of it david sat up quickly i dare say he said but frank kept all that away from me anyhow the house is pretty well all right now there is nothing to make a row no smoking no cribbing no filth its ever so much more cheery to be like that and just think that less than three years ago bags you and i were just beginning as two dirty little fags what a bag of tricks has happened since then what were we talking about oh jevons adams was awfully decent to me about it made me blush he said id taught jev to be cleanthats true when he first used to fag for frank i wanted to wash the teacups again when his filthy little paws had touched themand oh yes he said id cured him of swearing which perhaps was true also though it seemed rather bad luck on him to be whacked by me for swearing when as adams said hed picked it up from me so i had to cure myself as well which ive almost done but then i couldnt whack myself when i swore so jev got on quicker than i did youre not getting on much now remarked bags patiently listening yes i am shut up im just coming to the wings adams said i was fussing over him too much and tying a string to his leg and clipping his wings when it was time for him to fly about as he damn pleased lord jev would have got whacked for that but you see hes turning out rather a fetching kidgoodlooking you know and all that and im not going to have him taken up by some brute and spoiled however any one who tries will have a nasty time with me first but i suppose adams is right jevs got to begin looking after himself im rather sorry in a way though its good sport looking after a kid like that and seeing it doesnt come to any harm hes an affectionate little beggar too and i believe he knows it would make me pretty sick if he got into beastly ways i say im afraid im talking like a missionary on the plains of timbuctoo remarked bags yes anywhere rum fellow you are bags you let me jaw to any extent without yawning or telling me to shut it but there are such a lot of frightfully interesting things that you must talk about in order to find out what you really think jev for instance i had no idea that i was a missionary till i began to jaw by the way my father is coming down for the old boys match next week dyou remember that awful morning when he bowled into the wrong net at helmsworth and how ashamed i was funny how one changes i should just love it if he did it again now because its so jolly sporting of him to try to bowl at all my sisters coming too and of course frank will be here playing for the old boys what a family they all love frank at home he and my father are tremendous pals they talk about norman and perpendicular and transitional till alls blue he stayed with us most of the christmas holidays you know when his mother was abroad david sat up again lord what a lot of things there are he said appreciatively not to mention her said bags no oh by the way i saw her coming out of maddens the photographers the other day do you suppose shed been done by jove shouldnt i like one well ask her then said bags with infinite patience david knitted his forehead into a diplomatic frown i couldnt straight off like that he said but i might lead up to it i might say i thought madden took jolly good photographs and see what she said suppose she said that she thought he didnt said bags wearily well i could say thatthat no one could do justice to some people or is that laying it on rather thick oh by the way ive been devilish cunning the head told me that my last iambics were pretty rotten and that id better have some private tuition so i asked if i might go to old gray for it jolly smart that so im going to drop french and have private tu with gray beginning tomorrow come into the garden maud remarked bags whats maud gotoh i see you mean violet yes thats the idea going in and out of the house im sure to run across her see why its striking four lets go down to house david as is the way of boys rising seventeen had been growing tremendously these last six months not in physical ways only but in stature of the mind it was impossible to imagine a boy less of a prig than he or one so unweighted with the sense of duty or responsibility but with his growth he had taken up his responsibilities quite simply and unconsciously and eagerly without having any egoism about it he did not in fact do these things and behave in a manner that made him so breezy a treasure to his housemaster because he heavily realised that there were things he ought to do and a manner in which he ought to behave but because he obeyed unconsciously the bent of his natural instincts which were those of a very highspirited and excellent fellow now budding from boyhood into early manhood he had no private meditations at all on the subject but merely lived in active and wholesome ways and enjoyed himself immensely and if by any chance he had come to learn what adams really thought of him he would have had no doubt that his informant was just pulling his leg his genial unconsciousness that he had any influence at all was exactly that which made his influence so strong he had the admirable gift of not thinking about himself but purely about the large quantity of attractive affairs that made up life and the number of jolly chaps with whom he was associated he had even been known to admit that manton and crossley to counteract whose ridiculous ineffectiveness the court of appeal had been founded were decent enough though of course no earthly good as prefects in the same way it was from no sense of conscious duty that he had educated and still watched over jevons it was sport looking after a kid was exactly the true account of the trouble he had taken then part of his growth had come this violent adoration of violet gray as natural as the strutting of the young male bird when first it is conscious of another sex than his david had suddenly perceived that though in many things girls are rotters there was something about them that made it necessary to wear buttonholes and if possible make runs or take wickets for other reasons than those generally necessary the two boys strolled at sunday pace down over the hot sunny field which wore its air of sabbatical and empty leisure may had been a wet month and the grass still retained the varnished freshness of spring except where in patches it had been worn by pitches or practicenets but for the last fortnight no rain had fallen and the light soil quick to dry was beginning to get hard and give bowlers such as david the crumbling wickets in which his soul delighted adamss house had scraped through the first ties of housematches for though david on whom they relied to thwart and discomfit their opponents had proved on that occasion to be extremely expensive and quite useless as a bowler he had in some weird fashion of his own managed to make fifty of the most awful runs ever scored chiefly by amazing misshits over the heads of point and slips he had also been badly missed off the first ball he received which added humour to the performance and a little later his legstump had been smartly hit though without displacing the bails he had hailed this with a shriek of laughter but in the second tie played last week he had shown himself in truer colours and had been bowled fair and square in both innings without scoring at all but had done things with the ball that really seemed inspired by satan he had grown into a bowler of the googliest type and had discovered all for himself that if he let his shirtsleeve wave in the air instead of rolling it tight up round his elbow it presented a much more puzzling outline to the batsman on that day there had been too a high crosswind and all that most of the batsmen who were favoured with his deliveries knew was that from very far off an immense lanky figure came prancing in a curved run up to the wickets and that from somewhere at the end of clothes hung up to dry a quavering object that was supposed to be a cricketball skidded through the air in such a manner that it was really impossible to tell what it was doing or what it would do sometimes when it looked most charged with incalculable waywardness it did nothing but bounce as an innocent and rotund ball should at other times chiefly when it looked almost pathetically guileless it played the lowest tricks that the laws of spin permitted it kicked out like a horse when it pitched or it leaped nervously aside as if trying to avoid the bat in fact the odds were that it did precisely what you didnt expect or again the demoniac blazes would run up to the wickets with less than his usual prance but in a slow and thoughtful manner as if he had a headache but if the wary batsman imagined as he not unfrequently did that this was the prelude to a slow and thoughtful ball he occasionally though not always found he was quite in error an extremely fast and straight ball was all that the thoughtful manner meant whereby we learn the danger of trusting to appearances and what made all these antics the more flustering and annoying was that david with guileless sincerity frankly confessed that he was often by no means clear himself what the ball was going to do i always mean it to do something rum he said but of course it doesnt always come off and sometimes it does just the opposite thats such awful fun its all silly tosh my bowling you know comes off in housematches sometimes but any school team would hit me over the moon this perfectly sincere view of his own performance was not shared by humphreys the captain of the school eleven who had twice been one of davids victims and to whom this opinion was expressed but the one you bowled me with in the first innings said that muchinjured young man came round my legs and took the middlestump blast you didnt you mean that david put his head on one side considering yes i think i did he said it was rather a good ball for me i thought it might do something of the sort every one gets a good ball in sometimes if they go on long enough well i wish you would keep them for schoolmatches said humphreys and second innings you had me with a roaring fullpitch ninetyfive miles an hour i thought it was only eightyfive and so i missed it by ten miles david laughed sorry it was rather a fast one he said i thought it had got you in the tummy jolly glad it was only your wicket som i remarked humphreys come and bathe since then every day had added to the pace of the ground and this sunday afternoon as david strolled down with bags he looked at the turf with extreme content just my luck all over he said that it should be getting into the state that suits me best for old boys match lord what a pity i said that i shant be able to send down a decent ball now but i should love to bowl frank bags i do think about cricket so tremendously in the summer half i lie awake making plans he took a short run and brought his arm over his shoulder in a complicated fashion why shouldnt i bring my arm up overhand like that he said and turn my wrist over underhand you might say that the ball would simply fly up gently in the air and fall at my feet but something might be done with it you can usually do something with anything if you give your mind to it like you with jev remarked bags oh thats only adamss rot he broke off and focused his blue eyes on a group of figures coming up the field towards them lord heres mother gray and violet coming he said i say is my tie straight whos the man with them dont know friend of theirs probably clever fellow hope theyll ask me to tea david had been carrying his straw hat in his hand but put it on in order to have the joy of taking it off to them same man who was in chapel this morning with them said bags in an undertone was he didnt see him lord doesnt she look ripping there is always some slight discomfort attached to a meeting which is seen while yet a long way off to be coming a difficulty in knowing the right moment to cease being absorbed in the landscape or in intelligent conversation with your friend and to become conscious of it in proper time to apply a suitable smile of recognition to the face david with his tingling heart managed it with wonderful illsuccess he put on a brilliant smile long before it could be seen at all and feeling as if his cheeks would crack took it completely off again then he tried to talk to bags in a natural manner and pointed to nothing at all away to the right then he proceeded to talk to bags again much too long and did not look up till the adorable one was but a couple of yards off on came the smile of recognition again and he took off his hat and dropped it and alas for the hope of being asked to tea when he picked up his hat again the vision had already gone by and it was only the most instantaneous return of his smile that he reaped from all those muddled manuvres so on they went bags with face red from suppressed giggles what are you laughing at you ass asked david in an indignant whisper i dont see anything funny no you wouldnt you were the funny man what did i do demanded david first you grinned an awful grin miles too soon said bags then you looked as grave as a judge with indigestion then miles too late you gave another awful grin and dropped your hat sorry you didnt get your tea but it was too funny for anything david was radically incapable of illhumour for more than a few seconds at a time and grinned in a less awful manner i never felt such a silly fool he said and im not sure i like that man what do you suppose they were talking about so interestedly cant say run back and ask them said bags i thought he looked rather a decent chap awfully goodlooking too a bit like maddox david gave a snort of disdain like your grandmother he observed in a withering manner which one ive got two david took hold of bags by the shoulders and ran him down the bit of steep hill to the gate the ugliest he said and the fattest and the beastliest i say though it was rather a sell for me complete suck said bags there are exactly as many ways of falling in love as there are different natures in the world and since every one boy or man or girl or woman falls in love off the same carpet so to speak on which he transacts the other affairs of life it followed that davids first excursion into the enchanted country was made with enthusiasm and gaiety and innocence and with that forgetfulness of himself that characterised his other ways and works that he was in love at all any grownup man who was so unfortunate as to forget what it was like to be a boy would probably have denied calling his feelings calflove at the most but no boy unless he was a shrivelled old man could doubt for a moment the genuineness of davids emotion it seriously threatened for the next few weeks to dethrone the dominant passion inspired by cricket and since that absolutely refused to vacate the supreme throne love squeezed itself in and sat beside it so that if david lay awake on sunday pondering over fresh wiles in the matter of his googlies on monday the googlies would not enter his head at all except as shadows and he would devote the whole of his insomnia which perhaps lasted half an hour to the contemplation of the adorable violet at such times he would give vent to a sound between a sigh and a groan and jevons from the next bed would ask if he had tummyache then david would say savagely no you little ass go to sleep and add in a minute or two thanks for asking jev at this high level his adoration remained for a whole month occasionally as during the two days of the old boys match he would be more absorbed in cricket while violet looked on from the throne of his heart even as she looked on from the balcony of the pavilion but on the day succeeding the glorious discomfiture of the old boys cricket as an active principle in his mind lapsed into a state of quiescence while violet became volcanic again he did not want anything from her though the thought of kissing her a wild flight of impossible fancy sent his heart into his mouth he only wanted that she should be she and he an adorer he could have given no further account of it than that all his other friends frank and his own sister and bags and plugs were on a different plane he loved margery he loved frank he esteemed and relied on bags but none gave him any tremor any sense of excitement but for violet his boyish heart was full of a sweet tumult and confusion whenever the enchantress came within eyeshot meantime the strange young man who had roused davids suspicions on sunday afternoon continued staying with the grays but his presence was accounted for since to davids great relief he proved to be a cousin he proved also which was satisfactory to be a man who played cricket occasionally for his county and thus had a claim to respect and took part in a match against the masters playing for them on that occasion he proceeded to hit davids bowling to all parts of the compass with the utmost ease and enjoyment a feat that raised him in the bowlers estimation eventually david got him out with a ball about which mr leonard gray knew absolutely nothing but he had been treated with wonderful contempt first and as gray retired he nodded in a friendly manner glad you didnt send that ball down sooner blaize he said then with the suddenness of a thunderbolt the end came bags brought the fateful news while david was ecstatically employed on a model flyingmachine which frank had given him did you ever see anything so ripping he shouted frank sent it me this morning it flew the whole length of hall just now wait till i wind it up again david picked up the beloved machine and began winding it whats up he said looking at bags anything beastly happened nothing wrong in the house is there oh david im so sorry said bags david let go of the winder and the propeller whirred and pulled as the wheels ran round well get on he said shes engaged to that cousin said bags banns were given out yesterday at the parish church plugs told me his people were down and he went with them to church instead of chapel david felt the world topple round him he sat down and turned very red in the face oh was all he said then bags came a step closer i say david he said shyly if you only knew how i hate anything that hurts you i should like to kill that chap and his plain rather goatlike face glowed with that which had so long inspired him namely his affection for david that shy silent passion of friendship david spun the propeller once or twice well hes a jolly lucky chap he said at length then he looked at bags and saw in his eyes just that blind devotion that you can see in a dogs eyes if you understand dogs he got up and put a hand on bagss shoulder its ripping of you to care bags he said im no end grateful hell later in the year it may be remembered the m c c legislated on this subject chapter xvi the school was assembled at evening chapel on the last sunday of this summer term tomorrow would be prizegiving with all its attendant festivities down to concert in the evening and another housesupperperhapsat adamss in celebration of their again having won the house cricketcup on tuesday the school would break up to meet again in large numbers on friday for the match at lords just now the hymn after the third collect had been sung but after that instead of the chaplain continuing to read the prayers the head did so next him in his pew was frank and before the prayer for all sorts and conditions of men there was a short pause and the silence became tense for every one present guessed what was coming then the quiet slow voice began again your prayers are requested for your friend david blaize it said who is lying dangerously ill then the three remaining prayers were said but before the final hymn was given out there came another pause and the head rose he spoke more intimately now you will all want to know what news i have to give you he said so before we finish the service i will tell you i saw david blaize just before chapel he was quite conscious and not frightened at all he knew quite well for his father had told him that he was in extreme danger i only saw him for a minute but i said we were going to pray for him this evening as we have done perhaps you would like to hear what he said to me the head paused a moment began once and then mastered his voice better he said thanks awfully sir thatll do me good a little rustle and stir went round chapel and all that any one had known of david came and stood quite close to him bags sitting at the end of the seat of the sixth form leaned forward putting his head on his hands frank who had come down an hour before just looked at the head waiting then the head spoke again i have told you this on purpose he said to show you how he faces death if it is that god wishes him to face also to show you that as he still hopes to live we must hope it with him in all the power that prayer gives us but he faces death with all thethe gay courage with which he faced that which has brought him into peril of it there are many of you who loved him and i am among them and we must be level with him in our courage now we will sing the hymn lead us heavenly father lead us the whole school of course knew what had happened two days before a young horse harnessed to a light cart and frightened by a tractionengine had bolted straight down the steep high street at marchester full at its lower end with the crowded traffic of marketday and the driver had been pitched off the box so that it galloped on unchecked and mad with fright at the moment david with a bag of macaroons which he had just bought came out of schoolshop throwing the parcel to bags who was with him he had shouted out catch hold and dont eat any and had rushed straight out into the road taking a header so to speak at the horse he had got hold of a rein and then still holding it had been jerked off his feet and the wheel of the cart had gone over him but the horse was checked and when they picked the boy up they found that the rein was still wrapped round his wrist there were severe internal injuries not necessarily fatal but until several days had elapsed every minute was critical with danger up till this morning all had gone well but a few hours ago there had been disquieting symptoms with fever and restlessness and signs of exhaustion he had been conscious all day and was no longer in great pain but it was feared that nervous shock consequent on internal injury might overcome the splendid powers of rallying which he had shown at first his father and margery had come down the day before but today they had scarcely seen him since the utmost quiet was necessary and an hour ago he had been told that he was in great danger it was to this that the head had referred adamss house was nearer to where the accident happened than the school sanatorium and he had been moved there since every extra yard was extra danger and for two days now a strange silence as of life in a dream had lain over it there had been no need for adams to tell them not to make any noise or disturbance for the boys crept about like mice and no voice was raised it seemed impossible that this should have happened to anybody most of all that it should have happened to david and yet in the room at the end of the passage just beyond the baize door into adamss private part of the house he was lying now midway between life and death horribly tired but not afraid maddox waited for the head to disrobe after service was over just outside the chapel the school and then the masters passed by him but he only nodded at one and another and still waited at last the head came out into the red twilight after sunset glad you waited for me maddox he said i didnt know you were down till just before chapel is there anything more to tell than what you told us all sir he asked the head took his arm no my dear fellow he said its not hopeless you know they dont say that would they allow me to see him sir he neednt know i did i could just look at him without his seeing me you must ask the doctor about that you got down this afternoon only yes sir i only heard this morning they walked on in silence a little way as far as the iron gate into the quadrangle then maddox spoke again hes the best chap in the world sir he said he saved me you know just saved me the head pressed his arm ah thats between you and david he said its not for me to hear but i know you love him which is the only point please god youll have him with you many years yet and if not frank you mustnt be bitter or think that its a cruel ordinance that takes him away god takes him and we must give even as david gave himself when he just jumped at that horse do you think he would have withheld himself if he had known what the result would have been not a bit of it he would have done it just the same we both know that his life was his and like the brick he is he chose to risk it they walked on in silence half across the quiet quadrangle will you come and sup with us asked the head presently i can give you a bed too if you like oh thanks awfully sir said frank but i think ill go down to the house mr adams will put me up somehow or i shall sit up i should like to be down there the head nodded i see he said i quite understand good night then maddox went out of schoolyard and down the road to his old house the afterglow of sunset was fading fast the road showed grey between black hedgerows and as he crossed the stream the reflection of a big star wavered on the quiet flowing water the whole place was intensely familiar to him part of his blood part of his intimate life and passing the fivescourt he remembered how on a wet day not yet three years ago he had given david and bags elementary instruction in squash and had walked down this same road afterwards waiting for david to come in with a parcel for him now that friend of his heart lay between life and death in the house of which the lights already shone between the elmtrees he tried to realise and again shrank from realising what the loss would mean to him he had a hundred friends alive and well but he could not measure david by any of them he was just david there was no fresh news when he got to the house he saw davids father and sister for a minute only but was not allowed to go in to see him after that he went into the boys part of the house and found that bags was waiting up also by permission in the double prefects study which he shared with david maddox knew it well it was the one he had managed to procure for himself alone the year that david came to the school and fagged for him bags was full of quiet politeness he gave maddox the sofa and since the rest of the house had gone to bed suggested that he might smoke if he wished adams wont mind he said its jolly of you to come and keep me company you know and then bags could not speak any more at once thanks i wont smoke said maddox you were with david at his private school too werent you yes two years said bags and been pals ever since same as me both of us davids friends i mean bags forgot to be shy of this great cambridge cricketblue you should have seen david he said jerking out the words he went bang for that horse like taking a header ii ought to have done it you know i got out of schoolshop just in front of him and stood staring oh my god why didnt you said maddox suddenly i know it was rotten of me he said but david was so damned quick about it you know he just chucked a bag of macaroons at me and simply jumped and then the wheel went over him and he was dragged along with the rein round his wrist bags gave one awful sniff and pointed to a white paper parcel that protruded from the cupboard where tea things were kept there they are he said he told me not to eat any last thing he said and and i want to see him again so frightfully just to see him you know what a ripper he didnt know how i liked him you did too same boat isnt it bags had no pretence of fortitude left and mopped his eyes damn that horse he said whod have cared if it had killed the whole high street so long as david didnt put his carcase in the light sillysilly idiot butbut a fellow just loves him the more for it i keep thinking over day after day of these last five years do you remember when he was swished maddox nodded yes jolly well deserved it too and he was so sick with me afterwards when i told him so but we made it up david said he was sorry silly fool as if he ever did anything to a pal he could be sorry for bags caught his breath dont know what there was about him he said but there he was just david you know and he liked you most awfully i used to get damned jealous sorry if you mind the two sat there together while the warm night with many stars wheeled overhead above the sleeping house talking occasionally but for the most part in silence adams who also was sitting up came in from time to time to see them and they would sit all three together from the sickroom came no determining news david was conscious and awake and they had given him all the morphia that they dared his temperature had not risen further but he was very much exhausted the question was how his strength would hold out unless he got to sleep this adams told them and perhaps they talked for a little of david recalling some incident of past days then adams would leave them again to go back to davids father and sister but not long after midnight he came in again having only just gone out david has suddenly asked if you were here frank he said he wants to see you and the doctor thinks you had better go to him he is getting very restless and perhaps you may be able to quiet him thats what they want you to do you can trust yourself frank got up yes sir i know i can he said the room where he lay was lit by a lamp that was shaded from the bed and near the head of it was standing the doctor who nodded to frank as he came in and beckoned him to the bed putting a chair for him by the side of it david old chap here i am he said david turned his tired eyes to him oh i say thats ripping he said faintly but i cant see you very well maynt there be a bit more light the doctor quietly tilted the shade round the lamp so that the light fell on franks face will that do said frank yes rather i wanted to see you awfully i wondered if you would come i thought perhaps you would when you knew frank am i going to die frank pulled the chair a little closer and bent over him no he said youre going to do nothing of the sort we cant get on without you possibly so youve got to get well see the doctor came close to frank and whispered to him tell him he must go to sleep he said and stepped back again out of sight and to get well continued frank youve got to go to sleep and bring your strength back david dont you remember our two beds at the end of dormitory well think yourself back in yours with me in the one next you and imagine its time to go to sleep its quite easy you know imagine its that jolly evening after our housematch last year when you were so tired you fell asleep without undressing yes i remember said david he was silent a little but his eyes were still wide i say would it bore you awfully to hold my hand he said youre so strong and fit and quiet i might get some i dont know am i talking rot no not a bit there frank fitted his hand into davids which lay like a sick child within it yes ripping said he a little drowsily sure its not an awful bore its a frightful bore said frank david smiled you didnt get a rise out of me he said shall have another try before long said frank comfortable rather david lay for some ten minutes still wideeyed but quiet then his eyelids fluttered closed and opened again awfully comfortable he said i wanted just you to tell me what to do i did so want you to come davids eyelids dropped again and the doctor came round to maddoxs side sit quite still he whispered and dont speak to him again sure it doesnt bore you asked david once more again there was silence and the two the friend and the doctor remained absolutely still for some five minutes then from the bed came a long sigh davids head rolled a little sideways on the pillow and after that came the quiet regular breathing then the doctor whispered once more to maddox you may have to sit like that with your arm out for hours he said well try to make you comfortable presently can you manage it why yes said he the doctor quietly left the room but came back soon after with pillows and as well as he could propped up maddoxs outstretched arm then he spoke to the nurse who was to sit up and came back to the bed and looked at david a moment listening to his regular breathing im going to get a bit of sleep now he whispered to frank but im afraid you wont you must stop just as you are if he lets go of your hand you must still sit there in case he wakes and asks for you if he says anything answer him as if he was in his dormitory and you in the bed next him youre in charge it was a couple of hours before david moved then he turned a little in bed frank he said oh shut up and go to sleep said frank tisnt morning right oh said david all sensation had gone from maddoxs arm it was quite numb up to the shoulder and it was only with his eyes that presently after he knew that david had let his hand slip from his own then very gently he withdrew it and it fell helplessly on to his knees david slept on through the hour before dawn when the flame of vitality burns dim and the dying loose their hold on life until through the curtains the pale light of morning looked in dimming the lamplight outside the twitter of birds began and the hushed sounds of life stole about within the house and the nurse moved quietly to and fro in the room setting things in order for the day she brought frank a cup of tea and some bread and butter and he ate and drank without moving from the bedside before long the doctor paid his promised visit but there was nothing for him to do now that sleep had come to david the immediate necessity was fulfilled and beyond that there was no need to look at present only hope the little white flame which had burned so dim and had come so near to being quenched the evening before shone more bravely all that morning maddox sat by davids bed as he slept it was he who had brought to him through the tie of their love and davids instinctive obedience to his suggestion the sleep that had been so imperative a need and the sunny morning grew broad and hot as he dozed sometimes but oftener watched filled with a huge and humble exultation of happiness that he had been able to help david and when david woke as he did a little after noon it was the best of all for even while his eyes were yet scarcely unclosed he spoke just one wordfranks name still sleepily oh go to sleep said frank just as he had said it twelve hours before no early school but this time david reasserted himself a little course not he said but ive slept ages andand i want something to eat the beaming nurse stepped to the bedside ill bring you some beeftea in a minute she said lie quite still david turned his head why its quite morning he said absolutely said frank and ive slept ever since you told me we were in dormitory together he said how long ago was that oh about twelve hours said frank and youve sat here all the time think so oh i say and just because you thought i might want you davids eyes were bright and untired again there was life shining behind them young life that may still be feeble as the snowdrops raising their frail heads above the ground on some sunny morning of february are feeble but they answer to the beckoning of spring not like late autumn blossoms feeling the chill of the winter that approaches frank leaned over him yes i thought you might want me he said but also i couldnt go away i wanted you david smiled at him i was pretty bad yesterday wasnt i he asked yes pretty bad i knew i must be because i didnt care what happened i do today im going to get better of course you are said frank and heres your food lord it smells good said david do be quick nurse so there was housesupper at adamss that
